<title>Abstract</title><p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic signals associated with autoimmune disease. The majority of these signals are located in non-coding regions and likely impact <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (cRE). Because cRE function is dynamic across cell types and states, profiling the epigenetic status of cRE across physiological processes is necessary to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which autoimmune variants contribute to disease risk. We localized risk variants from 15 autoimmune GWAS to cRE active during TCR-CD28 costimulation of naïve human CD4+ T cells. To characterize how dynamic changes in gene expression correlate with cRE activity, we measured transcript levels, chromatin accessibility, and promoter-cRE contacts across three phases of naive CD4+ T cell activation using RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiC. We identified ∼1,200 protein-coding genes physically connected to accessible disease-associated variants at 423 GWAS signals, at least one-third of which are dynamically regulated by activation. From these maps, we functionally validated a novel stretch of evolutionarily conserved intergenic enhancers whose activity is required for activation-induced <italic>IL2</italic> gene expression in human and mouse, and is influenced by autoimmune-associated genetic variation. The set of genes implicated by this approach are enriched for genes controlling CD4+ T cell function and genes involved in human inborn errors of immunity, and we pharmacologically validated eight implicated genes as novel regulators of T cell activation. These studies directly show how autoimmune variants and the genes they regulate influence processes involved in CD4+ T cell proliferation and activation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>GWAS has linked hundreds of regions of the human genome to autoimmune disease susceptibility. The majority of GWAS variants are located in non-coding regions of the genome, and likely contribute to disease risk by modulating cis-regulatory element (cRE) activity to influence gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Identifying causal variants and effector genes molecularly responsible for increased disease risk is critical for identifying targets for downstream molecular study and therapeutic intervention. An understanding of how non-coding variants function is often limited by incomplete knowledge of the mechanism of action, <italic>i.e.</italic>, whether a variant is located in a cRE, in which cell types a cRE is active, and which genes are regulated by which cRE.</p>
<p>CD4+ T cells are key regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses that combat infection by orchestrating the activity of other immune cells. In their quiescent, naïve state, ‘helper’ T cells traffic between the blood and secondary lymphoid tissues as part of an immunosurveillance program maintained by transcription factors such as KLF2, TOB, and FOXO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Upon encountering specific antigen, a cascade of signals activated through the TCR and costimulatory receptors results in large-scale changes in gene expression driven by factors like NFKB, NFAT, IRF4, and STATs, leading to proliferation and differentiation into specialized Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets capable of participating in protective immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. CD4+ T cells are also key players in the induction and pathogenesis of autoimmunity. The cis-regulatory architecture of CD4+ T cells is enriched for autoimmune disease GWAS variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, and T cells from autoimmune patients harbor distinct epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures linking dysregulated gene expression with disease pathogenesis. Autoimmune variants may contribute to the breakdown of immune self-tolerance by shifting the balance between autoreactive conventional vs. regulatory CD4+ T cells, by altering cytokine production, or by promoting auto-antigen production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Chromatin conformation assays allow for identification of putative target genes of autoimmune variant-containing cRE in close spatial proximity to gene promoters. Previous work using promoter-capture HiC and HiC in combination with other epigenetic marks have implicated sets of autoimmune variants and effector genes that may participate in T cell activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In addition to chromatin conformation approaches, multiple complementary approaches have been developed to link disease associated SNPs to their downstream effector genes. Expression quantitative trait mapping (eQTL) and chromatin co-accessibility data can be used to implicate effector genes through statistical association of genotypes with readouts of expression or other molecular markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, these approaches do not account for the relevant 3D structure of the genome in the nucleus, and are highly susceptible to <italic>trans</italic>-effects and other confounding factors.</p>
<p>In this study, we measured the impact of TCR-CD28 activation on the autoimmune-associated <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory architecture of CD4+ helper T cells, and by comparing our data to those of several orthogonal GWAS effector gene nomination studies, identify hundreds of effector genes not implicated previously. We find that 3D chromatin-based approaches exhibit 2- to 10-fold higher predictive sensitivity than eQTL and ABC statistical approaches when benchmarked against a ‘gold standard set’ of genes underlying inborn errors in immunity and tolerance. Our maps of autoimmune SNP-gene contacts also predicted a stretch of evolutionarily conserved, intergenic enhancers that we show are required for normal expression of the canonical T cell activation gene <italic>IL2</italic> in both human and mouse, whose activity is influenced by autoimmune risk variants. The set of variant-connected effector genes defined by 3D physical proximity to autoimmune-associated cRE is enriched for genes that regulate T cell activation, as validated pharmacologically in this study and by CRISPR-based screens in orthogonal studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Gene expression dynamics as a function of naïve CD4+ T cell activation</title>
<p>To explore the universe of genes and cREs that are affected by and may contribute to CD4+ activation, we characterized the dynamics of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and 3D chromatin conformation in human CD4+CD62L<sup>hi</sup>CD44<sup>lo</sup> naïve T cells purified directly <italic>ex vivo</italic> and in response to <italic>in vitro</italic> activation through the T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 for 8 or 24 hours using RNA-seq (N=3 donors), ATAC-seq (N=3 donors), and HiC (N=2 donors, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). As sequencing depth and restriction enzyme cutting frequency affects the resolution and reliability of HiC experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, we constructed libraries with two four-cutter restriction enzymes and sequenced to a total of approximately 4 billion unique-valid reads per timepoint. We verified the reproducibility of replicate ATAC-seq and RNA-seq libraries with principal component analysis and HiC libraries using distance-controlled, stratum-adjusted correlation coefficient (SCC). Replicate samples were highly correlated and clustered by activation stage (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 - Figure Supplement 1A-C</xref>). As expected, quiescent naïve CD4+ T cells expressed high levels of <italic>SELL, TCF7, CCR7,</italic> and <italic>IL7R</italic>, and rapidly upregulated <italic>CD69, CD44, HLADR,</italic> and <italic>IL2RA</italic> upon stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref><bold>, Supplementary File 1</bold>). Genome-scale gene set variance analysis based on MsigDB hallmark pathways showed that genes involved in KRAS and Hedgehog signaling are actively enriched in quiescent naive CD4+ T cells, while stimulated cell transcriptomes are enriched for genes involved in cell cycle, metabolism, and TNF-, IL-2/STAT5-, IFNg-, Notch-, and MTORC1-mediated signaling pathways (<bold>Supplementary File 2</bold>).</p>

<p>To define global gene expression dynamics during the course of CD4+ T cell activation, we performed pairwise comparisons and k-means clustering, identifying 4390 differentially expressed genes after 8 hours of stimulation (3289 upregulated and 1101 downregulated) and 3611 differentially expressed genes between 8 hours and 24 hours (3015 upregulated and 596 downregulated, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 - Figure Supplement 1D</xref>) that could be further separated into five clusters based on their distinct trajectories (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 - Figure Supplement 1E-G</xref>, <bold>Supplementary File 1</bold>). Genes upregulated early upon activation (cluster 1; n=1621 genes) are enriched for pathways involved in the unfolded protein response, cytokine signaling, and translation (<italic>e.g</italic>., <italic>IL2, IFNG, TNF, IL3, IL8, IL2RA, ICOS, CD40LG, FASLG, MYC, FOS, JUNB, REL, NFKB1, STAT5A,</italic> <bold>Supplementary File 3</bold>). Genes downregulated late (cluster 2; n=1600 genes) are moderately enriched for receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, cytokine signaling, and extracellular matrix organization. Genes monotonically increasing (cluster 3; n=2676 genes) are highly enriched for pathways involved in infectious disease and RNA stability, translation and metabolism, and moderately enriched for pathways involved in the unfolded protein response, cellular responses to stress, regulation of apoptosis, and DNA repair (<italic>e.g</italic>., <italic>TBX21, BHLHE40, IL12RB2, STAT1, CCND2, CDK4, PRMT1, ICAM1, EZH2,</italic> <bold>Supplementary File 3</bold>). Genes downregulated early (cluster 4; n=1628 genes) are enriched for pathways involved in inositol phosphate biosynthesis, neutrophil degranulation, and metabolism of nucleotides (<italic>e.g</italic>., <italic>KLF2, IL7R, RORA, IL10RA</italic>), and genes upregulated late (cluster 5; n=2154 genes) are highly enriched for pathways involved in cell cycle, DNA unwinding, DNA repair, chromosomal maintenance, beta-oxidation of octanoyl-CoA, and cellular response to stress (<italic>e.g</italic>., <italic>CDK2, E2F1, CDK1, CCNE1, CCNA2, PCNA, WEE1, CDC6, ORC1, MCM2</italic>). These patterns are consistent with known changes in the cellular processes that operate during T cell activation, confirming that <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation of CD4+ T cells recapitulates gene expression programs known to be engaged during a T cell immune response.</p>

<title>Dynamic changes in chromosomal architecture and genome accessibility during naïve CD4+ T cell activation</title>
<p>To understand the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory dynamics underlying the observed activation-induced changes in gene expression, we examined CD4+ T cell nuclear chromosome conformation and chromatin accessibility as a function of stimulation state using HiC and ATAC-seq. The human genome consists of ∼3 meters of DNA that is incorporated into chromatin and compacted into the ∼500 cubic micron nucleus of a cell in a hierarchically ordered manner. This degree of compaction results in only ∼1% of genomic DNA being accessible to the machinery that regulates gene transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, therefore a map of open chromatin regions (OCR) in a cell represents its potential gene regulatory landscape. Open chromatin mapping of human CD4+ T cells at all states identified a consensus <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory landscape of 181,093 reproducible OCR (<bold>Supplementary File 4</bold>). Of these, 14% (25,291) exhibited differential accessibility following 8 hours of stimulation (FDR&lt;0.05). Most differentially accessible regions (DAR) became more open (18,887), but some DAR (6,629) showed reduced accessibility (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <bold>Supplementary File 5</bold>). The change in accessibility over the next 16 hours of stimulation showed the opposite dynamic, with 6,629 regions exhibiting reduced accessibility, and only 4,417 DAR becoming more open (total of 11,046 DAR, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <bold>Supplementary File 5</bold>). These OCR represent the set of putative cRE with dynamic activity during T cell activation.</p>

<p>The vast majority of putative cRE are located in intergenic or intronic regions of the genome far from gene promoters, meaning that the specific impact of a given cRE on gene expression cannot be properly interpreted from a one-dimensional map of genomic or epigenomic features. To predict which cRE may regulate which genes in CD4+ T cells across different states of activation, we created three-dimensional maps of cRE-gene proximity in the context of genome structure. The highest order of 3D nuclear genome structure is represented by A/B compartments, which are large chromosomal domains that self-associate into transcriptionally active (A) <italic>vs</italic>. inactive (B) regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In agreement with prior studies, we find that OCR located in active A compartments exhibit higher average accessibility than those OCR located in less active B compartments (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – Figure Supplement 1A</xref><bold>, Supplementary File 6</bold>), a trend observed across all cell states. Likewise, genes located in A compartments show higher average expression than those located in B compartments (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – Figure Supplement 1B</xref>). A quantitative comparison across cell states showed that 94% of the CD4+ T cell genome remained stably compartmentalized into A (42%) and B (52%), indicating that activation does not cause a major shift in the large-scale organization of the genome within the nucleus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Within each A or B compartment, the genome is further organized into topologically associating domains (TADs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. These structures are defined by the fact that genomic regions within them have the potential to interact with each other in 3D, but have low potential to interact with regions outside the TAD. The location of TAD boundaries can influence gene expression by limiting the access of cRE to specific, topologically associated genes. While ∼80% of TAD boundaries remained stable across all states, 20% of TAD boundaries (8925) changed as a function of T cell activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – Figure Supplement 1C-D</xref>, <bold>Supplemental File 7</bold>). TAD boundary dynamics were categorized and 2198 boundaries exhibited a change in strength, 2030 boundaries shifted position, and 4697 boundaries exhibited more complex changes such as loss of a boundary resulting in merger of two neighboring TAD, addition of a boundary splitting one TAD into two, or a combination of any of these changes. Genes nearby dynamic TAD boundaries are enriched for pathways involved in RNA metabolism, cellular response to stress, and the activity of PTEN, p53, JAK/STAT, Runx and Hedgehog (<bold>Supplementary File 6</bold>). We also detected chromatin stripes, which are TAD-like structures that consist of a genomic anchor region that is brought into contact with a larger loop domain via an active extrusion mechanism. Chromatin stripes are contained within and/or overlap TAD regions, and are enriched for active enhancers and super-enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. We identified 1526 chromatin stripes in quiescent naïve CD4+ T cells, 1676 stripes in 8 hour stimulated cells, and 2028 stripes at 24 hours post-stimulation (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - Figure Supplement 2A</xref><bold>, Supplementary File 8</bold>). Consistent with prior studies in other cell types, chromatin stripes were preferentially located in A compartments, and genes and OCR within stripe regions showed increased expression and chromatin accessibility (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - Figure Supplement 2B-D</xref>).</p>
<p>Within active topological structures, transcriptional enhancers can regulate the expression of distant genes by looping to physically interact with gene promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. To identify potential regulatory cRE-gene interactions, we identified high confidence loop contacts across all cell states using Fit-HiC (merged 1kb, 2kb, and 4kb resolutions, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). This approach detected 933,755 loop contacts in quiescent naïve CD4+ T cells, 900,267 loop contacts in 8-hour stimulated cells, and 551,802 contacts in 24-hour stimulated cells (2,099,627 total unique loops). Approximately 23% of these loops involved a gene promoter at one end and an OCR at the other, and these promoter-interacting OCR were enriched for enhancer signatures based on flanking histone marks from CD4+ T cells in the epigenome roadmap database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - Figure Supplement 1E</xref>). T cell activation resulted in significant reorganization of the open chromatin-promoter interactome, as 907 promoter-OCR exhibited increased contact and 1333 showed decreased contact following 8 hours of stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Continued stimulation over the next 16 hours was associated with an increase in the contact frequency of 41 promoter-OCR pairs, while only 4 pairs exhibited decreased contact (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Activation-induced changes in chromatin architecture and gene expression were highly correlated, as genomic regions exhibiting increased promoter connectivity became more accessible at early stages of stimulation, which was associated with increased gene transcription from connected promoters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref><bold>, Supplementary File 9</bold>). The accessibility of promoter-connected OCR and the expression of their associated genes decreased globally from 8 to 24 hours of stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). We compared these loop calls to a prior chromatin capture analysis in CD4+ T cells by Burren et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and found that roughly 40% of stable loops in both stimulated and unstimulated cells were identical in both studies, despite differing in approach (HiC vs. PCHiC), analysis (HiC vs. CHiCAGO), sample (naïve CD4+ vs. total CD4+), timepoint (8 vs. 4 hour), and donor individuals (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - Figure Supplement 1F</xref>). As expected, unstimulated samples were more similar than activated samples.</p>
<p>We next focused on the 5 sets of genes with the dynamic expression patterns defined in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, and identified 57,609 OCR that contact dynamic gene promoters in at least one stage. Most dynamic genes contacted between 1 and ∼35 OCR, with a median of 10 OCR per gene, but a handful of dynamic genes were observed in contact with over 100 distinct open chromatin regions (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - Figure Supplement 1G</xref>). Similarly, most OCR were connected to a single dynamic gene, but many contacted more than one gene (median 2 genes per OCR), suggesting that most dynamic genes have a complex regulatory architecture. Increased gene expression upon activation correlated with an increase in the accessibility and promoter contact frequency of distant cRE (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - Figure Supplement 1H</xref>), as exemplified by <italic>GEM</italic> and <italic>IRF4</italic> (<xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - Figure Supplement 3A,B</xref>). Conversely, the 3D regulatory architecture of genes like KLF2 and DPEP2, which were downregulated following stimulation, exhibited decreased contact and accessibility (<xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - Figure Supplement 3C,D</xref>).</p>

<title>Transcription factor footprints enriched in dynamic open chromatin identify regulators of T cell activation</title>
<p>To explore what factors drive dynamic changes in the regulatory architecture of the CD4+ T cell genome during activation, we conducted a quantitative footprinting analysis at 1,173,159 transcription factor (TF) motifs located in the consensus CD4+ T cell open chromatin landscape using the average accessibility of the region surrounding each motif as a measure of regulatory activity (<bold>Supplementary File 10</bold>). Activation of naïve CD4+ T cells resulted in increased chromatin accessibility around bZIP motifs at tens of thousands of genomic regions by 8 hours post-stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>), which was associated with increased expression of Fos and Jun family members constituting the AP-1 complex, as well as the bZIP factors BATF, BACH1, and BACH2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The activity of NFE2 and SMAD was increased without increased expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>), likely due to post-translational regulation of these factors by phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Conversely, the motifs for a number of TF exhibited significantly reduced accessibility early after stimulation, including those for EGR2 and FOXP3 that are known to negatively regulate T cell activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). By 24 hours post-activation, bZIP activity remained largely unchanged compared to 8 hours (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), but a number of factors showed decreased activity. These include several members of the Sp family, the Myc cofactor MAZ that also cooperates with CTCF to regulate chromatin looping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, KLF2, which controls genes involved in naïve CD4+ T cell quiescence and homing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, NRF1, a factor implicated in age-associated T cell hypofunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, and EGR2 and 3, which are known to oppose T cell activation and promote tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>).</p>

<p>To explore how transcription factor activity may operate <italic>via</italic> the CD4+ T cell open chromatin landscape to regulate distinct programs of dynamic gene expression during TCR/CD28-induced activation, we focused on TF motifs enriched among those OCR specifically contacting promoters of dynamic genes identified by our clustering analysis (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Figure Supplement 1A</xref>). The set of OCR contacting dynamic gene promoters were enriched for the motifs of 89 expressed (TPM&gt;5) transcription factors, as compared to motifs present in the total open chromatin landscape (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). The majority of this TF activity was enriched in OCR connected to genes highly upregulated at 24 hours post-activation (clusters 3 and 5, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), with the exception of CREB3, ELF1, ESRRA, GABPA, RELA, XPB1, ZNF384, and the transcriptional repressor IKZF1 known as a strong negative regulator of T cell activation and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Conversely, motifs for IKZF1, ZNF384, GABPA, ESRRA, and ELF1 were highly enriched in the set of OCR contacting genes down-regulated early after activation (cluster 4, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Motifs for KLF2 and the metabolic gene regulator SREBF1 were likewise enriched in OCR connected to down-regulated genes. Open chromatin regions interacting with genes in cluster 2 are negatively enriched for this set of TF except for CTCF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we integrated TF footprint, promoter connectome, and gene co-expression data to construct TF-gene regulatory networks likely operating at each timepoint. The connections between regulatory nodes are based on physical promoter-TF footprint interactions with confidence weighted by gene co-expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, <bold>Supplementary File 11</bold>). Highly co-expressed genes at the core of the unstimulated CD4+ T cell regulatory network encode transcription factors such as KLF2, ETS1, IKZF1, and TCF7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> that are known to be involved in T cell gene silencing, quiescence, homeostasis, and homing. Genes connected to the top factors in this network were enriched for pathways involved in immune signaling, DNA replication and repair, protein secretion, and programmed cell death (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Figure Supplement 1B</xref>). Costimulation through the TCR and CD28 induced a set of core network genes active at both time points with known roles in T cell activation and differentiation (<italic>NFKB1, JUNB, MYC, IRF4, STAT5, STAT1, LEF1, ATF4</italic>). Also part of this set is <italic>PLAGL2</italic>, an oncogene in the Wnt pathway that regulates hypoxia-induced genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> with no prior defined role in T cell activation. Additional nodes specifically implicated at 8 hours post-activation are HIF1A, the major sensor of cellular hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, and XBP1, a major transcriptional mediator of the unfolded ER protein response with defined roles in T cell activation, differentiation, and exhaustion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Factors specifically implicated at 24 hours post-activation include E2F1, a transcriptional regulator of both cell cycle and apoptosis in T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, BHLHE40, a factor known to control multiple aspects of T cell metabolism and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, and the Myc cofactor MAZ that has not been previously studied in the context of T cell function. Genes connected to factors in the activated T cell networks were enriched for pathways involved in cytokine signaling, the interferon response, transcription, cell cycle, DNA replication and repair, and programmed cell death (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Figure Supplement 1B</xref>). Together, these data indicate that concurrent but separable stimulation-induced gene programs are the result of the activity of distinct sets of DNA binding factors mobilized by antigen and costimulatory receptor signaling in naïve CD4+ T cells.</p>

<title>Identification of autoimmune variants associated with CD4+ T cell cRE and predicted effector genes</title>
<p>Following our established variant-to-gene (V2G) mapping approach to implicate functional SNPs and their effector genes using the combination of GWAS and chromatin conformation capture data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, we intersected promoter-interacting OCR with autoimmune SNPs from the 95% credible set derived from 15 autoimmune diseases (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Files 12</bold> and <bold>13</bold>). Constraining the GWAS SNPs in this way reduced the credible set size from an average of 14 variants per sentinel to 3 variants per sentinel. To determine whether open chromatin in physical contact with dynamically regulated genes in CD4+ T cells is enriched for autoimmune disease heritability, we performed a partitioned LD score regression analysis. This landscape was enriched for variants associated with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC), type I diabetes (T1D), lupus (SLE), celiac disease (CEL), allergy (ALG), eczema (ECZ), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but not for variants associated with psoriasis (PSO) or juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <bold>Supplementary File 14</bold>). The OCR connected to genes upregulated early and/or progressively upon activation (clusters 1 and 3) were most strongly enriched for ALG, CEL, IBD/UC, RA and T1D heritability, while SLE and ECZ heritability was most enriched in OCR connected to genes upregulated later post-activation (clusters 3 and 5, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).

<title>Comparative predictive power against orthogonal variant-to-gene mapping approaches</title>

As part of the comparison, we harmonized the chromatin-based datasets using our chromatin loop calling approach and integrated with the same 95% credible set of autoimmune variants to create comparable physical contact maps. A total of 6936 unique genes were implicated by all studies. Our HiC-ATAC-seq approach in naïve and activated human CD4+ implicated 1947 effector genes, 400 of which through proxies in open promoters and 1836 through contacts with distal variants, of which 752 were dynamically regulated throughout activation. The HiC dataset from Gate et al. implicated 110 genes, and the capture-HiC datasets from Burren et al., Yang et al., and Javierre et al. implicated 1408, 2572, and 2368 genes, respectively (<bold>Supplementary File 16</bold>). A total of 369 autoimmune GWAS effector genes were predicted in common by our HiC approach and the pcHiC-based approaches. The eQTL studies by Soskic et al., Gate et al., Ye et al., and Schmiedel et al. (DICE) implicated 171, 15, 15, and 221 genes, and the co-accessibility data from Gate et al. implicated 45 genes. Concordance between our gene predictions and the pcHiC predictions ranged from 15-24% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), while concordance between our predictions and the eQTL predictions was low (0.6%∼5%, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), and concordance among eQTL studies was also low (1.6%-13%, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). However, when we co-localized the Soskic variant-gene pairs with autoimmune GWAS SNPs, 41 of these eQTL were also predicted by our study, representing a concordance 10-fold higher than obtained by a random sampling of genes within 500 kb of autoimmune variants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). A total of 1519 of the genes implicated in our study were not predicted by eQTL approaches, while 644 genes from our CD4 T cell V2G data were not implicated by the other chromatin-based datasets, and altogether 562 putative autoimmune effector genes were uniquely predicted by our study.

<p>To measure the predictive power of the sets of genes implicated by each approach above, a precision-recall analysis was performed against the ‘gold standard’ human inborn errors in immunity gene set, based on the hypothesis that genes under the control of autoimmune-associated variants would cause monogenic immune disease phenotypes if subjected to deleterious coding mutations. The set of genes from our study with disease-associated SNPs located in their open promoters overlapped with only 5% of the genes from the gold standard set (<bold>Supplementary File 16</bold>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). However, leveraging our HiC data to include distal autoimmune variants captured interacting with open gene promoters increased the sensitivity of the approach 3-fold to 16% (71 overlapping genes, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), confirming the relevance of long-range promoter-cRE/SNP contacts. This level of sensitivity is comparable to that of other chromosome capture-based datasets for predicting HIEI genes in CD4+ T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Conversely, the eQTL-based approaches were 3- to ∼12-fold less sensitive than the chromatin-constrained approaches in predicting HIEI genes, with most recalling 0-2.5% and the DICE eQTL dataset recalling 6% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Restricting our 3D chromatin V2G to only those genes dynamically regulated during T cell activation reduced predictive power from 16% to 10%, but the fraction of these genes in the HIEI gold standard set (precision) increased from ∼4% to 6.2% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating that focusing the V2G set on those SNP-gene pairs that are dynamically regulated by T cell activation reduces potential false positive predictions. The precision of our dataset was superior to that of the other chromosome capture-based datasets except for the Burren pcHiC dataset (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). The eQTL approaches were comparable to the 3D chromatin-based datasets in precision (∼3-6%, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>We also analyzed the relative predictive power of a recently proposed ‘activity-by-contact’ (ABC) model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> that uses a multi-tissue averaged HiC dataset instead of cell type-matched 3D chromatin-based data to link variants to genes. This model constrains the input data by removing bidirectional, antisense, and small RNAs, and eliminate genes ubiquitously expressed across tissues based on the assumption that these genes are driven primarily by elements adjacent to their promoters. Also, while most human genes have multiple alternative transcriptional start sites (median = 3), ABC only annotates only one promoter per gene. To apply the activity-by-contact gene nomination model to our CD4+ T cell chromatin-based V2G data, we used our ATAC-seq data and publicly available CD4+ T cell H3K27ac ChIP-seq data as input, and integrated this with GWAS and the averaged HiC dataset from the original ABC study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. The ABC model nominated 650 genes compared to 1836 genes using our cell type-matched HiC data and analysis pipeline. Only 357 genes were nominated by both approaches, while 1479 genes nominated by our approach were not implicated by the ABC model, and 293 genes not implicated by our approach were newly implicated by ABC. To measure the predictive power of the ABC approach, we re-ran the precision-recall re-analysis with all datasets subjected to the ABC gene-promoter filter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). We found that applying the restricted ABC model promoter annotation to all datasets did not have a large effect on recall, however, the precision of several of the datasets were affected. For example, using the restricted promoter/gene set reduced the precision of our V2G approach and artificially inflated the precision of the ‘nearest gene to SNP’ metric. The precision-recall analysis also shows that the ABC score-based approach is only half as powerful at predicting HIEI genes as the chromatin-based V2G approaches (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). This indicates that informing GWAS data with cell type- and state-specific 3D chromatin-based data brings more target gene predictive power than application of the multi-tissue-averaged HiC used by the ABC model. Together, these analyses indicate that chromosome capture-based V2G is a more sensitive approach for identifying ‘true’ effector genes than eQTL or ABC approaches, but comes with additional predicted genes that represent either false positives or true effector genes for which monogenic LOF/GOF mutations have not yet been characterized in humans.</p>

<title>Functional validation of novel autoimmune V2G-predicted enhancers at the <italic>IL2</italic> locus</title>
<p>Our 3D chromatin-based analysis specifically predicts dynamic, disease-associated regulatory elements in intergenic space at the <italic>IL2</italic> locus. The <italic>IL2</italic> gene encodes a cytokine with crucial, pleotropic roles in the immune system, and dysregulation of IL-2 and IL-2 receptor signaling leads to immunodeficiency and autoimmune disorders in mice and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Activation-induced transcription of <italic>IL2</italic> involves an upstream regulatory region (URR) ∼375 bp from the TSS that has served as a paradigm of tissue-specific, inducible gene transcription for nearly four decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. However, the presence of evolutionarily conserved non-coding sequences (CNS) in the ∼150 kb of intergenic space 46, 51, 80, 83, 85, 96, 122, and 128 kb upstream of the TSS suggest that additional regulatory elements may have evolved to control <italic>IL2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). The −51 kb CNS contains a SNP linked to T1D, IBD, PSO, CEL and allergy (rs72669153), while the −85 kb CNS contains a SNP linked to RA (rs6232750) and the −128 kb CNS contains two SNPs linked to T1D, JIA, and SLE (rs1512973 and rs12504008, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). In TCR/CD28-stimulated naïve CD4+ T cells, these CNS are remodeled to become highly accessible (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), and they loop to interact physically with the <italic>IL2</italic> URR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) at both time points. ChIP-seq analyses in human T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> show that the URR and all distal CNS except −85 are occupied by TF such as Jun/Fos (AP-1), NFAT, and NFkB that are known regulators of <italic>IL2</italic> (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – Figure Supplement 1</xref>), and the −85, −122, and −128 CNS are occupied by additional TF not previously thought to be direct regulators of <italic>IL2</italic>, such as MYC, BCL6, and STAT5 (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – Figure Supplement 1</xref>). Recombinant reporter assays in primary activated human CD4+ T cells showed that the −46, −51, −83, and −128 CNS/OCR can enhance transcription from the URR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). To determine whether the native elements contribute to the expression of <italic>IL2</italic>, we targeted each CNS/OCR individually in primary human CD4+ T cells or Jurkat T cells using CRISPR/CAS9 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>) and measured IL-2 secretion following TCR/CD28 stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Deletion of the −46, −51, −83, −85, −122, and −128 kb elements in primary human CD4+ T cells each resulted in a ∼50% reduction in IL-2 production, while deletion of the −80 kb element had little effect. A very similar pattern of impact was observed when these elements were deleted individually in Jurkat T cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). The URR has a stronger contribution to IL-2 production than any individual intergenic element, as deletion of the URR almost completely abrogated activation-induced IL-2 production by both primary CD4+ or Jurkat T cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). To determine whether these intergenic enhancers exist in synergistic epistasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> necessary for <italic>IL2</italic> transactivation, we generated Jurkat T cell clones in which the stretch of all 7 elements located 46 kb to 128 kb upstream of <italic>IL2</italic> was deleted using CRISPR/CAS9 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Despite the URR and 46 kb of upstream sequence being intact in these clones, loss of the 81.3 kb stretch of intergenic enhancers renders these cells incapable of expressing <italic>IL2</italic> at both the mRNA and protein level in response to stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). These results show that the URR is not sufficient for activation-induced expression of <italic>IL2</italic>, and that <italic>IL2</italic> has a previously unappreciated, complex, and autoimmune disease-associated regulatory architecture that was accurately predicted by our 3D epigenomic V2G approach. Importantly, we find that the distal <italic>IL2</italic> cRE are highly accessible in quiescent memory T cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17, Th1-17, Th22) isolated directly <italic>ex vivo</italic> from human blood, whereas naïve CD4+ T cells and non-IL-2-producing Treg showed little accessibility at these elements (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – Figure Supplement 1D</xref>). This suggests that stable remodeling of distal <italic>IL2</italic> cRE can persist <italic>in vivo</italic> after TCR signals cease, and that this epigenetic imprinting contributes to the immediate, activation-induced production of IL-2 exhibited by memory, but not naïve or regulatory, CD4+ T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Autoimmune variants are likely to influence disease risk by altering the activity of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements in T cells. At genome scale, we identified over 1000 cRE likely impacted by autoimmune disease-associated genetic variation, in that they contain autoimmune risk SNPs that are predicted to decrease or increase transcription factor binding affinity. Overall, 1370 autoimmune risk variants in open chromatin were predicted to influence the activity of 495 DNA binding factors (<bold>Supplementary File 17</bold>), including PLAG1, PRDM1, BACH2, MYC, TBX21, BHLHE40, LEF1, TCF7, BCL6, IRF, p53, STAT (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8 – Figure Supplement 1A</xref>), and hundreds of NFkB, EGR, KLF, FKH/FOX, and FOS-JUN sites (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>).

Genes implicated by V2G in activated CD4+ T cells were moderately enriched for genes known to control the production of IFN-G, but at the individual disease level, only genes connected to CRO- and ATD-associated variants were enriched for IFNG regulatory genes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref rid="fig8s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 8 – Figure Supplement 2A</xref>). Genes contacting CRO, PSO, RA, SLE, T1D and VIT variants were moderately enriched for TNF regulatory genes, but the set of all V2G genes was not enriched for TNF genes. We also queried the orthologs of our V2G-implicated genes from the international mouse phenotype consortium (IMPC) database and identified 97 genes that when knocked out give an immune phenotype and 126 V2G genes that result in a hematopoietic phenotype (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>, <xref rid="fig8s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 8 – Figure Supplement 2B</xref>, <bold>Supplementary File 18</bold>).

<p>An important application of this V2G approach is the identification of novel regulators of T cell activation and their potential as drug targets, as nearly 20% of implicated genes have at least one chemical modulator currently available (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>, <bold>Supplementary File 19</bold>). As shown above, this approach validates genes that are well-studied regulators of T cell function, however, a significant portion of implicated genes are not well-studied and are not currently known to regulate T cell activation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>). We observed a trend that genes expressed more highly in immune tissues (GTEX) have in general been better investigated, and identified several less-studied genes that could be novel targets, including the kinases GRK6, PTK6, SIK1, and MAP3K11, the G protein-coupled receptors OXER1, GPR183, GPR18, and KISS1R, the acetylcholine receptor CHRNB1, and the <italic>de novo</italic> purine pathway enzyme GART. To determine whether these V2G-implicated genes are novel regulators of T cell activation, we used commercially available pharmacologic modulators in dose-response assays of activation-induced T cell proliferation. Stimulation of T cells in the presence of ligands for CHRNB1, KISS1R and OXER1 did not significantly affect T cell proliferation, however, small molecules targeting GRK6, PTK6, MAP3K11, GPR183, GART, and SIK1 inhibited T cell activation in the nanomolar to micromolar range (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8G</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By measuring dynamic changes in chromosome folding, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression in naïve CD4+ T cells as a function of TCR-CD28 costimulation, we identified the putative <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory landscape of autoimmune disease-associated genetic variation and physically connected these elements to their putative effector genes. This and prior chromosome capture-based studies show that most cRE and their variants interact with, and therefore have the potential to regulate, more than one gene (median 5 in this study), supporting a scenario in which multiple effector genes are operative at a GWAS locus. We validated a stretch of novel distal elements predicted by our V2G approach as <italic>bona fide</italic> enhancers for the canonical immune gene <italic>IL2</italic>, and showed that autoimmune-associated genetic variation at one of these elements influences it’s activity. We also conducted pharmacologic targeting experiments and compared our results with CRISPR-based studies to validate sets of <italic>bona fide</italic> effector genes with a confluence of multiple orthogonal lines of evidence supporting their role in CD4+ T cell activation.</p>
<p>We also observe that the vast majority (87-95%) of GWAS effector genes predicted by chromosome capture-based approaches are not the genes nearest to the sentinel SNPs queried in this study, while roughly one-third of eGenes predicted by eQTL approaches are the nearest to a sentinel. This and the low concordance between 3D chromatin vs. eQTL eGene predictions is consistent with the view that eQTL-based and GWAS-based approaches inherently implicate different types of genes. While eQTLs cluster strongly near transcription start sites of genes with simple regulatory structures and low enrichment for functional annotations, GWAS variants are generally far from the TSS of genes with complex regulatory landscapes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. Moreover, eGene discovery by eQTL studies using scRNA-seq approaches are significantly limited by the low gene detection power inherent to these methods, particularly in rare cell types.</p>
<p>Our systematic comparison of 3D chromatin-based target gene nomination studies in human CD4+ T cells revealed significant variability between datasets, with the highest concordance exhibited by the Javierre and Burren datasets (37%) and the next highest exhibited by our V2G and the Javierre dataset (24%). Although we harmonized the comparisons as much as possible by subjecting each dataset to the same HiC loop calling and GWAS integration steps, there are several potential sources for the observed discrepancy between the studies. The modes of stimulation are largely comparable, but timepoints and donors varied, and ours was the only study that sorted naïve CD4+ T cells prior to stimulation. The higher concordance among promoter-capture datasets compared to our HiC dataset is likely due to their lower resolution compared to our HiC and their greater sequencing depth focused at promoters compared to HiC. The lower resolution of HindIII-based capture-HiC results in loops called to the wrong promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, and will miss distal SNP interactions at any promoters excluded from the capture set. While HiC is unbiased in this regard, high resolution HiC will fail to call some SNP-promoter loops because the sequencing depth is spread across the whole genome instead of focused at promoters. However, despite variation between studies, the results show the clear value of tissue-matched chromatin conformation maps compared to tissue-averaged HiC for understanding the complex genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that regulate gene expression and for predicting autoimmune effector genes.</p>
<p>Why do the V2G approaches not capture a larger proportion of genes from the human inborn errors in immunity ‘truth set’? Low recall/sensitivity could result from the fact that a substantial portion of the mutations in the full HIEI gene set result in immunodeficiency but not autoimmune phenotypes. However, restricting the HIEI truth set to only those disease gene mutations that result in an autoimmune phenotype (143 genes) only increased recall from 16% to 17.5%, suggesting that this is not a major factor reducing sensitivity. Also, our method uses GWAS signals as an input, and unlike GWAS for height, BMI, blood traits, etc., most autoimmune GWAS signals are likely not saturated, which limits discoverability. Another reason for reduced sensitivity is the likelihood that many of the genes in the HIEI truth set operate in cells other than CD4+ T cells, and consistent with this, when the Javierre pcHiC V2G is extended to all immune cell types tested, recall increases from 17% to 27%. This observation emphasizes how limited inclusion cell types and states in a study can significantly limit the power to detect autoimmune effector genes. Why are so few of our 3D chromatin-based V2G genes present in the HIEI truth set? Low precision could be due to false positives in the V2G gene set; <italic>i.e</italic>., contacts between disease-associated cRE and genes that are not in fact involved in disease susceptibility. This does not argue <italic>per se</italic> against the biological relevance of the cRE or the gene, only that the linkage to disease susceptibility is not relevant. Alternatively, the absence of chromatin-GWAS-implicated genes in the truth set could be a false negative from the point of view of the truth set; <italic>i.e</italic>., monogenic, disease-causing mutations in these genes may exist in the human population, but have not yet been discovered. For example, in the year 2000 approximately 100 monogenic mutations causing human inborn errors of immunity were known, but this increased by ∼11 disease mutations per year until 300 human inborn errors of immunity had been identified by 2017. The advent of next-generation exome/genome sequencing and the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increase in the rate of HIEI discovery between 2018-2021 to ∼40 per year to the current recognized HIEI of ∼450. If we assume a conservative continued rate of HIEI discovery of 25 disease genes per year, the next 10 years will show us an additional ∼250 disease genes that are not currently contained in the truth set.</p>
<p>Many of the genes identified in this 3D epigenomic V2G screen have known roles in T cell activation and function. An example is <italic>IL2</italic>, and we used the resulting maps to identify and validate a stretch of previously unknown distal enhancers whose activity is required for <italic>IL2</italic> expression and is influenced by autoimmune genetic variation. Another example is the phosphatase DUSP5 that regulates MAPK signaling during T cell activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. However, roles for many of the genes implicated here in T cell activation are not known. For example, one of the top implicated genes, PARK7, is a deglycase studied in the context of Parkinson’s disease, but has a recently been shown to modulate regulatory T cell function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>. The orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR108 is another top gene uniquely implicated by our chromatin-based V2G that has not been studied in T cells, but was identified in a recent CRISPR screen for genes affecting IL-2 levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Also co-implicated by our study and recent CRISPR screens are the cannabidiol receptor GPR18<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup> and the purine biosynthetic enzyme GART<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. The GPR18 agonist arachidonyl glycine inhibited CD4+ T cell activation above 10 uM, while the GPR18 antagonist O-1918 slightly enhanced T cell activation. This GPR was implicated by both chromatin- and eQTL-based approaches. Antagonism of GART, an enzyme we previous identified as a V2G effector gene in COVID19 severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, with the FDA-approved drug lometrexol inhibited T cell activation in the 10 nM range. Antagonism of GRK6, a member of the G-coupled receptor kinase family associated with insulin secretion and T2D susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>, and PTK6, an oncogenic kinase studied in the context of cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>, led to inhibition of T cell activation in the nM to uM range. These targets were implicated by the other chromatin-based approaches but not by eQTL. Inhibition of MAP3K11, a kinase that facilitates signaling through JNK1 and IkappaB kinase in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup> inhibited stimulation-induced CD4+ T cell proliferation in the 100 nM range, as did 25-hydroxycholesterol, a ligand of the G protein-coupled receptor GPR183 that was implicated by both chromatin- and eQTL-based approaches. SIK1 is a member of the salt-inducible kinase family uniquely implicated in our study that negatively regulates TORC activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, and a small molecule SIK1 inhibitor potently antagonized stimulation-induced CD4+ T cell activation in the pM range.</p>
<p>Our integration of high-resolution Hi-C, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and GWAS data in a single immune cell type across multiple activation states identified hundreds of autoimmune variant-gene pairs at ∼half of all GWAS loci studied, and application of this technique to additional immune cell types will likely identify effector genes at many of the remaining loci. This study highlights the value of chromosome conformation data as a powerful biological constraint for focusing variant-to-gene mapping efforts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>, and shows that dynamic changes in the spatial conformation of the genome that accompany cell state transitions alter gene expression by exposing promoters to a varying array of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, transcription factors, and genetic variants.</p>

Isolated untouched, highly purified (93-98%) naïve human CD4 T cells were activated using anti-CD3+anti-CD28 Dynabeads (1:1, Thermofisher scientific, cat # 11161D) for 8-24 hours. Cells were then used to prepare sequencing libraries. The human leukemic T cell line Jurkat was obtained from ATCC, cloned by limiting dilution, and clones with high activation-induced secretion of IL-2 were selected for further study. Single-cell mouse lymphocyte suspensions were prepared from spleen and lymph nodes isolated from 6-week-old female wild-type or <italic>Il2</italic>-83cRE-ko mice (C57BL6 background). Mouse CD4+ T cells were purified by negative selection using a CD4+ T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, cat. # 130-104-454). For CD8 depletion, CD8+ T cells were positively stained using CD8a (Ly-2) microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, cat. # 130-117-044) and the negative flow-through fraction was collected. Tregs were purified from the mouse lymphocytes using a CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, cat. # 130-091-041).

The sgRNA was eluted with elution buffer preheated to 95°C. The eluted sgRNA was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C, and the suspension was transferred into a new RNase-free tube. The sgRNA quality was checked by a bioanalyzer using an RNA nano Chip. The sgRNA was diluted to 500 ng/μl in injection buffer (sterile 10 mM Tris/0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) and stored in a −80°C freezer until use. An injection mixture (final volume 30 μl) was prepared in injection buffer by mixing 500 ng/μl of each of the sgRNAs (left and right) with Cas9 mRNA (1 μg/μl, TriLink, cat # L-6125). Fertilized eggs collected from B6/129 mice were microinjected at the CHOP transgenic core and transferred into pseudo-pregnant B6 females. The pups were genotyped using primers flanking the targeted sequence (Forward primer: TTAGGACCTCACCCATCACAA and reverse primer: CATGCCCAGCTACTCTGACAT). The PCR product was cloned into the Promega PGEM T Easy TA cloning vector, and plasmid DNA was Sanger sequenced to determine the size of the deletion.

<p>The retrieved files were trimmed/preprocessed using fastp with the default settings. Following this, matched R1 and R2 files were concatenated to a single R1/R2 file pair. The reads were aligned to hg19 and duplicates were removed as described for the ATAC-seq data analysis. The deduplicated bam files were used as input to the ABC model. We ran the ABC model with the default settings for hg19 and provided reference files for the blacklist, promoter annotation, chromosome sizes reference, and set of ubiquitiously expressed genes. The HiC data used was the KR normalized averaged HiC dataset that was derived from a set of cell lines (GM12878, NHEK, HMEC, RPE1, THP1, IMR90, HU-VEC, HCT116, K562, KBM7; average_hic.v2.191020.tar.gz) at 5kb resolution then scaled by powerlaw distribution as described in the original manuscript. The default threshold of 0.2 was used to link enhancers to genes. The resulting elements were intersected with the credible set list used in this study for precision-recall analyses.</p>

<title>Precision-recall analyses against HIEI genes</title>
<p>To benchmark our autoimmune effector gene predictions against prior eQTL and chromatin capture studies, we curated a list of 449 expert curated genes from Human Errors in Inborn Immunity 2022, where mutations have been reported to cause immune phenotypes in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Most of these genes were identified through rare loss of function mutations in the coding region. In addition to this we also took a subset of 145 genes reported to specifically result in autoimmune phenotypes. These two sets of genes were treated as “gold standard” sets of genes to compare different approaches to predict GWAS effector genes. We curated the results of several other chromatin conformation or eQTL based methods of assigning variants to genes to compare with our study. For the chromatin confirmation studies, we obtained loop calls from the associated publications and intersected with the list variants in the 95% credible set from 15 GWAS used to predict effector genes using GenomicRanges (v1.46.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref></sup>. For eQTL studies, we obtained the summary stats files and identified eGenes linked to any member of the credible set reported as an eQTL in the transcriptome wide association analysis (TWAS; p-value &lt; 1e-4). Precision was calculated as the ratio of the number predicted genes in the truth set to the total number of predicted genes, while recall was calculated as the ratio of the number predicted genes in the truth set to the total number of genes in truth set.</p>

<title>Colocalized eQTL comparisons</title>
<p>In addition to comparisons with the eGenes identified by TWAS in the Soskic et al. study, we also compared overlap of gene nominations in our study with the eQTLs that colocalized with an autoimmune GWAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Enrichment of sentinel-gene assignments was conducted similarly as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Briefly, a null distribution was constructed by randomly selecting genes within 1 Mb of the sentinel compared to the set of colocalized cis-eQTL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> found in through 10,000 iterations. The observed overlap reports the set of gene identified by both our HiC based approach with the set of colocalized eQTLs. We report the empirical P value of the observed value relative to null distribution.</p>

After 6 hours, the transfection medium was replaced with complete culture medium. Transfected cells were incubated at 37C for 48-72 hours in a cell culture incubator. and then the Lentiviral supernatants were harvested and spun at 300g for 5 minutes to remove cellular debris. Lentiviral supernatants were concentrated using Lenti-X<sup>TM</sup> Concentrator (Takara Bio, Cat # 631232) and then centrifuged at 1500g for 30 minutes at 4°C and supernatant was discarded. The lentiviral pellet was resuspended at a ratio of 1:20 of the original volume using RPMI media and concentrated virus supernatant aliquots were prepared and stored until use at −80°C. To achieve high transduction efficiency, the viral supernatant was titrated in Jurkat cells through transduction using various dilutions of the viral supernatants and transduction efficiency was determined by mcherry expression analyzed through flow cytometry. Jurkat cells were seeded in a 24 well plate at 0.5 x106/well in culture media, viral supernatant with 8 ug/mL of polybrene was added to each well. Spinfection was performed for 90 min. at 2500 rpm, and transduced cells were equilibrated at 37C for ∼6 hrs, followed by incubation at 37C 5%CO2 for ∼72 hours culture. Transduced Jurkat Cells were then harvested and stimulated using PMA (15 ng/mL) + Ionomycin (1 uM) + human anti-CD28 (2 ug/ml), BioXcell cat # BE0248 in 96 well culture plates (TPP, cat # 92097) in triplicates.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors profile gene expression, chromatin accessibility and chromosomal architecture (by Hi-C) in activated CD4 T cells and use this information to link non-coding variants associated with autoimmune diseases with putative target genes. They find over a 1000 genes physically linked with autoimmune disease loci in these cells, many of which are upregulated upon T cell activation. Focusing on IL2, they dissect the regulatory architecture of this locus, including the allelic effects of GWAS variants. They also intersect their variant-to-gene lists with data from CRISPR screens for genes involved in CD4 T cell activation and expression of inflammatory genes, finding enrichments for regulators. Finally, they showed that pharmacological inhibition of some of these genes impacts T cell activation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>There is significant interest in characterizing the mechanisms by which genetic mutations linked to autoimmunity perturb immune processes. Pahl et al. collect information of dynamic accessible regions, genes, and 3D contacts in primary CD4+ T cell samples that have been stimulated ex vivo. The study includes a variety of analyses characterizing these dynamic changes. With TF footprinting they propose factors linked to active regulatory elements. They compare the performance of their variant mapping pipeline that uses their data versus existing datasets. Most compelling there was a deep dive into additional study of regulatory elements nearby the IL2 gene. Finally, they perform a pharmacological screen targeting several genes they suggest are involved in T cell proliferation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The work done characterizing elements at the IL2 locus is impressive.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- There are extensive studies performed on resting and activated immune cell states (CD4+ T cells and other cell types) and some at multiple time points or concentrations of stimuli that collect ATAC-seq and/or RNA-seq. Several analyses performed in published studies were similarly performed in this study. I expected the authors to at least briefly mention published studies and whether their conclusions generally agree or disagree. Are the same dynamic regulatory regions or genes identified upon T cell activation? Are the same TF footprints enriched in these dynamic regulatory elements? In the revision, I appreciate that the authors now include additional data from several studies that I had initially suggested for the purposes of nominating disease genes in their precision-recall analysis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper used RNAseq, ATACseq, and Hi-C to assess gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and chromatin physical associations for native CD4+ T cells as they respond to stimulation through TCR and CD28. With these data in hand, the author identified 423 GWAS signals to their respective target genes, where most of these were not in the proximal promoter, but rather distal enhancers. The IL-2 gene was used as an example to identify new distal cis regulatory regions required for optimal IL-2 gene transcription. These distal elements interact with the proximal IL2 promoter region. When the distal enhancer contained an autoimmune SNP, it affected IL-2 gene transcription. The authors also identified genetic risk variants that were associated to genes upon activation. Some of these regulate proliferation and cytokine production, but others were novel.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper provides a wealth of data related to gene expression after CD4 T cells are activated through the TCR and CD28. An important strength of this paper is that these data were intensively analyzed to uncover autoimmune disease SNPs in cis acting regions. Many of these could be assigned to likely target genes even though they often are in distal enhancers. These findings help to provide a better understanding concerning the mechanism by which GWAS risk elements impact gene expression.</p>
<p>Another strength to this study was the proof-of-principle studies examining the IL-2 gene. Not only were new cis acting enhancers discovered, but they were functionally shown to be important in regulating IL-2 expression, including susceptibility to colitis. Their importance was also established with respect to such distal enhancers harboring disease relevant SNPs, which were shown to affect IL-2 transcription.</p>
<p>The data from this study were also mined against past Crispr screens that identified genes that control aspects of CD4 T cell activation. From these comparisons, novel genes were identified that function during T cell activation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A weakness from this study is that few individuals were analyzed, i.e., RNAseq and ATACseq (n=3) and HiC (n=2). Thus, the authors may have underestimated potentially relevant risk associations by their chromatin capture-based methodology. This might account for low overlap of their data with the eQTL-based approach or the HIEI truth set.</p>
<p>The authors explain that the low overlap is not due to few GWAS associations by HiC. The expanded discussion in the revised manuscript provides a framework to help explain inherent differences between these methods that may contribute to the low overlap.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>This study indicates that defining distal chromatin interacting regions help to identify distal genetic elements, including relevant variants, that contribute to gene activation.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors profile gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and chromosomal architecture (by Hi-C) in activated CD4 T cells and use this information to link non-coding variants associated with autoimmune diseases with putative target genes. They find over 1000 genes physically linked with autoimmune disease loci in these cells, many of which are upregulated upon T cell activation. Focusing on IL2, they dissect the regulatory architecture of this locus, including the allelic effects of GWAS variants. They also intersect their variant-to-gene lists with data from CRISPR screens for genes involved in CD4 T cell activation and expression of inflammatory genes, finding enrichments for regulators. Finally, they showed that pharmacological inhibition of some of these genes impacts T-cell activation.</p>
<p>This is a solid study that follows a well-established canvas for variant-to-gene prioritisation using 3D genomics, applying it to activated T cells. The authors go some way in validating the lists of candidate genes, as well as exploring the regulatory architecture of a candidate GWAS locus. Jointly with data from previous studies performing variant-to-gene assignment in activated CD4 T cells (and other immune cells), this work provides a useful additional resource for interpreting autoimmune disease-associated genetic variation.</p>
<p>Suggestions for improvement:</p>
<p>Autoimmune disease variants were already linked with genes in CD28-stimulated CD4 T cells using chromosome conformation capture, specifically Promoter CHi-C and the COGS pipeline (Javierre et al., Cell 2016; Burren et al., Genome Biol 2017; Yang et al., Nat Comms 2020). The authors cite these papers and present a comparative analysis of their variant-to-gene assignments (in addition to scRNA-seq eQTL-based assignments). Furthermore, they find that the Burren analysis yields a higher enrichment for gold standard genes.</p>
<p>The obvious question that the authors don't venture into is why the results are quite different. In principle, this could be due to the differences between:</p>
<p>(a) the cell stimulation procedure</p>
<p>(b) the GWAS datasets used</p>
<p>(c)  the types of assay (Hi-C vs Capture Hi-C)</p>
<p>(d) approaches for defining gene-linked regions (loops vs neighbourhoods)</p>
<p>(e) how the GWAS signals at gene-linked regions are aggregated (e.g., the flavours of COGS in Javierre and Burren vs the authors' approach)</p>
<p>Re (a), I'm not sure the authors make it explicitly clear in the main text that the Capture Hi-Cbased studies also use *stimulated* CD4 T cells, particularly in the section &quot;Comparative predictive power...&quot;. So the cells used are pretty much the same, and the differences likely arise from points (b) to (e).</p>
<p>It would be useful for the community to understand more clearly what is driving these differences, ideally with some added data. Could the authors, for example, take the PCHi-C data from Javierre/Burren and use their GWAS data and variant-to-gene assignment algorithms?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the referee’s expert assessment of our work and its value to the field, and we are glad that the referee was enthused by our comparison of the predictive power of the various V2G approaches. A point not emphasized enough in the original version of the manuscript is that we actually did harmonize the various datasets in the way the referee suggests for the precision/recall analysis. We took the contact maps presented from each paper, mapped genes using the same set of GWAS SNPs, and defined all gene-linked regions using our loop calling approach. This has been clarified in the revised version of the manuscript. We have now included a more thoughtful discussion of the possible sources of discrepancy between the different studies included in the comparison, and our thoughts on the potential sources raised by the referee are outlined below:</p>
<p>(a) The modes of stimulation used are similar between studies, but timepoints and donors did vary, and ours was the only study that sorted naïve CD4+ T cells before stimulation. These aspects could represent a source of variability.</p>
<p>(b) The GWAS is not a source of variability because we re-ran the raw data from all the orthogonal studies through our V2G pipeline using the same GWAS as in the current manuscript.</p>
<p>(c) The use of HiC vs. Capture HiC is a likely source of variability. The Capture-HiC datasets included in our comparison are lower resolution (i.e. HindIII) but focus higher sequencing depth at promoters compared to our HiC datasets – i.e., Capture-HiC may mis-call loops to the wrong promoters due to lower resolution as we have shown in our previous study [Su, Human Genetics, 2021], and will miss distal SNP interactions at promoters not included in the capture set. While HiC is unbiased in this regard, HiC will fail to call some SNP-promoter loops called by CaptureHiC because the sequencing power is not specifically focused at promoters.</p>
<p>(d) For studies using neighborhood approaches, we re-ran the raw data through our loop calling algorithm to connect distal SNP to gene promoters, and regarding (e) above, we ran the raw data through our V2G pipeline to allow a better comparison.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, given that the authors use Hi-C, a popular method for V2G prioritisation for this type of data is currently ABC (Nasser et al, Nature 2021). Could the authors provide a comparative analysis with respect to the V2G assignments in the paper and, if they see it appropriate, also run ABC-based GWAS integration on their own Hi-C data?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an excellent suggestion, which we have followed in the revised version of our manuscript. It should be noted (and we do so in the text of the revision) that there is an important caveat to bringing in the ABC model. Chromosome conformation-based approaches are biologically constrained (i.e., informed) by the natural structure of chromatin in the nucleus that controls how gene transcription is regulated in cis, and it does so in a way that brings value to GWAS data. However, the ABC model further constrains the input data by imposing non-biological filters that allow the algorithm to be applied, but impose artifactual limitations that may negatively impact interpretation and discovery. In addition to filtering out pseudogenes, bidirectional RNA, antisense RNAs, and small RNAs, the ABC model gene set eliminates genes ubiquitously expressed across tissues (based on the assumption that these genes are driven primarily by elements adjacent to their promoters) and only allows annotation of one promoter per gene, even though the median number of promoters per gene in the human genome is three. In contrast, our chromatin-based V2G removes pseudogenes, but includes lincRNA and small RNAs, and includes all alternative transcription start sites annotated by gencode.</p>
<p>To apply the ABC GWAS gene nomination model to our CD4+ T cell chromatin-based V2G data, we used our ATAC-seq data and publicly available CD4+ T cell H3K27ac ChIP-seq data as input, and integrated this with GWAS and the average ENCODE-derived HiC dataset from the original ABC paper. The activity-by-contact model nominated 650 genes, compared to 1836 genes when using our cell type-matched HiC data and analysis pipeline. Only 357 of these genes were nominated by both approaches; 1479 genes nominated by our approach were not nominated by ABC, while 293 genes not implicated by our approach were newly implicated by ABC. To determine how the ABC-constrained approach performs against the HIEI gold standard set, we subjected all datasets used for the comparison depicted in the new Figure 5D to the same promoter filter used by the ABC model prior as part of the precision-recall re-analysis. Firstly, we found that applying the restricted ABC model promoter annotation to all datasets did not have a large effect on recall, however, the precision of several of the datasets were affected. For example, using the restricted promoter set reduced the precision of our (Pahl) V2G approach and inflated the precision of the nearest gene to SNP metric. Second, the new precision-recall analysis shows that the ABC score-based approach is only half as sensitive at predicting HIEI genes as the chromatin-based V2G approaches. This indicates that constraining GWAS data with cell type- and state-specific 3D chromatin-based data brings more GWAS target gene predictive power than application of the multi-tissue-averaged HiC used by the ABC model.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>There is significant interest in characterizing the mechanisms by which genetic mutations linked to autoimmunity perturb immune processes. Pahl et al. collect information on dynamic accessible regions, genes, and 3D contacts in primary CD4+ T cell samples that have been stimulated ex vivo. The study includes a variety of analyses characterizing these dynamic changes. With TF footprinting they propose factors linked to active regulatory elements. They compare the performance of their variant mapping pipeline that uses their data versus existing datasets. Most compelling there was a deep dive into additional study of regulatory elements nearby the IL2 gene. Finally, they perform a pharmacological screen targeting several genes they suggest are involved in T cell proliferation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work done characterizing elements at the IL2 locus is impressive.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Missing critical context to evaluate claims. There are extensive studies performed on resting and activated immune cell states (CD4+ T cells and other cell types) and some at multiple time points or concentrations of stimuli that collect ATAC-seq and/or RNA-seq that have been ignored by this study. How do conclusions from previous studies compare to what the authors conclude here? It is impossible to evaluate the claims without this additional context. These are a few studies I am familiar with (the authors should perform a more comprehensive search to be sure they're not ignoring existing observations) that would be important to compare/contrast conclusions:  o Alasoo, K. et al.

<p>- As a general point, I appreciate it when each claim includes a corresponding effect size and p-value, which helps me evaluate the strength of significance of supporting evidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the referee’s expert assessment of our work and emphasis on the value of our functional follow-up studies. Our precision-recall analyses were not meant to represent an exhaustive comparison of all prior GWAS gene nomination studies, although we agree that this could (and should) be done as part of a separate study in a future manuscript. Instead, we focused on gene nomination studies that 1) analyzed resting and activated human CD4+ T cells, 2) whose experimental design was most comparable to our own studies, and 3) had raw data readily available in the appropriate formats to allow re-analysis and harmonization before comparison. This is a point we did not make sufficiently clear in the original version of the manuscript, but have clarified in the revision.</p>
<p>Based on this rationale, we agree that the studies by Gate et al. and Ye et al. should be included in our comparative precision-recall analysis, and we have done so in the revised manuscript. The Gate study reported ATAC-seq peak co-accessibility, caQTL, eQTL, and HiC data, and we now include the resulting gene nominations from these datasets in the precision-recall analysis. These datasets performed poorly with respect to nomination of HIEI genes, likely due to small sample numbers and low sequencing depth compared to the other eQTL and chromatin capture-based studies. The eQTL reported by Ye et al. nominated 15 genes for autoimmune traits, two of which were in the ‘truth’ HIEI set (IL7R and IL2RB). This resulted low predictive power but a high precision due to the low number of nominated genes compared to the other V2G datasets. As suggested by referee 1, we have also subjected our data to the ‘activity-by-contact’ (ABC) algorithm and have included this dataset in the comparison as well. Please see Figure 5 in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>We have elected not to include data from the other studies suggested by the referee for the following reasons: The stimulation paradigm used in the Glinos study is very different from that used in other studies. Also, this study and the study by Calderon did not nominate genes. The studies by Alasoo et al. and Kim-Hellmuth et al. analyzed macrophages, which are not a comparable cell type to CD4+ T cells. The allele-specific eQTL study by Gutierrez-Arcelus et al. included relevant the cell type and activation states, but included a relatively small number of samples (24) and variants (561), and the raw data in dbGAP does not readily allow for re-analysis and harmonization with the other studies.

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper used RNAseq, ATACseq, and Hi-C to assess gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and chromatin physical associations for native CD4+ T cells as they respond to stimulation through TCR and CD28. With these data in hand, the authors identified 423 GWAS signals to their respective target genes, where most of these were not in the proximal promoter, but rather distal enhancers. The IL-2 gene was used as an example to identify new distal cisregulatory regions required for optimal IL-2 gene transcription. These distal elements interact with the proximal IL2 promoter region. When the distal enhancer contained an autoimmune SNP, it affected IL-2 gene transcription. The authors also identified genetic risk variants that were associated with genes upon activation. Some of these regulate proliferation and cytokine production, but others are novel.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper provides a wealth of data related to gene expression after CD4 T cells are activated through the TCR and CD28. An important strength of this paper is that these data were intensively analyzed to uncover autoimmune disease SNPs in cis-acting regions. Many of these could be assigned to likely target genes even though they often are in distal enhancers. These findings help to provide a better understanding concerning the mechanism by which GWAS risk elements impact gene expression.</p>
<p>Another strength of this study was the proof-of-principle studies examining the IL-2 gene. Not only were new cis-acting enhancers discovered, but they were functionally shown to be important in regulating IL-2 expression, including susceptibility to colitis. Their importance was also established with respect to such distal enhancers harboring disease-relevant SNPs, which were shown to affect IL-2 transcription.</p>
<p>The data from this study were also mined against past CRISPR screens that identified genes that control aspects of CD4 T cell activation. From these comparisons, novel genes were identified that function during T cell activation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A weakness of this study is that few individuals were analyzed, i.e., RNAseq and ATACseq (n=3) and HiC (n=2). Thus, the authors may have underestimated potentially relevant risk associations by their chromatin capture-based methodology. This might account for the low overlap of their data with the eQTL-based approach or the HIEI truth set.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>This study indicates that defining distal chromatin interacting regions helps to identify distal genetic elements, including relevant variants, that contribute to gene activation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the referee’s expert assessment of our work and emphasis on the value of our functional follow-up studies. We have ensured that all sample sizes, effect sizes, p values and FDR statistics are included in the figures and figure legends. We agree that including more donors for the HiC studies would increase the number of implicated variants and genes, however, all the chromatin-based V2G approaches described in our manuscript use relatively small sample sizes, but implicate more variants and genes than the comparable eQTL studies. I.e., the low overlap is not driven by a paucity of GWAS-chromatin-based associations. An alternative explanation for the low overlap between GWAS-chromatin-based approaches and eQTL approaches was recently by Pritchard and colleagues, who reported that GWAS and eQTL studies systematically implicate different types of variants (Mostafavi et al., Nature Genetics 2023). Among other differences, eQTL tend to implicate nearby genes while GWAS variants implicate distant genes, and our results support this contention. We referred to this study in the original version of the manuscript, but have included a more extensive discussion of potential explanations in the revised version. We thank the reviewer for helpful suggestions that have improved the quality of our study.</p>
