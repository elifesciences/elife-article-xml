<title>Abstract</title><p>The apical extracellular matrix (aECM) plays a critical role in epithelial tube morphogenesis during organ formation, but its composition and organization remain poorly understood. Using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic salivary gland (SG) as a model, we identify Papss, an enzyme that synthesizes the universal sulfate donor PAPS, as a critical regulator of tube lumen expansion. <italic>Papss</italic> mutants show a disorganized apical membrane, condensed aECM, and disruptions in Golgi structures and intracellular trafficking. SG-specific expression of wild-type Papss, but not the catalytically inactive form, rescues the defects in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, suggesting that defects in sulfation are the underlying cause of the phenotypes. Additionally, we identify two zona pellucida (ZP) domain proteins, Piopio (Pio) and Dumpy (Dpy), as key components of the SG aECM. In the absence of <italic>Papss</italic>, Pio is gradually lost in the aECM, while the Dpy-positive aECM structure is condensed and dissociates from the apical membrane, leading to a thin lumen. Mutations in <italic>dpy</italic> or <italic>pio</italic>, or in <italic>Notopleural</italic>, which encodes a matriptase that cleaves Pio to form the luminal Pio pool, result in a SG lumen with alternating bulges and constrictions, with the loss of <italic>pio</italic> leading to the loss of Dpy in the lumen. Our findings underscore the essential role of sulfation in organizing the aECM during tubular organ formation and highlight the mechanical support provided by ZP domain proteins in maintaining luminal diameter.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epithelial tubes are critical components of many key biological organs, including the kidney, heart, and lungs. Aberrant tube size leads to common diseases and congenital disorders, such as polycystic kidney disease, asthma, and lung hypoplasia. Tube morphogenesis is regulated by multiple factors, including intracellular mechanisms, intercellular interactions, and interactions between cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). Specifically, events at the apical (luminal) surface of a tube play an important role in regulating tube diameter and growth, thereby influencing overall tube shape (Myat and Andrew, 2002). During tubular organ formation, the surrounding epithelium secretes apical ECM (aECM) components into the lumen. These aECM components form the luminal meshwork and interact with the apical membrane, playing a critical role in epithelial morphogenesis and regulation of tube dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jazwinska et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Devine et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Luschnig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Syed et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Drees et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gill et al., 2016</xref>; Cohen, Sparacio, et al., 2020).</p>
<p>The aECM has a distinct composition compared to the basal ECM, with a diverse array of components (Zheng et al., 2020). ZP domain proteins, which are highly conserved across species, are of particular interest and are characterized by a conserved 260 amino acid ZP domain that mediates homo– or heteromeric polymerization into filaments. Initially identified in the extracellular coat of mammalian oocytes, ZP domain proteins have been shown to play a critical role in the organization of specialized apical structures in various tissues in species ranging from worms to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Porter &amp; Tamm, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Legan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Op De Beeck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Renner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">McAllister et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wong et al., 2000</xref>; Cohen, Bermudez, et al., 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Plaza et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jovine et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Litscher &amp; Wassarman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wilkin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ghosh &amp; Treisman, 2024</xref>). Chitin, a biopolymer of N-acetylglucosamine, is another major aECM component that is abundant in invertebrates and some vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mei et al., 2024</xref>). In many <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> tissues, chitin forms a network of fibers that provide mechanical support and maintain the integrity of the epithelial layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Araujo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Devine et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Moussian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tonning et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Several studies have shown the role of ZP proteins in maintaining the chitin matrix in the aECM. During <italic>Drosophila</italic> tracheal development, two ZP proteins, Dumpy (Dpy) and Piopio (Pio), build an elastic structure in the lumen that modulates mechanical stress and maintains the chitin matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jazwinska et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Drees et al., 2023</xref>). In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> corneal lens, another ZP domain protein, Dusky-like, establishes an external scaffold for chitin retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ghosh &amp; Treisman, 2024</xref>). However, many organs in both vertebrates and invertebrates have a non-chitinous aECM, and the role of ZP proteins in the non-chitinous aECM is less well understood.</p>
<p>Post-translational modifications of the aECM are essential for proper tube dimensions during organ formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Luschnig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abrams et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Herman &amp; Horvitz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hwang et al., 2003</xref>). Sulfation is an abundant post-translational modification that takes place in the Golgi apparatus, where a sulfate group is covalently attached to amino acid residues of proteins or side chains of proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gunal et al., 2019</xref>). Several studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have shown key roles of sulfation in neuronal organization, development of reproductive tissues, and phynotypic plasticitiy, linking this post-translational modification to multiple cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Turnbull et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bulow &amp; Hobert, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kinnunen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tecle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Diaz-Balzac et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dierker et al., 2016</xref>). A study in a mouse model of cystic fibrosis also suggest a link between the disease state and proper sulfation levels in organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Xia et al., 2005</xref>), but the role of sulfation in tubular organ development and aECM organization remains elusive.</p>
<p>Sulfation reactions require a high-energy form of sulfate, 3’-phosphoadenosine-5’-phosphosulfate (PAPS), which is produced by the enzyme PAPS synthetase (Papss) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">van den Boom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gunal et al., 2019</xref>). Mammals have two Papss isoforms, Papss1 and Papss2. <italic>Papss1</italic> shows ubiquitous expression, with higher levels in glandular cells and salivary duct cells, suggesting that high degrees of sulfation are required in these cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Uhlen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Karlsson et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Papss2</italic> shows a more restricted expression in certain tissues such as cartilage, and mutations in <italic>Papss2</italic> have been associated with skeletal dysplasia in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Faiyaz ul Haque et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahmad et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kurima et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ford-Hutchinson et al., 2005</xref>). Mouse models with exon deletions in <italic>Papss1</italic> or <italic>Papss2</italic> show extensive defects, including lethality (<italic>Papss1</italic>) and abnormal craniofacial and limb morphology (<italic>Papss2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Groza et al., 2023</xref>), demonstrating that Papss is vital for developmental processes in mammals. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has a single <italic>Papss</italic> gene, allowing for a straightforward investigation of its function in developmental processes without redundancy. By studying the role of <italic>Papss</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, we can gain valuable insights into the role of this conserved enzyme in normal development and disease in humans.</p>
<p>To understand the role of post-translational modification in aECM organization and to determine the key composition of the non-chitinous aECM in tubular organs, we use the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic SG as a model. This single-layered epithelial tube is formed through highly stereotyped morphogenetic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung et al., 2014</xref>), making it an excellent system for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying aECM composition and modification. SG cells are specified on the ventral surface of the embryo at stage 10. Once specified, SG cells do not undergo cell division or cell death because SG-upregulated transcription factors downregulate the expression of key cell cycle genes and proapoptotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Myat &amp; Andrew, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chandrasekaran &amp; Beckendorf, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fox et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Matthew et al., 2024</xref>), and thus the entire morphogenetic process is driven by cell shape change, cell rearrangement, and collective cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Myat &amp; Andrew, 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bradley &amp; Andrew, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bradley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chung &amp; Andrew, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chung et al., 2017</xref>). At stage 11, SG cells invaginate to form a three-dimensional tubular structure, which then elongates and migrates toward its final position during stages 12-13. The SG continues to migrate and the lumen expands significantly by apical secretion during stages 14-16, forming the fully developed organ. Despite limited knowledge of the composition of the aECM in the SG, previous work has demonstrated the critical role of ADAMTS-A, a secreted metalloprotease, in releasing cells from the aECM to facilitate SG migration and normal lumen shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ismat et al., 2013</xref>). Our previous work has also shown that cell-aECM adhesion via the apical surface protein Cad99C influences cell rearrangement during SG elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chung &amp; Andrew, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we identify Papss as being essential for aECM organization and lumen expansion of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic SG. Loss of <italic>Papss</italic> results in a disorganized apical membrane and a condensed aECM, which is associated with disrupted Golgi structures and intracellular trafficking. <italic>Papss</italic> mutants also show defects in the basal ECM and occasional SG cell death, leading to invasion of hemocytes into SG epithelia that engulf dying cells. Expressing the wild-type (WT) Papss in the SG rescues all phenotypes, but not the enzyme-dead form. We identify two ZP proteins, Pio and Dpy, as key components of the SG aECM. In the SG lumen, these ZP domain proteins form a filamentous scaffold that is significantly affected by the loss of <italic>Papss</italic>, with Pio eventually being lost from the aECM and the Dpy-positive aECM structure condensing and dissociating from the apical membrane. Mutations in <italic>pio</italic> or <italic>dpy</italic>, or in <italic>Notopleural</italic> (<italic>Np</italic>), which encodes a matriptase that cleaves Pio to form the luminal pool of Pio, exhibit bulging and constriction of the SG lumen. Notably, mutations in <italic>pio</italic> result in the loss of luminal Dpy signals in the SG. These data indicate that the Dpy-containing filamentous structure of the aECM is crucial for maintaining luminal diameter and that the luminal pool of Pio is essential for organizing this structure during SG morphogenesis.</p>

<title>Results</title>

<title>Papss is required for SG lumen expansion</title>
<p>To identify key enzymes that affect SG morphology by modifying aECM components, we examined the effects of the loss of ∼20 enzymes that are highly expressed in the SG and are likely to function in the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fox et al., 2013</xref>). Deficiency lines deleting each enzyme were immunostained with the apical membrane marker Crumbs (Crb) or Stranded at Second (SAS) to assess SG lumen shape. Among the twelve lines showing defects (Table 1), a deficiency line deleting <italic>PAPS synthetase</italic> (<italic>Papss</italic>) and 18 other genes had a very thin SG lumen with irregular apical protrusions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Papss catalyzes the synthesis of 3’-phosphoadenosine-5’-phosphosulfate (PAPS), the sulfate donor compound in all sulfotransferase reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Venkatachalam, 2003</xref>). Consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jullien et al., 1997</xref>), our fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed that <italic>Papss</italic> transcripts are highly expressed in the SG throughout morphogenesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting a high demand for sulfation in this organ.</p>

Sanger sequencing of this mutant identified a point mutation (G-&gt;A) that introduces a premature stop codon (Trp271-&gt;stop; amino acid number is for the Papss-PA isoform) located near the N-terminus of the ATP sulfurylase domain, resulting in a truncated protein in which most of the domain is not translated (Figure 1-figure supplement S1A-B). Since both protein domains are essential for the enzyme function of Papss, we conclude that this mutant line is potentially null or a strong hypomorphic allele. <italic>Papss</italic> homozygous mutants and transheterozygotes for <italic>Papss</italic> mutant over a deficiency were embryonic lethal. To test the role of Papss in sulfation in the SG, we checked for the presence of sulfated tyrosine using a sulfotyrosine antibody in WT and <italic>Papss</italic> mutant embryos. In WT, we observed strong sulfotyrosine signals both in the apical membrane and as puncta in the cytoplasm of SG cells (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 1-figure supplement S2A</xref>). The cytoplasmic puncta colocalized with ManII-GFP signals, a medial Golgi marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yang et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that proteins undergoing tyrosine sulfation in the Golgi are detected by the antibody (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 1-figure supplement S2C</xref>). In <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, the cytoplasmic punctate signals were significantly reduced (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 1-figure supplement 2B</xref>), suggesting that sulfation in the Golgi is decreased. The signals at the apical membrane appeared similar or slightly reduced compared to WT, suggesting that sulfated molecules, possibly by maternally provided Papss, were still targeted apically, although it is not clear whether they were properly targeted to their original destination or mislocalized. Together with a previous study using Alcian Blue staining showing the loss of sulfated biomolecules in the <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhu et al., 2005</xref>), these data suggest sulfation in the SG is dependent on Papss.</p>
<p><italic>Papss</italic> homozygous mutant embryos often showed overall defective embryonic morphology, such as defects in germ band retraction and head involution (39%; N=80/204; <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 1-figure supplement 3A-F</xref>). The heterozygous <italic>Papss</italic> mutant embryos produced by crossing <italic>Papss</italic> mutants with WT flies appeared normal (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 1-figure supplement 3A-F</xref>). A smaller percentage of transheterozygous embryos showed similar defects (10%; N=13/136), with many late-stage embryos appearing normal (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 1-figure supplement 3C, E and F</xref>). We conclude that transheterozygous embryos with more severe defects did not survive to late stages, but we cannot rule out the possibility that a secondary mutation at another gene locus contributes to the overall embryonic defects. Embryos with these morphological defects often showed defects in SG invagination, forming a SG close to the surface of the embryo (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 1-figure supplement 3D, G and H</xref>). We used the embryos that formed the SG in the normal position for quantification and further analysis.</p>
<p>Using the adherens junction (AJ) marker E-cadherin (Ecad) signals, we analyzed SG lumen phenotypes in <italic>Papss</italic> homozygous mutant embryos and transheterozygotes. During stages 14-16, the WT SG lumen expanded consistently throughout its length (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Papss</italic> mutant embryos exhibited irregularities in SG lumen expansion. At stage 14, when the WT SG lumen expansion began, more than 40% of <italic>Papss</italic> mutant embryos had either a thinner lumen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D and I</xref>; 18%; N=7/38) or a slightly irregular lumen with bulges (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D and I</xref>; 24%; N=9/38). At stage 16, about half of <italic>Papss</italic> homozygous or mutant embryos or transheterozygotes over a deficiency showed an overall thin lumen with an irregular apical surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D and I</xref>’) and the other half had an irregularly expanded lumen with thin and expanded regions along its length (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D and I</xref>’). Quantification of the SG lumen length and diameter at stage 16 showed that whereas the lumen length was comparable between WT and <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SGs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>), the diameter was significantly decreased or irregular, with a high degree of variation in <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SGs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K and K</xref>’). Quantification of the SG lumen area at stage 16 revealed that <italic>Papss</italic> mutants SGs exhibiting the thin lumen phenotype had a smaller lumen size compared to WT. Together, these data suggest a role for Papss in SG lumen expansion primarily by expanding the lumen diameter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether the SG lumen expansion defects are due to the loss of <italic>Papss</italic>, we performed a rescue experiment by overexpressing Papss in the SG using the SG-specific driver <italic>sage-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chung et al., 2009</xref>) in the <italic>Papss</italic> mutant background. <italic>Papss</italic> produces multiple isoforms, including Papss-PA/B/C/G (629 aa), Papss-PD (657 aa), and Papss-PE/F/H (630 aa), which differ only slightly in the N-terminus (Flybase; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.flybase.org">www.flybase.org</ext-link>). Using three additional probes that detect different subsets of splice forms, we performed fluorescent in situ hybridization and found that all probes detected signals in the SG at varying levels (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 1-figure supplement 4A and B</xref>). We generated UAS lines for Papss-PD and Papss-PE and found that overexpression of either isoform in the SG of WT embryos resulted in a normally expanded SG lumen (data for Papss-PE overexpression are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F and I</xref>’). Given the high levels of <italic>Papss</italic> mRNA in the WT SG, the Papss protein is likely abundant in the SG, which may explain why further overexpression of Papss does not lead to any additional effects. Since our initial analysis showed identical rescue features in the SG for the generated UAS lines, we used the UAS-Papss-PD and UAS-Papss-PE lines interchangeably for further experiments (hereafter, when overexpressed, Papss-PD and Papss-PE will be referred to as Papss). When Papss was overexpressed in the SG of <italic>Papss</italic> mutant embryos, only a small fraction (4%; N=1/26) showed a thin lumen phenotype along the entire length of the SG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G and I</xref>’). The majority of embryos (73%) showed either a normal, fully expanded lumen along the entire length of the SG, with occasional slight irregularities at the apical membrane (42%; N=11/26), or a irregularly expanded lumen, where some parts of the SG lumen were expanded and others were thin (31%; N=8/26) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G and I</xref>’). SGs with normally expanded lumens had luminal geometry comparable to that of WT embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J-L</xref>). Interestingly, some of the embryos had an over-expanded SG lumen, often with a non-uniform diameter (24%; N=6/24; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G and I</xref>’). To test whether the enzyme activity of Papss is required for its role in SG lumen expansion, we also generated UAS lines with mutations in the critical residues of the ATP sulfurylase (F593P) and APS kinase (K193A) domains using the Papss-PD isoform (See Materials and Methods for details; amino acid number is for Papss-PD). Overexpressing a mutant version of Papss containing both of these mutations in the SG did not rescue the SG phenotypes as WT Papss did, but it showed the same range of defects as <italic>Papss</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, I’ and J-L). These data suggest that the sulfation activity of Papss is required for SG lumen expansion. Overall, although a range of phenotypes was present, the thin SG lumen phenotype was almost completely rescued by SG-specific expression of WT Papss, but not the enzyme-dead form.</p>

<title>Loss of <italic>Papss</italic> disrupts the apical domain and aECM organization</title>
<p>To investigate the cellular basis of the thin SG lumen phenotype in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, we examined the localization of key apical membrane proteins and junctional markers. In WT SGs, the apical polarity protein Crb localized to the subapical region (SAR) between the apical surface (free apical area) and the AJs, and we observed clear Crb signals along the apical cell boundary of each SG cell (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A and B</xref>). In contrast, the Crb signals in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants appeared less prominently localized to the SAR in SG cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). We measured the Crb signal intensity in the SAR and the apical-medial region of SG cells. The ratio of the Crb signal intensity at SAR to apical-medial intensity was significantly lower in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants than in WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating disorganization of the apical domain. The AJ marker Ecad and the septate junction (SJ) marker Discs large (Dlg) showed no apparent disruption in localization compared to WT (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A-E</xref>). These data suggest that loss of <italic>Papss</italic> primarily affects the apical membrane in the SG, while leaving the junctional regions intact.</p>

<p>Next, we investigated the organization of the aECM, using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which marks several glycan modifications including O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). WGA has been shown to label the apical membrane and luminal structure in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tonning et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chung et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, we observed relatively weak WGA signals in the apical membrane and the lumen of WT SGs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>; n=25 SGs). Notably, the luminal signals showed multiple thin filamentous organizations traversing the lumen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting heterogeneity of the luminal structure. In <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, WGA signals were increased in both the lumen and apical membrane, with the apical membrane signals appearing more diffuse (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>; n=28 SGs). Interestingly, the luminal WGA signals in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants accumulated strongly on one side along the entire length of the lumen, whereas the thin filamentous WGA signals in WT SGs appeared to show no bias and were mostly centered in the lumen. In regions with a thin SG lumen, WGA was present in a highly condensed rod-like structure; in expanded regions, WGA signals showed either a similar condensed rod-like structure favoring one side of the SG lumen or a slightly condensed filamentous structure often broadly associated with the apical membrane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis also revealed highly condensed and more electron-dense luminal structures in the SG of <italic>Papss</italic> mutants compared to WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H and I</xref>; original, raw TEM images of several WT and <italic>Papss</italic> mutant samples are shown in <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 2-figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). SG-specific overexpression of Papss in the <italic>Papss</italic> mutant background resulted in a partial rescue; the luminal WGA structures were less condensed than <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, but they were not as thin as those in WT SGs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest a role for Papss in organizing the SG aECM with loss of <italic>Papss</italic> resulting in a tightly packed or condensed aECM that is loosely associated with the apical membrane.</p>

<title>Loss of <italic>Papss</italic> disrupts Golgi organization and mislocalizes intracellular trafficking markers</title>
<p>In addition to the apical membrane and luminal signals, we detected WGA signals around the nucleus, consistent with WGA binding to glycoproteins on the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rutherford et al., 1997</xref>), and in several large, punctate cytoplasmic structures in WT SG cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A and E</xref>).

<p>Interestingly, we observed highly dispersed ManII-GFP signals in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants SGs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K and L</xref>’), suggesting that Golgi structures may be disrupted upon <italic>Papss</italic> loss. To examine the Golgi structures in more detail, we performed TEM analysis in WT and <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SG cells.</p>
<p>In contrast to the mammalian Golgi, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Golgi lacks the characteristic ribbon-like structure and is composed of a series of individual cisternae arranged in a random, disordered fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kondylis &amp; Rabouille, 2009</xref>). While the Golgi in WT SG cells showed randomly arranged cisternae, the Golgi in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants showed abnormal arrangement, either stacked or compressed, with small electron-dense puncta along these structures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M and N</xref>), suggesting a functional defect and possible protein aggregation. Other organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), appeared relatively normal. SG-specific expression of GFP-KDEL, GFP fused to the ER retention motif KDEL, or immunostaining for prolyl-4-hydroxylase-alpha SG1, an ER-resident enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abrams et al., 2006</xref>), showed no significant differences between WT and <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SGs (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 3-figure supplement 1 A-D</xref>). TEM analysis also revealed similar ER structures in WT and <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SG cells (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 3-figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). These data suggest that loss of <italic>Papss</italic> disrupts the Golgi, but not the ER.</p>
<p>To determine whether the phenotypes observed in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants are due to defects in Golgi structure and function, we examined the morphology of the SG in null mutants of two key Golgi components, GM130 and Grasp65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Both mutants were homozygous-viable. Although the GM130 null allele (<italic>GM130<sup>1123</sup></italic>) was extremely weak and difficult to grow, the embryos we managed to collect appeared normal, and the SG exhibited only mild irregularity (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 3-figure supplement 2A</xref>; n=5/5). It is possible that only relatively normal embryos survived until late stages of embryogenesis. However, <italic>Grasp65</italic> null mutants (<italic>Grasp65<sup>102</sup></italic>) exhibited a highly irregular SG lumen with condensed luminal WGA signals (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 3-figure supplement 2B and C</xref>; n=10/10). These data suggest that disrupted Golgi structures in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants may contribute to the SG defects.</p>
<p>The aberrant Golgi structures observed in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants prompted us to investigate the impact on intracellular trafficking components. We examined the localization of Rab11, a marker for recycling endosomes, Rab7, a marker for late endosomes, and Sec15, an exocyst marker. As previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chung &amp; Andrew, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Le &amp; Chung, 2021</xref>), Rab11 and Sec15 were enriched along the apical domain of WT SG cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3O and Q</xref>). In <italic>Papss</italic> mutants SGs, we observed an increase in apical Rab11 signal intensity, with some signals mislocalized to the basolateral region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3P and S</xref>). In contrast, Sec15 signals were significantly reduced at the apical membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3R and T</xref>). Unlike Rab11 or Sec15, Rab7 localized in large punctate structures in the cytoplasm of WT SG cells (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 3-figure supplement 3A</xref>). In <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, the number of Rab7 puncta was significantly reduced, although the intensity of Rab7 puncta was not significantly different from WT (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 3-figure supplement 3B-D</xref>). TEM analysis revealed a number of electron-dense vesicles in the apical domain of SG cells in WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3U</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SGs showed fewer electron-dense vesicles, but instead we observed several larger, empty vesicle-like structures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3V and W</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that defective sulfation affects Golgi structures and multiple routes of intracellular trafficking.</p>

<title>Loss of <italic>Papss</italic> results in abnormal cell death and disruption of the basal ECM</title>
<p>In <italic>Papss</italic> mutant embryos, we often observed one or more acellular regions within the SG epithelium during late embryogenesis that lacked any markers for nuclei, cell membranes, or junctions. To test whether these acellular regions were caused by cell death, we stained embryos with an antibody against <italic>Drosophila</italic> cleaved death caspase-1 (DCP-1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sarkissian et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, DCP-1 signals were often found within the acellular spaces (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A and B</xref>), suggesting that loss of <italic>Papss</italic> leads to abnormal cell death in the SG. TEM analysis also captured a dying cell in the <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SG supporting the occurrence of cell death (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). We found that <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SGs have a significantly higher number of these acellular spaces compared to WT SGs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Quantifying the number of SG cells at stage 16 revealed that <italic>Papss</italic> homozygous embryos and transheterozygotes have significantly fewer cells than WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Overexpression of WT Papss, but not the mutant form of Papss, in the <italic>Papss</italic> mutant background decreased the number of acellular regions within the SG (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>) and restored the number of SG cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). This suggests that loss of sulfation leads to conditions that hinder SG cell survival. Blocking apoptosis in the <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SG by overexpressing the baculoviral protein p35, a caspase inhibitor of apoptosis, also restored the SG cell number (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting that apoptosis is a key mechanism underlying SG cell loss in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants. Importantly, the SGs in these embryos still showed thin (25%; N=2/8) or irregularly expanded (75%; N=6/8) lumens, suggesting that SG lumen expansion defects in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants are independent of abnormal cell death.</p>

<p>Using srpHemo3x-mCh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gyoergy et al., 2018</xref>), we labeled hemocytes, which are analogous in function to macrophages in vertebrates.

In normal epithelia, the basal ECM acts as a physical barrier, preventing hemocytes from migrating into the epithelial layer. To examine the integrity of the basal ECM in <italic>Papss</italic> we used an antibody against Nidogen (Ndg), a glycoprotein with important linker functions in the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wolfstetter &amp; Holz, 2012</xref>). Ndg-positive basal ECM was detected in a regular, thin layer around WT SGs at stage 16 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). However, in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, Ndg signals were irregular and often disconnected, and hemocytes invaded SG cells through the gaps in the Ndg-positive basal ECM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). Overall, our data suggest that loss of <italic>Papss</italic> leads to aberrant cell death in the SG and disrupts both the apical and basal ECM of the SG.</p>

<p>To test Pio localization in the SG, we used a transgenic line expressing an mCherry-Pio (mCh-Pio) fusion protein with the N-terminal mCh tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Drees et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), as well as a Pio antibody generated with the peptide corresponding to the sequence within the ZP domain of Pio, between the ZP-N and ZP-C domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jazwinska et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). mCh-Pio signals were observed in cytoplasmic puncta, at the apical membrane, and in the SG lumen. These signals, especially the luminal signals, became stronger at stages 15-16 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that Pio is transported apically and secreted into the SG lumen. Pio antibody signals showed distinct localization, predominantly in the SG lumen and at the apical membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E and F</xref>). At stages 11 and 12, the Pio antibody revealed low levels of cytoplasmic punctate signals along with strong luminal signals, but from stage 13, Pio signals were predominantly localized to the SG lumen (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E and F</xref>; <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, compared to the diffuse luminal mCh-Pio signals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), Pio antibody signals in the SG lumen were heterogeneous with filamentous structures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>’’), resembling luminal WGA signals. Pio antibody signals were absent at all stages in the <italic>pio</italic> null mutant, in which the entire ZP domain is deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Drees et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 5-figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), confirming antibody specificity. The Pio protein is known to be cleaved, at one cleavage site after the ZP domain, possibly by a furin protease, and at another cleavage site within the ZP domain by the matriptase Notopleural (Np) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Drees et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Drees et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The latter cleavage site falls within the peptide sequence used to generate the Pio antibody (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). A possible explanation for the different signals between mCh-Pio and Pio antibody signals is that the Pio antibody preferentially recognizes the C-terminal ZP domain fragment after furin and Np cleavage, whereas diffuse, luminal mCh-Pio signals are either the secreted Pio protein cleaved only by furin or the N-terminal fragment after Np cleavage.</p>

<p>Dpy-YFP signals from the Dpy-YFP knock-in line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lye et al., 2014</xref>; YFP insertion into the <italic>dpy</italic> locus near the middle of the protein) showed heterogeneous, filamentous structures in the SG lumen throughout SG morphogenesis (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 5-figure supplement 2A</xref>) that colocalized with Pio antibody and WGA signals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E-F</xref>”; <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 5-figure supplement 2C</xref>). It should be noted that because homozygous Dpy-YFP embryos showed a bulging and constricted SG lumen phenotype with highly condensed Dpy-YFP signals throughout the lumen (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 5-figure supplement 2B</xref>), we used embryos with one copy of the transgene to analyze Dpy localization. Qsm localization was analyzed using the mCh-Qsm knock-in line, in which mCh is inserted into the <italic>qsm</italic> locus a few amino acids downstream of the N-terminal end of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chu &amp; Hayashi, 2021</xref>). Unlike Pio and Dpy, mCh-Qsm signals were not detected in the SG lumen. Instead, they showed a dynamic intracellular localization ranging from cytoplasmic signals with apical membrane enrichment (stages 11-14) and apical vesicular signals (stages 14-15) to prominent signals at the apical membrane and SJs (stage 16) (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 5-figure supplement 3A</xref>). These data suggest that Qsm is not a component of the SG aECM. However, it is possible that the mCh-Qsm signals only detect the cleaved N-terminal fragment of Qsm, while the C-terminal fragment may localize to a different subcellular location. Taken together, our data suggest that Pio and Dpy form filamentous aECM structures in the SG.</p>
<p>We next examined Pio, mCh-Pio, Dpy-YFP, and mCh-Qsm signals in <italic>Papss</italic> mutant SGs at stages 14 and 16. At stage 14, Pio antibody and Dpy-YFP signals appeared condensed and enriched within the SG lumen, with reduced association with the apical membrane compared to WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G and G</xref>’). Interestingly, Pio antibody signals were barely detectable in the SG lumen at stage 16 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H-H</xref>’’’), likely due to either protein degradation or epitope masking caused by aECM condensation and protein misfolding. In contrast, Dpy-YFP signals remained in the lumen at all stages and were condensed and localized to one side of the lumen at stage 16 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H-H</xref>’’’), similar to WGA signals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). mCh-Pio signals were depleted from the expanded region of the lumen but weak signals colocalized with condensed Dpy-YFP signals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). We did not observe any significant differences in the localization or intensity of mCh-Qsm signals in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 5-figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). These data suggest that the luminal pool of Pio and Dpy, which form filamentous structure, is significantly affected by the loss of <italic>Papss</italic>, resulting in the loss of Pio and the condensation and dissociation of the Dpy-containing aECM structure from the apical membrane.</p>

<title>ZP domain matrix is required for uniform SG lumen diameter</title>
<p>We next investigated the role of Pio and Dpy in SG morphogenesis by analyzing SG lumen morphology in <italic>pio</italic> and <italic>dpy</italic> mutants. Immunostaining with Ecad revealed that <italic>pio</italic> null mutants formed relatively normal SGs up to stage 15, but stage 16 SGs showed dramatically abnormal luminal morphology characterized by multiple constrictions, with a slight expansion of the lumen between constrictions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, B and F; <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 6-figure supplement 1B</xref>). The constricted regions were severely narrowed to the point of almost no luminal space, and some luminal regions also showed a flat protrusion on one side of the SG lumen (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Notably, these abnormal luminal shapes were associated with a progressive loss of luminal WGA and Dpy-YFP signals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, D). In <italic>pio</italic> mutants, WGA signals were comparable to WT at stages 13 and 14 (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 6-figure supplement 1A-B</xref>), but appeared slightly reduced and diffuse in the SG lumen at late stage 14, and this reduction became more pronounced at stage 15 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Dpy-YFP signals were more severely affected in <italic>pio</italic> mutants. Unlike the strong, filamentous luminal signals in the control (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A</xref>), Dpy-YFP signals were reduced and diffuse in the SG lumen and were detected in the cytoplasm of <italic>pio</italic> mutant SG cells from stage 12 to stage 14, with a conspicuous absence in the lumen at stage 15 (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 6-figure supplement 1C</xref>). By stage 16, both WGA and Dpy-YFP signals were completely absent from the lumen in <italic>pio</italic> mutants, whereas the signals were still present at the apical membrane and in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B and D</xref>). We conclude that WGA primarily detects Dpy in the SG lumen and that Pio is required for Dpy secretion to the SG lumen.</p>
<p>To test a role for Pio cleavage and localization in shaping the SG lumen, we analyzed embryos mutant for the matriptase Np, which cleaves Pio. In <italic>Np</italic> mutants, Pio and WGA signals were observed in both the apical membrane and lumen up to stage 14, similar to WT embryos (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). However, at stage 16, Pio signals were observed closely associated with the apical membrane, with no luminal Pio signals present (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that Np is required for this luminal pool of Pio. Importantly, <italic>Np</italic> mutants exhibited the same bulging and constricting SG luminal phenotype at stage 16 as <italic>pio</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E and F</xref>), indicating that the filamentous luminal Pio structure plays a crucial role in maintaining a uniform SG diameter.</p>
<p><italic>dpy</italic> mutants (<italic>dpy<sup>ov1</sup></italic>; a spontaneous mutant with a transposable element insertion into intron 11) exhibited a more severe bulging and constriction phenotype in the SG lumen compared to <italic>pio</italic> mutants. Until stage 14, SGs in <italic>dpy</italic> mutants often showed a curved shape, but otherwise had a relatively normal morphology and uniform diameter (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 6-figure supplement 1D</xref>). At stages 15 and 16, SG lumen lost regularity and uniformity, often exhibiting multiple bulges and constrictions. (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G and G</xref>’). In constricting regions, we observed condensed Pio and WGA signals in the lumen, whereas in bulging regions, weak Pio and WGA signals were detected along the apical boundaries (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G and G</xref>’). These data suggest a disrupted luminal scaffold that correlates with the bulging and constricting luminal morphology.</p>
<p>To further investigate the role of Np in cleaving Pio to organize the aECM during SG morphogenesis, we overexpressed WT (Np<sup>WT</sup>) and mutant (Np<sup>mut</sup>) forms of Np using the UAS-Np-Strep and UAS-Np.S990A-GFP lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Drees et al., 2019</xref>). It should be noted that the endogenous Np remains when either form of Np is overexpressed in the SG. Overexpression of Np<sup>WT</sup> increased the intensity of luminal mCh-Pio signals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>), whereas overexpression of Np<sup>mut</sup> resulted in the absence of the mCh-Pio signals in the lumen but strong mCh-Pio signals close to the apical membrane and in the cytoplasmic puncta (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>), supporting the role of Np in cleaving Pio to generate the luminal pool of Pio. In Np<sup>WT</sup>-overexpressing SGs, the overall intensity of Pio and Dpy-YFP signals also appeared increased at both the apical membrane and in the lumen compared to WT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). These embryos did not show obvious changes in the SG morphology. In Np<sup>mut</sup>-overexpressing SGs, Pio signals appeared to be increased at the apical membrane, and various levels of filamentous luminal signals were detected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I-I</xref>’’). Importantly, the regions of the lumen lacking luminal Pio signals was always slightly expanded compared to the region with filamentous luminal Pio signals, supporting the idea that the luminal Pio pool is important for a uniform lumen diameter (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>’ and I’’; n=11/13). Dpy-YFP signals could not be analyzed properly with Np<sup>mut</sup> overexpression because of the GFP tag in the Np<sup>mut</sup> transgene. However, we detected two distinct pools of fluorescent signals in the GFP channel. The first pool was cytoplasmic punctate signals that colocalized with mCh-Pio, which we confirmed are Np<sup>mut</sup>-GFP signals in a separate staining, and the second pool was thin filamentous luminal signals that overlapped with Pio antibody signals, which we suspect are Dpy-YFP signals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>). These data suggest that overexpressed Np<sup>mut</sup> failed to cleave mCh-Pio and Pio, leading to their accumulation at and near the apical membrane, but the endogenous Np still cleaved some pool, resulting in low levels of filamentous luminal Pio structures. Taken together, our data suggest that Dpy and Pio form a luminal scaffold necessary for a uniform SG tube diameter and that Pio cleavage by Np is essential for forming this scaffold.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study highlights the critical role of Papss, a key enzyme that produces the universal sulfate donor PAPS, in aECM organization and lumen expansion in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic SG. <italic>Papss</italic> mutants show defective SG lumen expansion, accompanied by disruption of the apical domain of SG cells and the aECM. The loss of <italic>Papss</italic> leads to defects in Golgi and intracellular trafficking, abnormal cell death in the SG, and defective basal ECM, emphasizing the importance of sulfation in multiple developmental processes. We also identify the ZP domain proteins Dpy and Pio as key components of the SG aECM, where Dpy is a scaffolding aECM structure that provides mechanical support and Pio is required for proper organization of this structure.</p>

<title>Sulfation is critical for aECM organization and SG lumen expansion</title>
<p>During <italic>Drosophila</italic> SG morphogenesis, secreted cargos are modified in the Golgi, secreted apically, and deposited in the lumen to form the aECM meshwork. Our data show that sulfation is essential for the proper organization of the aECM and the formation of a normal SG luminal shape. Consistent with a high demand for sulfation in the SG, transcripts for <italic>Papss</italic> and several other key enzymes involved in sulfation reactions are also upregulated in the SG, including <italic>slalom</italic> (<italic>sll</italic>), which encodes the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PAPS transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kamiyama et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Luders et al., 2003</xref>), and <italic>pipe</italic> (<italic>pip</italic>) and <italic>tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase</italic> (<italic>Tpst</italic>), which encode sulfotransferases. Notably, Alcian Blue-stained materials are absent from the SG in <italic>Papss</italic>, <italic>sll</italic>, or <italic>pip</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhu et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that sulfation in the SG depends entirely on these enzymes. Our data show that the irregularly expanded SG lumen phenotype in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants is associated with the condensed aECM structures and reduced association of the aECM with the apical membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Inappropriate charge balance due to defective sulfation of proteoglycans and glycoproteins, as well as protein misfolding or failure to bind to appropriate partners, may contribute to aggregation of aECM components and condensation of the aECM structure. The ubiquitously expressed human <italic>Papss1</italic> gene shows upregulation in several glandular organs and the salivary duct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Uhlen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Karlsson et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting a potentially conserved role for this enzyme in modifying secreted molecules and modifying aECM in these organs.</p>
<p>The defects in SG lumen expansion in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants are linked to defects in intracellular trafficking, characterized by aberrant Golgi structures and mislocalized or reduced levels of several vesicle markers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). This suggests that the loss of <italic>Papss</italic> has a broader impact on the intracellular trafficking system, beyond the sulfation of specific substrate molecules. Mutants of the key Golgi component Grasp65 show a mildly irregular SG lumen (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 3-figure supplement 3</xref>), supporting the important role of the Golgi in establishing proper lumen dimensions during organ formation. Consistent with the idea that the secretory pathway plays a key role in trafficking aECM components to the lumen, several mutants in intracellular trafficking genes, such as <italic>CrebA</italic>, <italic>Sec61β</italic>, and <italic>Sar1</italic>, which encode a major transcription factor that boosts secretory capacity, a Sec61 translocon component, and a COPII vesicle formation component, respectively, have been shown to have a slightly thinner SG lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fox et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fox &amp; Andrew, 2015</xref>). However, the defects in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants differ from those in general secretion mutants. While the latter exhibit a uniformly thin lumen, altered localization of several subcellular organelles including mitochondria and the ER, and reduced Golgi signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fox &amp; Andrew, 2015</xref>), <italic>Papss</italic> mutants show an irregularly expanded lumen and primarily affect the Golgi, while other organelles remain largely intact (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>). Some of the abnormally modified targets appear to be aggregated in the defective Golgi in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, but many are still transported apically and secreted into the lumen, resulting in a highly condensed luminal aggregate.</p>

<title>The role of ZP domain proteins in non-chitinous aECM in the SG</title>
<p>We are beginning to understand the structural components and biological functions of the non-chitinous aECM during tubular organ formation. For example, in the non-chitinous aECM of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> vulva and excretory duct, distinct aECM components, including zona pellucida (ZP) domain proteins, chondroitin proteoglycans, and glycoproteins, work together to form the lumens of these tubular organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gill et al., 2016</xref>; Cohen, Sparacio, et al., 2020). Our work reveals that two ZP proteins, Dpy and Pio, play essential roles in organizing the aECM in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> SG, highlighting the important role of ZP proteins in forming the non-chitinous luminal matrix during tubular organ formation. Dpy, a gigantic protein (&gt;2 MDa) with hundreds of epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats interspersed with a Dpy module, forms long filamentous structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wilkin et al., 2000</xref>). With these filamentous structures, Dpy plays an essential role in the organization and attachment of apical structures in several tissues, including the thoracic cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wilkin et al., 2000</xref>), embryonic trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jazwinska et al., 2003</xref>), pupal wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bokel et al., 2005</xref>), genitalia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Smith et al., 2020</xref>), and muscle tendon cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chu &amp; Hayashi, 2021</xref>). In the SG, aberrantly formed or lost luminal Dpy structures correlate with abnormal luminal morphology (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="supp1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>). We propose that the Dpy filamentous structure provides mechanical support in the SG aECM and that proper organization of these structures is critical for the formation of a uniform tube diameter. WGA signals always colocalize with Dpy-YFP signals in WT and <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, and both signals are absent from the lumen in <italic>pio</italic> mutants. WGA may primarily detect Dpy in the SG lumen by binding sugar residues that are attached to numerous EGF modules of the Dpy protein. A caveat to the analysis of Dpy using the Dpy-YFP line is that it is a non-functional fusion protein. An antibody against Dpy or a new functional fusion protein will be required to confirm Dpy localization. Even with this caveat, our data with the Pio antibody suggest that Dpy forms the filamentous luminal structure with Pio. Pio is required to secrete and maintain Dpy in the lumen of the SG (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). This is consistent with a role for Pio in Dpy secretion in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Drees et al., 2023</xref>) and suggests a conserved role for Pio in multiple tissues. Since the ZP domains of Pio and Dpy have been shown to bind directly to each other in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Drees et al., 2023</xref>), it is likely that the binding of Pio and Dpy is required for the formation of filamentous luminal structures. This binding may require cleavage of Pio by the matriptase Np, which generates the filamentous luminal pool of Pio (C-terminal ZP fragment of Pio). <italic>pio</italic> and <italic>Np</italic> mutants show similar bulging and constricting SG lumen morphology (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that the generation of the C-terminal ZP fragment of Pio by Np is critical for the formation of the filamentous luminal structure with Dpy.</p>
<p>Papss plays an essential role in the formation of the filamentous Dpy/Pio structure (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). It will be important to learn if the defects of the Pio-Dpy matrix in <italic>Papss</italic> mutants is a direct consequence of the loss of sulfation on these proteins or if it’s an indirect outcome. The ZP domain can mediate homomeric or heteromeric polymerization into filaments, and its structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds formed between conserved Cys residues responsible for the polymerization of ZP modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jovine et al., 2002</xref>). Defective disulfide bond formation due to defective sulfation may destabilize Pio-Dpy interactions. Additionally, hundreds of EGF modules in the Dpy protein are highly susceptible to O-glycosylation. Sulfation of the glycan groups attached to Dpy may be critical for its ability to form a filamentous structure. In the absence of sulfation, the glycan groups on Dpy may not properly interact with the surrounding materials in the lumen, resulting in an aggregated and condensed structure. However, additional key substrate(s) of Papss, such as mucins, may exist in the SG aECM that play a key role in lumen expansion and shape. The striking enrichment of <italic>Papss</italic> expression in the SG compared to other tubular organs, such as the trachea, implies that the key substrate(s) of Papss are likely unique to or more highly enriched in the SG aECM than in the tracheal aECM.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to determine the role of other ZP proteins highly expressed in the SG. Qsm, for example, has been found in the same intracellular vesicles as Dpy in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tendon cells and has been shown to physically interact with Dpy through their ZP domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chu &amp; Hayashi, 2021</xref>). Qsm has been shown to remodel Dpy filaments that link tendon cells to the pupal cuticle, increasing their tensile strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chu &amp; Hayashi, 2021</xref>). In the SG, we find that Qsm is mainly localized to cytoplasmic vesicles and AJ/SJ regions rather than being present in the SG lumen like Pio and Dpy. It should be noted that like Pio, Qsm has a furin cleavage site near the transmembrane domain and another putative protease cleavage site in the ZP domain. Since the mCh-Qsm line contains the mCh insertion near the N-terminal end of the protein, the mCh-Qsm signals are likely those of the cleaved N-terminal fragment after cleavage by these proteases and will need to be confirmed using western blot. Further investigation will be needed to determine the role of Qsm in junctional regions of SG cells. Also, the roles of other SG-upregulated ZP domain proteins remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our analysis of the <italic>Drosophila Papss</italic> gene, a single ortholog of human Papss1 and Papss2, reveals its multiple roles during SG development. We expect that these findings will provide important insights into the function of these enzymes in normal development and disease in humans. Our findings on the key role of two ZP proteins, Pio and Dpy, as major components of the SG aECM also provide valuable information on the organization of the non-chitinous aECM during organ formation.</p>

UFO09742 was generated from the RE15281 cDNA clone encoding the open reading frame (ORF) for the Papss-PD isoform.</p>
<p>UFO09743 was generated using the RE03925 cDNA clone, which encodes the same ORF for the Papss-PE isoform. Each clone contains a C-terminal Flag-HA tag. Purified DNA for the UAS clones (500 ng/µl) was sent to GenetiVision (Houston, TX) for injection. GenetiVision performed PhiC31-mediated insertions using the attP40 site.</p>
<p>UAS-Papss mutant lines for the APS kinase and ATP sulfurylase domains were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the UAS-Papss-PD construct (UAS-Papss-PD<sup>K193A</sup>, UAS-Papss-PD<sup>F593P</sup>, and UAS-Papss-PD<sup>K193A,</sup> <sup>F593P</sup>). K161 and F550 in human Papss (K193 and F593 residues of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Papss-PD<italic>)</italic> were identified as being critical for the catalytic efficiency of the APS kinase and ATP sulfurylase domains, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>), and were mutated to alanine and proline, respectively.

<title>Immunostaining and confocal microscopy</title>
<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos were collected on a grape juice agar plate. All embryos were dechorionated by incubation in 50% bleach for three minutes at room temperature. After dechorionation, embryos were fixed in either saturated heptane or standard formaldehyde fixative (7 ml heptane, 5.6 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O, 700 µl 37% formaldehyde, 700 µl 10x PBS). Saturated heptane was prepared by mixing heptane:37% formaldehyde 1:1 and shaking vigorously. For immunofluorescence staining, embryos were fixed in saturated heptane for forty minutes at room temperature, devitellinized by vortexing in 80% ethanol, and then washed three times in absolute ethanol. For staining using the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) reaction for visualization, embryos were fixed in formaldehyde fixative and devitellinized by vortexing in 100% methanol. Embryos were then stained with primary and secondary antibodies in PBSTB (1X PBS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100). All antibodies used are listed in Table S3. Embryos were then mounted in Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polysciences, Inc). Confocal images were taken using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with 63x, NA 1.4 and 40x, NA 1.3 objectives.

<title>Quantification of SG lumen length and diameter</title>
<p>Confocal images of stage 16 SGs immunolabeled with an antibody for the cell junction marker, E-cad, were used. Several Z-sections, spanning approximately half of the circumferential/radial axis of the SG lumen, were merged to create a projection which covered the entire length of the lumen. The line tool in Fiji was used to measure the length of the SG lumen. To measure the diameter of the SG lumen, the lumen was divided into four equal segments using the lumen length obtained above, as there are sometimes minor variations in width value along the length of the lumen. The line tool in Fiji was then used to measure the width along each quarter of the lumen, and an average value was obtained per SG. Each measurement obtained in Fiji was adjusted for scale according to the image properties in the raw confocal file. Sample numbers are: n=8, WT; n=8, <italic>Papss<sup>2</sup></italic> with a thin lumen; n=10, <italic>Papss<sup>2</sup></italic>with an irregularly expanded lumen; n=8, <italic>Papss<sup>2</sup>/Df</italic> with a thin lumen; n=8, <italic>Papss<sup>2</sup>/Df</italic> with a irregularly expanded lumen; n=10, <italic>sage&gt;Papss-PE</italic> with a normally expanded lumen; n=8, <italic>sage&gt;Papss-PE; Papss<sup>2</sup></italic> with a normally expanded lumen; n=10 <italic>sage&gt;Papss-PD; Papss<sup>2</sup></italic> with a normally expanded lumen; n=11, <italic>sage&gt;Papss-PD<sup>K193A,F593P</sup>; Papss<sup>2</sup></italic> with a thin lumen; n=7, <italic>sage&gt;Papss-PD<sup>K193A,F593P</sup>; Papss<sup>2</sup></italic> with a irregularly expanded lumen.</p>

<title>Quantification of Crb signal intensity</title>
<p>Confocal images of stage 16 SGs immunolabeled with antibodies against the sub-apical region (SAR) marker, Crb, and the AJ marker, Ecad, were used. A maximum intensity projection of the apical region of several SG cells with the highest Ecad and Crb signals was created using seven z-sections. Regions were manually drawn along the inner or outer boundary of the Ecad signals of each cell to mark the SAR and apical-medial regions. The mean gray value of the apical-medial Crb signals in each cell (the region delineated by the inner boundary of the Ecad signals) was quantified using Fiji. The mean gray value of the SAR Crb signals was calculated using the integrated densities and areas calculated with Fiji for regions between inner and outer boundaries. To subtract the background, the average mean gray value of Crb signals for five regions outside the embryo was subtracted from the mean gray values of the SAR and apical-medial Crb signals in each SG cell. The ratio of the SAR to the apical-medial Crb level was compared. Seven and six embryos were used for the WT and <italic>Papss</italic> mutants, respectively, and four to eight cells per SG. SuperPlots were used to address variability in the data sets of each SG. Statistical significance was determined using a Welch’s t-test.</p>

<p>High-resolution confocal images of stage 16 SGs immunostained with CrebA (SG nuclei), Ecad, and WGA were obtained using an Olympus SpinSR10 Sora spinning disk confocal microscope with a 100x, NA 1.5 objective. Each image was taken under identical imaging conditions. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the WGA puncta was obtained using the Imaris software (Andor), and the number of puncta per SG was counted by Imaris. The Imaris machine learning tool was used to exclude non-puncta WGA signals within the SG and non-SG WGA puncta.

Threshold images for Sec15 or Rab11, which display pixels as black or white based on whether they are above a value for signal intensity, were generated in Adobe Photoshop. In addition, Sec15 and Rab11 images were converted using the RGB stack function in Fiji. A stack of images including the threshold and RGB stack converted images for Sec15 or Rab11 and the Ecad images was generated using the images to stack function in Fiji. Using the threshold images for Sec15 and Rab11, a boundary for the apical region encompassing five SG cells, and the mean gray value intensity was calculated from the RGB stack converted Rab11or Sec15 images.

<p>This paper is <bold>important</bold> in demonstrating a requirement for sulfation in organizing apical extracellular matrix (aECM) during tubulogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. The authors identify and characterize the organization of some of the first known components of the non-chitinous aECM in the Drosophila salivary gland tube, and these findings are supported by <bold>convincing</bold> data. This study would be of interest to developmental and cell biologists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>There is growing appreciation for the important of luminal (apical) ECM in tube development, but such matrices are much less well understood than basal ECMs. Here the authors provide insights into the aECM that shapes the Drosophila salivary gland (SG) tube and the importance of PAPSS-dependent sulfation in its organization and function.</p>
<p>The first part of the paper focuses on careful phenotypic characterization of papss mutants, using multiple markers and TEM. This revealed reduced markers of sulfation and defects in both apical and basal ECM organization, Golgi (but not ER) morphology, number and localization of other endosomal compartments, plus increased cell death. The authors focus on the fact that papss mutants have an irregular SG lumen diameter, with both narrowed regions and bulged regions. They address the pleiotropy, showing that preventing the cell death and resultant gaps in the tube did not rescue the SG luminal shape defects and discussing similarities and differences between the papss mutant phenotype and those caused by more general trafficking defects. The analysis uses a papss nonsense mutant from an EMS screen - I appreciate the rigorous approach the authors took to analyze transheterozygotes (as well as homozygotes) plus rescued animals in order to rule out effects of linked mutations. Importantly, the rescue experiments also demonstrated that sulfation enzymatic activity is important.</p>
<p>The 2nd part of the paper focuses on the SG aECM, showing that Dpy and Pio ZP protein fusions localize abnormally in papss mutants and that these ZP mutants (and Np protease mutants) have similar SG lumen shaping defects to the papss mutants. A key conclusion is that SG lumen defects correlate with loss of a Pio+Dpy-dependent filamentous structure in the lumen. These data suggest that ZP protein misregulation could explain this part of the papss phenotype.</p>
<p>Overall, the text is very well written and clear. Figures are clearly labeled. The methods involve rigorous genetic approaches, microscopy, and quantifications/statistics and are documented appropriately. The findings are convincing.</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>This study will be of interest to researchers studying developmental morphogenesis in general and specifically tube biology or the aECM. It should be particularly of interest to those studying sulfation or ZP proteins (which are broadly present in aECMs across organisms, including humans).</p>
<p>This study adds to the literature demonstrating the importance of luminal matrix in shaping tubular organs and greatly advances understanding of the luminal matrix in the Drosophila salivary gland, an important model of tubular organ development and one that has key matrix differences (such as no chitin) compared to other highly studied Drosophila tubes like the trachea.</p>
<p>The detailed description of the defects resulting from papss loss suggests that there are multiple different sulfated targets, with a subset specifically relevant to aECM biology. A limitation is that specific sulfated substrates are not identified here (e.g. are these the ZP proteins themselves or other matrix glycoproteins or lipids?); therefore, it's not clear how direct or indirect the effects of papss are on ZP proteins. However, this is clearly a direction for future work and does not detract from the excellent beginning made here.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>This study provides new insights into organ morphogenesis using the Drosophila salivary gland (SG) as a model. The authors identify a requirement for sulfation in regulating lumen expansion, which correlates with several effects at the cellular level, including regulation of intracellular trafficking and the organization of Golgi, the aECM and the apical membrane. In addition, the authors show that the ZP proteins Dumpy (Dpy) and Pio form an aECM regulating lumen expansion. Previous reports already pointed to a role for Papss in sulfation in SG and the presence of Dpy and Pio in the SG. Now this work extends these previous analyses and provides more detailed descriptions that may be relevant to the fields of morphogenesis and cell biology (with particular focus on ECM research and tubulogenesis). This study nicely presents valuable information regarding the requirements of sulfation and the aECM in SG development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The results supporting a role for sulfation in SG development are strong. In addition, the results supporting the involvement of Dpy and Pio in the aECM of the SG, their role in lumen expansion, and their interactions, are also strong.</p>
<p>- The authors have made an excellent job in revising and clarifying the many different issues raised by the reviewers, particularly with the addition of new experiments and quantifications. I consider that the manuscript has improved considerably.</p>
<p>- The authors generated a catalytically inactive Papss enzyme, which is not able to rescue the defects in Papss mutants, in contrast to wild type Papss. This result clearly indicates that the sulfation activity of Papss is required for SG development.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>This study provides new insights into organ morphogenesis using the Drosophila salivary gland (SG) as a model. The authors identify a requirement for sulfation in regulating lumen expansion, which correlates with several effects at the cellular level, including regulation of intracellular trafficking and the organization of Golgi, the aECM and the apical membrane. In addition, the authors show that the ZP proteins Dumpy (Dpy) and Pio form an aECM regulating lumen expansion. Previous reports already pointed to a role for Papss in sulfation in SG and the presence of Dpy and Pio in the SG. Now this work extends these previous analyses and provides more detailed descriptions that may be relevant to the fields of morphogenesis and cell biology (with particular focus on ECM research and tubulogenesis). This study nicely presents valuable information regarding the requirements of sulfation and the aECM in SG development.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>-The results supporting a role for sulfation in SG development are strong. In addition, the results supporting the involvement of Dpy and Pio in the aECM of the SG, their role in lumen expansion, and their interactions, are also strong.</p>
<p>-The authors have made an excellent job in revising and clarifying the many different issues raised by the reviewers, particularly with the addition of new experiments and quantifications. I consider that the manuscript has improved considerably.</p>
<p>-The authors generated a catalytically inactive Papss enzyme, which is not able to rescue the defects in Papss mutants, in contrast to wild type Papss. This result clearly indicates that the sulfation activity of Papss is required for SG development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>-The main concern is the lack of clear connection between sulfation and the phenotypes observed at the cellular level, and, importantly, the lack of connection between sulfation and the Pio-Dpy matrix. Indeed, the mechanism/s by which sulfation affects lumen expansion are not elucidated and no targets of this modification are identified or investigated. A direct (or instructive) role for sulfation in aECM organization is not clearly supported by the results, and the connection between sulfation and Pio/Dpy roles seems correlative rather than causative. As it is presented, the mechanisms by which sulfation regulates SG lumen expansion remains elusive in this study.</p>
<p>-In my opinion the authors overestimate their findings with several conclusions, as exemplified in the abstract:</p>
<p>&quot;In the absence of Papss, Pio is gradually lost in the aECM, while the Dpy-positive aECM structure is condensed and dissociates from the apical membrane, leading to a thin lumen. Mutations in dpy or pio, or in Notopleural, which encodes a matriptase that cleaves Pio to form the luminal Pio pool, result in a SG lumen with alternating bulges and constrictions, with the loss of pio leading to the loss of Dpy in the lumen. Our findings underscore the essential role of sulfation in organizing the aECM during tubular organ formation and highlight the mechanical support provided by ZP domain proteins in maintaining luminal diameter.&quot;</p>
<p>The findings leading to conclude that sulfation organizes the aECM and that the absence of Papss leads to a thin lumen due to defects in Dpy/Pio are not strong. The authors certainly show that Papss is required for proper Pio and Dpy accumulation. They also show that Pio is required for Dpy accumulation, and that Pio and Dpy form an aECM required for lumen expansion. However, the absence of Pio and Dpy do not fully recapitulate Papss mutant defects (thin lumen). I wonder whether other hypothesis and models could account for the observed results. For instance, a role for Papss affecting secretion, in which case sulfation would have an indirect role in aECM organization. This study does not address the mechanical properties of Dpy in normal and mutant salivary glands.</p>
<p>-Minor issues relate to the genotype/phenotype analysis. It is surprising that the authors detect only mild effects on sulfation in Papss mutants using an anti-sulfoTyr antibody, as Papss is the only Papss synthathase. Generating germ line clones (which is a feasible experiment) would have helped to prove that this minor effect is due to the contribution of maternal product. The loss of function allele used in this study seems problematic, as it produces effects in heterozygous conditions difficult to interpret. Cleaning the chromosome or using an alternative loss of function condition (another allele, RNAi, etc...) would have helped to present a more reliable explanation.</p>

<p>Overall, I am pleased with the authors' revisions in response to my original comments and those of the other reviewers. The addition of the sulfation(-) mutant to Fig. 1 is particularly nice. I have just a few additional suggestions for text changes to improve clarity/precision.</p>
<p>(1) The current title of this manuscript is quite broad, making it sound like a review article. I recommend adding sulfation and salivary gland to the title to convey the main points more clearly. e.g. Sulfation affects apical extracellular matrix organization during development of the Drosophila salivary gland tube.</p>

<p>Thank you for the suggestion. We agree and have changed the title of the paper as suggested.</p>

<p>(2) Figure 1B shows very striking enrichment of papss expression in the salivary gland compared to other tubes like the trachea that also contain Pio and Dpy. To me, this implies that the key substrate(s) of Papss are likely to be unique, or at least more highly enriched, in the salivary gland aECM compared to the tracheal aECM (e.g. probably not Pio or Dpy themselves). I suggest that the authors address the implications of this apparent SG specificity in the discussion (paragraph beginning on p. 21, line 559).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we agree that there may be other key substrates of Papss in the SG, such as mucins, which play an important role in organizing the aECM and expanding the lumen. We have included a discussion.</p>

<p>(3) p. 15, lines 374-376 &quot;The Pio protein is known to be cleaved, at one cleavage site after the ZP domain by the furin protease and at another cleavage site within the ZP domain by the matriptase Notopleural (Np) (Drees et al., 2019; Drees et al., 2023; Figure 5B).&quot; As far as I can see, the Drees papers show that Pio is cleaved somewhere in the vicinity of a consensus furin cleavage site, but do not actually establish that the cleavage happens at this exact site or is done by a furin protease (this is just an assumption). Please word more carefully, e.g. &quot;at one cleavage site after the ZP domain, possibly by a furin protease&quot;.</p>

<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have edited the text.</p>

<p>Throughout the paper, I find a bit confusing the description of the lumen phenotype and their interpretations.</p>
<p>Papss mutants produce SG that are either &quot;thin&quot; or show &quot;irregular lumen with bulges&quot;. Do the authors think that these are two different manifestations of the same effect? or do they think that there are different causes behind?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The thin lumen phenotype appears to occur when the Pio-Dpy matrix is significantly condensed. When this matrix is less condensed in one region of the lumen than in other regions, the lumen appears irregular with bulges.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Are the defects in Grasp65 mutants categorized as &quot;irregular lumen with bulges&quot; similar to those in Papss mutants? Why do these mutants don't show a &quot;thin lumen&quot; defect?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Grasp65 mutant phenotypes are milder than those of Papss mutants. Multiple mutations in several Golgi components that more significantly disrupt Golgi structures and function may cause more severe defects in lumen expansion and shape.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>How the defects described for Pio (&quot;multiple constrictions with a slight expansion between constrictions&quot;) and Dpy mutants (&quot;lumen with multiple bulges and constrictions&quot;) relate to the &quot;irregular lumen with bulges&quot; in Papss mutants?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>pio and dpy mutants show more stereotypical phenotypes, while Papss mutants exhibit more irregular and random phenotypes. The irregular lumen phenotypes in Papss mutants are associated with a condensed Pio-Dpy matrix.</p>
