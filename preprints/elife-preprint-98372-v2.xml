<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins are frequently overexpressed in various cancers, playing a pivotal role in cancer initiation and progression, as well as intrinsic or acquired resistance to therapy. Although inhibitors targeting BCL-2, such as Venetoclax, have shown efficacy in hematological malignancies, their therapeutic potential in solid tumors remains limited. Identifying novel molecular targets to overcome resistance to these inhibitors is of significant clinical importance. Here, we provide evidence of a strong synthetic lethality between WSB2, a previously underexplored substrate-binding receptor of the Cullin 5-RBX2-Elongin B/C (CRL5) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. Mechanistically, WSB assembles a CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that facilitates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of NOXA, a pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein. Loss of WSB2 leads to a substantial accumulation of NOXA in both cultured cell lines and knockout mouse tissues. While WSB2 deficiency alone does not significantly impact spontaneous apoptosis, it sensitizes cells to apoptosis when anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins are either genetically depleted or pharmacologically inhibited. Moreover, WSB2 is overexpressed in several human cancer types. These findings identify WSB2 as a critical regulator of mitochondrial apoptosis and reveal the dysregulation of the WSB2-NOXA axis as a key factor contributing to apoptosis resistance in cancer cells. Targeting both WSB2 and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins holds promising therapeutic potential for overcoming resistance in human cancers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the defining hallmarks of human cancers is their ability to evade apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. This evasion not only drives tumor initiation and progression but also underlies resistance to many cancer therapies. Most anticancer treatments—including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy—rely on the activation of apoptotic pathways in cancer cells to achieve their therapeutic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Apoptosis is predominantly regulated at the mitochondrial level by the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family of proteins, which are classified into anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic subgroups. Anti-apoptotic members such as BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-W, and MCL-1 contain one to four BH domains and preserve mitochondrial outer membrane integrity by neutralizing pro-apoptotic counterparts. In contrast, pro-apoptotic proteins include multidomain effectors (e.g., BAX, BAK, and BOK) and “BH3-only” proteins (e.g., NOXA, BIM, PUMA, and BAD), which respond to cellular stress by triggering mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, leading to apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Tumors frequently develop resistance to apoptosis by upregulating anti-apoptotic proteins or suppressing pro-apoptotic counterparts, emphasizing the need for therapeutic strategies that can restore this critical balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Small-molecule BH3 mimetics have emerged as a promising class of drugs that specifically inhibit anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins. Venetoclax (ABT-199), a BCL-2-specific inhibitor, has achieved clinical approval for treating BCL-2-dependent hematological malignancies, such as small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, Venetoclax demonstrates enhanced efficacy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) when combined with other therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. However, its application in solid tumors remains limited, potentially due to the lower dependency of solid tumors on BCL-2 for survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Identifying alternative molecular targets to sensitize solid tumors to BCL-2 inhibitors represents a critical unmet need.</p>
<p>Cullin 5 (CUL5), a member of the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase family, plays a pivotal role in protein turnover by assembling with RBX2, Elongin B/C, and a SOCS box-containing substrate-binding receptor to form the CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Among these, WD repeat and SOCS box-containing protein 2 (WSB2) has been identified as a substrate receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. WSB2 is frequently overexpressed in cancers such as lung, breast, and melanoma, where it promotes malignancy by driving cell proliferation, cycle progression, and migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Despite its oncogenic potential, the lack of identified physiological substrates for the CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> complex has limited its exploration as a therapeutic target.</p>
<p>Using data from the DepMap Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org/">https://depmap.org/</ext-link>), we uncovered a functional interplay between WSB2 and BCL-2 family proteins. Biochemical analyses revealed that WSB2 facilitates the degradation of NOXA, a pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein, through assembling the CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Through a combination of cell line studies, xenograft tumor models, and knockout mice experiments, we investigated the biological significance and therapeutic potential of targeting WSB2. Our findings suggest that disrupting the WSB2-NOXA axis could synergize with BCL-2 inhibitors to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, offering a novel strategy for combating apoptosis resistance in human cancers.</p>

<title>Multiple BCL-2 family proteins identified as interactors of WSB2</title>
<p>WSB2 has been identified as a substrate receptor of the CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex; however, its physiological roles in specific cellular processes remain largely unknown. Interestingly, several genome-wide RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 screening studies have revealed strong synthetic interactions between WSB2 and key regulators of mitochondrial apoptosis, including MCL-1, BCL-xL, and MARCH5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. To elucidate the potential molecular functions of WSB2, we analyzed the genetic co-dependency between WSB2 and other proteins using Broad’s 21Q2 DepMap dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. This dataset, derived from large-scale loss-of-function sgRNA screens for vulnerabilities in 990 cancer cell lines, allows the identification of genes with similar functions or pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Gene ontology analysis of the top 100 WSB2 co-dependent genes revealed significant enrichment in apoptosis-related processes (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table. S1, 2</xref>). Among the most correlated genes, WSB2 displayed a positive association with anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2L2 (BCL-W) and MCL-1, while negatively correlating with pro-apoptotic proteins BAX and PMAIP1 (NOXA) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, WSB2, along with key BCL-2 family members (BCL-2, BCL-W, BAX, MCL-1, NOXA, and BAK1), constituted a co-essential module that also included UBE2J2/MARCH5, an E2-E3 ligase complex known to regulate MCL-1/NOXA turnover (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Using the DepLink web server<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> to analyze genetic and pharmacological perturbations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, we observed that <italic>WSB2</italic> knockout exhibited the highest correlations with the BH3 mimetics ABT-737 and ABT-263 among hundreds of drugs tested (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S3</xref>). These molecular links prompted us to investigate whether WSB2 has any impact on mitochondrial apoptosis through the regulation of BCL-2 family proteins. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the interaction between WSB2 and BCL-2 family proteins. Exogenous co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays revealed that WSB2 interacted with MCL-1, NOXA, BAD, BCL-XL, and BCL-2 but not with BAX, BCL-W, or BAK (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). These interactions were further confirmed through semi-endogenous and endogenous Co-IP assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D, F-J</xref>). In contrast, WSB1, a closely related paralog of WSB2, did not interact with BCL-2 family proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>Since BCL-2 family proteins reside on the outer mitochondrial membrane, we sought to determine the subcellular distribution of WSB2. Immunofluorescence (IF) analysis demonstrated that WSB2 is predominantly cytoplasmic, with partial colocalization with the mitochondrial marker HSP60 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>). Subcellular fractionation of HeLa cells further confirmed that WSB2 is primarily cytoplasmic, with a moderate mitochondrial presence and negligible nuclear localization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L</xref>). To determine its submitochondrial localization, we purified mitochondria and performed Protease K digestion under different mitochondrial preparations. Cleavage by Protease K only occurred in intact mitochondria and targeted outer membrane proteins exposed to the cytosol, such as TOM70. Swelling the mitochondria with a hypotonic buffer disrupted the outer mitochondrial membrane but left the inner membrane intact, resulting in the cleavage of intermembrane space proteins like SMAC. Lysis with Triton X-100 caused the cleavage of all mitochondrial proteins including matrix proteins like HSP60. Similar to TOM70, WSB2 was cleaved by Protease K digestion in intact mitochondria preparation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1M</xref>). Cleavage patterns confirmed that WSB2 is exposed on the cytosolic side of the mitochondrial outer membrane.</p>
<p>Collectively, these data indicate that a proportion of WSB2 is located on the mitochondrial outer membrane, selectively interacting with certain members of the BCL-2 protein family.</p>

<title>The CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex mediates the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of NOXA</title>
<p>WSB2 was co-purified with CRL5 complex components (RBX2, CUL5, ELOB, and ELOC), confirming its role as a potential CRL5 adaptor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). To investigate whether WSB2 regulates the stability of BCL-2 family proteins, we analyzed protein levels following WSB2 overexpression or depletion.

<p>We further demonstrated that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 completely reversed the reduction in NOXA protein levels caused by WSB2 overexpression. In contrast, overexpression of WSB1 had no effect on NOXA levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). WSB2 contains a C-terminal SOCS box, comprising a BC box and a Cullin 5 (CUL5) box, which are essential for interacting with Elongin B/C and CUL5, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Deletion of either domain (BC box or CUL5 box) abolished WSB2’s ability to decrease NOXA protein levels, as confirmed by experiments using WSB2 mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Reintroduction of these mutants into <italic>WSB2</italic> KO C4-2 cells failed to reverse the accumulation of NOXA, further confirming the functional importance of these domains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Consistently, depletion of CRL5 complex components (RBX2, CUL5, ELOB, or ELOC) through siRNAs in C4-2B or Huh-7 cells also resulted in a significant increase in NOXA protein levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, NOXA co-immunoprecipitated with all subunits of the CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> complex (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig"> Figure 2 — figure supplement 1D </xref>). Cycloheximide chase assays revealed that <italic>WSB2</italic> KO cells exhibited an extended half-life for NOXA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H, I</xref>). Additionally, the mRNA levels of NOXA were even reduced in <italic>WSB2</italic> KO cells compared to control cells, likely to counteract the accumulation of NOXA protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). This suggests that the accumulation of NOXA in <italic>WSB2</italic> KO cells is primarily due to impaired protein degradation. A previous study showed that UBE2F promotes the survival of lung cancer cells by activating CRL5 to degrade NOXA via the K11 Linkage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. By employing linkage-specific K11/K48/K63-Ub mutants, we observed that WSB2-mediated ubiquitination of NOXA likely involves all the tested ubiquitin linkage types (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Conversely, <italic>WSB2</italic> KO cells showed reduced levels of ubiquitinated NOXA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2N</xref>), further confirming that WSB2 is essential for NOXA turnover.</p>
<p>Collectively, these data indicate that the CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> complex mediates the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of NOXA.</p>

<title>The C-terminal region of NOXA is crucial for WSB2-mediated NOXA degradation</title>
<p>In addition to its BC and CUL5 boxes, WSB2 also contains five WD repeats, which typically function as modules facilitating protein-protein interactions.

<p>Reciprocally, we sought to determine the region in NOXA that is required for its interaction with WSB2. By generating a series of NOXA deletion mutants and conducting Co-IP assays, we identified the C-terminal region (40–54 aa), which contains the mitochondrial-targeting domain (MTD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, as the critical binding site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-G</xref>). Mutation of key residues within this domain (5A mutant) abolished the interaction between NOXA and WSB2, whereas mutations in the BH3 domain (3E mutant) did not affect their interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig"> Figure 3 — figure supplement 1B </xref>). Furthermore, the NOXA-5A mutant was resistant to WSB2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I, J</xref>), resulting in an extended protein half-life compared to NOXA-WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K, L</xref>). NOXA contains three lysine residues that can be attached by ubiquitin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. By simultaneously mutating these lysine residues to arginine, we found that WSB2-mediated NOXA ubiquitination was completely abolished, although this mutant (KR) exhibits a comparable WSB2-binding capacity to NOXA-WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H, J</xref>). Additional <italic>in vivo</italic> ubiquitination assays revealed that lysine 48 is the primary residue mediating WSB2-dependent ubiquitination of NOXA (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig"> Figure 3 — figure supplement 1C </xref>). These results indicate that the C-terminal region of NOXA, particularly its mitochondrial-targeting domain and lysine 48, is essential for its recognition and ubiquitination by WSB2.</p>
<p>To explore the therapeutic potential of disrupting the WSB2-NOXA interaction, we synthesized a peptide derived from the C-terminal region of NOXA (40-54 aa). This peptide competitively inhibited the interaction between WSB2 and NOXA in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M</xref>). Based on this, we hypothesized that transduction of the C-terminal NOXA peptide into cells could competitively inhibit WSB2-mediated NOXA degradation. To efficiently deliver this peptide into cells, we synthesized a fusion peptide in which the C-terminal peptide was connected to the cell-penetrating poly-arginine (R8) sequence. Treatment of cells with this fusion peptide reduced endogenous WSB2-NOXA interaction (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig"> Figure 3 — figure supplement 1D </xref>), dose-dependently increased endogenous NOXA protein levels, and prolonged endogenous NOXA turnover (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3N</xref>, <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig"> Figure 3 — figure supplement 1E, F </xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these data indicate that the C-terminal region of NOXA is indispensable for its interaction with WSB2 and subsequent ubiquitination.</p>

<title>Co-inhibition of WSB2 and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins causes synthetic lethality via apoptotic cell death</title>
<p>Despite the significant accumulation of NOXA in WSB2-deficient cells, we did not observe obvious spontaneous apoptosis under standard cell culture conditions. This suggests that NOXA upregulation alone is insufficient to trigger spontaneous apoptosis.</p>
<p>Consequently, we hypothesized that simultaneous depletion of an anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein might synergize with WSB2 deficiency to induce apoptosis. To test this, we established stable cell lines with BCL-XL or MCL-1 knockdown via shRNAs, followed by further depletion of WSB2 using siRNA. Remarkably, co-depletion of BCL-XL and WSB2 or MCL-1 and WSB2 resulted in robust apoptosis, as evidenced by increased caspase cleavage in Western blot (WB) analyses and a significant rise in apoptotic marker detected by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-D</xref>). The E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH5 co-exists with WSB2 in a functional module (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), and previous studies have shown that depletion of MARCH5 sensitizes cells to MCL-1 inhibitors or BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.

<p>Next, we used pharmacological inhibitors targeting anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins to assess their efficacy in WSB2-deficient cells. In parental C4-2B and Huh-7 cells, treatment with either ABT-737 (an inhibitor of BCL-2/BCL-XL) or AZD5991 (an inhibitor of MCL-1) resulted in only modest apoptosis induction. However, in WSB2-deficient cells, these drugs caused substantial apoptosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G-J</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig"> Figure 4 — figure supplement 1A-D </xref>).

<p>We further explored whether NOXA upregulation could enhance sensitivity to BCL-2 inhibitors in cancer cells. Huh-7 cells treated with a cell-penetrating peptide derived from the C-terminal region of NOXA exhibited significantly increased sensitivity to ABT-737 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G, H</xref>). This effect was dose-dependent, with higher concentrations of the peptide correlating with greater accumulation of NOXA protein and higher levels of apoptosis. Importantly, the control peptide had no such effect. To validate these findings <italic>in vivo</italic>, we conducted xenograft tumor assays. Huh-7 tumors treated with either ABT-737 or the C-terminal NOXA peptide showed moderate reductions in tumor growth.

<p>To investigate the physiological role of WSB2 in apoptosis in apoptosis <italic>in vivo</italic>, we established a Wsb2 knockout mouse model (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig"> Figure 6 — figure supplement 1A </xref>). Homozygous <italic>Wsb2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were observed to be born at Mendelian ratios and exhibited a normal lifespan with no apparent morphological or behavioral abnormalities (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig"> Figure 6 — figure supplement 1B, C </xref>). Although some <italic>Wsb2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed reduced body size after birth, their adult size generally matched that of wild-type mice. At week 4, we collected multiple mouse tissues, including heart, liver, lung, kidney, and brain. WB analyses demonstrated varying degrees of upregulation in NOXA proteins in the tissues from <italic>Wsb2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to WT littermates. A strong upregulation of NOXA proteins were observed in the liver and heart tissues from <italic>Wsb2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, but not in lung, kidney, and brain tissues, indicating WSB2 modulate NOXA protein levels in a tissue-specific manner. However, the protein levels of caspase 3, 7, and 9 in these tissues were comparable between <italic>Wsb2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and WT littermates (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig"> Figure 6 — figure supplement 1D </xref>). IF and WB analyses of heart and liver tissues revealed that cleaved caspases were nearly undetectable in both <italic>Wsb2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and WT littermates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-E</xref>). Consistent with the results from <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture, Wsb2 ablation alone was insufficient to induce significant apoptosis in mouse organs.</p>

<p>To evaluate whether pharmacological inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins could trigger significant apoptosis in the organs from <italic>Wsb2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, we administered the BCL-2-specific inhibitor ABT-199 (Venetoclax) by oral gavage for seven days. In the liver and heart tissues of ABT-199-treated <italic>Wsb2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, we detected pronounced apoptosis, as evidenced by increased levels of cleaved caspases, cleaved PARP1, and TUNEL-positive cells, which were absent in WT littermates under the same treatment conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-E</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig"> Figure 6 — figure supplement 2A-I </xref>). These findings were corroborated by <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, where primary hepatocytes isolated from <italic>Wsb2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited significantly greater susceptibility to ABT-199-induced apoptosis compared to wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess whether the cardiac injury was caused by ABT-199 treatment, we measured the levels of several cardiac enzyme markers, including CK (creatine kinase), CK-MB (creatine kinase isoenzyme MB), α-HBDH (α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase), and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) in serum. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>, ABT-199 administration led to a significant elevation in the levels of these cardiac enzymes in <italic>Wsb2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, whereas no such effect was observed in WT littermates. These results suggest that co-inhibition of WSB2 and BCL-2 exacerbates apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, leading to tissue injury. To investigate whether the anti-apoptotic function of WSB2 is primarily reliant on mouse NOXA, we isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). NOXA protein levels were markedly upregulated in <italic>Wsb2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> MEFs compared to wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). Moreover, reducing the expression of NOXA through shRNA-mediated knockdown in <italic>Wsb2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> MEFs largely reversed the substantial apoptosis induced by ABT-199 treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these data indicate that WSB2-mediated NOXA destabilization is evolutionally conserved and this regulatory axis is critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis.</p>

<title>WSB2 is overexpressed in several human cancer types</title>
<p>To explore the clinical relevance of WSB2, we analyzed its expression across various human cancer types using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Remarkably, WSB2 mRNA levels were significantly elevated in multiple cancers, including prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), compared to corresponding normal tissues (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). In PRAD, higher WSB2 expression positively correlated with key clinical parameters such as Gleason score (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>), pathological stage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>), clinical stage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>), and nodal metastasis status (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The WSB2 protein has been identified in several large-scale proteome mapping analyses as being co-purified from the CUL5 scaffold complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. With the presence of a SOCS box in its protein sequence, WSB2 is believed to serve as a receptor for substrates, assisting in their recognition by the CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Its close paralog, WSB1, is induced by hypoxia and can form a CRL5<sup>WSB1</sup> complex that promotes cancer metastasis by inducing VHL degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Additionally, the CRL5<sup>WSB1</sup> complex overcomes oncogene-induced senescence by targeting ATM for degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. However, the physiological substrates of the CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> complex remain poorly understood. Nevertheless, prior to our current study, there are several pieces of evidence suggesting that this complex may play a role in regulating cell death, possibly involving BCL-2 family proteins. In a large-scale RNAi screening aimed at understanding cancer dependencies and synthetic lethal relationships, the top correlates of WSB2 co-essentiality were found to be MCL-1, BCL-2, and MARCH5, while the most strongly anti-correlated gene with WSB2 was BAX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Two CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens also showed strong synthetic relationships between WSB2 and MCL-1, BCL-2, or MARCH5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. A comprehensive phenotypic CRISPR/Cas9 screen of the ubiquitin pathway revealed that knockout of CUL5, RBX2, or WSB2 resulted in cells becoming hypersensitive to the CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a genome-wide CRISPR inhibition (CRISPRi) screen conducted in lung cancer cells demonstrated that knockout of CUL5, RBX2, or UBE2F (a specific E2 for CRL5 E3s) caused cells to become hypersensitive to a CDK9 inhibitor or MCL-1 inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. By connecting the dots from these studies, our findings provide a comprehensive scenario. We have shown that WSB2 assembles an active CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> complex, which mediates the ubiquitination and proteasomal turnover of NOXA, maintaining its low-level expression under basal conditions. WSB2 deficiency leads to a remarkable accumulation of NOXA, but it alone is not sufficient to trigger spontaneous apoptosis. This is consistent with previous studies showing that enforced expression of NOXA alone is ineffective at triggering apoptosis in various cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Striking when combined with genetic or pharmacological inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, massive apoptosis occurs in WSB2-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). However, it is important to note that knockdown of NOXA expression in WSB2-deficient cells largely, but not completely, reverses the massive apoptosis induced by BCL-2 family protein inhibitors, implying that WSB2 may also modulate apoptosis through other unidentified targets. Indeed, WSB2 interacts with multiple BCL-2 family proteins (MCL-1, BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BAD) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-J</xref>). Although WSB2 does not alter their turnover, it is still possible that WSB2 modulates the apoptotic function of these proteins through direct binding. Further investigation is warranted to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying WSB2-mediated anti-apoptotic function. Lastly, it would also be interesting to explore whether there are any upstream signals capable of overriding WSB2-mediated NOXA destabilization under specific stress conditions.</p>

<p>In the current study, our focus was primarily on investigating the <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-apoptotic function of WSB2. Thus, we did not extensively characterize the potential morphological and behavioral abnormalities in <italic>Wsb2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. However, recent large-scale mouse phenotype analyses conducted by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) have reported abnormalities in tooth morphology, locomotor activity, retina, heart, osmotic and electrolyte balance, as well as male infertility in Wsb2<sup>-/-</sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. It remains unclear whether these abnormalities are a result of NOXA accumulation and subsequent dysregulated apoptosis. Generating Wsb2/NOXA double knockout mice would be beneficial in determining whether these abnormalities can be reversed by further ablating NOXA expression. Despite the fact that WSB2 is upregulated in various types of cancer and exhibits a strong anti-apoptotic function, which makes it a promising target for cancer therapy, it is crucial to comprehensively understand the downstream substrates regulated by the CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> E3 ligase complex. This insight will help us better evaluate the potential consequences of pharmacologically inhibiting WSB2, considering that such inhibition could disrupt the regulation of additional substrates, potentially resulting in unwanted side effects.</p>
<p>Since its initial discovery as a novel phorbol-12-myristate13-acetate (PMA) responsive gene in T cells, and subsequently as a transcriptional target of the genotoxic response regulator p53, NOXA has emerged as a critical player in regulating cell death pathways in various cell types under stressed conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Notably, NOXA is implicated in fine-tuning apoptosis induction in cancer cells treated with genotoxic anticancer drugs, including paclitaxel (a microtubule targeting agent), bortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor), and MLN4924 (a CRL E3 ligase inhibitor)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. These different agents engage distinct mechanisms, such as transcriptional activation or protein stabilization, to upregulate NOXA protein levels and initiate apoptotic cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. The half-life of NOXA protein was very short, as it undergoes ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation mediated by the addition of ubiquitin to specific lysine residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. In mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines, despite high NOXA transcript levels, low NOXA protein expression is observed due to rapid protein degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Similarly, paradoxical downregulation of NOXA protein is observed in Cushing’s disease (CD) adenomas, despite transcriptional upregulation caused by recurrent promoter hypomethylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that certain tumor cells may exploit pathways to accelerate NOXA degradation, thus suppressing apoptosis. The elevated NOXA mRNA levels observed in tumor cells may potentially serve as a compensatory mechanism to counteract the reduction in NOXA protein levels. Previous studies have only partially characterized the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of NOXA, showing that UBE2F, in conjunction with RBX2, induces CUL5 neddylation, leading to CRL5 E3 activation and subsequent NOXA degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. In lung cancer tissues, high levels of UBE2F and CUL5 correlate with reduced NOXA levels and poorer survival in patients. However, the specific CRL5 substrate receptor responsible for NOXA destabilization has yet to be identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In our study, we identified WSB2 as the substrate receptor for NOXA, thereby shedding light on its role in regulating NOXA turnover. Further investigation is needed to determine whether WSB2 dysregulation is responsible for the accelerated protein turnover observed in various cancer types, such as MCL and CD adenomas. It should also be noted that WSB2 only facilitates NOXA destabilization in certain tissues/organs, such as heart, and liver, in mouse models. It is not surprising that a specific substrate can be targeted by multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases. A previous study has indicated that treatment with a proteasome inhibitor could further increase NOXA protein levels in CUL5 knockout cells, suggesting that the turnover of NOXA can be regulated by additional ubiquitin ligases apart from the CRL5 E3s <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. In fact, the RING domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligases MARCH5 have been reported to mediate NOXA degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Further investigation is needed to determine which E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) play the predominant roles in specific tissues/organs or types of cancer.</p>
<p>Although bortezomib and MLN4924 have proven effective in stabilizing the NOXA protein and promoting NOXA-dependent apoptosis, their broad inhibition of the proteasome or all CRL E3 ligases, respectively, inevitably leads to side effects. In this study, we have conducted preliminary investigations on the use of a competitive peptide to effectively inhibit the binding of WSB2 and NOXA, resulting in the accumulation of NOXA proteins and increased sensitivity to ABT-737. In the future, other potential therapeutic strategies can be explored, such as designing PROTAC molecules specifically for degrading WSB2 or developing small molecules to disrupt the interaction between WSB2 and NOXA. Extensive research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of these approaches in preclinical cancer models.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Jiao D et al reported the induction of synthetic lethality by combined inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins and WSB2, a substrate receptor in CRL5 ubiquitin ligase complex. Mechanistically, WSB2 interacts with NOXA to promote its ubiquitylation and degradation. Cancer cells deficient in WSB2, as well as heart and liver tissues from Wsb2-/- mice exhibit high susceptibility to apoptosis induced by inhibitors of BCL-2 family proteins. The anti-apoptotic activity of WSB2 is partially dependent on NOXA.</p>
<p>Overall, the finding that WSB2 disruption triggers synthetic lethality to BCL-2 family protein inhibitors by destabilizing NOXA is rather novel. The manuscript is largely hypothesis-driven, with experiments that are adequately designed and executed. However, there are quite a few issues for the authors to address, including those listed below.</p>
<p>Specific comments from the previous round of review:</p>
<p>(1) At the beginning of the Results section, a clear statement is needed as to why the authors are interested in WSB2 and what brought them to analyze &quot;the genetic co-dependency between WSB2 and other proteins&quot;.</p>
<p>(2) In general, the biochemical evidence supporting the role of WSB2 as a SOCS box-containing substrate-binding receptor of CRL5 E3 in promoting NOXA ubiquitylation and degradation is relatively weak. First, since NOXA2 binds to WSB2 on its SOCS box, which consists of a BC box for Elongin B/C binding and a CUL5 box for CUL5 binding, it is crucial to determine whether the binding of NOXA on the SOCS box affects the formation of CRL5WSB2 complex. The authors should demonstrate the endogenous binding between NOXA and the CRL5WSB2 complex. Additionally, the authors may also consider manipulating CUL5, SAG, or ElonginB/C to assess if it would affect NOXA protein turnover in two independent cell lines. Second, in all the experiments designed to detect NOXA ubiquitylation in cells, the authors utilized immunoprecipitation (IP) with FLAG-NOXA/NOXA, followed by immunoblotting (IB) with HA-Ub. However, it is possible that the observed poly-Ub bands could be partly attributed to the ubiquitylation of other NOXA binding proteins. Therefore, the authors need to consider performing IP with HA-Ub and subsequently IB with NOXA. Alternatively, they could use Ni-beads to pull down all His-Ub-tagged proteins under denaturing conditions, followed by the detection of FLAG-tagged NOXA using anti-FLAG Ab. The authors are encouraged to perform one of these suggested experiments to exclude the possibility of this concern. Furthermore, an in vitro ubiquitylation assay is crucial to conclusively demonstrate that the polyubiquitylation of NOXA is indeed mediated by the CRL5WSB2 complex.</p>
<p>(3) In their attempt to map the binding regions between NOXA and WSB2, the authors utilized exogenous proteins of both WSB2 and NOXA. To strengthen their findings, it would be more convincing to perform IP with exogenous wt/mutant WSB2 or NOXA and subsequently perform IB to detect endogenous NOXA or WSB2, respectively. Additionally, an in vitro binding assay using purified proteins would provide further evidence of a direct binding between NOXA and WSB2.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. We agree that a clear rationale should be provided at the beginning of the Results section. As reported in previous studies [Ref: 1, 2, 3], strong synthetic interactions have been observed between WSB2 and several mitochondrial apoptosis-related factors, including MCL-1, BCL-xL, and MARCH5. We have referenced these findings in the Discussion section. Motivated by these studies, we became interested in the role of WSB2 and aimed to investigate the specific mechanisms underlying its synthetic lethality with anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members. We will revise the beginning of the Results section to clearly state this rationale.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. To determine whether endogenous NOXA binds to the intact CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> complex, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays using an antibody against NOXA. Indeed, NOXA co-immunoprecipitated with all subunits of the CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> complex (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D), suggesting that NOXA binding to WSB2 does not disrupt interactions between WSB2 and the other CRL5 subunits. Moreover, depletion of CRL5 complex components (RBX2/SAG, CUL5, ELOB, or ELOC) through siRNAs in C4-2B or Huh-7 cells also resulted in a marked increase in NOXA protein levels.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for raising these important considerations regarding our ubiquitylation assays. We fully acknowledge the reviewer's concern that classical ubiquitination assays could potentially detect ubiquitination of proteins interacting with NOXA. However, we would like to clarify that our experimental conditions effectively mitigate this issue. Specifically, cells were lysed using buffer containing 1% SDS followed by boiling at 105°C for 5 minutes. These rigorous denaturing conditions ensure disruption of non-covalent protein interactions, thereby effectively eliminating the possibility of detecting ubiquitination signals from NOXA-associated proteins.</p>
<p>Regarding the suggestion to perform an in vitro ubiquitination assay, we agree this experiment would indeed provide additional evidence. However, due to significant technical complexities associated with reconstituting CRL5-based E3 ubiquitin ligase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>—which would require the expression and purification of at least six recombinant proteins—such experiments are rarely performed in this context. Furthermore, NOXA is uniquely localized as a membrane protein on the mitochondrial outer membrane, posing additional significant challenges for protein expression and purification. Given the robustness of our current <italic>in vivo</italic> ubiquitylation assay under stringent denaturing conditions, we believe our existing data sufficiently and conclusively demonstrate NOXA ubiquitination mediated by the CRL5<sup>WSB2</sup> complex.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising these important issues. In response to the reviewer’s suggestion to map the binding regions between NOXA and WSB2 more convincingly, we have indeed performed semi-endogenous Co-IP assays, which yielded results consistent with our exogenous protein experiments (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B). Concerning the recommendation to further validate direct interaction using purified recombinant proteins, we encountered substantial technical difficulties in obtaining pure and soluble recombinant WSB2 protein. Additionally, given that NOXA is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein and the interaction occurs on mitochondria, we believe that an in vitro binding assay may have limited physiological relevance. We hope the reviewer can appreciate these practical challenges and our current evidence supporting the strong interaction between NOXA and WSB2.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Exploring the DEP-MAP database and two drug-screen databases, the authors identify WSB2 as an interactor of several BCL2 proteins. In follow-up experiments, they show that CRL5/WSB2 controls NOXA protein levels via K48 ubiquitination following direct protein-protein interaction, and cell death sensitivity in the context of BH3 mimetic treatment, where WSB2 depletion synergizes with drug treatment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use a set of orthogonal methods across different model cell lines and a new WSB2 KO mouse model to confirm their findings. They also manage to correlate WSB2 expression with poor prognosis in prostate and liver cancer, supporting the idea that targeting WSB2 may sensitize cancers for treatment with BH3 mimetics.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions drawn based on the findings in cancer patients are very speculative, as regulation of NOXA cannot be the sole function of CRL5/WSB2 and it is hence unclear what causes correlation with patient survival. Moreover, the authors do not provide a clear mechanistic explanation of how exactly higher levels of NOXA promote apoptosis in the absence of WSB2. This would be important knowledge, as usually high NOXA levels correlate with high MCL1, as they are turned over together, but in situations like this, or loss of other E3 ligases, such as MARCH, the buffering capacity of MCL1 is outrun, allowing excess NOXA to kill (likely by neutralizing other BCL2 proteins it usually does not bind to, such as BCLX). Moreover, a necroptosis-inducing role of NOXA has been postulated. Neither of these options is interrogated here.</p>
<p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Figure 2J. The authors showed that &quot;the mRNA levels of NOXA were even reduced in WSB2-KO cells compared to parental cells&quot;. What is the possible mechanism? This point should at least be discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising these important issues. The underlying mechanisms for the significantly lower mRNA levels of NOXA following the KO of <italic>WSB2</italic> are not fully understood at present. However, we propose that this could represent a form of negative feedback regulation at the level of gene expression. Specifically, when the protein levels of BNIP3/3L rise sharply, it may activate mechanisms that suppress their own mRNA synthesis or stability, serving as a buffering system to prevent further protein accumulation. Such negative feedback loops may be critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and avoiding excessive protein production. Moreover, this phenomenon is frequently observed in other studies investigating substrates targeted by E3 ubiquitin ligases for degradation. We have elaborated on this point in the Discussion section.</p>

<p>(2) Figure 2M. A previous study has clearly demonstrated that NOXA is subjected to ubiquitylation and degradation by CRL5 E3 ligase (PMID: 27591266). This paper should be cited. Also, in that publication, NOXA ubiquitylation is via the K11 linkage, not the K48 linkage. The authors should include K11R mutant in their assay.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important issue. We thank the reviewer for suggesting the relevant reference (PMID: 27591266), which we have now cited accordingly. Additionally, we would like to clarify that our new <italic>in vivo</italic> ubiquitination assays included the K11R and K11-only ubiquitin mutants, and our data demonstrate that WSB2-mediated NOXA ubiquitination indeed involves the K11 linkage ubiquitination（Figure 2—figure supplement 1E).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important issue. To address this, we generated FLAG-NOXA mutants individually substituting lysine residues K35, K41, and K48 with arginine. In vivo ubiquitination assays demonstrated that lysine 48 (K48) is the predominant residue responsible for WSB2-mediated NOXA ubiquitination (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C).</p>

<p>(4) Figure 3N. The authors need to show that the fusion peptide containing C-terminal NOXA peptide competitively inhibits the interaction between endogenous WSB2 and NOXA and extends the protein half-life of NOXA, leading to NOXA accumulation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for raising these important issues. As suggested, we investigated whether the fusion peptide containing the C-terminal NOXA sequence competitively disrupts the interaction between endogenous WSB2 and NOXA, subsequently influencing NOXA stability. Our results demonstrated that treatment with this fusion peptide indeed significantly reduced the endogenous interaction between WSB2 and NOXA (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). Furthermore, we observed that the peptide dose-dependently increased endogenous NOXA protein levels and prolonged its protein half-life, thereby resulting in the accumulation of NOXA (Figure 3N; Figure 3—figure supplement 1E, F). These findings collectively indicate that the fusion peptide competitively inhibits the WSB2-NOXA interaction, stabilizes NOXA protein, and enhances its accumulation.</p>

<p>(5) Figure 4. a) It would be better to investigate whether WSB2 knockdown can sensitize cancer cells to the treatment with ABT-737 or AZD5991, evidenced by a decrease in both IC50 values and clonogenic survival rates and whether such sensitization is dependent on NOXA. b) The authors need to show the levels of cleaved caspase-3/7/9 and the percentages of apoptotic cells in shNC cells upon silencing of WSB2 in Figure 4A-F. c) It will be more convincing to repeat the experiment to show synthetic lethality by WSB2 disruption and MCL-1 inhibitor AZD5991 treatment using another cell line, such as WSB2-deficient Huh-7 cells in Figure 4 I&amp;J.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for these valuable and constructive suggestions.
Regarding point (a): We believe that our current Western blot and flow cytometry data (Figure 4G–L) have already provided strong evidence that WSB2 depletion enhances apoptosis in response to ABT-737 and AZD5991. Therefore, we consider that additional IC50 and clonogenic survival assays, while informative, may not be essential for supporting our conclusion. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 5A–F, we found that silencing NOXA largely, though not completely, reversed the enhanced apoptosis triggered by these inhibitors in WSB2-deficient cells, suggesting that the sensitization effect is at least partially dependent on NOXA.</p>
<p>Regarding point (b): We have shown that WSB2 knockout alone had no impact on the levels of cleaved caspase-3/7/9 or the percentages of apoptotic cells in Huh-7 and C4-2B cells (Figure 4G-L and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-D), indicating that WSB2 loss does not induce apoptosis on its own under basal conditions.</p>
<p>Regarding point (c): We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and have now repeated the experiment in WSB2 knockout Huh-7 cells. The new results further support the synthetic lethality between WSB2 loss and AZD5991 treatment (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, D).</p>

<p>(6) Figure 5A/C/E. The effect of siNOXA is minor, if any, for cleavage of caspases. The same thing for Figure 6F/H.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful observation regarding the relatively modest effect of shNOXA on caspase cleavage in Figures 5A/C/E and Figures 6F/H. Indeed, we acknowledge that the reduction in caspase cleavage following NOXA knockdown is moderate. However, consistent with our discussions in the manuscript, NOXA knockdown significantly—but not completely—rescued the increased apoptosis observed in WSB2-deficient cells treated with BCL-2 family inhibitors. This suggests that while NOXA plays a notable role, additional mechanisms or unidentified targets may also be involved in WSB2-mediated regulation of apoptosis.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's thoughtful suggestion regarding additional immunohistochemical or immunofluorescence analyses in xenograft tumors. However, due to current limitations in available antibodies suitable for reliable detection of NOXA by IHC and IF, we are unable to perform these experiments. We greatly appreciate the reviewer's understanding of this technical constraint. Nevertheless, our existing data collectively supports the conclusion that the combination of ABT-737 and R8-C-terminal NOXA peptide significantly enhances apoptosis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<p>(9) Figure S1D. BCL-W levels were reduced upon WSB2 overexpression, which should be acknowledged.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for raising this important issue. We acknowledge that BCL-W protein levels were slightly reduced upon WSB2 overexpression in Figure S1D. However, this effect is distinct from the pronounced reduction observed in NOXA protein levels. We have revised the manuscript to clarify this point. Additionally, we recognize that transient overexpression systems may occasionally lead to non-specific or artifactual changes. Our exogenous expression and co-immunoprecipitation experiments did not support an interaction between BCL-W and WSB2. Therefore, the observed reduction of BCL-W under these conditions may not reflect a physiologically relevant regulation.</p>

<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for this insightful and biologically meaningful suggestion. We agree that investigating the potential role of WSB2 in radiation-induced tissue damage and tumorigenesis would be of great interest.

Nevertheless, we recognize the value of this line of investigation and plan to explore it in our future studies.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors focus on NOXA, after initially identifying WSB2 to interact with several BCL2 proteins. The rationale behind this is that WSB2 depletion or overexpression affects NOXA levels, but none of the other BCL2 proteins tested, as stated in the text. Yet, BCLW is also depleted upon overexpression of WSB2 (Supplementary Figure 1). How does this phenomenon relate to the sensitization noted, is BCL-W higher in WSB2 KO cells? It does not seem so though. This warrants discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for raising this important issue. Our results showed that overexpression of WSB2 markedly reduced NOXA levels, while the levels of other BCL-2 family proteins remained unaffected or minimally affected, such as BCL-W (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). Furthermore, depletion of WSB2 through shRNA-mediated KD or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO in C4-2B cells or Huh-7 cells led to a marked increase in the steady-state levels of endogenous NOXA, without affecting other BCL-2 family proteins examined, included BCL-W (Figure 2A-C, Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>If WSB2 depletion does not affect MCL1 levels, how does excess NOXA actually kill? Does it bind to any (other) prosurvival proteins under conditions of WSB2 depletion? Is the MCL1 half-life changed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for raising this important point. NOXA is a BH3-only protein known to promote apoptosis primarily by binding to and neutralizing anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, especially MCL-1, via its BH3 domain. It can inhibit MCL-1 either through competitive binding or by facilitating its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In our system, the total protein levels of MCL-1 remained unchanged in <italic>WSB2</italic> knockout cells, suggesting that NOXA may not be promoting apoptosis through enhanced MCL-1 degradation. Instead, we speculate that the accumulation of NOXA in <italic>WSB2</italic>-deficient cells enhances apoptosis by sequestering MCL-1 through direct binding, thereby freeing pro-apoptotic effectors such as BAK and BAX. In line with our observations, Nakao et al. reported that deletion of the mitochondrial E3 ligase MARCH5 led to a pronounced increase in NOXA expression, while leaving MCL-1 protein levels unchanged in leukemia cell lines (Leukemia. 2023 ;37:1028-1038., PMID: 36973350).</p>
<p>Additionally, NOXA has been reported to interact with other anti-apoptotic proteins, including BCL-XL. It is therefore possible that under conditions of WSB2 depletion, excess NOXA may also bind to BCL-XL and relieve its inhibition of BAX/BAK, further contributing to apoptosis. Future experiments assessing NOXA binding partners in <italic>WSB2</italic>-deficient cells would help clarify this mechanism.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I think some initial insights into the mechanism underlying the sensitization would add a lot to this study. Is there a role of BFL1/A1 in any of these cell lines, as it can also rather selectively bind to NOXA and is sometimes deregulated in cancer?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for raising this important issue. While BFL1/A1 is indeed another anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family member that can selectively bind to NOXA and has been implicated in cancer, our study primarily focuses on the WSB2-NOXA axis. However, given its potential involvement in apoptosis regulation, it would be an interesting direction for future studies to explore whether BFL1/A1 contributes to NOXA-mediated sensitization in specific cellular contexts.</p>

<p>Otherwise, this is a very nice and convincing study.</p>
