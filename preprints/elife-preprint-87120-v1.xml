<title>Abstract</title><p>Chronic high-fat feeding triggers widespread metabolic dysfunction including obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes. While these ultimate pathological states are relatively well understood, we have a limited understanding of how high-fat intake first triggers physiological changes. Here, we identify an acute microglial metabolic response that rapidly translates intake of high-fat diet (HFD) to a surprisingly beneficial effect on spatial and learning memory. Acute high-fat intake increases palmitate levels in cerebrospinal fluid and triggers a wave of microglial metabolic activation characterized by mitochondrial membrane activation, fission and metabolic skewing towards aerobic glycolysis. These effects are generalized, detectable in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cortex all within 1-3 days of HFD exposure. In vivo microglial ablation and conditional DRP1 deletion experiments show that the microglial metabolic response is necessary for the acute effects of HFD. <sup>13</sup>C-tracing experiments reveal that in addition to processing via β-oxidation, microglia shunt a substantial fraction of palmitate towards anaplerosis and re-release of bioenergetic carbons into the extracellular milieu in the form of lactate, glutamate, succinate, and intriguingly, the neuro-protective metabolite itaconate. Together, these data identify microglial cells as a critical nutrient regulatory node in the brain, metabolizing away harmful fatty acids and liberating the same carbons instead as alternate bioenergetic and protective substrates. The data identify a surprisingly beneficial effect of short-term HFD on learning and memory.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The central nervous system (CNS) plays a critical role in regulating glucose and energy homeostasis by sensing, integrating, and responding to peripheral signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Our understanding of CNS control over energy balance is mostly derived from investigation of distinct functional sets of hypothalamic neurons and their interactions with the periphery[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. In addition, a growing body of evidence supports an important role for glial cells in regulating energy balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. For example, astrocytes can regulate energy balance by processing glucose into lactate, which is then released to fuel and modulate surrounding neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. These latter findings demonstrate how metabolic intermediaries from the neuronal niche can directly influence CNS output.</p>
<p>Microglia are the third most abundant glial cell in the brain. Developmentally, they are derived from the yolk sac and are considered CNS immune cells. Like the peripheral immune compartment, microglia activation has been implicated in metabolic disease pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Specifically, microglia in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) become activated under conditions of chronic high-fat feeding in a process termed ‘microgliosis’. High fat diet (HFD)-induced activation has been associated with moderate increases in cytokine gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] and pioneering studies testing both genetic manipulation of microglial NF-kB and microglial depletion with PLX5622 suggest that microglial activation is necessary for the metabolic impairments triggered by chronic HFD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Recent evidence suggests a role for microglial mitochondrial alterations (fission) that can be detected within days of high fat diet (HFD) administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Microglia outside the hypothalamus also activate upon chronic HFD exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] and associate with cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. A key outstanding question in the field, then, is how high-fat feeding first triggers microglial activation.</p>
<p>Here, we find that microglia rapidly and directly sense the switch to dietary fat within a single feeding cycle. By three days, HFD increases microglial mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibits complex II activity, and skews mitochondria towards fission. Using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolomics we demonstrate that microglia are directly exposed to increased palmitate and stearate levels within hours of the feeding switch, and using <sup>13</sup>C-tracer studies, we find that microglia robustly metabolize fatty acids via β-oxidation. Interestingly, we find the same acute microglial metabolic response (aMMR) beyond the hypothalamus <italic>in vivo,</italic> in the hippocampus and cortex. aMMR is largely independent of transcriptional changes, and intriguingly, we find that it improves spatial and learning memory. Microglial depletion experiments and microglia-specific DRP deletion show that microglia and more specifically microglial mitochondrial fission, are necessary for the immediate glucose homeostatic responses and memory improvements to HFD. The data thus identify an acute non-transcriptional microglial metabolic pathway that couples detection of acute increases in dietary fat to changes in whole body metabolism and memory.</p>

<title>Acute HFD-induced metabolic changes are microglia dependent</title>
<p>To understand the nature of the immediate high-fat feeding response, we characterized the physiological effects of acute HFD (3d ad libitum feeding) in cohorts of C57BL/6J mice (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). Metabolically healthy mice exhibit rapid metabolic shifts on this timescale, including fasting and post-absorptive (2-hr fast) hyperglycemia and an elevated insulin response to glucose (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B-E</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig S1A-B</xref></bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Glucose excursions, as revealed by baseline-correction, and insulin tolerance test results are minimally impacted upon acute HFD (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig S1C</xref></bold>), an important contrast to chronic HFD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. These acute changes in glycemic control are transient, returning to homeostatic levels within one week of a return to normal chow (‘Reverse Diet’; <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C-E</xref></bold>) and are not associated with substantial body weight gain (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig S1D</xref></bold>). To test whether microglia contribute to the induction of these acute HFD-induced effects, we treated mice with the microglia-ablating drug PLX-5622 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] for 7-9 days and repeated the 3d HFD metabolic assessment. PLX-5622 treatment depleted hypothalamic microglia by &gt;95% across animals (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref></bold>) and prevented both the acute HFD-driven insulin hypersecretion and post-absorptive glucose excess (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C-E</xref></bold>). Hyperglycemia associated with over-night fasting was unaffected by microglial depletion (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref></bold>). The latter indicates that acute HFD triggers microglia-dependent and independent metabolic effects. Thus, microglia are required for metabolic changes induced by the transition to high-fat feeding.</p>

<title>A rapid Microglial Mitochondria Response to high fat diet</title>
<p>Long-term exposure to HFD has previously been associated with hypothalamic microgliosis (increased number and activation of CD45<sup>lo</sup>;CD11b<sup>+</sup> microglia) and monocyte infiltration (CD45<sup>hi</sup>;Cd11b<sup>+</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Examination of 3d HFD responses in both wild-type animals and animals harboring a microglia-restricted EYFP lineage reporter showed no evidence of either increased hypothalamic microglial proliferation (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig S1E</xref></bold>) or monocyte infiltration (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig S1F</xref></bold>). Similarly, using one of the most sensitive scRNAseq protocols available (CEL-Seq2), we found no evidence of a significant microglial transcriptional response upon 3d HFD. The latter analysis included searches for changes in heterogeneity, skewing across sub-states, and appearance of new cell sub-states (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig S1G</xref></bold>). The lack of response is especially clear when juxtaposed to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-triggered responses performed using the same purification and sequencing protocols in the same laboratory (EAE; <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref></bold>). Thus, the central effects of acute HFD are distinct from those of chronic HFD, and have little to no effect on microglial expansion, transcription, heterogeneity, or inflammation in the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>A deep body of literature has highlighted how cellular metabolic changes are necessary and sufficient mediators of cell-type specific function, work pioneered recently by the immunometabolism community[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. We tested whether such changes in cellular metabolism might underpin the microglial response to acute high-fat feeding. Interestingly, mitochondrial membrane potential was increased in primary MBH microglia sorted from animals administered a 3d HFD (Mitotracker Deep Red; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A-B</xref></bold>). Co-staining in the same samples showed no evidence of altered mitochondrial mass (Mitotracker Green; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref></bold>). This acute microglial metabolic response (aMMR) was detectable within 12 hours of high-fat feeding (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). aMMR appeared transient and distinct from the effects induced by chronic HFD. Specifically, parallel measures showed no induction of membrane potential in 4-week HFD animals (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). Thus, microglia respond to acute dietary fat through a relatively restricted mitochondrial response.</p>

</fig>
<p>To understand the inputs that might trigger the aMMR response, we performed targeted metabolomics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>; Suppl Table 1</bold>). Overall, relatively few metabolites change upon 3d HFD. Nicotinamide-N-oxide was the only metabolite that decreased significantly. Six metabolites increased upon 3d HFD including methylmalonate, isovalerylcarnitine, nicotinic acid, glutarylcarnitine, and notably, the fatty acids palmitate (hexadecanoic acid) and stearate (octadecanoic acid). Palmitate and stearate, the only two metabolites that changed by &gt;2-fold, are highly enriched in the HFD itself (Research Diets D12492) suggesting that microglia respond directly to dietary fatty acid levels.</p>
<p>To test whether these observed fatty acid changes in the CSF might directly trigger aMMR, we examined the primary microglial response to palmitate <italic>in vitro</italic> using neonatal microglia (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2A-B</xref></bold>). Palmitate had no effect on either baseline or maximal oxygen consumption under standard culture conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref></bold>). That said, when added in conjunction with succinate (to prime complex II-mediated OxPhos), palmitate-treated microglia were unable to utilize succinate. Acute palmitate therefore appears to rapidly compromise or saturate complex II function and prevent utilization of substrates routed through complex II. Consistent with these <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, fresh primary microglia from 3d HFD animals failed to respond to complex II-specific mitochondrial stimuli (Rotenone + Succinate; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref></bold>) validating the findings in adult, <italic>ex vivo</italic> contexts. Consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> observations above, <italic>in vitro</italic> palmitate exposure decreased microglial mitochondrial length within 24 hours, indicating that fatty acid exposure itself is sufficient to trigger mitochondrial fission in a cell autonomous manner (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref> upper panels</bold>). Collectively, these responses were independent of any detectable mitoSOX-activating ROS release (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2C</xref></bold>), and, were associated with recruitment of the mitochondrial fission regulator DRP1 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref></bold>). A 24h exposure to the mono-unsaturated fatty acid oleate failed to elicit a comparable fission response (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref></bold>), and, acute palmitate exposure had no effects on microglial cytokine release <italic>in vitro</italic> (IL6, IL1β, TNFa; <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2E</xref></bold>). Thus, acute fatty acid exposure recapitulates aMMR in vitro including selective loss of complex II activity and lack of significant inflammatory cytokine response.</p>

<title>Microglia take up and metabolize free fatty acids</title>
<p>Based on BODIPY fluorescence, we found that primary microglia increase lipid droplet numbers within 24h of <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure to palmitate (200uM; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref></bold>), suggesting a capacity to take up and process fatty acids. To characterize the microglial consequences of fatty acid uptake we used stable isotopic tracer labelling and directly quantified U-[<sup>13</sup>C]-palmitate (<sup>13</sup>C-palmitate) processing in both control (BSA treated) and 24h palmitate pre-exposed microglia. Primary microglia incubated with <sup>13</sup>C-palmitate for 4 hours, washed and subjected to GCMS or LCMS-based metabolomics (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref></bold>). Focusing first on the control microglia we observed significant palmitate uptake and incorporation into downstream metabolites (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C-F</xref>; and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4O</xref></bold>). This is the first definitive demonstration to our knowledge that microglia metabolize fatty acids. <sup>13</sup>C-palmitate label was processed to palmitoylcarnitine and acetylcarnitine indicating that microglial fatty acid metabolism acts via the canonical CPT1/CPT2 pathway, moving carbons from outside the mitochondria into the inner mitochondrial matrix (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig S4A</xref></bold>). <sup>13</sup>C-labelling was also found in <sup>13</sup>C-acetylserine, indicating that palmitate is processed through β-oxidation and that it contributes to the acetyl-coA pool (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig S4B</xref></bold>). Label was detected in all measured TCA cycle intermediates (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig S4C</xref></bold>). Examination of labelling ratios of TCA intermediates and glutamate indicated that microglia push a substantial fraction of palmitate-derived carbons out of the TCA (alpha-ketoglutarate (a-KG) to glutamate) rather than processing them further through the whole TCA cycle (towards malate) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E-F</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig S4D</xref></bold>). This is a relatively unique pattern of substrate routing. Thus, microglia store and metabolize palmitate for both energy-producing and anaplerotic reactions.</p>

<title>Palmitate induces a novel microglial lactate/succinate/itaconate release pathway</title>
<p>We next evaluated the effect of the cold palmitate pretreatment on substrate routing and utilization, our model for understanding aMMR. Palmitate <italic>pretreatment</italic> interestingly increased labelling of palmitoylcarnitine, acetylcarnitine and acetylserine, demonstrating that 24h palmitate exposure accelerates β-oxidation (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C-D</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig S4A-B</xref></bold>). The pre-exposure enhanced m+2 label enrichment at a-KG and glutamate without impacting other TCA intermediates (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E-F</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig S4C-D</xref></bold>) indicating that fatty acid exposure further increases microglial substrate routing to glutamate and anaplerosis. Tracer measurements made in extracellular media conditioned from the same cells revealed that 24h palmitate treatment triggered release of glutamate, succinate, and intriguingly itaconate (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G-I</xref></bold>), an immunomodulatory metabolite known to inhibit succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] and recently shown to be neuroprotective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. These findings are consistent with the complex II inhibition observed above upon 3d HFD/palmitate treatment and suggest that itaconate-dependent inhibition of complex II inhibition limits the bioenergetic utilization of fatty acids by microglia, sparing the carbons for release to the cell exterior. Collectively, the data therefore indicate that microglia sense and process fatty acids to generate alternative metabolites for surrounding cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4O</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We next tested whether the effects of 24h palmitate exposure were specific to palmitate-derived carbons or generalizable to other substrates. We repeated the same experiment, instead replacing U-[<sup>13</sup>C]-palmitate with U-[<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref></bold>). Under control conditions, microglia exhibited strong glucose uptake, glycolysis and incorporation of glucose-label into TCA intermediates (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4J</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig S4E</xref></bold>). Substantial <sup>13</sup>C labelling was detected in pyruvate, citrate, a-KG, malate, and again in glutamate, confirming that the unexpected TCA shunt toward glutamate/glutamine pathway is a unique characteristic of the microglial metabolic fingerprint. Importantly, as with palmitate tracing, <sup>13</sup>C-glucose-derived metabolites were detected <italic>extracellularly</italic> in the form of glutamate, itaconate and succinate, as well as in extracellular lactate (m+3) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4K-N</xref></bold>). Palmitate <italic>pretreatment</italic> increased all of these signatures, including glucose uptake (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4J</xref></bold>), lactate labelling and lactate release. aMMR is therefore characterized by induction of a Warburg-like metabolic signature (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4N</xref></bold>). Interestingly, as with palmitate-tracing experiments, fatty acid pretreatment increased release of tracer-labeled itaconate and succinate into the extracellular media (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4L-M</xref></bold>). Collectively, these data identify microglia as a novel metabolic node able to take-up potentially harmful free fatty acids and repurpose them to fuel surrounding cells in the form of lactate and anaplerotic substrates (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4O</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Acute HFD induces widespread MMR and rapid modulation of spatial and learning memory</title>
<p>Changes in neuronal function have previously been linked to lactate provided by glucose metabolism in astrocytes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. To determine if the substrates released by microglia have the potential to directly influence neurons, we incubated primary neuron cultures (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl <bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig S5A</xref></bold></xref>) with conditioned media from the microglial <sup>13</sup>C-glucose tracing experiments (ie. media containing <sup>13</sup>C-glucose-derived isotopically labeled lactate, itaconate, succinate, citrate). As a control for direct uptake of residual <sup>13</sup>C-glucose, we treated parallel neuronal cultures with the fresh <sup>13</sup>C-glucose tracing media originally added to the microglia. Intriguingly, and consistent with literature documenting poor direct glucose utilization by neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], we found robust m+3 lactate (and other metabolites) in cells treated with microglial conditioned media, at levels that far exceeded labelling triggered by glucose tracer alone (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>,</bold> middle column vs left column)(<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig S5B</xref></bold>).

<p>The majority of literature relating HFD-associated microglial function to metabolic regulation is focused on the hypothalamus, a region of the brain that exhibits an unusually leaky blood brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Given our findings that CSF free fatty acid levels double upon acute HFD and given the dramatic metabolomic rewiring induced by microglial palmitate exposure, we asked whether aMMR might also occur in other brain regions. We FACS-sorted cortical and hippocampal microglia and tested for mitochondrial activation (MMR) in 3d HFD exposed mice. Indeed, 3d HFD exposure triggered an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential in both cortical and hippocampal microglia (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B-C</xref></bold>). These data were consistent with the CSF results and suggested therefore that acute high-fat feeding might alter higher cognitive function.</p>
<p>Given the hippocampal signature, we tested whether 3d HFD mice showed any deleterious memory phenotype compared to chow-fed controls. Surprisingly, HFD-treated animals outperformed the controls. Using a standard Barnes test, 3d HFD mice exhibited a faster reaction (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref></bold>), suggestive of improved learning and spatial memory. Similarly, when challenged with a T-Maze, 3d HFD exposed animals exhibited heightened spatial memory (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref></bold>). These phenotypes were reproducible at two different institutes (VAI, USA and MPI-IE, Germany) and in the hands of different experimentalists (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D-E</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig S5C-D</xref>)</bold>. Notably, the memory differences were observed in the absence of any detectable changes to motor coordination (ROTAROD; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F-H</xref></bold>). Thus, acute high-fat feeding triggers improvements in learning and spatial memory.</p>
<p>To validate that these 3d HFD induced cognitive effects were microglial aMMR dependent, we once again repeated experiments in microglia-depleted (PLX-5622) and <italic>Drp1<sup>MGKO</sup></italic> mice. Importantly, PLX-5622-treated animals failed to show any detectable memory improvements upon a 3d HFD (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5I-J</xref></bold>) indicating indeed that an intact microglial compartment is necessary for acute HFD enhancement of memory function. Likewise, 3d HFD exposure failed to trigger memory improvements in <italic>Drp1<sup>MGKO</sup></italic> mice (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5K</xref></bold>) indicating that the memory enhancing response, like the glucose homeostatic effect, is microglial DRP1-dependent. Again, no mice in any treatment group showed altered motor effects by ROTAROD (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl FigS5 E-J</xref></bold>). Therefore, 3d HFD-triggered aMMR appears to constitute a generalized physiological response that optimizes dietary coupling to diverse central functions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our data identify a new role for microglial cells as a rapid metabolic sensor of dietary macronutrient composition, and as a relay that triggers cognitive and peripheral metabolic responses. One of the most intriguing results was the directionality of the rapid metabolic responses. Whereas a bulk of literature demonstrates adverse outcomes upon chronic HFD, both in the brain (microgliosis, inflammatory cytokine release, myeloid cell infiltration) and periphery (hyperglycemia, insulin resistance)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], our findings indicate that acute HFD initiates a distinct homeostatic response that supports cognitive function. From an evolutionary perspective, there are obvious benefits to partitioning energy use towards cognition once energy demands are well met. We find that aMMR results from direct uptake, processing, and release of fatty acid derived carbons, and demonstrate that microglia are capable of metabolizing fatty acids towards diverse intracellular and extracellular pools. One immediate question raised by this work is the mechanistic nature of the flip from the seemingly beneficial acute MMR (aMMR) observed here, to the well-documented inflammatory MMR (iMMR) triggered after 1-2 weeks of chronic HFD. One possibility is that the response requires flexibility between lipid storage and processing, and that this becomes saturated with prolonged HFD.</p>
<p>Of equal interest are the PLX5622 experiments and data, which demonstrate for the first time that microglial ablation has no overt effect on baseline metabolism and memory. Importantly, however, the data show that microglia are critical for optimal response to dietary change. We are aware of the fact that CSFR1 inhibiting compounds such as PLX5622 deplete not only microglia but also long living CNS macrophages in the meninges and perivascular space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] but they are by far less numerous and placed far from neurons in the parenchyma. We demonstrate a novel role for microglia in optimizing glycemia upon short-(2 hours) but not long-(24 hour) term fasting and therefore suggest that microglia mediate a glucose-sparing function in the transition from the post-prandial to fasted state. Future work mapping the downstream neuronal circuitry governing this response will be important. The overabundance of food in since industrialization has skewed a significant global population towards chronic prandial and post-prandial states and away from one of substantial intermittent fasting events. The finding that aMMR coordinates central metabolic balance with peripheral glucose homeostasis selectively during the prandial/post-prandial phase adds nuance to a significant literature distinguishing these physiological contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]). From an evolutionary perspective it is easy to rationalize why initial periods of plenty would be mechanistically coupled to maximizing central functions.</p>
<p>One question raised by these findings is if there is a hierarchy for substrate sharing between glial cell (microglia, tanycytes, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes) and neurons. Our data indicate that microglia provide several TCA-associated substrates into the extracellular milieu, and, that palmitate/HFD increases this activity. Tanycytes and astrocytes have both been documented to release select metabolites into the extracellular environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Given that CSF production is only loosely compartmentalized (e.g. relative to the highly physically structured control of blood), we suspect a cooperative model over hierarchical, serial or synergistic metabolic compartmentalization models. Other new questions relate to the depth or breadth of other cognitive processes that might also be influenced by acute HFD. In this study, we demonstrate that aMMR involves release of at least 4 important anapleurotic substrates, and that aMMR is detectable from the hypothalamus to the hippocampus and cortex. Increased lactate has been shown to enhance fear memory in a glutamate-associated mechanism ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]). Both lactate and glutamate are increased upon 3d HFD-induced aMMR.</p>
<p>In addition to identifying novel substrate routing patterns in microglia, our data demonstrate that mitochondrial fission is necessary for aMMR. Fatty acid triggered fission has been observed in several cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] including neurons and glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Work by Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] suggests that the aMMR characterized here may require UCP2; those authors demonstrated UCP2-dependent mitochondrial changes in short- and long-term HFD exposed hypothalamic microglia. Collectively the two studies argue against the notion that astrocytes are unique amongst glial cells in their ability to use fatty acids, and importantly, to release fatty-acid derived substrates for use by neurons and other neighboring cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>].</p>
<p>Finally, this study demonstrates previously unappreciated plasticity and complexity for microglial cellular metabolism. Rather than being largely glucose-constrained, our tracer studies reveal that primary microglia from across the brain readily take-up, metabolize and store fatty acids and that fatty acids are metabolized towards bioenergetic and acetylation reactions (acetyl-coA). They prove for the first time that substantial β-oxidation occurs in microglia cells even in the presence of high extracellular glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. The coordinate observations of intra- and extracellular succinate and itaconate accumulation and relative Complex II inhibition indicate that palmitate metabolism drives feed-forward inhibition of Complex II via itaconate production and shunting of TCA intermediates out of the cycle towards glutamate. Further examination of the role of glutamine as a fuel and anapleurotic regulator of cellular function is therefore warranted. At least under the standard conditions used here and, in the field, microglia appear to be metabolically wired release of carbon substrates to neighboring cells, through several intermediates including lactate, succinate, glutamate, citrate and itaconate. This idea is consistent with the lack of substantial induction of lipid droplet accumulation, respiration, or ROS buildup upon palmitate exposure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we identify a rapid microglial mechanism that translates direct dietary fat sensation into a non-transcriptional, mitochondrial response that specifically alters extracellular regulatory substrates (lactate, glutamate, itaconate and succinate) and enhances memory function. The response is progressive over the first days of dietary intervention, an effect that appears dependent on feed forward inhibition of mitochondrial complex II by itaconate. The aMMR response is detectable across the entire brain, which carries important implications for understanding how our diet directly regulates diverse cognitive and homeostatic responses, and the development of pharmacological and lifestyle interventions to enhance them.</p>

<title>Experimental Animals</title>
<p>All animal studies and experimental procedures were approved by the either the Max Planck Commities in Germany or by the Van Andel Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in US, before project initiation. All mice were housed in a temperature-controlled environment (23°C) with a 12-h light and 12-h dark (07.00–19.00) photoperiod. Animals were provided standard chow diet (Research Diets #5021; 23,6% calories from fat; Mouse Breeder Diet #6539) or HFD (60% fat; Research diet, Rodent Chow #D12492) and water ad libitum unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>For the experiments performed on non-modified mice, C57BL/6J were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. <italic>Drp1</italic> floxed mice (<italic>Drp1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) and Cx3cr1<sup>CreER</sup> mice (B6.129P2(C)-Cx3cr1<sup>tm2.1(cre/ERT2)Jung</sup>/J) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Mice expressing tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (CreERT2) in cells expressing CX3CR1 (Cx3cr1-cre:ERT2) were crossed with mice harboring conditional alleles Drp1 (<italic>Drp1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>). For induction of Cre recombinase, 5- to 6-week-old <italic>Drp1<sup>MGKO</sup></italic> (<italic>Drp1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>-Cx3cr1-cre) mice and their littermate control, were treated with 4 mg tamoxifen (TAM, Sigma) solved in 200 μl corn oil (Sigma) injected subcutaneously at two time points 48 h apart. High fat diet (HFD) was started 4 weeks from the last injection to allow the replacement of peripheral monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].

<title>Microglial Depletion</title>
<p>Microglia were depleted in all cases by feeding mice custom diet (Research Diets) containing the CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622 (Plexxikon) formulated in the exact diets indicated above. The compound-containing diets have the new order numbers (D12450: PLX5622-containing standard diet and D21021905: PLX5622-containing high-fat diet). PLX5622 was included to achieve a dose of 1.2 g/kg based on average adult C57BL/6J food intake. Animals were administered the diet for 7-9 days.</p>

<title>Microglia Cultures</title>
<p>Eight to ten mice (1–3 days old, mixed sex) from C57BL/6J mice were used for primary microglia culture. In brief, brains were dissected and placed in a small culture dish that contained a small volume of Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM). The meningeal lining (dura and arachnoid layers) were then gently removed using two small straight forceps under a magnifying glass. The cleaned brain was then placed in a new culture dish minced into a fine slurry using a pair of corneal scissors. Suspended cells were filtered (70 μm) and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm and the pellet was re-suspended and plated on poly-D-lysine (Cat# P6407, Sigma)-coated 75cm<sup>2</sup> flasks with DMEM containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine serum. Seven to 10 days later, the flasks were stimulated for 3 days with 30ng/ml M-CSF (Cat# 315-02, Peprotech) and then, shaken (200 rpm) for 3 hours (37°C) to specifically release microglia.</p>

<title>Embryonic Cortical Neuron Culture Protocol</title>
<p>Primary neuron cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18 (E18) CD1 mice. Brains were gently removed from the embryos and placed into a petri dish filled with ice cold, sterile Hibernate Medium (Cat#. A1247601, Gibco). Hemispheres were gently separated, and the meninges, thalamus, striatum, brainstem, and hippocampus were removed. Cortical tissue was isolated and cut into 1 mm<sup>3</sup> segments. The cortical tissue from each brain was pooled and digested in papain solution (20 U/mL Cat# LS003126, Worthington) and then treated with DNase I (Cat# LS006563, Worthington) to remove residual DNA. The tissue was then washed with pre-warmed Neurobasal media (Cat# 21103049, Gibco), mechanically dissociated, and strained through a 40 μm cell strainer. The cell suspension was pelleted at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes, resuspended in 2 mL of neuron media (Neurobasal media containing 1% B27, 2mM GlutaMAX and penicillin-streptomycin) and gently mixed. The dissociated neurons were seeded on poly-D-lysine coated 6 well culture plates at 1 million cells/ well. On DIV3, cytosine arabinoside (1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine) was added to a final concentration of 5 μM to curb glial proliferation. The neurons were maintained until DIV21 by replacing 1/3 volume of media with fresh neuron media every five days.</p>

<p>For Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolites were extracted using ice cold 80% methanol, sonicated, and then D-myristic acid was added (750ng/sample) as an internal standard. Dried samples were dissolved in 30 μL methozyamine hydrochloride (10mg/ml) in pyridine and derivatized as tert-butyldimethylsily (TBDMS) esters using 70 μL N-(<italic>tert</italic>-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. For metabolite analysis, an Agilent 5975C GC/MS equipped with a DB-5MS+DG (30 m x 250 µm x 0.25 µm) capillary column (Agilent J&amp;W, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used. All data were collected by electron impact set at 70 eV. A total of 1 μL of the derivatized sample was injected in the GC in splitless mode with inlet temperature set to 280 °C, using helium as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.5512 mL/min (rate at which myristic acid elutes at 17.94 min). The quadrupole was set at 150 °C and the GC/MS interface at 285 °C. The oven program for all metabolite analyses started at 60 °C held for 1 min, then increased at a rate of 10 °C/min until 320 °C. Bake-out was at 320 °C for 10 min. Sample data were acquired both in scan (1-600 m/z) modes. MassHunter software (v10, Agilent Technologies) was used for peak picking and integration of GCMS data. Peak areas of all isotoplogues for a molecular ion of each metabolite were used for mass isotopomer distribution anaylsis using a custom algorithm developed at VAI. Briefly, the atomic composition of the TBDMS-derivatized metabolite fragments (M-57) was determined, and matrices correcting for natural contribution of isotopomer enrichment were generated for each metabolite.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study demonstrates a link between an acute high fat diet, microglial metabolism and improved higher cognitive function. The evidence supporting the proposed model is <bold>incomplete</bold> at this stage and would benefit from additional experiments probing the link between microglial metabolism and higher cognitive function. Following more mechanistic dissection, this work will be of interest to a broad audience in the field of neuroscience, metabolism, and immunology.</p>

<p>In this study, Drougard et al. examined the consequences of an acute high fat diet (HFD) on microglia in mice. 3-day HFD influenced the regulation of systemic glucose homeostasis in a microglia-dependent and independent manner, as determined using microglial depletion with PLX5622. 3-day HFD increased microglial membrane potential and the levels of palmitate and stearate in cerebrospinal fluid in vivo. Using confocal imaging, respirometry and stable isotope-assisted tracing in primary microglial cultures, the authors suggest an increase in mitochondrial fission and metabolic remodelling occurs when exposed to palmitate, which increases the release of glutamate, succinate and itaconate that may alter neuronal metabolism. This acute microglial metabolic response following acute HFD is subsequently linked to improved higher cognitive function (learning and memory) in a microglia and DRP1-dependent manner.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Overall, this study is interesting and novel in linking acute high fat diet to changes in microglia and improved learning and memory in mice. The role for microglia and DRP1 in regulating glucose homeostasis and memory in vivo appears to be supported by the data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors suggest that utilisation of palmitate by microglia following HFD is the driver of the acute metabolic changes and that the release of microglial-derived lactate, succinate, glutamate and itaconate are causally linked to improvements in learning and memory.</p>
<p>
A major weakness is that the authors provide no mechanistic link between beta-oxidation of palmitate (or other fatty acids) in microglia and the observed systemic metabolic and memory phenotypes in vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of CPT1a could be considered or CPT1a-deficient microglia.</p>
<p>Another major weakness is that the authors also suggest that 3-day HFD microglial response (increase membrane potential) is likely driven by palmitate-induced increases in itaconate feedforward inhibition of complex II/SDH. Whilst this is an interesting hypothesis, the in vitro metabolic characterisation is not entirely convincing. The authors suggest that acute palmitate appears to rapidly compromise or saturate complex II activity. Succinate is a membrane impermeable dicarboxylate. It can enter cells via MCT transporters at acidic pH. It is not clear that I) Succinate is taken up into microglia, II) If the succinate used was pH neutral sodium succinate or succinic acid, and III) If the observed changes are due to succinate oxidation, changes in pH or activation of the succinate receptor SUCNR1 on microglia. In the absence of these succinate treatments, there are no alterations in mitochondrial respiration or membrane potential following palmitate treatment, which does not support this hypothesis. Intracellular itaconate measurements and quantification are lacking and IRG1 expression is not assessed. There also appears to be more labelled itaconate in neuronal cultures from control (BSA) microglia conditioned media, which is not discussed. What is the total level of itaconate in neurons from these conditioned media experiments? No evidence is provided that the in vivo response is dependent on IRG1, the mitochondrial enzyme responsible for itaconate synthesis, or itaconate. To causally link IRG1/itaconate, IRG1-deficient mice could be used in future work.</p>
<p>While microglial DRP1 is causally implicated the role of palmitate is not convincing. Mitochondrial morphology changes are subtle including TOMM20 and DRP1 staining and co-localization - additional supporting data should be provided. Electron microscopy of mitochondrial structure would provide more detailed insight to morphology changes. Western blot of fission-associated proteins Drp1, phospho-Drp1 (S616), MFF and MiD49/51. Higher magnification and quality confocal imaging of DRP1/TOMM20. Drp1 recruitment to mitochondrial membranes can be assessed using subcellular fractionation. No characterisation of primary microglia from DRP1-knockout mice is performed with palmitate treatment. Authors demonstrate an increase in both stearate and palmitate in CSF following 3-day HFD. Only palmitate was tested in the regulation of microglial responses, but it may be more informative to test stearate and palmitate combined.</p>

<p>The study &quot;A rapid microglial metabolic response controls metabolism and improves memory&quot; by Drougard et al. provides evidence that short-term HFD has a beneficial effect on spatial and learning memory through microglial metabolic reprogramming. The manuscript is well-written and the statistics were properly performed with all the data. However, there are concerns regarding the interpretation of the data, particularly the gap between the in vivo observations and the in vitro mechanistic studies.</p>
<p>In the PLX-5622 microglial depletion study, it is unclear what happened to the body weight, food intake, and day-night behavior of these mice compared to the vehicle control mice. It is important to address the innate immunity-dependent physiology affected by a long period of microglial depletion in the brain (also macrophages in the periphery). Furthermore, it would be beneficial to validate the images presented in Fig.1F by providing iba1 staining in chow diet-fed mice with or without PLX-5622 for 7-10 days. Additionally, high-quality images, with equal DAPI staining and comparable anatomical level, should be provided in both chow diet-fed mice and HFD-fed mice with or without PLX-5622 in the same region of hypothalamus or hippocampus. These are critical evidences for this project, and it is suggested that the authors provide more data on the general physiology of these mice, at least regarding body weight and food intake.</p>
<p>It is also unclear whether the microglia shown in Fig.3A were isolated from mice 4 weeks after Tamoxifen injection. It is suggested that the authors provide more evidence, such as additional images or primary microglia culture, to demonstrate that the mitochondria had more fusion upon drp1 KO. It is recommended to use mito-tracker green/red to stain live microglia and provide good resolution images.</p>
<p>Regarding the data presented in Fig.5A, it is suggested that the authors profile the metabolomics of the microglial conditioned media (and provide the methods on how this conditioned media was collected) to determine whether there was already abundant lactate in the media. Any glucose-derived metabolites, e.g. lactate, are probably more preferred by neurons as energy substrates than glucose, especially in embryonic neurons (which are ready to use lactate in newborn brain).</p>
<p>
Finally, it is important to address whether PLX-5622 affects learning and spatial memory in chow diet-fed animals. Following the findings shown in Fig 5J and 5K, the authors should confirm these by any morphological studies on synapse, e.g. by synaptophysin staining or ultrastructure EM study in the area shown in Fig 5I.</p>

<p>Drougard et al. explore microglial detection of a switch to high-fat diet and a subsequent metabolic response that benefits memory. The findings are both surprising and novel in the context of acute high-fat intake, with convincing evidence of increased CSF palmitate after 3 days of HFD. While the authors demonstrate compelling signs of microglial activation in multiple brain regions and unique metabolite release in tracing studies, they should address the following areas prior to acceptance of this manuscript.</p>
<p>Major Points:</p>
<p>
1. It appears that the authors perform key metabolic assays in vitro/ex vivo using primary microglia from either neonatal or adult mice, which should be more clearly delineated especially for the 13C-palmitate tracing. In the case of experiments using primary microglia derived from mixed glial cultures stimulated with M-CSF, this system relies on neonatal mice. This is understandable given the greater potential yield from neonatal mice, but the metabolic state and energetic demands of neonatal and adult microglia differ as their functional roles change across the lifespan. The authors should either show that the metabolic pathways they implicate in neonatal microglia are also representative of adult microglia or perform additional experiments using microglia pooled from adult mice, especially because they link metabolites derived from neonatal microglia (presumably not under the effects of acute HFD) to improved performance in behavioral assays that utilize adult mice.</p>
<p>2. The authors demonstrate that 3 days of HFD increases circulating palmitate by CSF metabolomics and that microglia can readily metabolize palmitate, but the causal link between palmitate metabolism specifically by microglia and improved performance in behavioral paradigms remains unclear. A previous body of research, alluded to by the authors, suggests that astrocyte shuttling of lactate to neurons improves long-term and spatial memory. The authors should account for palmitate that also could be derived from astrocyte secretion into CSF, and the relative contribution compared to microglia-derived palmitate. Specifically, although microglia can metabolize the palmitate in circulation, there is no direct evidence that the palmitate from the HFD is directly shuttled to microglia and not, for example, to astrocytes (which also express CX3CR1). Thus, the Barnes Maze results could be attributed to multiple cell types. Furthermore, the evidence provided in Figure 5J is insufficient to claim a microglia-dependent mechanism without showing data from mice on HFD with and without microglia depletion (analogous to the third and fourth bars in panel K).</p>
<p>3. Given the emphasis on improved cognitive function, there is minimal discussion of the actual behavioral outcomes in both the results and discussion sections. The data that HFD-treated animals outperform controls should be presented in more detail both in the figure and in the text. For example, data from all days/trials of the Barnes Maze should be shown, including the day(s) HFD mice outperform controls. Furthermore, the authors should either cite additional literature or provide experimental evidence supporting the notion that microglia release of TCA-associated substrates into the extracellular milieu after HFD specifically benefits neuronal function cellularly or regionally in the brain, which could translate to improved performance in classical behavioral paradigms. The single reference included is a bit obscure, given the study found that increased lactate enhances fear memory which is a neural circuit not studied in the current manuscript. Are there no additional studies on more relevant metabolites (e.g., itaconate, succinate)?</p>
<p>Minor Points:</p>
<p>
1. In Figure 5J the latency to find the hole was noticeably higher (mean around 150s) than the latency in panel K (mean around 100s for controls, and 60s for Drp1MGWT on HFD). This suggests high variability between experiments using this modified version of the Barnes Maze, despite the authors' assertion that a &quot;standard&quot; Barnes Maze was employed and the results were reproducible at multiple institutions. Why do Drp1MGWT mice on control diet find the escape hole significantly faster than WT mice on control diet in panel J? Given the emphasis on cognitive improvement following acute HFD as a novel finding, the authors should explain this discrepancy.</p>
<p>2. The authors highlight in the graphical abstract and again in Figure 4A the formation of lipid droplets following palmitate exposure as evidence of that microglia can process fatty acids. They later suggest that a lack of substantial induction of lipid droplet accumulation suggests that microglia are metabolically wired to release carbon substrates to neighboring cells. Clarification as to the role of lipid droplet formation/accumulation in explaining the results would eliminate any possible confusion.</p>
<p>3. In many bar graphs showing relatively modest effects, it would be helpful to use symbols to also show the distribution of sample and animal replicates (especially behavioral paradigms).</p>
