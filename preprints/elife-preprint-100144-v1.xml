<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) in eukaryotic RNA is an epigenetic modification that is critical for RNA metabolism, gene expression regulation, and the development of organisms. Aberrant expression of m<sup>6</sup>A components appears in a variety of human diseases. RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has proven to be involved in sex determination regulated by <italic>Sxl</italic> and may affect X chromosome expression through the MSL complex. The dosage-related effects under the condition of genomic imbalance (i.e., aneuploidy) are related to various epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Here, we investigated the roles of RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification in unbalanced genomes using aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The results showed that the expression of m<sup>6</sup>A components changed significantly under genomic imbalance, and affected the abundance and genome-wide distribution of m<sup>6</sup>A, which may be related to the developmental abnormalities of aneuploids. The relationships between methylation status and classical dosage effect, dosage compensation, and inverse dosage effect were also studied. In addition, we demonstrated that RNA m<sup>6</sup>A methylation may affect dosage-dependent gene regulation through dosage-sensitive modifiers, alternative splicing, the MSL complex, and other processes. More interestingly, there seems to be a closely relationship between MSL complex and RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification. It is found that ectopically overexpressed MSL complex, especially the levels of H4K16Ac through MOF could influence the expression levels of m<sup>6</sup>A modification and genomic imbalance may be involved in this interaction. We found that m<sup>6</sup>A could affect the levels of H4K16Ac through MOF, a component of the MSL complex, and that genomic imbalance may be involved in this interaction. Altogether, our work reveals the dynamic and regulatory role of RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification in unbalanced genomes, and may shed new light on the mechanisms of aneuploidy-related developmental abnormalities and diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression in response to environmental changes and play important roles in the development of organisms and a variety of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jaenisch and Bird, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lence et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to DNA and chromatin modifications, which are well studied, more than one hundred RNA chemical modifications have been identified in cells to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Roundtree et al., 2017a</xref>). As a marker of post-transcriptional regulation, RNA modifications participate in almost all aspects of RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Roundtree et al., 2017a</xref>). <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most prevalent internal modification in many eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Roundtree et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), which widely affects RNA alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dominissini et al., 2012</xref>), export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Roundtree et al., 2017b</xref>), stability (Wang X et al., 2014), and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>). RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modifications have been found to be enriched on the transcripts of genes that regulate development and cell fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dominissini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Geula et al., 2015</xref>), and some m<sup>6</sup>A sites are regulated in a tissue- or disease-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zaccara et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the abnormal expression of m<sup>6</sup>A components is related to the tumorigenesis, proliferation, and metastasis of many types of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pinello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ma et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, it is of great significance to study RNA m<sup>6</sup>A methylation for revealing the mechanisms of gene expression regulation and human diseases.</p>
<p>At present, there are few studies on RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, possibly due to its relatively low abundance (m<sup>6</sup>A/A &lt; 0.2%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Haussmann et al., 2016</xref>), and the mutation of some m<sup>6</sup>A component genes will affect their viability and fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hongay and Orr-Weaver, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Haussmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kan et al., 2017</xref>). However, as a model organism with specific genetic and developmental advantages, <italic>Drosophila</italic> remains an excellent tool for studying the roles of epigenetic modifications in gene regulation, individual development, and disease process. Several components of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex (<italic>Ime4</italic>, <italic>dMettl14</italic>, and <italic>fl(2)d</italic> constitute the core complex, with <italic>vir</italic> and <italic>nito</italic> acting as cofactors) and a m<sup>6</sup>A reader protein (<italic>Ythdc1</italic>) have been identified, all of which have homologues in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lence et al., 2017</xref>). Deletion of the major methyltransferase gene <italic>Ime4</italic> or the reader <italic>Ythdc1</italic> causes locomotion defects, and the splicing of sex-determining factor <italic>Sxl</italic> is affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Haussmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lence et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kan et al., 2017</xref>). However, homozygous mutations in <italic>fl(2)d</italic>, <italic>vir</italic>, and <italic>nito</italic> were lethal, suggesting that these subunits have important functions other than methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Penn et al., 2008</xref>; Yan et al., 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lence et al., 2017</xref>). RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification has an obvious sexual dimorphism in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and reduced m<sup>6</sup>A levels severely decreased the survival of females. It is thought to be due to the derepression of <italic>msl-2</italic> caused by aberrantly spliced <italic>Sxl</italic>, which forms the Male Specific Lethal (MSL) complex that associates with the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Haussmann et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Dosage compensation is a widespread phenomenon in unbalanced genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lucchesi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birchler and Veitia, 2021</xref>). The deletion or duplication of some chromosomes rather than the whole chromosome set leads to genomic imbalance, that is, aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Orr et al., 2015</xref>). Aneuploid variation is usually detrimental to organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Birchler and Veitia, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Orr et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birchler and Veitia, 2021</xref>), and is associated with developmental abnormalities, mental retardation, and various congenital defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Williams et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sanchez-Pavon et al., 2021</xref>), possibly due to disorders in their gene expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Prestel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Letourneau et al., 2014</xref>). Studies across species have pointed out that there is genome-wide <italic>trans</italic> modulation in aneuploidy, and the genes on the varied chromosomes are compensated to a certain extent, while genes located on the rest of the genome are mainly regulated in the opposite direction to the changes of chromosome numbers, which is known as the inverse dosage effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Birchler and Veitia, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Sun et al., 2013c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Shi et al., 2021</xref>). Histone modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zhang et al., 2021a</xref>), chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Birchler, 2016</xref>), lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>) and microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Shi et al., 2022</xref>) have all been shown to play a role in genomic imbalance.</p>
<p>Because of the haploinsufficiency for X-linked genes, heterogametic individuals in organisms with XY sex determination systems could be regarded as analogous to aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Disteche, 2016</xref>), including humans and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Some studies have linked histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) and non-coding <italic>roX</italic> RNAs to the dosage compensation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Park et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Conrad et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, the compensation of X chromosome in human is thought to be regulated by lncRNA X-inactive specific transcript (<italic>XIST</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jordan et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification indirectly affects gene expression through <italic>Sxl</italic> and <italic>msl-2</italic>; while in human, m<sup>6</sup>A methylation of the key lncRNA <italic>XIST</italic> is necessary for the silencing of gene transcription on one of the female X chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Patil et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, most tumor cells have genomic instability and high levels of aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ben-David and Amon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chiarle, 2021</xref>), and at the same time, m<sup>6</sup>A component genes are often aberrantly expressed in various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pinello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ma et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>An increasing number of studies have found that dosage-related effects in aneuploidy may be the integration of multiple modulations rather than through a single mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Prestel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Birchler, 2016</xref>). The effects of genomic imbalance are complicated, and the model of dosage compensation and global gene regulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has been extended to autosomal aneuploidies and sex chromosome aneuploid metafemales where MSL complexes are not assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sun et al., 2013b</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zhang et al., 2021b</xref>). In addition, genomic imbalance and <italic>trans</italic> regulatory mechanisms in other species such as maize, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and humans have also been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Raznahan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Shi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">San Roman et al., 2023</xref>). To reveal the role of RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification in unbalanced genomes, we studied the dynamic changes and regulatory functions of m<sup>6</sup>A methylation under genetic imbalance conditions using autosomal and sex chromosome aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> maintained in our laboratory. Meanwhile, dosage-sensitive modifiers, differential alternative splicing events, the MSL complex and other factors that may mediate the relationships between RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification and the dosage-related effects of aneuploidy were also investigated. In summary, we provided a comprehensive picture of RNA m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in unbalanced genomes.</p>

<title>The responses of m<sup>6</sup>A components under genomic imbalance</title>
<p>RNA m<sup>6</sup>A methylation is a reversible epigenetic modification, and its dynamic process is mediated by m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferases (writers), demethylases (erasers), and m<sup>6</sup>A recognition proteins (readers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zaccara et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We first detected the expression of m<sup>6</sup>A components in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae with karyotypes of normal diploids and trisomies that have an additional chromosome arm using RT-qPCR to determine whether RNA m<sup>6</sup>A dynamics are affected by correlative enzymes in unbalanced genomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). It was found that the transcription levels of most m<sup>6</sup>A writers and the major m<sup>6</sup>A reader are down-regulated in aneuploids compared with their respective sex-corresponding controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Unlike the other components, the cofactor <italic>vir</italic> of methyltransferase complex is up-regulated in trisomy 2L females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Haussmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lence et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kan et al., 2017</xref>). Because RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification is enriched in the nervous system of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the brains of aneuploid third instar larvae were also used to detect the expression of m<sup>6</sup>A components. As expected, a decreased expression trend of m<sup>6</sup>A components similar to that of the whole larvae was observed (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>Previous studies have pointed out that the m<sup>6</sup>A methylomes have temporal and spatial specificity in the development process of organisms, especially for embryonic development and cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Meyer and Jaffrey, 2014</xref>; Wang Y et al., 2014). Aberrant expression of m<sup>6</sup>A components may cause defects in embryogenesis and even early embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zhong et al., 2008</xref>; Wang Y et al., 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Geula et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we designed probes of m<sup>6</sup>A components (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>) to examine the mRNA expression and localization patterns during early embryonic development of aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> using high-resolution TSA-FISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lecuyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jandura et al., 2017</xref>). The results showed that the subembryonic distribution patterns of the five components of m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex and one m<sup>6</sup>A reading protein are similar in wildtype and aneuploidies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C,D</xref>; <xref rid="figs1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-F</xref>). At the blastoderm stage (stage 1-5), the probe signals of m<sup>6</sup>A components are widely distributed in the surface cell layer, yolk plasma, yolk cortex, and show a pattern of basal enrichment (<xref rid="figs1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-F</xref>). For the gastrulae at stage 6-11, the transcripts of m<sup>6</sup>A components are mainly located in head, amnioproctodeal invagination, germ band, and as in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lence et al., 2016</xref>), and show an enrichment in neuroectoderm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref rid="figs1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-F</xref>). At later stages of embryonic development (stages 12-13 and 14-17), the probes are distributed in brain, ventral nerve cord, midgut, and salivary gland (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref rid="figs1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-F</xref>).</p>
<p>By observing the subcellular localization of the probe signals of m<sup>6</sup>A components at higher magnification, it can be found that most of the mRNAs of these genes have nuclei-associated localization patterns (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref rid="figs1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A’-F’</xref>). In the early and late stages of embryonic development, the probe signals of <italic>Ime4</italic>, <italic>dMettl14</italic>, <italic>fl(2)d</italic>, <italic>vir</italic>, and <italic>Ythdc1</italic> form dense small foci near the nucleus, which is a perinuclear distribution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref rid="figs1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A’-F’</xref>). For <italic>nito</italic>, in addition to the perinuclear signals, there is also an obvious signal of intranuclear localization during early embryogenesis, which is manifested as one or two small foci in the blastoderm nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref rid="figs1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E’</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there seems to be no difference in the localization of the transcripts of m<sup>6</sup>A components that we detected in aneuploidy and wildtype embryos, the expression levels of these genes, as determined by relative fluorescence intensity, are significantly changed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E,F</xref>; <xref rid="figs1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A”-F”</xref>). Except for the irregular fluctuations at early embryonic stages, the expression levels of most m<sup>6</sup>A components in aneuploids are lower than those in wildtype at more mature stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E,F</xref>; <xref rid="figs1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A”-F”</xref>), which is similar to the trend we detected in third instar larvae (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The transcripts of m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase and reader protein have specific subembryonic and subcellular localization patterns in the development of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, which may be a mechanism to regulate cellular functions, and ensure appropriate cell growth and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lecuyer et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Genome-wide mapping of RNA m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic></title>
<p>Subsequently, we detected the global levels of RNA m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in wildtype and aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae to determine whether m<sup>6</sup>A abundance is altered under the condition of genomic imbalance due to modulation by transmethylases. The overall abundance of m6A was represented by the m<sup>6</sup>A/A ratio in total RNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). It was found that the m<sup>6</sup>A abundance of wildtype males is higher than that of females, but both are lower than 0.2%, which is consistent with the finding that m<sup>6</sup>A levels in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are relatively low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Haussmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lence et al., 2016</xref>). Females with triple chromosome 2 left arms (2L) and metafemales with triple X chromosomes have significantly higher m<sup>6</sup>A abundances than diploid females, whereas there is no significant difference between trisomy 2L males and wildtype males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, genomic imbalance can affect the m<sup>6</sup>A methylation status to some extent, and this epigenetic modification is different between males and females. However, the m<sup>6</sup>A abundance in aneuploidies did not follow the expression levels of transmethylases.</p>

<p>To obtain m<sup>6</sup>A mapping across the transcriptome of aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic>, samples with different karyotypes were used for m<sup>6</sup>A methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq). By identifying consistent peaks in two biological replicates, approximately ten thousand m<sup>6</sup>A peaks were found in wildtype females and males, whereas there were less than half the number of methylation sites in the three kinds of aneuploidies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). When these m<sup>6</sup>A sites were annotated according to the nearest genes, the changes in the number of m<sup>6</sup>A-marked genes in samples of different genotypes were in accordance with that of m<sup>6</sup>A peaks, in which there are about 2,500 m<sup>6</sup>A-marked genes in wildtype and about 1,000 m<sup>6</sup>A-modified genes in trisomies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Both the number of m<sup>6</sup>A peaks and the number of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified genes are the least in trisomy 2L females (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,C</xref>). The changes in the number of RNA methylation sites in aneuploids did not coincide with the changes of overall m<sup>6</sup>A abundance, but instead matched the expression of m<sup>6</sup>A components. We speculate that this may be caused by the nonuniformity and heterogeneity of RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification, including the tissue specificity, the developmental specificity, the different numbers of m<sup>6</sup>A sites in one transcript, the different proportions of methylated transcripts, et cetera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Meyer and Jaffrey, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zaccara et al., 2019</xref>). Analysis of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified reads in wildtype and aneuploidy MeRIP samples showed that the expression levels at m<sup>6</sup>A sites in aneuploidies are significantly higher than that in wildtype (Mann Whitney U test p-values &lt; 0.001; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), which confirmed our hypothesis.</p>
<p>These results suggest that RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification exhibits greater heterogeneity in unbalanced genomes.</p>
<p>We next studied the overall characteristics of m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in aneuploid and control <italic>Drosophila</italic>. m<sup>6</sup>A peaks are localized along all autosomes and sex chromosomes, and the numbers of peaks are correlated with chromosome length (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Methylation sites are widely distributed on 5’UTR (30-50%), 3’UTR (10-15%), promoter (15-20%), and internal exons (20-35%), and the aneuploidies appeared to have a higher proportion of 5’UTR peaks and a lower proportion of exon peaks than the wildtype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). The highest values of density distributions of the length of exons containing m<sup>6</sup>A peaks are around 250 bp, and approximately 90% of the exons are longer than the typical 140 bp (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). <italic>De novo</italic> motif analysis of m<sup>6</sup>A methylation peaks in each sample showed that the top-ranked motif is consistent with the conserved m<sup>6</sup>A motif DRACH (D=G/A/U, R=G/A, H=U/A/C; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). In addition, enrichment analysis of the known motif DRACH showed that it is significantly enriched in all samples, and more than 97% of the m<sup>6</sup>A sites have this sequence (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>There are 370 common genes to which the m<sup>6</sup>A peaks were annotated in all genotypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). We classified the m<sup>6</sup>A-modified genes in each sample and found that they were mostly protein-coding genes, whereas only about 7% were ncRNAs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). As described in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zaccara et al., 2019</xref>), most methylated RNAs have one m<sup>6</sup>A peak (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D-H</xref>). However, there are still some genes whose transcripts can be highly methylated and contain more than five m<sup>6</sup>A sites (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D-I</xref>). It was found that transcription factors were significantly enriched in 70 genes with more than 5 m<sup>6</sup>A peaks in both wildtype and aneuploidy (Fisher’s exact test p-value = 7.7e-4; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>; <xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Thus, specific types of genes may be preferentially targeted by m<sup>6</sup>A modification, such as transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kan et al., 2017</xref>). Analysis of the functions of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified genes in each sample revealed that they were enriched for a large number of common functions, among which the most significant were those related to morphogenesis, development, and growth (<xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The 141 GO terms shared by the five genotypes were summarized and found to include functions about metabolism, regulation, cellular processes, signaling pathways, behavior, and immune response (<xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). Through pathway enrichment analysis of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified genes, 9 terms were found to be consistently enriched in all samples, including MAPK signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway, TGF-β pathway, etc. (<xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D-F</xref>).</p>

<title>Differentially methylated peaks (DMPs) and their associated genes</title>
<p>We then searched for the differential methylation peaks (DMPs) in autosomal and sex chromosome aneuploidies compared with wildtype <italic>Drosophila</italic> of their corresponding sex. The number of DMPs and the changing trend of DMP methylation status are shown in the Figures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-D</xref>). In trisomy 2L females, the number of upregulated DMPs (1,131) is less than that of downregulated DMPs (1,602). In trisomy 2L males, the number of upregulated DMPs (1,521) is slightly higher than that of downregulated DMPs (1,259). In metafemales, the number of upregulated DMPs (1,393) is higher than that of downregulated DMPs (926) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-D</xref>). More DMP-associated genes were found in autosomal aneuploidies than in sex chromosome aneuploidy (trisomy 2L female = 2,148, trisomy 2L male = 2,055, metafemale = 1,771; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Also, the total number of peaks after the differential analysis would be different from the number of m<sup>6</sup>A peaks identified in the previous section, because the analysis software merged and recalculated the peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Stark and Brown, 2013</xref>).</p>

<p>DMPs are distributed on all chromosomes (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Specifically, the MeRIP-Seq signal intensity at the location of DMPs showed that the m<sup>6</sup>A-marked reads in trisomies are denser than those of wildtypes, especially on the triple chromosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-H</xref>). The density of reads on chromosome 2L of trisomy 2L <italic>Drosophila</italic> is higher than that on other chromosomes, while the density of reads on chromosome X of metafemales is significantly higher than that of autosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-H</xref>). Previous studies on aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> showed that the expression levels of genes on chromosomes with increased copy numbers were mostly similar to those in diploids, and the expression of genes on unvaried chromosomes were widely inverse regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Sun et al., 2013c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Birchler, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). It can be concluded that the changes in the density of reads at DMP sites are not due to a direct gene dosage effect. Similar results were obtained by counting the methylation status of cis and trans transcripts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I-K</xref>). Overall, the transcripts of genes located on the varied chromosomes in three trisomies have more up-regulated DMPs than down-regulated DMPs, which is more obvious in metafemales (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I-K</xref>). In trisomy 2L females and males, genes localized on other autosomes have a higher proportion of down-regulated DMPs, while the X-linked <italic>trans</italic> genes show sexual dimorphism and X chromosome-specific response to genomic imbalance. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I,J</xref>). For metafemales, the transcripts of <italic>trans</italic> genes have similar numbers of up-regulated and down-regulated DMPs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). Therefore, <italic>cis</italic> genes in trisomy generally possessed a higher proportion of up-regulated DMP-associated transcripts, whereas the methylation states of <italic>trans</italic> genes are variable, depending on the identities of varied chromosomes and their genomic locations. The above results give us reason to speculate that the changes of m<sup>6</sup>A methylation may affect dosage compensation of <italic>cis</italic>-genes and inverse dosage modulation of <italic>trans</italic>-genes in aneuploidy.</p>
<p>The distribution of DMPs along gene features includes 5’UTR (30-35%), 3’UTR (20-25%), promoter (10-25%), and internal exon (25-35%), among which the proportion of 3’UTR is higher than that of all m<sup>6</sup>A sites (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The length distributions of exons with DMPs are similar to that of all m<sup>6</sup>A-modified exons (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). <italic>De novo</italic> motif analysis of the sequences where DMPs are located or enrichment analysis of the known motif DRACH both showed that DMP sites are enriched for the conserved motif of m<sup>6</sup>A (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). There are also similarities between the types of DMPs-associated genes and m<sup>6</sup>A-marked genes (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The DMP-associated genes of the three aneuploidies have complex overlapping relationships (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Most DMP-associated genes have one differentially methylated site, and only a few genes contained more than three DMPs (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H-J</xref>). There are 1,042 common DMP-associated genes in all trisomies, of which 71 were transcription factors and were significantly enriched (Fisher’s exact test p-value = 6.9e-5; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,B</xref>). We speculate that these differentially methylated transcription factors may play an important role in the regulation of gene expression and development of aneuploidy.</p>

<p>Functional enrichment analysis showed that genes with up-regulated DMPs in three trisomies were enriched for 153 common functions, while the genes with down-regulated DMPs shared only 6 functions (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Similarly, genes with up-regulated DMPs were enriched for more consistent pathways in all aneuploids (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the functions of DMP-associated genes are the same as those of m<sup>6</sup>A-marked genes, and these genes are also enriched for cell fate commitment, dorsal/ventral pattern formation, sex differentiation, post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, and other additional GO terms. We found that many DMP-associated genes have functions related to gene expression regulation and dosage compensation, including some components of MSL complex (<italic>msl-1</italic>, <italic>msl-3</italic>, <italic>lncRNA:roX1</italic>) and the major sex-determining factor <italic>Sxl</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).

<title>Relationships between m<sup>6</sup>A and dosage-related modulation of gene expression in aneuploidy</title>
<p>To explore the relationships between RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification and gene expression regulation under genomic imbalance, we combined the results of MeRIP-Seq and RNA-seq, and performed a comprehensive analysis.

<p>By analyzing the crossover of different groups of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified genes and genes with canonical dosage effect, dosage compensation, and inverse dosage effect, we further revealed the relationships between m<sup>6</sup>A-modified genes and dosage-related effects in aneuploidy (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F-H</xref>).

<p>Furthermore, the distributions of m<sup>6</sup>A modification sites along gene features in genes with classical dosage-related effects were also studied (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I-K</xref>). We found that in wildtype females, trisomy 2L females, and metafemales, a higher proportion of m<sup>6</sup>A sites on genes with canonical dosage compensation and inverse dosage effect are distributed in the 5’UTR than genes with dosage effects (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I,K</xref>). At the same time, this proportion is higher in trisomy than in wildtype. In contrast to females, trisomy 2L males have a higher proportion of 5’UTR RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification on dosage effect genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>). The above study again demonstrates the sexual dimorphism of RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification in response to aneuploidy. In addition, it has been suggested that m<sup>6</sup>A residues in the 5’UTR region may have unique regulatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Luo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Meyer and Jaffrey, 2014</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the high level of 5’UTR m<sup>6</sup>A modification on genes with dosage compensation and inverse dosage effect might regulate the down-regulation of these genes.</p>
<p>Dozens of dosage-sensitive modifiers have been identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, whose dosage changes can negatively or positively regulate the gene expression across the whole genome like aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Birchler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Birchler and Veitia, 2007</xref>). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks between dosage-sensitive modifiers and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were constructed to investigate whether RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification could participate in the gene regulatory networks in unbalanced genomes through these regulators (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). In the three types of aneuploidies, there are more dosage-sensitive modifiers with up-regulated DMPs than with down-regulated DMPs. The regulators <italic>ox</italic> and <italic>Vha55</italic> without DMPs interact with a large number of significantly up-regulated DEGs in trisomy 2L females and metafemales, whereas these two regulators interact with a small number of down-regulated DEGs in trisomy 2L males. Up-regulated DMP-associated regulators <italic>wg</italic>, <italic>Uba1</italic>, <italic>ap</italic>, <italic>Atg1</italic>, <italic>osa</italic>, <italic>rdx</italic>, and <italic>sd</italic> in trisomy 2L females mainly interacted with significantly down-regulated DEGs (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>); and up-regulated DMP-associated regulators <italic>Uba1</italic>, <italic>osa</italic>, and <italic>sd</italic> in metafemales also interacted with down-regulated DEGs (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

<title>Alterations of m<sup>6</sup>A may be involved in differential alternative splicing in imbalanced genomes</title>
<p>Next, we analyzed the differential alternative splicing events in aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

<p>In all trisomy <italic>Drosophila</italic>, 10 genes are shown to be differentially expressed, with their transcripts also being differentially spliced and differentially methylated. Three of them are illustrated below [<italic>su(Hw)</italic>, <italic>Ppn</italic>, and <italic>CG13124</italic>]. <italic>su(Hw)</italic> is a component of the gypsy chromatin insulator complex, which is a regulatory element that establish independent domains of transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Roseman et al., 1993</xref>). Due to the close relationship between <italic>su(Hw)</italic> and second-site modifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rabinow and Birchler, 1989</xref>), and <italic>BEAF-32</italic>, which is also an insulator DNA-binding protein, has been proposed as a possible inverse dosage regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gurudatta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zhang et al., 2021b</xref>), We speculated that the transcription factor <italic>su(Hw)</italic> may also be a dosage-sensitive regulator. The data showed that the transcription levels of <italic>su(Hw)</italic> are up-regulated in all three aneuploidies, and there is a consistent m<sup>6</sup>A modification site with significantly down-regulated methylation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). At the same time, the transcripts of this gene have a common alternative 5’ splice site (A5SS), and its inclusion levels in trisomies are down-regulated, that is, more short transcript isoforms are generated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). <italic>Ppn</italic> gene encodes an essential extracellular matrix protein that influences cell rearrangements. The expression level of <italic>Ppn</italic> and its m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in 5’UTR region are both significantly up-regulated in trisomies (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In addition, an alternatively spliced exon is significantly less frequently skipped in all aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). The third gene, <italic>CG13124</italic>, which may be involved in involved in regulation of translational initiation, is up-regulated in aneuploids. Two m<sup>6</sup>A sites in its 5’UTR region are methylated at higher levels in all aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Its transcripts also have a common significantly different exon-skipping event (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1I</xref>).</p>
<p>These results indicate that there are complicated relationships among RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification, gene expression, and alternative splicing under the condition of genome imbalance. RNA splicing seems to be more closely related to m<sup>6</sup>A methylation than gene transcription. The m<sup>6</sup>A sites located in 5’UTR show remarkable changes in methylation levels in aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and may be involved in the regulation of some differential alternative splicing events, such as exon skipping.</p>

<title>Interactions between m<sup>6</sup>A and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Male Specific Lethal (MSL) complex</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that m<sup>6</sup>A components are involved in regulating the alternative splicing of sex-determining gene <italic>Sxl</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and the deficiency of m<sup>6</sup>A writers or readers will lead to the reduction of female-specific isoforms of <italic>Sxl</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Haussmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lence et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kan et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Sxl</italic> is also a direct target of RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kan et al., 2017</xref>). We found that <italic>Sxl</italic> transcripts are both differentially methylated and differentially spliced in three kinds of aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A,B</xref>). For trisomy 2L females and metafemales, two common m<sup>6</sup>A peaks are significantly up-regulated in the 5’UTR region of <italic>Sxl</italic>. However, trisomy 2L males have a significantly down-regulated m<sup>6</sup>A peak in the 5’UTR (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Meanwhile, multiple junctions of <italic>Sxl</italic> transcripts undergo complicated alternative splicing in aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic>, including SE, A5SS, alternative 3’ splice site (A3SS), and mutually exclusive exons (MXE) types (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). By checking the distributions of RNA sequencing reads near the male-specific exon (namely the third exon), it can be observed that there are almost no mapped reads on the third exon in wildtype females, trisomy 2L females, and metafemales, while the reads mapped to the second and fourth exons are highly prevalent (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). On the contrary, wildtype males and trisomy 2L males have a substantial number of reads on the third exon, accompanied by a smaller number of reads on the adjacent two exons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Notably, we found that a small number of RNA-seq reads aligned to the male-specific exon appeared in trisomy 2L females, which was identified as an SE-type differential alternative splicing event (FDR = 7.4e-7; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). This variation may be related to the abnormal m<sup>6</sup>A methylation levels under the condition of genomic imbalance.</p>

<p>The abnormal expression of m<sup>6</sup>A components reduces the survival of female <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which is thought to be probably caused by the expression of downstream MSL complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Haussmann et al., 2016</xref>). To investigate the interplay between the MSL complex and m<sup>6</sup>A modification, we examined the responses of m<sup>6</sup>A regulators in transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains with MSL2 mutation or overexpression (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A-E</xref>; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C,D</xref>). The results revealed significant changes in the expression profiles of m<sup>6</sup>A regulators in MSL2 transgenic strains, especially the m<sup>6</sup>A reader protein Ythdc1, which increased tens of fold in MSL2 knockdown and overexpressed <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C,D</xref>; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We also observed that the trends of Ime4 expression in females and males were the same in MSL2-overexpressed <italic>Drosophila</italic>, whereas there was obvious sexual dimorphism in MSL2-knockdown samples (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C,D</xref>), which may be due to the ectopic assembly of MSL complex in MSL2-overexpressed females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zhang et al., 2021a</xref>). In addition, we also examined the expression levels of MSL2 when <italic>Ythdc1</italic> was knocked down, and found that MSL2 was also significantly increased in females (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>). All these results strongly suggest a potential relationship between MSL2 and Ythdc1. Next, we further compared the overall abundance of m<sup>6</sup>A in MSL2 transgenic and wildtype <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E,F</xref>). The results showed that m<sup>6</sup>A levels were significantly decreased with MSL2 knockdown and significantly increased with MSL2 overexpression in females (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). However, overexpression of MSL2 failed to exert a discernible effect on m<sup>6</sup>A abundance in males, although m<sup>6</sup>A level decreased with MSL2 depletion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7F</xref>). This difference between the sexes may be due to the endogenous MSL2 in males, but not in females.</p>
<p>In the next, we investigated the expression of m<sup>6</sup>A regulators in aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> overexpressing MSL2, according the results that the MSL complex could be regulated directly or indirectly by m<sup>6</sup>A modification, and the sexual dimorphism of RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification in response to aneuploidy. It is found that the transcription levels of m<sup>6</sup>A regulators are significantly up-regulated in the brains of most aneuploid larvae that overexpressed MSL2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>). These results are not completely consistent with the quantitative results when MSL2 was overexpressed in diploids, which may be related to the effect of unbalanced genomes. We also used TSA-FISH to detect the expression and distribution of m<sup>6</sup>A components during embryogenesis in aneuploidies overexpressing MSL2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>; <xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The subembryonic and subcellular distributions of mRNAs for m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferases and reading protein did not appear to be affected by ectopic expression of MSL2 in aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-F</xref>; <xref rid="figs1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A’-F’</xref>). But the relative expression of m<sup>6</sup>A components showed diverse dynamics, among which the levels of the most important methyltransferase Ime4 are significantly up-regulated in autosomal trisomy and sex chromosome trisomy with MSL2 overexpression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>; <xref rid="figs1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A”-F”</xref>). Considering that unbalanced genomes can affect the expression of MSL complex subunits, and the above results show that there is a close relationship between MSL complex and m<sup>6</sup>A modification, we speculate that unbalanced genomes may influence the expression of m<sup>6</sup>A regulators, possibly through the MSL complex.</p>

<title>Relationship of H4K16Ac with m<sup>6</sup>A modification</title>
<p>As an important component of the MSL complex, MOF is a histone acetyltransferase that specifically acetylates histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16Ac), thereby affecting chromatin structure and functions, and activating transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kind et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Conrad et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies have elucidated the regulatory role of m<sup>6</sup>A in histone modifications, and histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) also plays a role in recruiting methyltransferase complexes to deposit m<sup>6</sup>A markers on RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2020</xref>). To investigate the functions of MOF-mediated H4K16Ac on RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification, we analyzed RNA-seq data from <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains overexpressing MOF (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H-J</xref>). We found obvious changes in the expression of m<sup>6</sup>A regulators in strains overexpressing MOF, with the levels of almost all m<sup>6</sup>A regulators being elevated (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). It was also observed that after overexpression of MOF, the increasing trends of m<sup>6</sup>A regulators in females and males were not exactly the same, mostly showing more pronounced increases in females, except for Mettl3 (Ime4) and dMettl14. According to the results of RT-qPCR, the expression of Ythdc1 was decreased in MOF knockdown strains and increased in MOF overexpression strains (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1J</xref>); meanwhile, the expression levels of MOF were significantly reduced in <italic>Ythdc1</italic> knockdown strains (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). These results were further verified by polytene chromosome immunofluorescence experiments (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D,E</xref>).

These results suggest that MOF-mediated acetylation modification can have a certain effect on RNA m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in a sexually dimorphic manner, which may be due to the endogenous MSL complex and the imbalance of X chromosome dosage in males.</p>

Quantitative analysis of polytene chromosome immunofluorescence results in <italic>Ythdc1</italic> knockdown <italic>Drosophila</italic> showed that the changes of H4K16Ac levels also showed sexual dimorphism (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F,G</xref>).

These observed changes in H4K16Ac were consistent with the pattern of changes in MOF protein in <italic>Ythdc1</italic> knockdown <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains, suggesting that m<sup>6</sup>A modification may affect H4K16Ac levels through the mediation of MOF. To further study whether unbalanced genomes are involved in the interaction between m<sup>6</sup>A and histone acetylation modification, we also analyzed RNA sequencing data from trisomy 2L <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains overexpressing MOF. The data showed that overexpression of MOF in trisomy 2L resulted in significant changes in the expression of m<sup>6</sup>A regulators, with a trend different from that observed in diploids (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>).

The global changes of gene regulatory networks in unbalanced genomes involves various epigenetic mechanisms, including histone modification, chromatin remodeling, lncRNAs, microRNAs, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Birchler, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zhang et al., 2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Shi et al., 2022</xref>). This study demonstrated that the expression of m<sup>6</sup>A components was altered under genomic imbalance, leading to dynamic changes in the entire methylome. Potential intermediaries by which m<sup>6</sup>A modification could affect <italic>trans</italic> regulation and achieve dosage compensation in aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> were also investigated, such as dosage-sensitive modifiers, alternative splicing events, and the MSL complex.</p>
<p>Our experiments show that the expression levels of most m<sup>6</sup>A component genes are significantly down-regulated in aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Depletion of m<sup>6</sup>A components interferes with the development of animals and plants, especially leading to impaired self-renewal and differentiation of embryonic stem cells, defects in embryonic development, and even early embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Granadino et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Horiuchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Raffel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Luo et al., 2014</xref>; Wang Y et al., 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Geula et al., 2015</xref>). We demonstrated by TSA-FISH that appropriate temporal and spatial specific distributions of the transcripts for m<sup>6</sup>A components are vital during <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-F</xref>; <xref rid="figs1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The abnormal expression of m<sup>6</sup>A-related genes may affect the development of aneuploid embryos.</p>
<p>In previous studies, the abundance of m<sup>6</sup>A modification is usually positively correlated with the number of m<sup>6</sup>A peaks and m<sup>6</sup>A-marked genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Luo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>). However, our results obviously did not conform to this rule, with higher m<sup>6</sup>A abundance and fewer MeRIP-Seq peaks in aneuploids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref>). This reflects the complexity and heterogeneity of m<sup>6</sup>A modification. We suspect that in aneuploidy many RNAs may be lost that are methylated at a low level in wildtype, and possess a higher proportion of highly methylated RNAs. Analysis of the expression levels at each m<sup>6</sup>A site confirmed our hypothesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, this phenomenon represents an imbalance in m<sup>6</sup>A methylation caused by aneuploidy.</p>
<p>The distribution of m<sup>6</sup>A sites on gene features, m<sup>6</sup>A consensus motifs, biotypes of m<sup>6</sup>A-marked genes, enriched functions and pathways of methylated genes in aneuploidies are similar to those in wildtype. We also found that genes highly methylated in all genotypes are enriched for transcription factors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). It is consistent with previous studies suggesting that transcription regulatory genes may be preferentially targeted by m<sup>6</sup>A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kan et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>We also analyzed the characteristics of DMPs and DMP-associated genes in trisomies. By observing the distributions of MeRIP-Seq reads around DMP sites, it can be found that the densities of m<sup>6</sup>A-marked reads on chromosome 2L are relatively higher in trisomy 2L females and males (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Meanwhile, metafemales with triple X have a higher density of m<sup>6</sup>A-marked reads on chromosome X (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Previous studies have found that there is dosage compensation for <italic>cis</italic>-genes in autosomal and sex chromosome aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and the expression of most genes on varied chromosomes approaches diploid levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sun et al., 2013b</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">c</xref>). Therefore, the up-regulation of m<sup>6</sup>A levels is not directly caused by the increased number of chromosomes. A recent study found that the selective enrichment of m<sup>6</sup>A methylation may play a role as a transcript degradation signal in dosage compensation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rücklé et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that changes in m<sup>6</sup>A levels in aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> may affect its dosage compensation and inverse dosage effect by regulating the stability of the transcripts. In addition, more up-regulated DMPs are detected in trisomy 2L males and metafemales, while trisomy 2L females have more down-regulated DMPs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-D</xref>). Combined with the fact that the survival rate of trisomy 2L female larvae is relatively lower than that of the other two trisomies, it can be speculated that the regulation of DMPs may affect the survival and development of aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>
<p>Gene expression in unbalanced genomes is extensively modulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sun et al., 2013b</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Raznahan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Shi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zhang et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">San Roman et al., 2023</xref>). Previous studies have analyzed the transcriptome data of autosomal and sex chromosome trisomic <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and found that most of the genes on the triple chromosomes were compensated, and the ratios of their expression levels to wildtype were approximately 1; meanwhile, the expression of genes on other chromosomes was close to two-thirds of that of the wildtype, which was called an inverse dosage effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sun et al., 2013b</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zhang et al., 2021b</xref>). We investigated the relationships between genes with different m<sup>6</sup>A methylation status and genes modulated by classical dosage-related effects (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F-H</xref>). The results showed that for aneuploid females, genes methylated in both trisomy and control are significantly enriched in dosage compensated <italic>cis</italic> genes and inverse dosage effect <italic>trans</italic> genes, and genes not methylated at all are enriched in dosage effect genes. However, in aneuploid males, methylated genes are associated with gene dosage effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F-H</xref>). We also found that the proportion of 5’UTR m<sup>6</sup>A peaks on dosage compensation and inverse dosage effect genes are increased in aneuploid females (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I-K</xref>). These results provide evidence of sexual dimorphism in the relationships between RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification and dosage-related effects. m<sup>6</sup>A located in the 5’UTR generally shows higher tissue specificity and richer dynamic changes, and may have unique regulatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dominissini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Meyer and Jaffrey, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gilbert et al., 2016</xref>). The increased proportion of m<sup>6</sup>A in the 5’UTR of genes with classical dosage-related effects in aneuploidies suggests that m<sup>6</sup>A modification may be involved in the regulation of dosage-dependent genes.</p>
<p>Dosage-related effects of aneuploidy are thought to be caused by dosage-sensitive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Shi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). Some dosage-sensitive regulators have been identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and changes in the dosage of individual regulatory genes can mimic the effects of aneuploidy in the whole genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Birchler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Xie and Birchler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zhang et al., 2021b</xref>). Most dosage-sensitive regulators are transcription factors, signal transduction components, and chromatin proteins, which have in common being members of macromolecular complexes or having multicomponent interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Birchler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Birchler and Veitia, 2007</xref>). We studied the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of dosage-dependent genes and their protein-protein interaction networks in aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The results showed that there are complex interactions between dosage-sensitive regulators and differentially expressed genes. Among them, most of the DEGs located on the unvaried chromosomes are down-regulated, indicating that the dosage-sensitive regulators mainly have negative effects on <italic>trans</italic> target genes. There are more regulatory genes with up-regulated DMPs than down-regulated DMPs in all three aneuploidies, and many of the regulators with up-regulated methylation are connected with interactors that have down-regulated expression.</p>
<p>We comprehensively analyzed the relationships among RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification, gene expression levels, and alternative splicing. The data showed that differential m<sup>6</sup>A methylation under genomic imbalance appeared to be more closely associated with differential alternative splicing (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-C</xref>). This phenomenon is reasonable because the mutation or knockout of <italic>Ime4</italic>, <italic>dMettl14</italic>, <italic>fl(2)d</italic>, and <italic>Ythdc1</italic> has been found to affect a large number of alternative splicing events in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and <italic>fl(2)d</italic> itself is thought to encode a splicing factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Penn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Haussmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lence et al., 2016</xref>). A small set of transcripts are simultaneously differentially m<sup>6</sup>A methylated, differentially expressed, and differentially alternative spliced in aneuploidies, including the transcription factor <italic>su(Hw)</italic>, which may be a dosage-sensitive regulator (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G-H</xref>). Besides, m<sup>6</sup>A modification in the 5’UTR regions may play a special role in some differential alternative splicing events (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F-I</xref>).</p>
<p>RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has been shown to be involved in the alternative splicing of <italic>Sxl</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lence et al., 2017</xref>). The deletion of some m<sup>6</sup>A components in females will result in a reduction of female-specific splicing of <italic>Sxl</italic> and an increase of the inclusion of the third exon, along with phenotypic sexual transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Haussmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lence et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kan et al., 2017</xref>). We found that <italic>Sxl</italic> transcripts of aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> are both differentially m<sup>6</sup>A methylated and differentially spliced (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-B</xref>). Among multiple alternative splicing events, trisomy 2L females have a higher level of the third exon inclusion compared with wildtype females (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>), which may be related to the differential methylation at 5’UTR of the <italic>Sxl</italic> transcripts.</p>
<p>Some studies proposed that the deletion of RNA m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase Ime4 harms the survival of female <italic>Drosophila</italic> because of the insufficient inhibition of <italic>msl-2</italic> caused by decreased <italic>Sxl</italic> levels, which in turn leads to up-regulation of X-linked genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Haussmann et al., 2016</xref>). However, other studies have found that the expression of genes on the X chromosome in females with ectopic expression of MSL2 does not increase twofold, that is, the MSL complex does not directly mediate dosage compensation, and the global inverse dosage effect caused by the imbalance of sex chromosomes is the basis for dosage compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Birchler, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sun et al., 2013a</xref>). Therefore, the lethality of the lack of m<sup>6</sup>A in female <italic>Drosophila</italic> may not be directly caused by up-regulation of X-linked genes through ectopic assembly of MSL complex, and the specific reasons need to be further studied.</p>
<p>The functions of MSL complex in dynamic regulation of global gene expression in aneuploid genomes has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zhang et al., 2021a</xref>). Here, we found that MSL2, a structure component of MSL complex, not only affects the expression of m<sup>6</sup>A regulators, but also influences the overall abundance of m<sup>6</sup>A in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C-F</xref>), proving a close relationship between the MSL complex and RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification. In addition, under the condition of genomic imbalance, the relative expression of m<sup>6</sup>A components was also changed in larvae and embryos of MSL2-overexpressed trisomies (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G,H</xref>). Another component of the MSL complex, MOF, which mediates histone acetylation and transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kind et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Conrad et al., 2012</xref>), is also closely associated with the m<sup>6</sup>A reader Ythdc1. Overexpression of MOF increased the expression of Ythdc1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A,B</xref>), and in turn, knockdown of <italic>Ythdc1</italic> reduced the expression of MOF and the level of H4K16Ac catalyzed by it (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C-G</xref>). These results demonstrate complicated interactions between RNA m<sup>6</sup>A methylation and the MSL complex in unbalanced genomes, which may affect the gene expression, sexual dimorphism, development and survival of aneuploid <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>

<title>Analysis of MeRIP-Seq data</title>
<p>The raw sequencing data was first filtered by Trim Galore (version 0.6.10) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/</ext-link>) to remove adapters and low-quality reads.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study provides integrated analyses of RNA sequencing and mapping data of the m6A RNA modification in the context of unbalanced genomes, using aneuploid Drosophila as a model, and suggests that the dosage compensation complex and m6A act in a feedback loop. The evidence is <bold>incomplete</bold> due to technical concerns, as quantitative assessments are being made using non-quantitative methods, and the study would be improved by further functional studies.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study sought to reveal the potential roles of m6A RNA methylation in gene dosage regulatory mechanisms, particularly in the context of aneuploid genomes in Drosophila. Specifically, this work looked at the relationships between the expression of m6A regulatory factors, RNA methylation status, classical and inverse dosage effects, and dosage compensation. Using RNA sequencing and m6A mapping experiments, an in-depth analysis was performed to reveal changes in m6A status and expression changes across multiple aneuploid Drosophila models. The authors propose that m6A methylation regulates MOF and, in turn, deposition of H4K16Ac, critical regulators of gene dosage in the context of genomic imbalance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study seeks to address an interesting question with respect to gene dosage regulation and the possible roles of m6A in that process. Previous work has linked m6A to X-inactivation in humans through the Xist lncRNA, and to the regulation of the Sxl in flies. This study seeks to broaden that understanding beyond these specific contexts to more broadly understand how m6A impacts imbalanced genomes in other contexts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The methods being used particularly for analysis of m6A at both the bulk and transcript-specific level are not sufficiently specific or quantitative to be able to confidently draw the conclusions the authors seek to make. MeRIP m6A mapping experiments can be very valuable, but differential methylation is difficult to assess when changes are small (as they often are, in this study but also m6A studies more broadly). For instance, based on the data presented and the methods described, it is not clear that the statement that &quot;expression levels at m6A sites in aneuploidies are significantly higher than that in wildtype&quot; is supported. MeRIP experiments are not quantitative, and since there are far fewer peaks in aneuploidies, it stands to reason that more antibody binding sites may be available to enrich those fewer peaks to a larger extent.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have tested the effects of partial- or whole-chromosome aneuploidy on the m6A RNA modification in Drosophila. The data reveal that overall m6A levels trend up but that the number of sites found by meRIP-seq trend down, which seems to suggest that aneuploidy causes a subset of sites to become hyper-methylated. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis of other published datasets establish correlations between the activity of the H4K16 acetyltransferase dosage compensation complex (DCC) and the expression of m6A components and m6A abundance, suggesting that DCC and m6A can act in a feedback loop on each other. Overall, this paper uses bioinformatic trends to generate a candidate model of feedback between DCC and m6A. It would be improved by functional studies that validate the effect in vivo.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>• Thorough bioinformatic analysis of their data.</p>
<p>• Incorporation of other published datasets that enhance scope and rigor.</p>
<p>• Finds trends that suggest that a chromosome counting mechanism can control m6A, as fits with pub data that the Sxl mRNA is m6A modified in XX females and not XY males.</p>
<p>• Suggests this counting mechanism may be due to the effect of chromatin-dependent effects on the expression of m6A components.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>• The linkage between H4K16 machinery and m6A is indirect and based on bioinformatic trends with little follow-up to test the mechanistic bases of these trends.</p>
<p>• The paper lacks sufficient in vivo validation of the effects of DCC alleles on m6A and vice versa. For example, Is the Ythdc1 genomic locus a direct target of the DCC component Msl-2 ? (see Figure 7).</p>
<p>• Quite a bit of technical detail is omitted from the main text, making it difficult for the reader to interpret outcomes.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study sought to reveal the potential roles of m6A RNA methylation in gene dosage regulatory mechanisms, particularly in the context of aneuploid genomes in Drosophila. Specifically, this work looked at the relationships between the expression of m6A regulatory factors, RNA methylation status, classical and inverse dosage effects, and dosage compensation. Using RNA sequencing and m6A mapping experiments, an in-depth analysis was performed to reveal changes in m6A status and expression changes across multiple aneuploid Drosophila models. The authors propose that m6A methylation regulates MOF and, in turn, deposition of H4K16Ac, critical regulators of gene dosage in the context of genomic imbalance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study seeks to address an interesting question with respect to gene dosage regulation and the possible roles of m6A in that process. Previous work has linked m6A to X-inactivation in humans through the Xist lncRNA, and to the regulation of the Sxl in flies. This study seeks to broaden that understanding beyond these specific contexts to more broadly understand how m6A impacts imbalanced genomes in other contexts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The methods being used particularly for analysis of m6A at both the bulk and transcript-specific level are not sufficiently specific or quantitative to be able to confidently draw the conclusions the authors seek to make. MeRIP m6A mapping experiments can be very valuable, but differential methylation is difficult to assess when changes are small (as they often are, in this study but also m6A studies more broadly). For instance, based on the data presented and the methods described, it is not clear that the statement that &quot;expression levels at m6A sites in aneuploidies are significantly higher than that in wildtype&quot; is supported. MeRIP experiments are not quantitative, and since there are far fewer peaks in aneuploidies, it stands to reason that more antibody binding sites may be available to enrich those fewer peaks to a larger extent. But based on the data as presented (figure 2D) this conclusion was drawn from RPKM in IP samples, which may not fully account for changing transcript abundances in absolute (expression level changes) and relative (proportion of transcripts in input RNA sample) terms.</p>

<p>Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (MeRIP-seq) is a commonly used strategy of genome-wide mapping of m6A modification. This method uses anti-m6A antibody to immunoprecipitate RNA fragments, which results in selective enrichment of methylated RNA. Then the RNA fragments were subjected to deep sequencing, and the regions enriched in the immunoprecipitate relative to input samples are identified as m6A peaks using the peak calling algorithm. We identified m6A peaks in different samples by the exomePeak2 program and determined common m6A peaks for each genotype based on the intersection of biological replicates. Figure 2D shows the RPM values of m6A peaks in MeRIP samples for each genotype, indicating that the levels of reads in the m6A peak regions were significantly higher in the aneuploid IP samples than in wildtypes. When the enrichment of IP samples relative to Input samples (RPM.IP/RPM.Input) was taken into account, the statistics for all three aneuploidies were still significantly higher than those of the wildtypes (Mann Whitney U test p-values &lt; 0.001). This analysis is not about changes in the abundance of transcripts, but from the MeRIP perspective, showing that there are relatively more m6A-modified reads mapped to the m6A peaks in aneuploidies than that in wildtypes. In addition, we have added the results of IP/Input in the main text, and revised the description in the manuscript to make it more precise to reduce possible misunderstandings.</p>

<p>According to some published articles, m6A levels of purified mRNA or total RNA can be detected by different methods (such as mass spectrometry, 2D thin-layer chromatography, etc.) in Drosophila cells or tissues [1-3].</p>
<p>Here, we used the EpiQuik m6A RNA Methylation Quantification Kit (Colorimetric) (Epigentek, NY, USA, Cat # P-9005), which is suitable for detecting m6A methylation status directly using total RNA isolated from any species such as mammals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and viruses. This kit has previously been used by researchers to detect the m6A/A ratio in total RNA [4, 5] or purified mRNA [6] from different species.</p>
<p>In order to compare the m6A levels between the total RNA and mRNA, it was shown that the enrichment of mRNA from total RNA using Dynabeads™mRNA Purification Kit (Invitrogen Cat # 61006) did not show any significantly differences comparing with the results of total RNA (Figure 1). That’s the reason why most of the results of m6A levels in the manuscript were detected in total RNA.</p>

<p>As suggested, we will try to extract and purify mRNA from different genotypes to verify our conclusion based on the m6A levels of total RNA if necessary. In addition, m6A modification in other types of RNA other than mRNA (e.g., lncRNA, rRNA) is not necessarily meaningless. We will also add discussions of this issue in the manuscript.</p>

<p>We found a set of ChIP-seq data (GSE109901) of H4K16ac in female and male Drosophila larvae from the public database, and analyzed whether H4K16ac is directly associated with m6A regulator genes. ChIP-seq is a standard method to study transcription factor binding and histone modification by using efficient and specific antibodies for immunoprecipitation. The results showed that there were H4K16ac peaks at the 5' region in gene of m6A reader Ythdc1 in both males and females. In addition, most of the genome sites where the other m6A regulator genes located are acetylated at H4K16 in both sexes, except that Ime4 shows sexual dimorphism and only contains H4K16ac peak in females. These results indicate that the m6A regulator gene itself is acetylated at H4K16, so there is a direct relationship between H4K16ac and m6A regulators. We have added these contents to the text.</p>
<p>Besides the above conclusion from the seq data, we are also going to do some experiments to test the linkage between H4K16 and m6A in the next, such as how about the m6A levels when MOF is over expressed with the increased levels of H4K16Ac, the H4K16 levels when YT521B is knocked down or over expressed and the relative expression levels of important regulatory genes in there.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• The paper lacks sufficient in vivo validation of the effects of DCC alleles on m6A and vice versa. For example, Is the Ythdc1 genomic locus a direct target of the DCC component Msl-2 ? (see Figure 7).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In order to study whether Ythdc1 genomic locus is a direct target of DCC component, we first analyzed a published MSL2 ChIP-seq data of Drosophila (GSE58768). Since MSL2 is only expressed in males under normal conditions, this set of data is from male Drosophila. According to the results, the majority (99.1%) of MSL2 peaks are located on the X chromosome, while the MSL2 peaks on other chromosomes are few. This is consistent with the fact that MSL2 is enriched on the X chromosome in male Drosophila [1, 2]. Ythdc1 gene is located on chromosome 3L, and there is no MSL2 peak near it. Similarly, other m6A regulator genes are not X-linked, and there is no MSL2 peak. Then we analyzed the MOF ChIP-seq data (GSE58768) of male Drosophila. It was found that 61.6% of MOF peaks were located on the X chromosome, which was also expected [3, 4]. Although there are more MOF peaks on autosomes than MSL2 peaks, MOF peaks are absent on m6A regulator genes on autosomes. Therefore, at present, there is no evidence that the gene locus of m6A regulators are the direct targets of DCC component MSL2 and MOF, which may be due to the fact that most MSL2 and MOF are tethered to the X chromosome by MSL complex under physiological conditions. Whether there are other direct or indirect interactions between Ythdc1 and MSL2 is an issue worthy of further study in the future.</p>

<p>In this article, the material used to perform MeRIP-seq was the whole third instar larvae. Because trisomy 2L and metafemale Drosophila died before developing into adults, it was not possible to use the heads of adults for MeRIP-seq detection of aneuploidy. For other experiments described here, the m6A abundance was measured using whole larvae or adult heads; material used for RT-qPCR analysis was whole larvae, larval brains, or adult heads; Drosophila embryos at different developmental stages were used for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments. We provide a detailed description of the experimental material for each assay in the manuscript.</p>

<p>We used the EpiQuik m6A RNA Methylation Quantification Kit (Colorimetric) (Epigentek, NY, USA, Cat # P-9005) to measure the m6A/A ratio in RNA samples. This kit is commercially available for quantification of m6A RNA methylation, which used colorimetric assay with easy-to-follow steps for convenience and speed, and is suitable for detecting m6A methylation status directly using total RNA isolated from any species such as mammals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and viruses.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>When the m6A peaks were annotated using the R package ChIPseeker, it will include two items: &quot;genomic annotation&quot; and &quot;nearest gene annotation&quot;. &quot;Genomic annotation&quot; tells us which genomic features the peak is annotated to, such as 5’UTR, 3’UTR, exon, etc. &quot;Nearest gene annotation&quot; indicates which specific gene/transcript the peak is matched to. We modified the description in the main text to make it easier to understand.</p>
