<title>Abstract</title><p>Despite intense research focus in mice, the transcriptional regulation of neocortical neurogenesis remains limited in humans and non-human primates. Cortical development in rhesus macaque is known to recapitulate multiple facets cortical development in humans, including the complex composition of neural stem cells and thicker upper-layer neurons. To characterize temporal shifts in transcriptomic programming responsible for differentiation from stem cells to neurons, we sampled parietal lobes of rhesus macaque at E40, E50, E70, E80, and E90, spanning the full period of embryonic neurogenesis. Single cell RNA sequencing produced a transcriptomic atlas of the developing rhesus macaque neocortex parietal lobe. Identification of distinct cell types and neural stem cells emerging in different developmental stages revealed a terminally bifurcating trajectory from stem cells to neurons. Notably, deep-layer neurons appear in early stages of neurogenesis while upper-layer neurons appear later. While these different lineages show overlap in their differentiation program, cell fates are determined post-mitotically. Pseudotime trajectories from vRGs to oRGs revealed differences in dynamic gene expression profiles, and identified divergence in their activation of BMP, FGF, and WNT signaling pathways. These results provide a comprehensive picture of the temporal patterns of gene expression leading to different fates of radial glial progenitors during neocortex layer formation.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The neocortex is the center for higher brain functions, such as perception and decision-making, and therefore the dissection of its developmental processes can be informative of the mechanisms responsible for these functions. Several studies have advanced our understanding of the principles underlying neocortical development in different species, especially in mice. Generally, the dorsal neocortex can be anatomically divided into six layers of cells, occupied by distinct neuronal cell types. The deep-layer neurons project to the thalamus (layer VI neurons) and subcortical areas (layer V neurons), while neurons occupying more superficial layers (upper-layer neurons) preferentially form intracortical projections<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]</sup>. The generation of distinct excitatory neuron cell types follows a temporal pattern in which early-born neurons migrate to deep layers (i.e., layers V and VI), while the later-born neurons migrate and surpass early-born neurons to occupy the upper layers (layer II-IV)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]</sup>. In Drosophila, several transcription factors are sequentially expressed specifically in neural stem cells to control specification of daughter neuron fates, while very few such transcription factors have been identified in mammals thus far. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), Telley and colleagues found that daughter neurons exhibit the same transcriptional profiles of their respective progenitor radial glia, although these apparently heritable expression patterns fade as neurons mature<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]</sup>. However, the temporal expression profiles of neural stem cells and the contribution of these specific temporal expression patterns in determining neuronal fate have not been wholly clarified in humans and non-human primates.</p>
<p>In rodents, radial glia cells are found in the ventricular zone (VZ), where they undergo proliferation and differentiation. Although ventricular radial glia (vRG) is also found in humans and non-human primates, the vast majority of radial glia in these higher species occupy the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ), and are therefore termed outer radial glia (oRG). VRG and oRG are both accompanied by the expression of stem cell markers such as PAX6 and exhibit extensive self-renewal and proliferative capacities<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]</sup>. However, despite functional similarities, they have distinct molecular phenotypes. Previous scRNA-seq analyses have identified several molecular markers, including MOXD1 and HOPX for oRGs, and CRYAB and FBXO32 for vRGs<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]</sup>. Furthermore, oRGs are derived from vRGs and vRGs exhibit obvious differences in numerous cell-extrinsic mechanisms, including activation of the FGF-MAPK cascade, SHH, PTEN/AKT, and PDGF pathways, and oxygen (O2) levels. These pathways and factors are involved in three broad cellular processes that include, vRG maintenance, spindle orientation, and cell adhesion/extracellular matrix production<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]</sup>.Some transcription factors have been shown to participate in vRG generation, such as INSM and TRNP1. Moreover, the cell-intrinsic patterns of transcriptional regulation responsible for generation of vRGs have not been characterized.</p>
<p>ScRNA-seq is a powerful tool for investigating developmental trajectories, defining cellular heterogeneity, and identifying novel cell subgroups<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]</sup>. Several groups have sampled embryonic mouse neocortex tissue for scRNA-seq<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]</sup>, as well as discrete, discontinuous embryonic developmental stages in human and non-human primates, while studies spanning the full embryonic neurogenic stage in the neocortex of humans and other primates are lacking<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]</sup>. Rhesus macaque and humans share multiple aspects of neurogenesis, and more importantly, the rhesus monkey and human brains share more similar gene expression patterns than brains of mice and humans<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]</sup>. To establish a comprehensive, global picture of the neurogenic processes in the rhesus macaque neocortex, which can be informative of neocortex evolution in humans, we sampled neocortical tissue at five developmental stages (E40, E50, E70, E80 and E90) in rhesus macaque embryos, spanning the full neurogenesis period. Through strict quality control, cell type annotation, and lineage trajectory inference, we identified two broad transcriptomic programs responsible for the differentiation of deep-layer and upper-layer neurons. We also defined the temporal expression patterns of neural stem cells, including oRGs, vRGs and IPs, and identified novel transcription factors involved in oRG generation. These findings can substantially enhance our understanding of neocortical development and evolution in primates.</p>

<label>2.1.</label><title>scRNA-Seq Analysis of Cell Types in the Developing Macaque Neocortex</title>
<p>In order to establish a comprehensive view of the cellular composition of the rhesus macaque brain at different stages in embryonic period development, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on the dissected parietal lobes of eight total rhesus macaque embryos, spanning five developmental stages of embryonic neurogenesis, including E40 (stage of peak neurogenesis) and E50 (Layer 6 formation); as well as at E70 (Layer 5 formation), E80 (Layer 4 formation), and E90 (Layer2-3 formation) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]</sup>. We obtained a transcriptome from 53,295 cells after filtering out low quality cells and removing potential doublets. Each embedding was visualized using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) of dimension reduction using Seurat, which identified 28 distinct clusters. All cell clusters present in the samples were then annotated (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>) and the respective cell types were identified (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>) based on their expression of molecular markers (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">figure S2</xref>, B to C</bold>). Each of the 28 identified clusters could be assigned to a cell type identity of neurocytes (including radial glia (RG), outer radial glia (oRG), intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs), ventral precursor cells (VP), excitatory neurons (EN), inhibitory neurons (IN), oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC), oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia, Cajal-Retzius cells and meningeal cells, or non-neuronal cell types (including endothelial, vascular/pericyte, and blood cells). Each cell cluster was composed of multiple embryo samples, and the samples from similar stages generally harbored similar distributions of cell types.</p>

<p>In general, ventricular radial glia (vRG) (cluster 10) showed characteristic VIM and PAX6 expression; outer radial glia (oRG) (cluster 12) highly expressed HOPX and MOXD1, two previously verified markers<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]</sup>; two clusters (cluster 8 and cluster 22) of intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) that strongly expressed EOMES, and one cluster of IPCs (cluster 22) were all topologically close to radial glia, while the other IPC cluster (cluster 8) was closer to neurons, indicating the presence of two stages of IPCs<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]</sup>; excitatory neurons were identified by the expression of well-established markers, such as NEUROD2 and NEUROD6; and the astrocyte and oligodendrocyte lineages were identified by AQP4 and SOX10 expression, respectively<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]</sup>. In addition, we identified DLX1+ and GAD1+ cells, which suggested the presence of inhibitory neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these results suggested that cortical neural progenitors undergo neurogenesis processes during the early stages of macaque embryonic cortical development, while gliogenic differentiation, including oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, occurs in later stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>).</p>

<label>2.2.</label><title>Distinct Excitatory Neuronal Types Sequentially Emerge in Developing Cortex</title>
<p>To better understand the temporal dynamics of excitatory neuron (EN) development and differentiation, we compiled a subset of all ENs and re-clustered them into 11 subclusters (EN1-11) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). Accordingly, we identified a subcluster of neurons (EN 8) from the midbrain, which highly expressed TCF7L2<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]</sup>, which were not included in following analysis. We then calculated the relative expression levels of cellular markers for each group and annotated the EN subclusters based on published descriptions of marker function (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref></bold>). We found that all EN subclusters could be well-distinguished by differential expression of either deep-layer neuron markers (BCL11B, FEZF2, and SOX5)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]</sup> or upper-layer neuron markers (CUX1 and SATB2)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]</sup>(<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, B to C</bold>). In previous seminal studies, 3H-thymidine (3H-dT) tracing in macaque rhesus unraveled the sequential generation of cortical neurons, with deep-layer neurons appearing prior to upper-layer neurons<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]</sup>. In agreement with this early work, we found that early-born neurons (E40 and E50) predominantly outnumbered later-born neurons in the deep-layer neuron subclusters (EN5 and 11), while upper-layer neuron subclusters contained the inverse proportions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, C and D</bold>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We then characterized temporal changes in the composition of each EN subcluster. While the EN 5 and EN 11 (deep-layer neurons) subclusters emerged at E40 and E50 and disappeared in later stages, EN subclusters 1, 2, 3, and 4 gradually increased in population size from E50 to E80 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). Notably, EN 6 was exclusively found in the cortex at E70 (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref></bold>). Since the brain is relatively small at E40 and E50, the cells collected at these stages inevitably included cells from adjacent regions.</p>

<label>2.3.</label><title>Specification of Different Progenitor Fates Controlled by Regulator Genes</title>
<p>To focus on the differentiation of neural progenitors, we generated subsets of cell clusters 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 20, and 22, then annotated them as ventricular radial glia (RG_C10), outer radial glia (oRG_C12 and RG_C14), intermediate progenitor cells (IPC_C22 and IPC_C8), ventral precursor cells (VP_C15), or oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC_C16) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). Subclustering analysis revealed that these neural progenitors differentiated into diverse cell types with distinct lineages across the macaque embryonic neocortex (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). We next investigated trajectories within the neural stem cell pool prior to branching as upper layer or deep layer excitatory neuron (EN). Notably, the C20 cluster did not clearly belong to any identifiable lineage. The oRG and IPC precursor cell groups exhibited characteristically high specific expression of HOPX and EOMES respectively.</p>

</fig>
<p>Although the presence of oRGs is a well-established feature of primate neurogenesis, and their molecular markers are widely used, the genetic basis and molecular processes leading to their emergence are still poorly understood. To construct gene expression profiles that illustrate the progression from RG_C10 cells to oRGs, we specifically examined changes in expression among RG_C10, oRG_C12, and RG_C14, cells, then calculated pseudotime trajectories (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, C to D</bold>). Based on these trajectories, we then profiled the temporal shifts in expression of each gene and selected the 150 most significant genes (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></bold>). We found a set of genes that were previously reported as highly expressed in outer radial glia that also showed high expression in the oRG_C12 differentiated pseudotime terminal<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]</sup> (such as SFRP1, HOPX, FAM107A, TNC, PTN, and MOXD1), while high ASPM expression was typical of cells in the earlier, RG, pseudotime terminal. In addition to these markers, we also found enrichment for some potential regulatory genes at the oRG_C12 terminal, such as Regulator of the cell cycle (RGCC) which controls mitotic spindle orientation<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]</sup>, and TTYH1, which regulates cell adhesion<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]</sup>. We also found genes that regulate ion channel expression, such as ATP1A2, ATP1B2, and SCN4B, which were not previously known to participate in oRG differentiation.</p>
<p>Analysis of DEGs specific to the RG pseudotime terminal identified cell cycle-related genes such as MKI67, TOP2A, CDC20 and CCNA2. Within the glia-like cells that largely comprised the oRG_C12 terminal, we also detected a population of true glial genes that exhibited high expression of SLC1A3, ZFP36L1<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]</sup>, GFAP, DBI, and EDNRB<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]</sup>. In addition, our analyses uncovered several DEGs that have not yet been investigated for a role in radial glia function and differentiation, such as DKK3, DDAH1, SAT1, and PEA15.

These data suggested that the cell fate determination by diverse neural progenitors occurs in the embryonic stages of macaque cortical development and is controlled by several key transcriptional regulators.</p>

<label>2.4.</label><title>The Generation of Deep-layer and Upper-layer Neurons Follows Distinct Terminal Trajectories</title>
<p>Based on our above finding that the deep-layer neurons appear earlier than upper layer neurons, we next sought to characterize dynamic shifts in the expression of transcriptional regulators that potentially contribute to determining neuronal fates. To this end, we performed pseudotime trajectory analysis of EN lineages (including deep-layer and upper-layer neurons) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>), then superimposed the cluster labels from RG_C10, oRG_C12, and RG_C14 stem cells in UMAP plots (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) and early (E40 and E50) and late (E70, 80 and 90) emergence stages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) over the extracted transcriptomic data. We then calculated the RG-specific differentially expressed genes (rgDEGs), as well as the DEGs of early and late neuron-specific (nDEGs). The set of genes that overlapped between of rgDEGs and nDEGs (termed mapping genes) thus be used to map neuronal subtypes to different neural stem cell populations (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure.

We hypothesized that mapping genes, such as FEZF2 and DOK5, may function in radial glia cells to specify neuronal progeny (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>).

<p>Since a substantial body of evidence indicates that neuronal fate is determined post-mitotically in the mammalian neocortex, analysis of differentially expressed genes over the course of the differentiation process could reveal the genetic mechanisms responsible for deciding stem cell fate as different neuronal progeny. Using Dynverse R packages, we constructed pseudotime trajectories for the cluster data, which identified a bifurcating trajectory from neural stem cells (including RG_C10, oRG_C12, and RG_C14) that leads to either deep-layer neurons in one branch or to upper-layer neurons in the alternative branch (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). However, it should be noted that the two distinct fates share a common path from neural stem cells to immature neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, from <bold>dot1</bold> to <bold>dot4</bold>), supporting the likelihood that neuronal fate is primarily determined post-mitotically.</p>
<p>Based on this trajectory, we then categorized the DEGs that exhibit dynamic, temporal shifts in expression over pseudotime, resulting in broad clusters. The first of these clusters was enriched with neural stem cells, characterized by high expression of PAX6, VIM, and TOP2A, which likely participate in regulating stemness and proliferation. The three remaining DEG clusters were enriched in either deep-layer neurons, upper-layer neurons, or both (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>). More specifically, we found that most of the DEGs were shared between both branches, such as STMN2, TUBB3, NEUROD2 and NEUROD6, further illustrating the shared differentiation processes between deep and upper layer ENs. We also identified deep layer-specific DEGs (including FEZF2, TBR1 and LMO3) and upper layer-specific genes (including MEF2C and DOK5). We then organized the cell types into a branching tree based on their differential expression of these marker genes, which includes stem-cell genes PAX6, HOPX and EOMES, in addition to the above deep layer- and upper layer-specific genes (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></bold>). The separation into distinct, branch-specific sets of DEGs suggested a role for these cell type-specific transcription factors and other genes in terminal neuron differentiation.</p>

<p>It is clearly observed that similar cellular processes with comparable temporal progression to sequential generate of deep layer and upper layer neurons in both primates and rodents (<bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref>, A to C</bold>). However, in primates, the number and relative development period of upper neurons are longer than that of rodents (<bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7D</xref></bold>). Besides, another important evolutionarily divergent feature in cortical development between the of primates and rodents is the abundance of oRG cells in the outer subventricular zone (oSVZ) of primates (human and macaque). Our human-macaque-mouse cross-species analysis shown that strong expression of oRG marker gene, such as HOPX, MOXD1, FAM107A and CLU (3) in both human and macaque datasets (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>), while barely detectable expression in mouse dataset, which is consistent with previous reports<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, We picked HOPX-positive and EOMES-positive cells (ligercluster5, 20, 13, 15) from human, mouse dataset and performed developmental trajectories analysis with slingshot (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). Comparing vRG to IPC trajectory between human, macaque, and mouse, we found this biological process of vRG-to-IPC is very conserved across species, but the vRG to oRG trajectory is divergent between species. The latter process is almost invisible in mice, but it is very similar in primates and macaque.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that neural progenitors exhibit distinct temporal expression patterns during neurogenesis in mice. However, similar temporal profiling has not been thoroughly investigated in macaque neural stem cells. Based on its topological position and associated markers that suggest it functions as a developmental root, we examined temporal expression profile of RG_C10 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We first identified marker genes to distinguish RG_C10 cells in different embryonic stages (i.e., E40-E90), and used these markers to generate dynamic expression profiles. We then clustered these dynamically expressed macaque genes into five types (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold>), consisting of Type 1 and 2 genes that decreased in expression during neurogenesis, Type 3, 4 and 5 genes that gradually ramp up in expression over the course of neurogenesis. We then performed a similar profiling of dynamic gene expression using data obtained from mouse apical progenitors<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]</sup> and categorized the DEGs into the same five categories. A total of 72 homologous transcription factors were shared between human, macaque and mouse transcriptomes. Analysis of their temporal dynamics revealed that exhibited similar temporal patterns between species such as NEUROD1, NEUROG2, POU3F2, ETV1, ETV5 and FOS (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref></bold>), which indicated that the majority of transcription factors had conserved temporal dynamics between species, and thus evolutionarily conserved patterns of regulation in neural stem cell differentiation.</p>

<label>3.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The cerebral cortex region of the brain responsible for extraordinary cognitive capacity, such as abstract thinking and language. The neocortex of non-human primate rhesus macaque resembles that of humans in many aspects. Thus, a comprehensive investigation of macaque neurogenesis can improve our understanding of neocortical development and evolution. For this purpose, we performed scRNA-seq in embryonic neocortical tissues of macaque. Our data support previous omics studies of embryonic macaque brain development<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]</sup>. We constructed a single-cell resolution transcriptomic atlas of the developing macaque neocortex, which we then used to identify dynamically expressed genes that likely contribute to the maturation of distinct neuron types, temporal expression patterns of neural stem cells, and the generation of oRGs.</p>
<p>The existence of oRGs has long been demonstrated in humans and primates through live imaging and immunostaining<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]</sup>. ORGs share similarities in their patterns of gene expression with vRGs (e.g., SOX2, PAX6, and NESTIN) but also specifically express several genes (such as MOXD1, HOPX, and FAM107A)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]</sup>. Recently, the molecular mechanisms associated with the generation and amplification of oRGs was shown to include signaling pathways such as the FGF-MAPK cascade, SHH, PTEN/AKT, and PDGF pathways, as well as proteins such as INSM, GPSM2, ASPM, TRNP1, ARHGAP11B, PAX6, and HIF1α. A number of these proteins were validated by genetic manipulation of their activities or expression in mouse, ferret, and marmoset<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]</sup>. The dynamically expressed genes and pseudotime trajectories from vRGs to oRGs presented in this work are in agreement with these previous reports. In addition to known regulators, we detected differential expression of ion channel regulators in oRGs, such as ATP1A2, ATP1B2, and SCN4B, suggesting that hyperpolarization and depolarization processes may participate in promoting or maintaining oRG populations. Indeed, hyperpolarization in mouse apical progenitors has been shown to promote the generation of IPCs and indirect neurogenesis<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]</sup>, although it remains unclear if similar mechanisms contribute to development of the primate neocortex.</p>
<p>The sequential generation of cortical neurons has long been observed in both rodents and primates, and many transcription factors are known to drive post-mitotic specification of neuronal progeny, mainly in rodents. Here, we found genes that are conserved across species, such as FEZF2 and TBR1, that are involved in specifying deep-layer neurons in the macaque neocortex. From the slingshot pseudotime analysis, which reflected the expression pattern of genes during appropriate lineage trajectories, it suggests that some genes are lineage-restricted or even involved in lineage fate determination. For example, FEZF2, PPP1R1B (also known as DARPP32), SOX5, LMO3, CELF4 may be involved in the fate specialization of deep neurons, while TMOD1, PID1, LINGO1, CRYM and MEF2C for upper layer neurons. Notably, FEZF2<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]</sup> and SOX5<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]</sup> have been confirmed associated with deep layer neuron specification in mice, while others, such as TMOD1, PID1 and LINGO1, have not been reported before, and their potential functions in the fate specification of cortical projection neurons need to be further explored. To date, only a very limited set of genes have been shown to function in specifying neuronal progeny in progenitor cells, which suggests that regulation in progenitors is more complex than in neurons, where a single transcription factor can trigger a transcriptional cascade to promote the maturation of neurons. In the current study, we found two types of genes (Dynamic type1 and 5) which have gradually altered expression patterns along with neurogenic stage, indicating a transition in cell state, in both vRGs and oRGs. In addition to these gradual transition genes, we also identified sets of genes (Dynamic type 2-4) with sharp changes in expression during neurogenesis which likely function in specifying different neuronal subtypes. These findings led us to postulate that a combination of biological processes and pathways change over time to coordinate gradual transitions from neural stem cell to daughter neuron. In previous studies, FOXG1 have been proved to play pivotal roles in controlling the cell cycle to meet the growing demands of the developing cerebral cortex<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]</sup>. Role of FOXG1 in the macaque vRG transcription factors regulatory network might contribute to primate stem cell pools enlargement and neocortex expansion.</p>
<p>This study also faces limitations. During the macaque embryonic neurogenesis, ventral radial glia cells generate excitatory neurons by direct and indirect neurogenesis. In general, the number of progenitor cells gradually decreases over the course of development, with progenitor cells generating deep neurons in the early stage of development and upper excitatory neurons in the later stages. We observed the anomalous disappearance of two subclusters of ENs (EN 5 and EN 11) from later stage samples (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>). This disappearance may could also be potentially explained by the development of axons and dendrites in early-born neurons, which have higher morphological complexity and greater vulnerability to enzymatic digestion and lysis during sampling. Nonetheless, this transcriptomic atlas uncovers the molecular signatures of the main cell types and temporal shifts in gene expression of differentiating progenitor cells during neocortex layer formation, thus providing a global perspective into neocortical neurogenesis in macaque.</p>

<p>Single-cell capture was achieved by random distribution of a single-cell suspension across &gt;200,000 microwells through a limited dilution approach. Beads with oligonucleotide barcodes were added to saturation so that a bead was paired with a cell in a microwell. Cell-lysis buffer was added so that poly-adenylated RNA molecules hybridized to the beads. Beads were collected into a single tube for reverse transcription.

Quality control was applied based on the detected gene number and the percentage of counts originating from mitochondrial RNA, ribosomal RNA, and hemoglobin gene per cell. Then cells were filtered to retain only higher quality (with less than 7.5% mitochondrial gene counts, less than 5.5% ribosomal gene counts, and detected genes above 400 and less than 6000). Additionally, we identified cell doublets using Scrublet v0.142 with default parameters and removed doublets before data analysis. After quality control, a total of 59,045 cells remained for subsequent analysis.</p>

Next, we used the SCTransform workflow in Seurat to normalize the single cell-seq data from different samples. During normalization, we also removed confounding sources of variation, including mitochondrial mapping and ribosomal mapping percentages.

Lastly, we evaluated the protein-protein interaction networks analysis of TFs and their target genes by the String<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]</sup> (V11.5) and visualized by Cytoscape<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]</sup> (version 3.8.1).</p>

<p>Firstly we picked up vRG cells in each species dataset and screened the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between adjacent development timepoints using “FindMarkers” function (with min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25). After separate normalization of the DEG expression matrix from different species datasets, we use “standardise” function of mfuzz to perform standardization. The DEGs of vRG in each species were grouped into five different clusters using Mfuzz package in R with fuzzy c-means algorithm<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]</sup>.</p>

<p>In the article &quot;Temporal transcriptomic dynamics in developing macaque neocortex&quot;, Xu et al. analyze the cellular composition and transcriptomic profiles of the developing macaque parietal cortex using single-cell RNA sequencing. The authors profiled eight prenatal rhesus macaque brains at five timepoints (E40, E50, E70, E80, and E90) and obtained a total of around 53,000 high-quality cells for downstream analysis. The dataset provides a high-resolution view into the developmental processes of early and mid-fetal macaque cortical development and will potentially be a valuable resource for future comparative studies of primate neurogenesis and neural stem cell fate specification. Their analysis of this dataset focused on the temporal gene expression profiles of outer and ventricular radial glia and utilized pesudotime trajectory analysis to characterize the genes associated with radial glial and neuronal differentiation. The rhesus macaque dataset presented in this study was then integrated with prenatal mouse and human scRNA-seq datasets to probe species differences in ventricular radial glia to intermediate progenitor cell trajectories. Additionally, the expression profile of macaque radial glia across time was compared to those of mouse apical progenitors to identify conserved and divergent expression patterns of transcription factors.</p>
<p>The main findings of this paper corroborate many previously reported and fundamental features of primate neurogenesis: deep layer neurons are generated before upper layer excitatory neurons, the expansion of outer radial glia in the primate lineage, conserved molecular markers of outer radial glia, and the early specification of progenitors. Furthermore, the authors show some interesting divergent features of macaque radial glial gene regulatory networks as compared to mouse. Overall, despite some uncertainties surrounding the clustering and annotations of certain cell types, the manuscript provides a valuable scRNA-seq dataset of early prenatal rhesus macaque brain development. The dynamic expression patterns and trajectory analysis of ventricular and outer radial glia provide valuable data and lists of differentially expressed genes (some consistent with previous studies, others reported for the first time here) for future studies.</p>
<p>The major weaknesses of this study are the inconsistent dissection of the targeted brain region and the loss of more mature excitatory neurons in samples from later developmental timepoint due to the use of single-cell RNA-seq. The authors mention that they could observe ventral progenitors and even midbrain neurons in their analyses. Ventral progenitors should not be present if the authors had properly dissected the parietal cortex. The fact that they obtained even midbrain cells point to an inadequate dissection or poor cell classification. If this is the result of poor classification, it could be easily fixed by using more markers with higher specificity. However, if it is the result of a poor dissection, some of the cells in other clusters could potentially be from midbrain as well. The loss of more mature excitatory neurons is also problematic because on top of hindering the analysis of these neurons in later developmental periods, it also affects the cell proportions the authors use to support some of their claims. The study could also benefit from the validation of some of the genes the authors uncovered to be specifically expressed in different populations of radial glia.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript by Xu et al., is an interesting study aiming to identify novel features of macaque cortical development. This study serves as a valuable atlas of single cell data during macaque neurogenesis, which extends the developmental stages previously explored. Overall, the authors have achieved their aim of collecting a comprehensive dataset of macaque cortical neurogenesis and have identified a few unknown features of macaque development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors have accumulated a robust dataset of developmental time points and have applied a variety of informatic approaches to interrogate this dataset. One interesting finding in this study is the expression of previously unknown receptors on macaque oRG cells. Another novel aspect of this paper is the temporal dissection of neocortical development across species. The identification that the regulome looks quite different, despite similar expression of transcription factors in discrete cell types, is intriguing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Due to the focus on demonstrating the robustness of the dataset, the novel findings in this manuscript are underdeveloped. There is also a lack of experimental validation. This is a particular weakness for newly identified features (like receptors in oRG cells). It's important to show expression in relevant cell types and, if possible, perform functional perturbations on these cell types. The presentation of the data highlighting novel findings could also be clarified at higher resolution, and dissected through additional informatic analyses. Additionally, the presentation of ideas and goals of this manuscript should be further clarified. A major gap in the study rationale and results is that the data was collected exclusively in the parietal lobe, yet the rationale and interpretation of what this data indicates about this specific cortical area was not discussed. Last, a few textual errors about neural development are also present and need to be corrected.</p>

<p>Summary: The study adds to the existing data that have established that cortical development in rhesus macaque is known to recapitulate multiple facets cortical development in humans. The authors generate and analyze single cell transcriptomic data from the timecourse of embryonic neurogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Studies of primate developmental biology are hindered by the limited availability and limit replication. In this regard, a new dataset is useful.</p>
<p>The study analyzes parietal cortex, while previous studies focused on frontal and motor cortex. This may be the first analysis of macaque parietal cortex and, as such, may provide important insights into arealization, which the authors have not addressed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The number of cells in the analysis is lower than recent published studies which may limit cell representation and potentially the discovery of subtle changes.</p>
<p>The macaque parietal cortex data is compared to human and mouse pre-frontal cortex. See data from PMCID: PMC8494648 that provides a better comparison.</p>
<p>A deeper assessment of these data in the context of existing studies would help others appreciate the significance of the work.</p>
