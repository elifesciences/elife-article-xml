<title>Abstract</title><p>The newly generated CD4 single-positive (SP) T lymphocytes are featured by enhanced IL-4 but repressed IFN-γ production. The mechanisms underlying this functional bias remain elusive. Previous studies have reported that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from mice harboring DC-specific deletion of IL-27p28 display an increased capacity of IFN-γ production upon TCR stimulation. Here we demonstrated that similarly altered functionality occurred in CD4SP thymocytes, recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) as well as naive T cells from either <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice or mice deficient in the α subunit of IL-27 receptor. Therefore, DC-derived IL-27p28-triggered, IL-27Rα-mediated signal is critically involved in the establishment of functional bias against IFN-γ production during their development in the thymus. Epigenetic analyses indicated reduced DNA methylation of the <italic>Ifng</italic> locus and increased trimethylation of H3K4 at both <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic> loci in CD4SP thymcoytes from <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice. Transcriptome profiling demonstrated that <italic>Il27p28</italic> ablation resulted in coordinated up-regulation of STAT1-activated genes. Concurrently, STAT1 was found to be constitutively activated. Moreover, we observed increased accumulation of STAT1 at the <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic> loci and a strong correlation between STAT1 binding and H3K4me3 modification of these loci. Of note, <italic>Il27p28</italic> deficiency exacerbated the autoimmune phenotype of <italic>Aire<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Collectively, this study reveals a novel mechanism underlying the functional bias of newly generated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the potential relevance of such a bias in autoimmunity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The thymus plays a crucial role in the phenotypic development and functional maturation of T cells. After positive and negative selection, T cell progenitors become CD4 or CD8 single positive (CD4SP or CD8SP) thymocytes that are self-tolerant. These SP thymocytes then emigrate to the periphery, known as recent thymic emigrants (RTEs), and 2-3 weeks later, RTEs develop into mature naive T cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ashby &amp; Hogquist, 2023</xref></italic>). Upon activation, CD4SP thymocytes and RTEs exhibit a reduced proliferation capacity and decreased production of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) compared to mature naive T cells. However, they show increased secretion of IL-4, which is known as T helper (Th) 2 bias in immature T cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hendricks &amp; Fink, 2011</xref></italic>). This Th2 bias in CD4SP thymocytes and RTEs is thought to assist newly emigrated self-reactive T cells to respond appropriately to self-antigens (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fink &amp; Hendricks, 2011</xref></italic>). Furthermore, the low level of IFN-γ production in RTEs renders them more prone to becoming regulatory T cells, which also helps to prevent the induction of autoimmune diseases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bhaumik et al., 2013</xref></italic>). The low level of DNA methylation at the <italic>Il4</italic> locus and reduced expression of <italic>Dnmts</italic> contribute to the Th2 bias in CD4SP thymocytes and RTEs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berkley et al., 2013</xref></italic>). However, the mechanism behind repressed IFN-γ expression in favor of the Th2 bias in these immature T cells is elusive.</p>
<p>The heterodimeric cytokine IL-27 is composed of IL-27p28 and Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3), which signals through the IL-27R consisting of the IL- 27Rα (also named as WSX-1, TCCR) and the gp130 subunits. Elevated levels of IL-27 are associated with the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lin et al., 2015</xref></italic>), behcet’s disease (BD) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shen et al., 2013</xref></italic>), and experimental arthritis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cao et al., 2008</xref></italic>). The IL-27-regulated differentiation and function of peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells subsets Th1, Th17 and Treg have been proposed as an explanation for the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mei et al., 2021</xref></italic>), however, conflicting reports have been demonstrated in different settings. For example, it is consistent that IL-27 inhibits Th17 differentiation and function <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>Il27p28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Ebi3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice models (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Diveu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al., 2012</xref></italic>). Although IL-27 inhibits Treg differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Huber et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Neufert et al., 2007</xref></italic>), and <italic>Ebi3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> EAE models show increased numbers and suppressive functions of Tregs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al., 2012</xref></italic>), Tregs in <italic>Il27ra</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and Treg-specific <italic>Il27ra</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice loss the suppressive function (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>; Y. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Park et al., 2019</xref></italic>). Furthermore, IL-27 was initially found to promote Th1 differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells under physiological conditions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pflanz et al., 2002</xref></italic>). However, naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells derived from <italic>Ebi3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Il27p28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit increased production of IFN-γ. In addition, the absence of <italic>Il27ra</italic><sup>-/-</sup> promotes pathological Th1 accumulation following <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> infection (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hamano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pflanz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Villarino et al., 2003</xref></italic>). A subsequent study demonstrates that both the absence and overexpression of IL-27p28 lead to increased susceptibility to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, with IL-27p28 attributed as an independent negative regulator of IFN-γ production in T cells (<italic>J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Park et al., 2019</xref></italic>). Notably, deficiency in gp130 does not alter IFN-γ production in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in a virus-infection model (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Harker et al., 2015</xref></italic>). These results indicate the intricate functionality of each subunit of IL-27 and IL 27R on peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which is insufficient to fully explain the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease.</p>
<p>The structural analysis of IL-27 has demonstrated that IL-27p28, serving as a central subunit, possesses the ability to bind with EBI3, as well as the two receptor subunits IL-27Rα and gp130 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caveney et al., 2022</xref></italic>). Previous studies have reported IL- 27p28 as an independent antagonist of gp130-mediated signaling (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Stumhofer et al., 2010</xref></italic>). In a ConA-induced liver damage model, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from mice with dendritic cell (DC)-specific deletion of p28 (<italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice) exhibit a propensity for rapid and robust production of IFN-γ upon activation. This observation is attributed to the absence of IL-27p28 in the thymic environment of these mice (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhang et al., 2013</xref></italic>). These findings raise the intriguing possibility that thymic DC-derived IL-27p28 may contribute to shaping the Th1/Th2 balance of newly generated CD4SP thymocytes. In this paper, we have demonstrated that DC-derived IL-27p28 plays a crucial role in maintaining the Th2 bias of CD4SP thymocytes. Our findings suggest that IL-27p28 regulates the DNA methylation status and histone modification of transcription regulatory regions of <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic> genes. These epigenetic modifications were further modulated by the low level of basal and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) protein. Furthermore, we observed that the disruption of Th2 bias in CD4SP thymocytes due to IL-27p28 deficiency exacerbated autoimmune diseases in <italic>Aire<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of Th2 bias by DC-derived IL-27p28 and its potential role in autoimmune diseases.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>DC-specific deletion of IL-27p28 endows the newly generated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with inherently enhanced capacity of IFN-γ production</title>
<p>Although IL-27 is widely reported to promote peripheral Th1 differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic>mice exhibit enhanced IFN-γ production, a capacity seemingly acquired in their development in the thymus (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhang et al., 2013</xref></italic>). To investigate the possibility that thymic DC-derived IL-27 shapes the functionality of newly generated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD4SP thymocytes, CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs, and CD4<sup>+</sup> naive T cells were purified from <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> (cKO) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates harboring a Rag2-GFP transgene, which allows easy tracking of newly generated thymocytes and RTEs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ashby &amp; Hogquist, 2023</xref></italic>). The purified cells were then compared for cytokine expression in response to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation under non-polarizing conditions. As expected, CD4<sup>+</sup> naive T cells from cKO mice exhibited a significantly higher level of <italic>Ifng</italic> mRNA expression compared to WT cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Intracellular staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) and ELISA assay of the culture supernatant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) confirmed enhanced IFN-γ production at the protein level. Notably, this difference was already detectable at the SP thymocyte stage, indicating that it is developmentally regulated. Another prominent feature of CD4SP thymocytes is the hyperproduction of Th2 cytokines (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fink &amp; Hendricks, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Makar et al., 2003</xref></italic>). Despite the profound impact of IL-27p28 deficiency on IFN-γ production, we observed no significant difference in IL-4 expression between cKO and WT T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A and C</xref>). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the expression of IL-2 and TNF-α between cKO and WT T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and Figure 1-figure supplement 1). These results suggest that DC-specific deletion of IL-27p28 specifically enhances IFN- γ production in newly generated T cells without affecting Th2 cytokines.</p>

<p>Next, we investigated the expression of T-box transcription factor (T-bet) and GATA3, which are the master regulators of Th1 and Th2 differentiation, respectively (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fang et al., 2022</xref></italic>). The differential impact of IL-27p28 deficiency on IFN-γ and IL-4 production was accompanied by an increase in Tbx21 expression but no significant alteration in Gata3 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Western blotting confirmed the upregulation of T-bet protein expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, we extended our analyses onto CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at steady state or under polarizing conditions. Higher basal levels of <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic> transcripts were detected in CD4SP thymocytes and naive T cells from cKO mice than the counterparts from WT mice even without stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating the constitutive activation of these loci. When cultured under polarizing conditions, these cells were effectively induced to differentiate into Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg lineages. In contrast to the previous report of different differentiation potentials of RTEs versus naive T cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hendricks &amp; Fink, 2011</xref></italic>), CD4SP thymocytes, RTEs and naive T cells showed similar capacity to differentiate into effector cells. Moreover, cKO and WT cells were equally positioned for the differentiation (Figure 1-figure supplement 2A-F), suggesting that IL-27p28 deficiency does not affect effector cell differentiation under optimal conditions. Taken together, these data support that IL- 27p28 is actively involved in the functional maturation of developing CD4SP thymocytes, biasing them away from the Th1 lineage.</p>

<label>2.</label><title><italic>Il27ra-</italic>deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are similarly predisposed for potent IFN-γ production</title>
<p>Apart from acting as a subunit of IL-27, IL-27p28 have been reported to possess activities independent of IL-27, by acting on its own or coupling with other proteins, such as IL-Y (p28/p40, binding to IL-27Rα/IL-12Rβ1 to activate STAT3) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Flores et al., 2015</xref></italic>) and CLY (p28/CLF, binding to gp130/IL-6Rα to activate STAT1 and STAT3) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tormo et al., 2013</xref></italic>). To ascertain whether the phenotype in the <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice results from defective IL-27Rα signaling, we investigated the functional characters of T lineage cells in mice deficient in <italic>Il27ra</italic>. Reminiscent to what was observed in <italic>Il27p28</italic>-deficient mice, increased expression of <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic> were detected in <italic>Il27ra</italic><sup>- /-</sup> CD4SP thymocytes and naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, whereas <italic>Il4</italic>, <italic>Il2,</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> transcripts were equally present in WT and <italic>Il27ra</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Intracellular staining confirmed the enhanced IFN-γ production by <italic>Il27ra</italic>-deficient cells stimulated under non-polarizing conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). IFN-γ production by <italic>Il27ra</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and WT cells, however, was comparable under Th1 polarizing conditions (Figure 1-figure supplement 2G). The similar phenotype shared by <italic>Il27p28</italic> and <italic>Il27ra</italic> knockout mice indicates that the altered T cell functionality in the absence of IL-27p28 is indeed a reflection of disrupted IL-27Rα signaling.</p>

<p>Developmentally regulated transcriptional activation and repression of genes or cell-type specific expression patterns are largely achieved by modifying the chromatin template at a gene locus (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ivashkiv, 2018</xref></italic>). Murine neonatal CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have been documented to be poised to rapid Th2 cytokine secretion due to the pre-existing hypomethylation at a key Th2 cytokine regulatory region (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rose et al., 2007</xref></italic>). In other reports, Th2 polarization in adult SP thymocytes and RTEs is attributable to active recruitment of DNA methyltransferases and increased H3K4 methylation at <italic>Il4</italic> locus (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berkley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Makar et al., 2003</xref></italic>). In addition, DNA methylation and histone modification are found to be important for the control of <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic> expression <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Friedman et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jones &amp; Chen, 2006</xref>)</italic>. Therefore, we next evaluated the contribution of epigenetic modifications to the enhanced IFN-γ production in the absence of IL-27p28. Firstly, we performed bisulfite genomic sequencing on DNA of CD4 SP thymocytes from <italic>Cd11c-cre p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic>mice and WT littermates. We focused on the nine CpG sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) most proximal to the <italic>Ifng</italic> transcription start site, among which the −53 CpG has previously been suggested to play a key role in IFN-γ repression in Th2 effector cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jones &amp; Chen, 2006</xref></italic>). DNA methylation was significantly reduced at three CpG sites (−53, −34 and +16 site) of the <italic>Ifng</italic> locus in CD4SP thymocytes from<italic>Cd11c-cre p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). On the contrary, the five CpG sites in the <italic>Il4</italic> promoter region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, D</xref>), whose demethylation is associated with high level IL-4 production (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lee et al., 2002</xref></italic>), showed no difference between cKO and WT CD4SP thymocytes.</p>

<p>As much as histone modifications are concerned, histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) are typically associated with repressed <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic> expression in Th cells, whereas histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) enhances gene expression (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Friedman et al., 2023</xref></italic>).

H3K4me3 was found to be accumulated at <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic> loci in cKO CD4SP thymocytes, while its level in <italic>Gata3</italic> and <italic>Il4</italic> loci was comparable to that of wild type cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).

<p>Given that STAT1 is a key mediator downstream of IL-27 signaling (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Philips et al., 2022</xref></italic>), we were particularly interested in the altered expression of STAT1-regulated genes in the absence of IL-27p28. A previous study by Wan et al. (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wan et al., 2015</xref></italic>) has compared the transcriptomes of wild-type and STAT1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells stimulated by IL-21. Using their data (GSE63204), we compiled a list of genes potentially under regulation of STAT1. The DEGs were then examined for overlaps with this gene set. Surprisingly, over 40% of up-regulated DEGs (55 out of 137) fell into the category of STAT1-activated genes, whereas only 2 of them belonged to STAT1-suppressed genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). To validate the RNA-Seq data, quantitative PCR was carried out for a group of overlapping genes, including <italic>Gm12250, Oasl2, Oas3, Parp14, Ifit3, Usp18, Igtp, Irf1, Ifi44, Oas2, Rsad2, Il12r</italic>. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, all these genes showed differential expression between WT and cKO CD4SP thymocytes. To further illustrate modest but coordinate changes in the expression of STAT1-regulated genes, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed without imposing an arbitrary fold-change cutoff. Indeed, significant enrichment of STAT1-activated genes was detected in the transcriptome of CD4SP thymocytes from the knockout mice (NES=-2.27, NOM p- val=0, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Therefore, IL-27p28 deficiency resulted in an enhanced STAT1 activity.</p>
<p>To reveal functionally important connections of the DEGs, protein-protein interaction network was generated using Network Analyst (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Xia et al., 2015</xref></italic>). After removal of isolated and loosely connected nodes, the rest of the proteins encoded by the DEGs were imported into Network Analyst for network construction. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, STAT1 was centrally positioned in the network with the highest degree of interactions. Taken together, these results indicate that IL-27p28 deficiency is strongly associated with an altered transcriptional program featured by enhanced expression of STAT1-activated genes.</p>

<label>5.</label><title>Constitutive activation of STAT1 in CD4SP thymocytes in the absence of IL- 27p28</title>
<p>The distinct transcriptional signature prompted us to examine the activation status of STAT1 in freshly isolated CD4SP thymocytes from <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic>mice and the WT littermates. Total thymocytes were stained for CD4 and CD8, followed by intracellular staining with antibodies against phosphorylated STATs. Significant levels of STAT1 Y701 phosphorylation were observed in cKO but not in WT cells. On the other hand, both cKO and WT cells were stained negative for phosphorylated STAT3 and STAT4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Phosphorylated and total STAT proteins were also analyzed by Western blotting in purified CD4SP thymocytes, RTEs and naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. While the total protein of STAT1 was comparable between cKO and WT cells in all populations examined, elevated levels of phosphorylated STAT1 Y701 were constantly detected in cKO cells. Moreover, the phosphorylation of STAT1 Y701 appeared to be developmentally regulated, increasing progressively from CD4SP thymocytes to naive T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Another predominant phosphorylation site in STAT1 is serine 727, which is crucial for maximal STAT1 transcription activity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barnholt et al., 2009</xref></italic>). Basal levels of S727 phosphorylation were also observed in CD4SP thymocytes, but with no difference in WT and cKO cells (data not shown). As much as STAT3 and STAT4 were concerned, neither total nor phosphorylated STAT3 and STAT4 were found to be altered with IL-27p28 ablation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that the impact is specific for STAT1.</p>

<p>STAT1 plays an important role in the development of Th1 response by regulating <italic>Tbx21</italic> and <italic>Ifng</italic> expression (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fang et al., 2022</xref></italic>). To explore the correlation of the increased STAT1 activation with the enhanced T-bet expression and IFN-γ production, we assessed STAT1 binding on the <italic>Tbx21</italic> and <italic>Ifng</italic> loci by ChIP assay. Possibly due to the relatively low abundance of activated STAT1, poor consistency was observed from one experiment to another with freshly isolated CD4SP thymocytes. Therefore, we chose to treat the cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 3 days prior to the assay. Under such conditions, STAT1 was found to be markedly accumulated in the promoter and regulatory regions of both <italic>Tbx21</italic> and <italic>Ifng</italic> loci of cKO mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Notably, there were strong positive correlations between the levels of STAT1 binding and H3K4me3 (Pearson’s correlation coefficient for <italic>Ifng</italic> locus r = 0.917, p = 0.010 and <italic>Tbx21</italic> locus r = 0.991, p &lt;0.001, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating the implication of STAT1 in the epigenetic modifications of the loci. Together, these data suggest that IL-27p28-medaited signal normally imposes an inhibitory effect on STAT1 activation, which in turn helps the establishment of functional bias against the Th1 lineage.</p>

<label>6.</label><title>Augmented autoimmune phenotype of <italic>Aire</italic>-deficient mice in the absence of IL- 27p28</title>
<p>The physiological significance remains elusive of the bias against the Th1 effector functions for CD4SP thymocytes and RTEs. One hypothesis proposes that it favors the development of peripheral tolerance by avoiding a more inflammatory and potential detrimental response to self-antigens (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cunningham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fink &amp; Hendricks, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hendricks &amp; Fink, 2011</xref></italic>). The disruption of such a bias in <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice provided a good model to test this hypothesis. Flow cytometric analysis of the peripheral T cell compartment demonstrated a significant increase of CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>-</sup> activated T cells with a concomitant decrease of CD44<sup>lo</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup> naive T cells in the cKO mice compared to the WT littermates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Nevertheless, the cKO mice displayed no obvious signs of autoimmunity up to the age of 24-30 weeks when assessed by auto-antibodies against double-strand DNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) and tissue pathology (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Occasionally, small lymphoid foci were observed in the lung of cKO mice. But the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells recovered from the lung tissues displayed a similar cytokine secretion profile to that of WT mice except for the intrinsic augmentation of IFN-γ production (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Therefore, IL-27p28 deficiency alone is insufficient to drive the development of autoimmunity.</p>

<p>We next sought to determine whether IL-27p28 deficiency would affect the autoimmune phonotype in the <italic>Aire</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse, which are predisposed to developing autoimmunity due to a defect in clonal deletion of autoreactive T cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">van Laar et al., 2022</xref>; J.

To this end, <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice were crossed with <italic>Aire</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice to generate double knockout mice. Histological examination revealed increased lymphocyte infiltration and more severe structural distortion in the lung and stomach in double knockout mice in comparison to mice deficient for Aire only (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). In addition, the double knockout mice exhibited an elevated level of autoantibodies to double-strand DNA, although the difference did not reach a statistical significance (<italic>p</italic>=0.068) possibly due to the limited sample size (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). When CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells recovered from the lung tissues were analyzed for IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-17 production, the double knockout mice were virtually indistinguishable from the <italic>Aire</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, except for increased IFN-γ production (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>Immunological anergy constitutes an important mechanism for peripheral tolerance. Two studies have identified a subset of naturally occurring Foxp3<sup>−</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD73<sup>hi</sup>FR4<sup>hi</sup> polyclonal CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in healthy hosts.

We wondered whether the Th1 bias induced by IL-27p28 deficiency would affect the generation of the anergic population.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Th2 polarization in adult SP thymocytes and RTEs is believed to be maintained through epigenetic modification at the <italic>Il4</italic> locus. However, the regulation of the opposing cytokine IFN-γ in this context remains unclear. We reported here that thymic DC-derived IL-27p28 played a key role in the establishment of the repressive status of the <italic>Ifng</italic> locus in newly generated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. As such, the loss of IL-27p28 in DCs endowed these cells with increased capacity of INF-γ production upon TCR engagement. Transcriptome profiling demonstrated coordinated up-regulation of STAT1-activated genes in the absence of IL-27p28. Indeed, enhanced phosphorylation of STAT1 was observed in CD4SP thymocytes from <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice, which was accompanied by the accumulation of STAT1 at the promoter and enhancer regions of <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic>. Epigenetic analyses indicated reduced DNA methylation at the <italic>Ifng</italic> locus and increased trimethylation of H3K4 at both <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic> loci in the absence of IL-27p28. Moreover, the H3K4me3 modification was shown to be strongly correlated with STAT1 binding to these loci. These data support a hypothesis that the exposure of developing thymocytes to IL-27p28 induces repressive epigenetic changes at the <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic> loci, possibly through antagonizing STAT1 activation, ultimately leading to an attenuated IFN-γ response of newly generated CD4SP thymocytes.</p>
<p>The present study revealed a significantly elevated level of phosphorylated STAT1 and up-regulation of a variety of STAT1-regulated genes in CD4SP thymocytes from <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice, indicating that IL-27p28 plays an important role in the fine tuning of STAT1 signaling in the developing thymocytes. As IL-27 is known to activate multiple STAT proteins, including STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, and STAT5 following engagement of the gp130/IL-27Rα receptor (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Philips et al., 2022</xref></italic>), the hyperactivation of STAT1 in the absence of IL-27p28 is somehow unexpected. We examined the potential impact of IL-27 deficiency on the expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), which has been shown to have a regulatory role in IL-27 signaling (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Owaki et al., 2006</xref></italic>). Comparable levels of SOCS3 were detected in CD4SP thymocytes and naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice and their littermates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-figure supplement 1). We also explored the possibility that the constitutive activation of STAT1 might be the secondary effect of enhanced IFN-γ production. Addition of IFN- γ antibodies to the culture of CD4SP thymocytes and naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, however, showed no significant effect on phosphorylated STAT1 levels in knockout cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-figure supplement 2A-B). Thus, STAT1 hyperaction is unlikely due to loss of SOCS3 expression or positive feedback of IFN-γ signaling. Of note, it has been previously demonstrated that IL-27p28 on its own can act as a natural antagonist of gp130- mediated signaling triggered by IL-6, IL-11 and IL-27 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Stumhofer et al., 2010</xref></italic>). Consistent with this finding, Chong et al. reported that IL-27p28 was able to inhibit IL- 27-induced Th1 differentiation by reducing the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chong et al., 2014</xref></italic>). Therefore, we speculate that IL-27p28 in the thymus may primarily functions to suppress STAT1 activation induced by other cytokines.</p>
<p>A recent study demonstrated that both recombinant murine and human IL-27 induced the expression of antiviral proteins <italic>Oas1</italic>, <italic>Oas2</italic>, <italic>Oas3</italic>, <italic>Oasl1</italic>, and <italic>Oasl2</italic> in epidermal keratinocytes. IL-27 signaling leads to OAS2 expression in a manner dependent on IL27Rα and STAT1, but independent of STAT2. Apart from their antiviral activity, OAS proteins are also involved in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Castelli et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Huang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Salzberg et al., 1997</xref></italic>). The genomic mutation and methylation of most OAS genes have been shown to alter their expression levels, which is associated with the levels of infiltrated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the tumor microenvironment (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gao et al., 2022</xref></italic>). Secreted OAS2 has also been observed to inhibit CD3 zeta chain expression in T cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dar et al., 2016</xref></italic>). In our current study, we observed an increase in the transcription of <italic>Oasl2, Oas2</italic>, and <italic>Oas3</italic> in CD4SP thymocytes from <italic>Cd11c-p28<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice, indicating that IL-27p28 signaling also involved in the fine-tuning of these OAS protein expressions. Whether these molecules play a role in thymocyte development remains to be clarified.</p>
<p>The biased functionality of newly generated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells has been proposed to be important for the induction of peripheral tolerance to self-antigens (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cunningham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fink &amp; Hendricks, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hendricks &amp; Fink, 2011</xref></italic>). Despite the much enhanced capacity of IFN-γ production by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and a significant increase of CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>-</sup> activated T cells, <italic>Cd11c-p28</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice displayed no apparent signs of autoimmunity under steady-state conditions. This is consistent with the result of our previous study in which negative selection was found to proceed normally in <italic>Cd11c- p28</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice using the RIP-mOVA and OT-II models (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tang et al., 2016</xref></italic>). We further interrogated the impact of the disrupted functional bias in <italic>Aire</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Aire induces ectopic expression of self-antigens in medullary thymic epithelial cells to mediate negative selection of autoreactive thymocytes. Its mutation causes a rare life-threatening autoimmune disease affecting multiple organs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">van Laar et al., 2022</xref>; J. X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wang et al., 2021</xref></italic>). In comparison to <italic>Aire</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, <italic>Cd11c-p28</italic><sup>f/f</sup> <italic>Aire</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice showed elevated levels of double-strand DNA autoantibodies, increased lymphocytes infiltration, and reduced anergic cells. Therefore, although disruption of the functional bias in newly generated T cells is not sufficient to drive autoimmunity, it accelerates disease development in hosts poised for autoimmunity.</p>
<p>In further support of a direct link between IL-27 and Aire, a recent study revealed that IL-27 production was inhibited in Aire-overexpressing murine dendritic cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zou et al., 2021</xref></italic>). The two subunits IL-27p28 and EBI3 of human IL-27 are usually coordinately expressed in antigen-presenting cells, while mouse IL-27p28 can be secreted independently to inhibit the activities of IL-27 signaling (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pflanz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Stumhofer et al., 2010</xref></italic>). The distinct production profile of IL-27p28 between humans and mice and our finding of the critical role of IL-27p28 in the maintenance of functional bias in newly generated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells may explain the much weaker autoimmune phenotype in <italic>Aire<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice than <italic>AIRE</italic>-mutated human subjects. In addition, recent studies have reported elevation of serum IL-27p28 (also known as IL-30) in patients with prostate cancer (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sorrentino et al., 2019</xref></italic>), psoriasis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Omar et al., 2021</xref></italic>), and obesity (<italic>Q. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wang et al., 2021</xref></italic>). It would be interesting to explore the involvement of altered functionality of newly generated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells under these pathological conditions.</p>
<p>Taken together, our data demonstrate that DC-derived IL-27p28 serves as an endogenous inhibitor for STAT1 hyper-activation in developing thymocytes. By regulating DNA and H3K4 methylation levels at the promoter and transcription regulatory regions of <italic>Ifng</italic> and <italic>Tbx21</italic>, it is critically involved in the establishment of the functional bias against IFN-γ production by newly generated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Disruption of this mechanism exacerbates autoimmune phenotypes in hosts predisposed for autoimmunity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zhang et al. demonstrate that CD4+ single positive (SP) thymocytes, CD4+ recent thymic emigrants (RTE), and CD4+ T naive (Tn) cells from Cd11c-p28-flox mice, which lack IL-27p28 selectively in Cd11c+ cells, exhibit a hyper-Th1 phenotype instead of the expected hyper Th2 phenotype. Using IL-27R-deficient mice, the authors confirm that this hyper-Th1 phenotype is due to IL-27 signaling via IL-27R, rather than the effects of monomeric IL-27p28. They also crossed Cd11c-p28-flox mice with autoimmune-prone Aire-deficient mice and showed that both T cell responses and tissue pathology are enhanced, suggesting that SP, RTE, and Tn cells from Cd11c-p28-flox mice are poised to become Th1 cells in response to self-antigens. Regarding mechanism, the authors demonstrate that SP, RTE, and Tn cells from Cd11c-p28-flox mice have reduced DNA methylation at the IFN-g and Tbx21 loci, indicating 'de-repression', along with enhanced histone tri-methylation at H3K4, indicating a 'permissive' transcriptional state. They also find evidence for enhanced STAT1 activity, which is relevant given the well-established role of STAT1 in promoting Th1 responses, and surprising given IL-27 is a potent STAT1 activator. This latter finding suggests that the Th1-inhibiting property of thymic IL-27 may not be due to direct effects on the T cells themselves.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall the data presented are high quality and the manuscript is well-reasoned and composed. The basic finding - that thymic IL-27 production limits the Th1 potential of SP, RTE, and Tn cells - is both unexpected and well described.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A credible mechanistic explanation, cellular or molecular, is lacking. The authors convincingly affirm the hyper-Th1 phenotype at epigenetic level but it remains unclear whether the observed changes reflect the capacity of IL-27 to directly elicit epigenetic remodeling in developing thymocytes or knock-on effects from other cell types which, in turn, elicit the epigenetic changes (presumably via cytokines). The authors propose that increased STAT1 activity is a driving force for the epigenetic changes and resultant hyper-Th1 phenotype. That conclusion is logical given the data at hand but the alternative hypothesis - that the hyper-STAT1 response is just a downstream consequence of the hyper-Th1 phenotype - remains equally likely. Thus, while the discovery of a new anti-inflammatory function for IL-27 within the thymus is compelling, further mechanistic studies are needed to advance the finding beyond phenomenology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Naïve CD4 T cells in CD11c-Cre p28-floxed mice express highly elevated levels of proinflammatory IFNg and the transcription factor T-bet. This phenotype turned out to be imposed by thymic dendritic cells (DCs) during CD4SP T cell development in the thymus [PMID: 23175475]. The current study affirms these observations, first, by developmentally mapping the IFNg dysregulation to newly generated thymic CD4SP cells [PMID: 23175475], second, by demonstrating increased STAT1 activation being associated with increased T-bet expression in CD11c-Cre p28-floxed CD4 T cells [PMID: 36109504], and lastly, by confirming IL-27 as the key cytokine in this process [PMID: 27469302]. The authors further demonstrate that such dysregulated cytokine expression is specific to the Th1 cytokine IFNg, without affecting the expression of the Th2 cytokine IL-4, thus proposing a role for thymic DC-derived p28 in shaping the cytokine response of newly generated CD4 helper T cells. Mechanistically, CD4SP cells of CD11c-Cre p28-floxed mice were found to display epigenetic changes in the Ifng and Tbx21 gene loci that were consistent with increased transcriptional activities of IFNg and T-bet mRNA expression. Moreover, in autoimmune Aire-deficiency settings, CD11c-Cre p28-floxed CD4 T cells still expressed significantly increased amounts of IFNg, exacerbating the autoimmune response and disease severity. Based on these results, the investigators propose a model where thymic DC-derived IL-27 is necessary to suppress IFNg expression by CD4SP cells and thus would impose a Th2-skewed predisposition of newly generated CD4 T cells in the thymus, potentially relevant in autoimmunity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Experiments are well-designed and executed. The conclusions are convincing and supported by the experimental results.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The premise of the current study is confusing as it tries to use the CD11c-p28 floxed mouse model to explain the Th2-prone immune profile of newly generated CD4SP thymocytes. Instead, it would be more helpful to (1) give full credit to the original study which already described the proinflammatory IFNg+ phenotype of CD4 T cells in CD11c-p28 floxed mice to be mediated by thymic dendritic cells [PMID: 23175475], and then, (2) build on that to explain that this study is aimed to understand the molecular basis of the original finding.</p>
<p>In its essence, this study mostly rediscovers and reaffirms previously reported findings, but with different tools. While the mapping of epigenetic changes in the IFNg and T-bet gene loci and the STAT1 gene signature in CD4SP cells are interesting, these are expected results, and they only reaffirm what would be assumed from the literature. Thus, there is only incremental gain in new insights and information on the role of DC-derived IL-27 in driving the Th1 phenotype of CD4SP cells in CD11c-p28 floxed mice.</p>
<p>Altogether, the major issues of this study remain unresolved:</p>
<p>(1) It is still unclear why the p28-deficiency in thymic dendritic cells would result in increased STAT1 activation in CD4SP cells. Based on their in vitro experiments with blocking anti-IFNg antibodies, the authors conclude that it is unlikely that the constitutive activation of STAT1 would be a secondary effect due to autocrine IFNg production by CD4SP cells. However, this possibility should be further tested with in vivo models, such as Ifng-deficient CD11c-p28 floxed mice. Alternatively, is this an indirect effect by other IFNg producers in the thymus, such as iNKT cells? It is necessary to explain what drives the STAT1 activation in CD11c-p28 floxed CD4SP cells in the first place.</p>
<p>(2) It is also unclear whether CD4SP cells are the direct targets of IL-27 p28. The cell-intrinsic effects of IL-27 p28 signaling in CD4SP cells should be assessed and demonstrated, ideally by CD4SP-specific deletion of IL-27Ra, or by establishing bone marrow chimeras of IL-27Ra germline KO mice.</p>

<p>Thanks for the comments. Following the suggestions of the reviewer, further studies will be performed to test whether developing thymocytes are the direct targets of IL-27 using Cd4-IL-27ra knockout mice or mixed bone marrow chimeras of wildtype and IL-27ra knockout cells.</p>
<p>To address the potential autocrine loop in the STAT1 hyperactivation, we added IFN-γ antibody into CD4+ T cell cultures and saw no obvious impact on STAT1 phosphorylation. If deemed necessary, we could further test this possibility in vivo using Cd4-Ifng and CD11c-p28 double knockout mice.</p>
<p>The detailed mechanisms underlying the hyperactivation of STAT1 remain to be determined. IL-27p28 has recently been shown to act as an antagonist of gp130-mediated signaling. In addition, structural studies have demonstrated that IL-27p28 has the interface with EBI3, as well as the two receptor subunits IL-27Rα and gp130. Taken into consideration of these findings and the fact that p28 and IL-27ra deficiency exhibits similar phenotype, we speculate that deficiency in either p28 or IL-27ra makes more gp130 available to transduce signals elicited by other cytokines. We will next focus on gp130 related cytokines to search for the candidate(s) which ultimately leads to enhanced STAT1 activation in the absence of p28. Alternatively, release of EBI3 in the absence of p28 may facilitate its coupling with other cytokine subunits. IL-35, which is composed of EBI3 and p35, is of particular interest as IL-27Rα is also involved in its signaling.</p>
<p>To narrow down the candidate cytokines, we will first examine the expression of IL-35 and gp130 related cytokines, including IL-6, IL-11, LIF, CT1, OSM, IL-31, CLCF1, CNTF in the thymus and thymocyte-depleted thymic stromal cells by mining public databases and by RT-PCR. Similarly, CD4+ thymocytes will be examined for the expression of receptor subunits which can couple with gp130, including IL-6R, IL-11R, LIFR, OSMRβ, IL-31Rα, CNTFRα, IL-23R, and IL-12Rβ2.</p>
<p>We next will select those cytokines expressed in the thymus or thymic stromal cells with cognate receptor expression in CD4+ thymocytes and test their effect on STAT1 phosphorylation of wildtype and p28-deficient CD4+ thymocytes. If deemed necessary, double knockout mice will be engaged to rescue the hyper-Th1 phenotype.</p>

Based on these results, the investigators propose a model where thymic DC-derived IL-27 is necessary to suppress IFNg expression by CD4SP cells and thus would impose a Th2-skewed predisposition of newly generated CD4 T cells in the thymus, potentially relevant in autoimmunity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Experiments are well-designed and executed. The conclusions are convincing and supported by the experimental results.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The premise of the current study is confusing as it tries to use the CD11c-p28 floxed mouse model to explain the Th2-prone immune profile of newly generated CD4SP thymocytes. Instead, it would be more helpful to (1) give full credit to the original study which already described the proinflammatory IFNg+ phenotype of CD4 T cells in CD11c-p28 floxed mice to be mediated by thymic dendritic cells [PMID: 23175475], and then, (2) build on that to explain that this study is aimed to understand the molecular basis of the original finding.
In its essence, this study mostly rediscovers and reaffirms previously reported findings, but with different tools. While the mapping of epigenetic changes in the IFNg and T-bet gene loci and the STAT1 gene signature in CD4SP cells are interesting, these are expected results, and they only reaffirm what would be assumed from the literature. Thus, there is only incremental gain in new insights and information on the role of DC-derived IL-27 in driving the Th1 phenotype of CD4SP cells in CD11c-p28 floxed mice.</p>

<p>Indeed, the present study is based on the finding of enhanced IFN-γ production by CD4+ T cells from CD11c-p28 floxed mice, which was originally reported by Zhang et al. and repeatedly cited in the our manuscript. We revisited this phenomenon in the context of functional bias of newly generated CD4+ T cells and sought to reveal the mechanisms underlying the hyper-Th1 phenotype in the absence of thymic DC-derived IL-27. We showed that deletion of p28 resulted in an unexpected hyperactivation of STAT1, which was accompanied by epigenetic changes in favor of Th1 bias. However, the gap remains between p28 deficiency and STAT1 activation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Altogether, the major issues of this study remain unresolved:</p>
<p>(1) It is still unclear why the p28-deficiency in thymic dendritic cells would result in increased STAT1 activation in CD4SP cells. Based on their in vitro experiments with blocking anti-IFNg antibodies, the authors conclude that it is unlikely that the constitutive activation of STAT1 would be a secondary effect due to autocrine IFNg production by CD4SP cells. However, this possibility should be further tested with in vivo models, such as Ifng-deficient CD11c-p28 floxed mice. Alternatively, is this an indirect effect by other IFNg producers in the thymus, such as iNKT cells? It is necessary to explain what drives the STAT1 activation in CD11c-p28 floxed CD4SP cells in the first place.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions. Further studies will be performed to test the potential autocrine loop for IFN-γ production in vivo using Cd4-Ifng and CD11c-p28 double knockout mice. This model should also be helpful to exclude the possibility of indirect role of IFN- production by such cells as iNKT.</p>
<p>As pointed out by the reviewer, a critical unanswered question is what drives the STAT1 activation in CD11c-p28 floxed CD4SP cells. Several lines of evidence point to the possibility that p28 deficiency increases the responsiveness of developing thymocytes to STAT1-activating cytokines. Firstly, IL-27p28 has recently been shown to act as an antagonist of gp130-mediated signaling. Secondly, structural studies have demonstrated that IL-27p28 is centrally positioned in the complex formed with EBI3, as well as the two receptor subunits IL-27Rα and gp130. Thirdly, we observed similar hyper-Th1 phenotype in the absence of either p28 and IL-27ra. Therefore, it is speculated that more gp130 should be available to transduce signals elicited by other cytokines in such a scenario. We will next seek to determine the candidate cytokine(s) responsible for the enhanced STAT1 activation in the absence of p28 as outlined in the response to Reviewer 1.</p>

<p>(2) It is also unclear whether CD4SP cells are the direct targets of IL-27 p28. The cell-intrinsic effects of IL-27 p28 signaling in CD4SP cells should be assessed and demonstrated, ideally by CD4SP-specific deletion of IL-27Ra, or by establishing bone marrow chimeras of IL-27Ra germline KO mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions. Further studies will be performed to test whether developing thymocytes are the direct targets of IL-27 using Cd4-IL-27ra knockout mice or mixed bone marrow chimeras of wildtype and IL-27ra knockout cells.</p>
