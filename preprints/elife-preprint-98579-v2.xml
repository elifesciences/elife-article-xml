<title>Abstract</title><p>Tumor neoantigen peptide vaccines hold potential for boosting cancer immunotherapy, yet efficiently co-delivering peptides and adjuvants to antigen-presenting cells in vivo remains challenging. Virus-like particle (VLP), which is a kind of multiprotein structure organized as virus, can deliver therapeutic substances into cells and stimulate immune response. However, the weak targeted delivery of VLP in vivo and its susceptibility to neutralization by antibodies hinder their clinical applications. Here, we firstly designed a novel protein carrier using the mammalian-derived capsid protein PEG10, which can self-assemble into endogenous VLP (eVLP) with high protein loading and transfection efficiency. Then, an engineered tumor vaccine, named ePAC, was developed by packaging genetically encoded neoantigen into eVLP with further modification of CpG-ODN on its surface to serve as an adjuvant and targeting unit to dendritic cells (DCs). Significantly, ePAC can efficiently target and transport neoantigens to DCs, and promote DCs maturation to induce neoantigen-specific T cells. Moreover, in mouse orthotopic liver cancer and humanized mouse tumor models, ePAC combined with anti-TIM-3 exhibited remarkable antitumor efficacy. Overall, these results support that ePAC could be safely utilized as cancer vaccines for antitumor therapy, showing significant potential for clinical translation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neoantigens, originating from non-synonymous mutations, incomplete splicing, translation of alternatives, or posttranslational modifications, are highly immunogenic because they are absent in normal tissues and can evade central thymic tolerance mechanisms(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Schumacher et al., 2019</xref>). Hence tumor neoantigen vaccines have been demonstrated as a promising and safe strategy in the treatment of various solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Typically, neoantigen peptides mixed with adjuvants are formulated into tumor neoantigen vaccines and directly administered to patients. Upon uptake of these antigen peptides and adjuvants, dendritic cells (DCs) are stimulated to activate neoantigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which in turn eliminate tumor cells and impede tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ott et al., 2017</xref>). However, the free antigen peptides and adjuvant inside the body following systemic administration tend to experience the rapid clearance and enzymatic degradation that would significantly limit their antitumor efficacy.</p>
<p>Lentiviruses offer an excellent approach to cross cell membranes by interacting with specific host cell receptors through viral envelope glycoproteins (Sundquist et al., 2012). To ensure safe gene delivery without permanent integration into the human genome, the protein of interest (POI) is always directly fused to lentiviral structural proteins for transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Voelkel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kaczmarczyk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cai et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, the POI can be inserted into the C-terminal of matrix protein (MA), core capsid (CA), nucleocapsid (NC), or even integrase (IN) with a protease site, allowing for independent functions upon cleavage by viral protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Voelkel et al., 2010</xref>). For example, in the delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNP), the lentiviral gag domain, including MA and NC, were fused with Cas9 and mixed with the full-length gag-pol domain for virus-like particle (VLP) packaging; upon transfection, Cas9 was cleaved by the protease from the viral pol domain in the host cell, leading to excellent gene editing efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Mangeot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hamilton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">An et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hamilton et al., 2024</xref>). To enhance the delivery efficacy of VLP, the ratio between gag-POI and gag-pol should be optimized. Additionally, the cleavage linker between gag and POI is also crucial for transfection, as it should be exposed on the protein surface for effective recognition by protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Banskota et al., 2022</xref>; Raguram A 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">An et al., 2024</xref>). In addition to nuclease delivery by lentiviral-designed VLP, gag domain from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adeno-associated virus, Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), or bacteriophages MS2, can also be assembled into VLP to carry other specific antigens to form VLP-based vaccines (RoldÃ£o A 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Klamp et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Li et al., 2014</xref>). With sizes ranging from 20 to 200 nm, resembling pathogen-associated structural patterns, these VLP-based vaccines can efficiently elicit in vivo immune responses and have been approved for use in clinical trials(RoldÃ£o A 2010). Immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages take up these vaccines through phagocytosis and micropinocytosis, and the present antigens from VLP to stimulate T cells for treating infectious diseases or cancer. However, viral-derived gag-pol in VLP, as a heterologous protein with strong immunogenicity, can also stimulate B cells to secrete neutralizing antibodies. These antibodies may remove VLPs from the body, thereby inhibiting the efficacy of VLP-based vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nooraei et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>PEG10</italic> is a domesticated transposable element, which is expressed in mammals encoding two open read frames, PEG10-RF1(a gag-like protein) and PEG10-RF1/2 (a fusion of the gag and pol domains) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lux et al., 2005</xref>). In brain, PEG10 has been identified as a component of stress granules and extracellular vesicles responsible for carrying mRNAs and proteins to transport information between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Pandya et al., 2021</xref>). Overexpression of PEG10 in HEK293FT cells resulted in the observation of extracellular vesicles containing the core capsid (CA) domain in the culture medium, demonstrating that endogenous retrovirus-like gag protein could be engineered into VLP for molecule transport (Segel M et al., 2021). Beside PEG10, the retrovirus-like protein Arc can also form VLP for cell communication, which is smaller than PEG10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ashley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pastuzyn et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, theoretically, endogenous retrovirus-like gag protein could be fused with antigens to produce VLP-based vaccines. However, endogenous VLP (eVLP) lack immunogenicity compared to viral VLP. This means that eVLP alone may struggle to activate dendritic cells (DCs) for inducing a robust immune response. To address this limitation, synthetic CpG oligonucleotide (CpG-ODN), a Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist, has been explored as adjuvants in clinical vaccine trials due to their potent immunostimulatory properties(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Coffman et al., 2010</xref>). DEC-205 is a multi-lectin receptor that has the binding capacity to CpG-ODN. For DCs, once CpG-ODN bonds to DEC-205, pinocytosis will be activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Lahoud et al., 2012</xref>). Once CpG-ODN is connected to eVLP, the particles will further gain two advantages: first, CpG-ODN modified eVLP tend to bind DEC-205, for initiating DCs to engulf these particles; second, after endocytosis, the CpG-ODN can enhance DC maturation and antigen presentation as an adjuvant. Therefore, CpG-ODN modification represents an excellent strategy to improve immune responses for eVLP-based vaccines.</p>
<p>In order to overcome the challenges associated with peptide vaccine delivery and leverage the unique biological characteristics of PEG10, herein we firstly engineered PEG10 gag domain with liver cancer specific neoantigens to assemble into eVLP for peptide vaccine delivery. Furthermore, CpG-ODN was anchored on the surface of eVLP-antigen complex, named as ePAC to enhance the DC targeting efficacy and the antigen induced immune response. Afterwards, we further evaluated the antitumor effect of our ePAC in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse model and confirmed that ePAC, as a cancer therapeutic vaccine, can activate immune response and regulate the tumor microenvironment. In general, our study reported a novel antigen delivery system which shows remarkable efficacy in transporting antigens to develop cancer therapeutic vaccine.</p>

<title>Preparation and Characterization of PEG10-assembled eVLP</title>
<p>The protein transfection process relying on VLP produced by virus-associated gag domain is straightforward and highly efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Voelkel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kaczmarczyk et al., 2011</xref>). As a type of retrovirus-like protein, mammalian-derived PEG10 possesses the canonical gag domain. We envision that the Protein of Interest (POI) could be fused to the PEG10 gag domain to create endogenous Virus-Like Particle (eVLP), which could then be delivered to targeted cells. To assess the transfection feasibility, eGFP was fused to the PEG10 gag domain behind the putative cutting site (NSQTD*PTEPV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lux et al., 2005</xref>) or a GS linker, along with the PEG10 gag-pol domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Plasmid VSVg is commonly used to assist retrovirus transfection. Therefore, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, gag-eGFP or gag-pol-eGFP combining with VSVg were transfected to HEK293T cells for eVLP production. After 24 hours, the fluorescence from HEK293T cells were recorded (Figure. S1A). We observed that eGFP fused behind the gag domain showed superior expression level compared to the gag-pol fused structure. Therefore, we chose group 2 to further determine the secreted eVLP, which were collected from the supernatant of the transfected HEK293T cells and concentrated through ultracentrifugation. As show in Supplementary Figure 1B and 1C, gag-eGFP protein was detectable via western blot analysis in the concentrated supernatant, similar to its detection in cell lysate, with CD9 serving as the loading control (the maker of extracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boker et al., 2018</xref>)). These results indicated that gag-eGFP could be self-assembled into eVLP for collection.</p>

</fig>
<p>Subsequently, the eVLPs collected from the four groups in Figure S1A were transfected into fresh HEK293T cells. Encouragingly, all gag and eGFP fused structure exhibited fluorescence in the cells, even with efficiency 90.1% by GS linker (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). For cutting site connecting structure, it reduced to 85.2% possibly owing to the steric effect from the fused protein during gag domain accumulation in cellular membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Meanwhile, the transfected HEK293T cells were collected and analyzed by Western Blot. The results further confirmed that eGFP can be transfected into HEK293T cells through PEG10 gag domain packaged eVLP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, when eGFP was fused to full-length PEG10, the fluorescence intensity was lower compared to the gag-only fusion type. But two distinct bands can still be observed during blotting, indicating successful self-cleavage by PEG10 protease domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). These results pointed out that GS linker could assist gag domain accumulation after fusing POI, and co-packaging PEG10 pol domain could facilitate POI releasing from gag domain in the presence of cutting site. Thus, behind cutting sequence of PEG10 gag domain, we used GS linker to connect POI for following experiments, presenting as gag-POI.</p>
<p>Normally, gag-pol and gag-POI should be co-transfected to produce VLP. Increasing the percentage of gag-pol could make VLP more stable and release POI efficiently from gag domain, however, it also would reduce the loading capacity of VLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hamilton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Banskota et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, to carry sufficient targeting protein for transfection, the plasmid ratio between gag-pol and gag-POI should be coordinated. We then compared eVLP transfection efficiency to HEK293T cells with various ratios of gag-pol and gag-eGFP plasmids, and noticed that gag-pol 2 Î¼g: gag-eGFP 14 Î¼g: VSVg 3 Î¼g was the most appropriate for targeting protein transfection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). Meanwhile, the function of VSVg for PEG10 based eVLP transfection was also determined. Without VSVg, the positive eGFP cells decreased dramatically from 73.5% to 16.4%, indicating that eVLP, like lentiviral or retroviral vectors, needed VSVg for transfection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>). To sum up, we designed a new protein transfection strategy based on PEG10-packaged eVLP with high transfection efficiency.</p>

<p>To prepare eVLP-based neoantigen vaccine, PEG10 gag domain was then fused with 7 tumor neoantigens from Hepa1-6 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2022</xref>) instead of eGFP, and the productivity of eVLP was evaluated by quantifying the total amount of proteins produced from one 10-cm dish of transfected HEK293T cells (eVLP vs control: 212Â±7.388 Î¼g vs 76.59Â±7.463 Î¼g, Figure S2). But in vivo, solely relying on the eVLP-antigen complex for antigen delivery to antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and immune response activation is not efficient. Although pseudotyped vectors expressing VSVg demonstrate robust mechanical stability and high titers for in vitro transduction, achieving effective transduction efficiencies for therapeutically relevant cells in vivo, such as hematopoietic stem cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and T cells, requires further modification of the vector surface by antibodies, peptides, or nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Lahoud et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lynn et al., 2020</xref>; Wei Y 2021). Here we utilized CpG-ODN to modify the eVLP-antigen complex, resulting in what we termed ePAC, which can interact with the DC surface protein DEC-205, thereby stimulating the intracellular receptor TLR9 and enhancing DC maturation. The modification process involved two steps: 1) The free amino group from the concentrated eVLP was reacted with NHS Ester carried by DBCO under 4L for 12h in PBS buffer. This step allowed for the anchoring of DBCO onto the eVLP. 2) CpG-ODN synthesized with 3âAzide (and 5âFAM) was added to DBCO anchored eVLP. This facilitated copper-free click chemistry, enabling the coupling of CpG-ODN to the eVLP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, by varying the concentration of DBCO-C6-NHS Ester from 0 to 14 nmol, ePAC exhibited different CpG-ODN loading efficiency as evidenced by agarose gel electrophoresis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and Figure S3). And the results showed that in a 200 Âµl eVLP reaction system, 3.5 nmol DBCO achieved the highest modification efficiency. Meanwhile, ePACs with elevated levels of CpG-ODN modification demonstrated robust fluorescent intensity in flow cytometry analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>DEC-205 is a CpG-ODN receptor expressed by a variety of antigen presenting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Lahoud et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Li et al., 2021</xref>). To explore the potential binding of CpG-ODN by DEC-205 and its impact on enhancing ePAC transfection efficiency, CHO cells, known for their ease of engineering to express large functional membrane proteins, were utilized to express mouse DEC-205. By flow cytometry analysis, ePAC transfection efficiency was 39.70Â±2.157 % in CHO cells with transient transfected DEC-205, which was significantly higher than that in wild type CHO cells (29.0 Â± 1.514%, <italic>p=0.0035</italic>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). In addition to transient expression, DEC-205 fused with mCherry at the C-terminal was introduced into CHO cells via lentiviral transfection. The expression of DEC-205-mCherry was notably observable using mCherry fluorescence under confocal microscopy (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Meanwhile, following a 2-hour co-culture with ePAC, CHO cells expressing DEC-205-mCherry exhibited stronger FAM signal than that in wild type CHO cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). These results suggested that CpG-ODN decoration could specifically improve the eVLP transfection efficiency in cells expressing DEC-205.</p>

<title>In vitro stimulation of DCs by ePAC</title>
<p>The transfection efficiency of ePAC was further verified in DC2.4 cells and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) from mouse (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). With CpG-ODN modification, the transfection efficiency of eVLP for DC2.4 cells and DCs were 99.9% and 43.4%, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). To confirm whether ePAC activated the intercellular receptor TLR9 signaling with cytokines secretion, the medium from DC2.4 cells were analyzed by ELISA. Compared to CpG-ODN or eVLP treated group, ePAC could significantly upregulate IL-6 and IL-12p70 secretion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Furthermore, the DC2.4 cells were also collected for Western Blot to analyze TLR9-Myd88-P65 signaling. After 6h stimulation, ePAC treated group exhibited higher fold change ratio of phosphorylated P65 (0.79 vs 0.34) and Myd88 (0.63 vs 0.37) than eVLP group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). These results suggested that ePAC can be uptake by DC2.4 cells efficiently to activate the intracellular TLR9 signaling. To further investigate the immune response triggered by ePAC stimulated APCs in vitro, moused bone marrow derived DCs were co-culture with ePAC for two days. Subsequently, the expression levels of CD80 and CD86 (the hallmarks of DCs maturity) in CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs were measured by flow cytometry. In contrast to eVLP treated group, the ePAC treated group showed a significant increase in CD80 and CD86 expression (24.08Â±0.2355% vs 14.25Â±0.7854%, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>). Following this, mouse spleen-derived T cells were stimulated in vitro by the ePAC-transfected DCs for two days. On the third day, the fresh transfected DCs were reintroduced to the stimulated T cells for an additional two rounds of co-culture. Hepa1-6 cells were then co-cultured with the final activated T cells for 3 days to assess the killing efficiency mediated by DC-activated T cells. Post-co-culture, the cell culture supernatant was collected for cytotoxicity assays using LDH detection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Notably, we found the percentage of Hepa1-6 cell death was dramatically increased in ePAC treated group (ePAC 57.73Â±1.018% vs eVLP 39.49Â±0.08%), similar with the positive control treated with Hepa1-6-derived neoantigen peptides plus CpG-ODN (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>).

<title>ePAC delivery and immune activation in vivo</title>
<p>The migration of ePAC to lymph nodes and its capacity to activate DCs are crucial determinants of the quality of the induced immune response. In order to investigate the accumulation of ePAC in lymph nodes, it was initially labeled with Dil and then subcutaneously injected into C57BL/6 mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), while Dil and Dil plus eVLP (only carrying neoantigens) served as the control groups. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, both ePAC and eVLP with the same vesicle structure produced from 293T cells, can efficiently accumulate in the draining lymph nodes two days post injection. The accumulation level of ePAC in lymph node is approximately 1.5 times higher than that of Dil plus eVLP group, and 5 times higher than that of Dil only group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Subsequently, the collected lymph nodes were digested to prepare single-cell suspensions, and flow cytometry was employed to quantify the cellular uptake of ePAC in CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>, CpG-ODN modification enhanced the uptake efficiency of eVLP (ePAC 12.57Â±0.4055% vs eVLP 9.29Â±0.7225%, <italic>p=0.0391</italic>) compared to eVLP without CpG-ODN in vivo. To further determine the immune responses, the mice were subcutaneously injected with CpG-ODN, eVLP or ePAC for three times at different time points (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). After sacrifice, the upregulation of MHC-II, CD80 and CD86 in CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs from lymph nodes was measured by flow cytometry. In comparison to eVLP treated group, the ePAC treated group exhibited significantly higher expression of MHC-II (ePAC 62.03Â±0.7753 vs eVLP 48.30Â±3.251, <italic>p=0.0093</italic>) and co-expression of CD80 and CD86 (ePAC 24.77Â±0.2333 vs eVLP 17.07Â±0.5239, <italic>p=0.0023</italic>) in CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs, indicating superior activation of DC maturation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4J</xref>). Moreover, to analyze the formation of memory T cells induced by ePAC, the mouse splenic T cells were reactivated by DCs in vitro for interferon (IFN)-Î³ ELISPOT assay. The secretion of IFN-Î³ by T cells from ePAC stimulated group was approximately 2 times higher than that of eVLP treated group, (ePAC 156Â±13.45 vs eVLP 74Â±13.87, <italic>p=0.0011</italic>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4L</xref>).

<title>Antitumor effect of ePAC in subcutaneous HCC model</title>
<p>The therapeutic efficacy of ePAC was assessed in C57BL/6 mice bearing Hepa1-6 tumor cells. A total of thirty mice with tumors of approximately 60 mm<sup>3</sup> were randomly divided into five groups (n=6 per group). These groups were subcutaneously injected with PBS, CpG-ODN, eVLP, eVLP + CpG-ODN and ePAC, respectively, on the day 0, day 4, and day 8 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Mice treated with PBS exhibited rapid tumor growth, whereas tumor growth in the other treatment groups significantly slowed down after three injections. Furthermore, ePAC with the ability to target DCs and increased stability by encapsulating peptides, exhibited significantly higher tumor growth inhibition efficiency (<italic>p=0.0002</italic>) comparing with the eVLP + CpG-ODN treated group similar to the simple mixture of neoantigen peptides and adjuvant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Meanwhile, the Kaplan-Meier analysis of tumor progression free survival (PFS) also clearly demonstrated the therapeutic advantages of our ePAC (<italic>p=0.0194</italic>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). To further investigate whether ePAC exerted antitumor activity by activating immune responses, spleen and tumor samples were isolated from the treated mice. The percentage of effector memory T cells in the spleen was assessed via flow cytometry, revealing higher levels in the ePAC treated group (31.60Â±1.48%) compared to the eVLP group (14.22Â±1.377%) or the eVLP + CpG-ODN group (20.73Â±2.209%, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). Within the tumors, the infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were examined using immunohistochemistry. While changes in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were not apparent across all groups, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration was notably stimulated by ePAC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>). The activation of the infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was further assessed by flow cytometry based on the expression level of 41-BB.

<p>Normally, strong activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is often accompanied by high expression levels of immune checkpoints, which can inhibit their antitumor function. Next, we compared the expression level of PD-1, TIM-3 and CTLA-4 in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from tumor tissues between PBS treated group and ePAC treated group.

<p>To accurately simulate the intrahepatic immune microenvironment and monitor vaccine response, we established an orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model using Hepa1-6-luc-bearing mice. Given the upregulation of TIM-3 following ePAC vaccination, we aimed to enhance the antitumor immune response by combining ePAC with Î±TIM-3. The mice were randomly divided into 4 groups treated with PBS, Î±TIM-3, ePAC and ePAC + Î±TIM-3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, the combination of ePAC and Î±TIM-3 showed the lowest luciferase activity of tumors at the day 28, although the only Î±TIM-3 or ePAC treated mice showed reduced luciferase activity. Furthermore, the orthotopic tumor progress of 4/6 mice treated by ePAC + Î±TIM-3 was completely inhibited without any ghost, in contrast to the PBS (0/6), Î±TIM-3 (2/6), or ePAC treated alone (2/6) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).

<title>Antitumor effect by HLA-A*0201 restricted vaccine</title>
<p>To further confirm the function of T cell stimulation and antitumor effect of eVLP-packaged vaccine in human immune system, we incorporated an HBV-derived antigen (HBc18-27, with high binding affinity with HLA-A*0201) instead of previous neoantigens from Hepa 1-6 cells to PEG10 to prepare the ePAC vaccine. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donners with HLA-A*0201 restriction was used to derive monocytes, which were then induced with IL-4 and GM-CSF for 5 days to generate immature DCs (iDCs). Subsequently, the ePAC was added to stimulate iDC maturation for 2 days. After the stimulation, the DCs in ePAC treated group showed the highest level of maturation comparing to the eVLP treated group and control group (Figure S4), by using flow cytometry analysis. Then, the T cells from the same donerâs PBMCs with removing monocytes, were co-cultured with the stimulated DCs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>).

<p>The therapeutic efficacy of ePAC was further evaluated on HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice bearing Hepa1-6 tumor cells. Hepa1-6 cells were infected with adenovirus to express HLA-A0201 and the HBc18-27 epitope prior to seeding in mice (Figure S5A). 48 hours post-infection in vitro, strong mCherry signals were observed in the cells under an MOI of 500, and the HLA-A*0201 was consistently expressed on the cell surface (Figure S5B and S5C), suggesting that adenovirus-infected Hepa1-6 cells could potentially be targeted by ePAC vaccine-activated T cells in HLA-A0201 transgenic mice. After inoculating Hepa1-6 cells, a total of fifteen mice with tumors of approximately 60 mm<sup>3</sup> were randomly divided into three groups and the time was recorded as day 0. These mice were subcutaneously injected with PBS, Î±TIM-3, and Î±TIM-3 + ePAC, respectively, on the day 0, day 4, and day 8 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Two days before the treatment, the adenovirus carrying HBc18-27 and HLA-A*0201 were intratumorally injected to the tumors again to maintain the expression of HBc18-27 and HLA-A*0201. The mice inoculated with PBS and Î±TIM-3 suffered from continuous and rapid tumor growth, while in Î±TIM-3 + ePAC, tumor growth was significantly inhibited (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7G</xref>). To further validate the immune response in tumors, the infiltrated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the tumors was analyzed by flow cytometry, revealing a higher percentage in total CD3 positive cells from the Î±TIM-3 + ePAC treated group (18.0Â±0.7197% vs 11.96Â±0.4130%) than that from the only Î±TIM-3 treated group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7J</xref>). Additionally, the activated level of the infiltrated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were also tested based on the expression of 4-1BB. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7K</xref>, there was a stronger activation level in the Î±TIM-3 + ePAC treated group (18.86Â±2.573%) compared to the Î±TIM-3 treated group (7.27Â±1.218%). Collectively, our data suggested that that ePAC, as tumor vaccine, can elicit antigen-specific immune responses in humanized mice with HLA-A*0201 restriction, highlighting its potential as an effective immunotherapeutic strategy for activating the human immune system to induce potent antitumor immunity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Neoantigen vaccines designed by mixture of adjuvant and polypeptides have been demonstrated to effectively inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in mouse model (Mandelboim O 1995), and successfully treated several advanced solid tumors in clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sahin et al., 2017</xref>). Our previous study also demonstrated that this type of personalized neoantigen vaccine can effectively prevent recurrence of primary liver cancer after surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2021</xref>). All these studies have proved the antitumor effect by neoantigen-induced immune responses. Different from polypeptide vaccines, here we used PEG10 gag domain to directly fuse with neoantigens to package ePAC as cancer vaccine. This formulation has several advantages compared to polypeptides. Firstly, we can link multiple neoantigens into one plasmid for direct expression and harvest it as lentivirus by ultracentrifugation, so vaccines can be prepared easily in laboratory. Secondly, the cost of synthesizing polypeptides greatly saved, and it also avoids the situation that some polypeptides with strong immunogenicity, but high hydrophobicity cannot be synthesized. In addition, eVLP is more stable than polypeptide, which is essentially a vesicle produced from HEK293T cells. Although we did not compare the antitumor efficiency between polypeptide and eVLP in vivo, eVLP packaged cancer vaccine really induced neoantigen specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to antitumor. Furthermore, comparing to the virus-based delivery vectors, the lentiviruses although can stably integrate into the host genome but carry risks of insertional mutagenesis; adenoviruses although have high transduction efficiency but strong immunogenicity, which leads to fast clearance by the immune system of the host and affects the efficiency of the secondary injection. Instead, our VLPs offer low immunogenicity and superior safety, making them more suitable for repeated use and vaccine development. Therefore, we first demonstrate that PEG10 can co-express neoantigens and be packaged as eVLP-based cancer vaccine to induce strong immune response.</p>
<p>As a mammalian virus-like protein, PEG10 is the first to be developed to delivery mRNA and protein as eVLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abed et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Pandya et al., 2021</xref>; Segel M et al., 2021). Arc is another endogenous virus-like protein with smaller amino acid length, mainly because it has lost functional protein domain during evolution and only retains the gag domain to support vesicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ashley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pastuzyn et al., 2018</xref>). If Arc is engineered as eVLP, only two plasmids (gag-antigens and VSVg) are needed to prepare tumor vaccines, which could be simpler and more stable. But both PEG10 and Arc are mammalian homogenous proteins without the ability to induce host immune responses as natural viral proteins. And they also cannot specifically target to APC cells. In our study, CpG-ODN was anchored onto the surface of eVLP to activate DCs and direct eVLP to target DCs in vivo. In addition to serving as an adjuvant and targeting DCs, CpG-ODN possesses other advantages. Firstly, its nucleic acid sequence is short and easy to synthesize, resulting in low costs. Secondly, CpG-ODN as adjuvant has been approved by FDA. Furthermore, CpG-ODN is easy to modify with functional groups during synthesis, allowing for efficient conjugation to the surface of VLPs via click chemistry reactions.</p>
<p>Although neoantigen vaccines can induce immune responses to efficiently inhibit the development of tumors, some problems have been discovered in our previous studies. The most typical one is the high expressing level of PD-1 and TIM-3 in T cells after vaccination. When we used Î±PD-1 or Î±TIM-3 for combined intervention, the antitumor effect was superiors than neoantigen vaccine only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lin et al., 2024</xref>). In this study, we also measured the exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in subcutaneous tumors, and conducted the combined strategy with Î±TIM-3, which resulted in a more significant antitumor effect. Cytokines can also be used as a combined strategy for antitumor with neoantigen vaccines. IL-10 can reduce the exhaustion level of T cells through metabolic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zhao et al., 2024</xref>); IL-7 and IL-15 can moderately promote T cell proliferation and maintain the stemness of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adachi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Silva et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, in the next step, we will continue to explore some combined strategies based on ePAC vaccines and develop more efficient antitumor strategies for clinical translation.</p>
<p>In summary, we genetically engineered PEG10, one of the mammalian retrovirus-like protein, to establish an eVLP vector for antigen polypeptide delivery. Using this strategy, we further designed CpG-ODN modified tumor vaccine ePAC, which can effectively accumulate in the lymph nodes for DC targeting and stimulation. Thus, following the antigen presentation and cytokine secretion by the DCs, the activation of the tumor antigen-specific immune response leaded to considerable inhibition of tumor growth. These findings shed light on fundamental studies of fusion-based cargo delivery by eVLP, offering a promising avenue for the development of therapeutic vaccines targeting infectious diseases and cancers.</p>

<title>Plasmids</title>
<p>PEG10 DNA sequence was synthesized according to pCMV-MmPeg10rc4 (addgene #174858). Then, the fragments of PEG10 including gag and gag-pol domain were amplified by PCR and inserted to pcDNA3.1 vector for plasmid construction. DEC205 was amplified by PCR from mouse bone marrow derived DCs, and mCherry was fused to the C-terminal of DEC205 and then inserted to pCDH vector for plasmid construction. Hepa1-6 cell derived seven neoantigens were identified in our previous study(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2022</xref>), and the DNA sequences were fused to the C-terminal of PEG10 gag domain cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector. The DNA sequence of HBc18-27 epitope was also synthesized and fused to PEG10. All DNA sequences were confirmed by sequencing after purification (EndoFree Maxi Plasmid Kit, TIANGEN Biotech). The sequences of these plasmids were listed in Table S1.</p>

<title>Cell lines</title>
<p>HEK293T cells, CHO cells, DC2.4 cells and Murine HCC cell line Hepa1-6 cells were obtained from ATCC. HepG2.2.15 cells were purchased from IMMOCELL (Xiamen, China). All these cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin at 37 Â°C in a humidified environment with 5% CO2. Luciferase-expressing Hepa1-6 (Hepa1-6-luc) cells were established through lentivirus transfection expressing luciferase reporter gene, and then the positive cells were selected by puromycin and maintained in low concentration of puromycin (Shanghai Genechem Co., Ltd).</p>

<title>eVLPs production, purification and modification</title>
<p>eVLPs were produced by transient transfection of HEK293T cells. Briefly, HEK293T cells were seeded in 10-cm dish 24h before transfection. Then, the plasmids expressing PEG10 (16 Î¼g) and VSVg (3 Î¼g) were co-transfected per dish. For PEG10, it includes two plasmids, gag-POI and gag-pol. The ratio between gag-POI and gag-pol was regulated according to different experiments as indicated. After 48 h and 72 h, the cell culture medium was collected and centrifuged at 2000 g for 20 min to remove cell debris. The clarified eVLP-containing supernatant was then filtered by a 0.45-Î¼m PVDF filter (EMD Millipore, #SE1M003M00), and ultracentrifuged at 120,000 g for 1.5h at 4Â°C in a Beckman Coulter Optima XPN-80 ultracentrifuge. Afterwards, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet that finally harvested from one 10-cm dish around 20 ml cell culture medium was then further resuspended by 200 Î¼l PBS. For eVLP that were used in the following in vitro experiments, it was concentrated 100-fold from cell culture medium using Lenti-Xâ¢ Concentrator (Takara, #631231) according to the manufacturerâs protocol. For eVLP that were injected into mice, it was concentrated 1000-fold by ultracentrifugation using a cushion of 20% (w/v) sucrose in PBS. To modify the concentrated eVLP by CpG-ODN, the DBCO-C6-NHS Ester (30 mg/ml, MACKLIN, China) was added into eVLP overnight at 4Â°C, then dialyzed using an ultra-centrifugal filter tube (AmiconÂ® Ultra-0.5 50k device, Millipore, Darmstadt) extensively with PBS for three times. Afterwards, the CpG-ODN-Azide (100 Î¼M, General Biol., China) was then further reacted with DBCO-eVLP through click chemistry at 37Â°C for 2h. Subsequently, the product was dialyzed again using an ultra-centrifugal filter tube against PBS for three times. The CpG-ODN modified eVLP was stocked at â80Â°C for further usage.</p>

<title>Adenovirus production</title>
<p>Adenovirus vectors were produced by transfecting HEK293A cells with transgenic transfer plasmid pDC315 and pBHGlox(delta)E1, 3Cre packaging plasmid in a 1:1 molar ratio, normalized to a total mass of 20 Î¼g plasmid/10-cm dish of cells, incubated with 60 Î¼l PEI in 500 Î¼l Opti-MEM medium. After two weeks, the transfected cells were harvested using 1 mL PBS and lysed through three cycles of repeated freeze-thaw (â80Â°C/37Â°C). Then, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 minutes, followed by filtration using a 0.45-Î¼m PVDF filter (EMD Millipore, #SE1M003M00), resulting in the collection of the first generation of adenovirus. To amplify the adenovirus, the first generation was seeded into fresh HEK293A cells for 3 days. Subsequently, the cells were harvested and lysed as described above to collect the second generation of adenovirus, which can be further amplified and used to transfect target cell for gene expression.</p>

<title>In vivo antitumor efficacy evaluation</title>
<p>Female C57BL/6 mice (6â8 weeks old) were purchased from China Wushi (Shanghai, China). HLA-A*0201/K<sup>b</sup> transgenic mice were purchased from National Human Disease Animal Model Resource Center (Beijing, China), which are a well-established model for the study of HLA-A*0201 restricted epitopes and vaccine development (Lorena Passoni 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gritzapis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Mengchao Hepatobiliary Hospital of Fujian Medical University. The subcutaneous HCC model was established by subcutaneous injection of 3Ã10<sup>6</sup> Hepa1-6 cells into the right axilla. The orthotopic HCC mouse model was established as follows: 1) the mice were intraperitoneally anesthetized with 50mg/kg of pentobarbital; 2) the skin was prepared aseptically, and the midline laparotomy was performed after the abdomen shaving; 3) liver subcapsular inoculation with 5Ã10<sup>5</sup> Hepa1-6-luc tumor cells mixed with the matrigel plugs; 4) the abdominal muscle and skin were fully-layer sutured.</p>
<p>Tumor monitoring of subcutaneous HCC cancer model was performed by a single operator every two days in two dimensions using calipers. Tumor volume was calculated from the measured data as follows: V=AB<sup>2</sup>/2 (A is the long diameter and B is the short diameter). When the tumor volume grew to 50-80 mm<sup>3</sup>, it was recorded as day 0, and then the mice were randomly divided into 5 groups (n=6) to start treatment. In the experimental group, CpG-ODN (10 Î¼l/mouse, from 100 Î¼M stock), eVLP (200 Î¼g/mouse), and ePAC were administered subcutaneously to each tumor-bearing mouse on day 0 day 4 and day 8, respectively. The control group was treated for the same duration with PBS injection. For the orthotopic HCC cancer model, the mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=6): PBS, Î±TIM-3 (100 Âµg/mouse, Leinco Technologies, USA), ePAC (200 Î¼g/mouse), ePAC (200 Âµg/mouse) + Î±TIM-3 (100 Âµg/mouse) after 10 days of tumor inoculation (recorded as day 0) and then the treatment was initiated. At the end of treatment, all mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the number of tumor nodules was recorded. For the subcutaneous HCC model constructed by HLA-A*0201/K<sup>b</sup> transgenic mice, the Hepa1-6 cells were infected by adenovirus to express HBc18-27 epitope and HLA-A*0201 before subcutaneous injection. Tumor monitoring was performed every three days and tumor volume was calculated from the measured data as previously outlined. The tumor volume grew to 50-80 mm<sup>3</sup> was recorded as day 0, then the mice were randomly divided into three groups (n=5): PBS, Î±TIM-3 (100 Âµg/mouse) and Î±TIM-3 (100 Âµg/mouse) + ePAC (200 Âµg/mouse) to start treatment.</p>

The mice were sacrificed on day 12 and the splenic T cells were harvested for ex vivo interferon (IFN)-Î³ ELISPOT assay. IFN-Î³ secretion of mouse splenic T cells were detected by ELISPOT kit (Mabtech, 3321-4APT-10). Briefly, bone marrow derived-DCs (BMDCs) were isolated from 6-8 weeks old naive C57BL/6 mouse femurs and tibias. After removal of residual soft tissue and epiphyses, the marrow was collected by flushing the canals with PBS and centrifuged at 800g for 5 min at room temperature. The precipitated cells were lysed with 1mL Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution (Gibco) for 4 minutes, centrifuged at 800g for 5 minutes, and washed twice with PBS. At day 0, 2 million cells/well were added into a 6-well plate and cultured with 2 mL RPMI-1640 medium/well (10 ng/mL mIL-4, and 20 ng/mL mGM-CSF, GenScript, China) to obtain BMDCs at 37Â°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Half volume of medium was changed at day 3. At day 6, the BMDCs were pulsed with CpG-ODN, eVLP or ePAC for 48h.

<p>This study presents a <bold>valuable</bold> strategy to co-deliver peptides and adjuvants to antigen-presenting cells by engineering the Virus-like particle (VLP). The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is <bold>convincing</bold>, but the antitumour efficacy is unimpressive and would benefit from more antitumor experiments. The work will be of broad interest to bioengineers and medical biologists focusing on cancer vaccines.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors fabricated a novel cancer vaccine using endogenous virus-like particles with tumor neoantigen. The vaccine ePAC was proven to elicit strong immune stimulation with an increased killing effect against tumor cells in 2 mouse models.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The author achieved high protein loading and transfection efficiency using PEG10 self-assembly while packaging tumor neoantigens inside for cancer immunotherapy. The author also enhanced the targeting effect towards dendritic cells by surface modification using CpG-ODN.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There were some minor issues but they have been resolved in the revision process. It would be great if the authors could compare this with commercially available treatments and other vaccines.</p>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>Since the ePAC vaccine particle functions as a delivery platform, it can be tailored to different tumors when packed with their specific tumor neoantigens. Thus, the ePAC platform can be potentially employed in a broad range of cancer vaccine therapies. It would be exciting to see this platform being developed for other major cancer types.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors harnessed the potential of mammalian endogenous virus-like protein to encapsulate virus-like particles (VLPs), enabling the precise delivery of tumor neoantigens. Through meticulous optimization of the VLP component ratios, they achieved remarkable stability and efficiency in delivering these crucial payloads. Moreover, the incorporation of CpG-ODN further heightened the targeted delivery efficiency and immunogenicity of the VLPs, solidifying their role as a potent tumor vaccine. In a diverse array of tumor mouse models, this novel tumor vaccine, termed ePAC, exhibited profound efficacy in activating the murine immune system. This activation manifested through the stimulation of dendritic cells in lymph nodes, the generation of effector memory T cells within the spleen, and the infiltration of neoantigen-specific T cells into tumors, resulting in robust anti-tumor responses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study delivered tumor neoantigens using VLPs, pioneering a new method for neoantigen delivery. Additionally, the gag protein of VLP is derived from mammalian endogenous virus-like protein, which offer greater safety compared to virus-derived gag proteins, thereby presenting a strong potential for clinical translation. The study also utilized a humanized mouse model to further validate the vaccine's efficacy and safety. Therefore, the anti-tumor vaccine designed in this study possesses both innovation and practicality.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Tang et al present an important manuscript focused on endogenous virus-like particles (eVLP) for cancer vaccination with solid in vivo studies. The author designed eVLP with high protein loading and transfection efficiency by PEG10 self-assembling while packaging neoantigens inside for cancer immunotherapy. The eVLP was further modified with CpG-ODN for enhanced dendritic cell targeting. The final vaccine ePAC was proven to elicit strong immune stimulation with increased killing effect against tumor cells in 2 mouse models. Below are my specific comments:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much to comment our work as âimportantâ. We sincerely appreciate the extremely helpful comments from the reviewer to significantly improve the quality of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) The figures were well prepared with minor flaws, such as missed scale bars in Figures 4B, 4K, 5B, and 5C. The author should also add labels representing statistical analysis for Figures 3C, 3D, and 3E. In Figure 6G, the authors should label which cell type is the data for.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the very suggestive comments. The scale bars and statistical analysis have been added in Figures 4B, 4K, 5B, 5C, 3C, 3D, and 3E. For Figure 6G, we have added âCD44+ CD62L- in CD8+ T cellsâ to explain the cell type.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 3H, the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) increased significantly, but there was also a non-negligible 10% of APCs found in the control group, indicating some potential unwanted immune response; the authors need to explain this phenomenon or add a cytotoxic test on the normal liver or other cell lines for confirmation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for this extremely helpful suggestion. The antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in Figure 3H were isolated from mouse bone marrow and then cultured in vitro for about 5 days with cytokine stimulation (IL-4 and GM-CSF). Due to the stimulation effects of IL-4 and GM-CSF, a small proportion of the APCs (~10%) was tending to mature (co-expressing CD80 and CD86) in the control group, as pointing out by the reviewer. Similarly, in Figure 3I, these 10% activated APCs can activate T cells in vitro and exhibit certain cytotoxicity. Since APCs must be induced and cultured in vitro before using in this experiment, the background cytotoxicity induced by cytokines is unavoidable, and this has been well documented in literatures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 3I, the ePAC seems to have a very similar effect on cytotoxic T-cell tumor killing compared to the peptides + CpG group. If the concentrations were also the same, based on that, questions will arise as to what is the benefit of using the compact vector other than just free peptide and CpG? Please explain and elaborate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the comment. In vitro experiments indeed demonstrated that peptides + CpG had the same T cell activating ability as ePAC, as pointing out by the reviewer. However, due to the instability of peptides and the lack of targeting, the efficiency of activating the immune system for peptides + CpG after subcutaneous injection is significantly lower than that for ePAC in vivo, as shown in Figure 3D and Figure 2A. Then, as expected, the antitumor efficacy induced by peptides alone + CpG is significantly lower than that induced by ePAC in Figure 5. We have provided a detailed description in âResultsâ section of âAntitumor effect of ePAC in subcutaneous HCC modelâ as follows: Furthermore, ePAC with the ability to target DCs and increased stability by encapsulating peptides, exhibited significantly higher tumor growth inhibition efficiency (p=0.0002) comparing with the eVLP + CpG-ODN treated group similar to the simple mixture of neoantigen peptides and adjuvant (Figures 5B and 5C). Meanwhile, the Kaplan-Meier analysis of tumor progression free survival (PFS) also clearly demonstrated the therapeutic advantages of our ePAC (p=0.0194, Figure 5B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In the animal experiment in Figures 4F to L, the activation effect of APCs was similar between ePAC and CpG-only groups with no significance, but when it comes to the HCC mouse model in Figure 5, the anti-tumor effect was significantly increased between ePAC and CpG-only group. The authors should explain the difference between these two results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the comment. Since PEG10 protein does not have an adjuvant effect, the adjuvant effect of ePAC mainly comes from the modified CpG. Therefore, although ePAC can effectively deliver tumor neoantigens, it does not have a significant advantage over free CpG in activating APCs. However, CpG only possesses the adjuvant effect and does not carry neoantigens. While it can promote the maturation of APCs, it cannot generate neoantigen-specific T cells. Consequently, the antitumor effect of CpG-only is much lower than that of ePAC in Figure 5.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors provided a novel antigen delivery system that showed remarkable efficacy in transporting antigens to develop cancer therapeutic vaccines.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript was innovative, meaningful, and had a rich amount of data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are still some issues that need to be addressed and clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much to comment our work as âinnovativeâ. We sincerely appreciate the extremely helpful comments from the reviewer to significantly improve the quality of our manuscript, and the listed weaknesses have been all carefully addressed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) The format of images and data should be unified. Specifically, as follows: a. The presentation of flow cytometry results; b, The color schemes for different groups of column diagrams.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much. Following the reviewerâs comment, we have unified the format of all images and data as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The P-value should be provided in Figures, including Figure 1F, 1H, 3C, 3D, and 3E.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much. We have provided the corresponding P-values in Figure 1F, 1H, 3C, 3D, and 3E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The quality of Figure 1C was too low to support the conclusion. The author should provide higher-quality images with no obvious background fluorescent signal. Meanwhile, the fluorescent image results of &quot;Egfp+VSVg&quot; group were inconsistent with the flow cytometry data. Additionally, the reviewer recommends that the authors use a confocal microscope to repeat this experiment to obtain a more convincing result.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for this comment. Following the reviewerâs suggestion, we uniformly adjusted the original images in Figure 1C to reduce background interference and increase its quality. After eliminating background interference, the fluorescence image of the &quot;Egfp+VSVg&quot; group was consistent with the flow cytometry result.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The survival situation of the mouse should be provided in Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure 7 to support the superior tumor therapy effect of ePAC.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the extremely helpful comment. Following the reviewerâs suggestion, we have added the progression free survival (PFS) of mice in Figure 5 and described this result in the âResultsâ section of âAntitumor effect of ePAC in subcutaneous HCC modelâ as follows: Meanwhile, the Kaplan-Meier analysis of tumor progression free survival (PFS) also clearly demonstrated the therapeutic advantages of our ePAC (p=0.0194, Figure 5B). For Figure 6 and Figure 7, to promptly detect the immune changes in the tumor microenvironment after vaccination, we were unable to conduct long-term observations on tumor-bearing mice, and therefore, we did not provide the survival curve. However, we monitored the tumor volume changes in real-time, which also can serve as an important measure for evaluating antitumor efficacy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) To demonstrate that ePAC could trigger a strong immune response, the positive control group in Figure 4K should be added.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for this very helpful comment. Following the reviewerâs suggestion, the mouse anti-CD3 antibody was used as the positive control in vitro to activate splenic T cells for ELISPOT assay, and the corresponding results have been added in revised Figure 4K. To address this, we have provided a detailed description in âFigure legendsâ section of âFigure 4. ePAC delivery and immune activation in vivoâ as follows: The mouse anti-CD3 antibody was used to activate splenic T cells in vitro as the positive control for ELISPOT assay.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In Figure 6G-I and other figures, the author should indicate the time point of detection. Meanwhile, there was no explanation for the different numbers of mice in Figure 6G-I. If the mouse was absent due to death, it may be necessary to advance the detection time to obtain a more convincing result.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the comment. The samples for Figure 6 G-I data were collected and analyzed at the day 28 after the start of treatment. Following the reviewerâs suggestion, we have specifically marked the time point of âSacrifice for samplingâ in Figure 6A. And we have provided a detailed description in âFigure legendsâ section of âFigure 6. Evaluation ePAC antitumor efficacy in orthotopic HCC model by Î±TIM-3 combinationâ as follows: The mice were sacrificed and sampled for analysis on the day of 28 after initiating treatment. In addition, in Figure 6G-I we have clearly indicated the sample size for each group. Although three mice in the PBS group died, we still have obtained enough samples for statistical analysis (n&gt;3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In Figure 6B, the rainbow color bar with an accurate number of maximum and minimum fluorescence intensity should be provided. In addition, the corresponding fluorescence intensity in Figure 6B should be noted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for this very helpful comment. Following the reviewerâs suggestion, we have added the rainbow color bar with an accurate number of maximum and minimum fluorescence intensity, and the statistic results in revised Figure 6B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The quality of images in Figure 1D and Figure S1B could not support the author's conclusion; please provide higher-quality images.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much. In Figure 1D and Figure S1B, to ensure the authenticity of the results, we tried our best to improve the quality of the pictures and provided the WB results with the full membrane scan. Although some non-specific bands appeared in the results, the target bands remained prominent. Additionally, we used two tags (HA and eGFP) for verification, which fully guarantees the reliability of our findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) In Figure 2F, the bright field in the overlay photo may disturb the observation. Meanwhile, the scale bar should be provided in enlarged images.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much. Following the reviewerâs suggestion, we have deleted the bright field in revised Figure 2F and added the scale bar in the enlarged images.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors harnessed the potential of mammalian endogenous virus-like proteins to encapsulate virus-like particles (VLPs), enabling the precise delivery of tumor neoantigens. Through meticulous optimization of the VLP component ratios, they achieved remarkable stability and efficiency in delivering these crucial payloads. Moreover, the incorporation of CpG-ODN further heightened the targeted delivery efficiency and immunogenicity of the VLPs, solidifying their role as a potent tumor vaccine. In a diverse array of tumor mouse models, this novel tumor vaccine, termed ePAC, exhibited profound efficacy in activating the murine immune system. This activation manifested through the stimulation of dendritic cells in lymph nodes, the generation of effector memory T cells within the spleen, and the infiltration of neoantigen-specific T cells into tumors, resulting in robust anti-tumor responses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study delivered tumor neoantigens using VLPs, pioneering a new method for neoantigen delivery. Additionally, the gag protein of VLP is derived from mammalian endogenous virus-like protein, which offers greater safety compared to virus-derived gag proteins, thereby presenting a strong potential for clinical translation. The study also utilized a humanized mouse model to further validate the vaccine's efficacy and safety. Therefore, the anti-tumor vaccine designed in this study possesses both innovation and practicality.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much to comment our work as ânovelâ, âinnovationâ and âpracticalityâ. We sincerely appreciate the extremely helpful comments from the reviewer to significantly improve the quality of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) CpG-ODN is an FDA-approved adjuvant with various sequence structures. Why was CpG-ODN 1826 directly chosen in this study instead of other types of CpG-ODN? Additionally, how does DEC-205 recognize CpG-ODN 1826, and can DEC-205 recognize other types of CpG-ODN?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the comment. CpG-ODNs are classified into three main types based on their structural composition: A, B, and C. Among them, only the B-class CpG-ODNs 1668, 1826, and 2006 have been directly proven to effectively bind DEC-205 and activate DC cells [1]. Therefore, in this study, B-class CpG-ODN 1826 was chosen as the ligand targeting DEC-205 on the surface of DC cells. DEC-205 primarily binds sequences containing the CpG motif core in a pH-dependent manner, thus theoretically allowing DEC-205 to bind a wide range of CpG-ODNs.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Why was it necessary to treat DCs with virus-like particles three times during the in vitro activation of T cells? Can this in vitro activation method effectively obtain neoantigen-responsive T cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the comment. DCs need to be pre-stimulated before being used to activate T cells. Although Single DC stimulation can activate T cells, but the activation efficiency is insufficient. Current research suggests that three DC-T interactions can more effectively activate T cells [2]. Therefore, we prepared virus-like particle stimulated DCs for three times to fully activate T cells. Our results in Figures 3I and 7D also demonstrate that three-time stimulations effectively activated antigen-specific T cells, resulting in stronger tumor cell killing effects.</p>

<p>(3) In the humanized mouse model, the authors used Hepa1-6 cells to construct the tumor model. To achieve the vaccine's anti-tumor function, these Hepa1-6 cells were additionally engineered to express HLA-A0201. However, in the in vitro experiments, the authors used the HepG2 cell line, which naturally expresses HLA-A0201. Why did the authors not continue to use HepG2 cells to construct the tumor model, instead of Hepa1-6 cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the comment. HepG2 cells are derived from human liver cancer. When directly implant into immunocompetent mice, they will be cleared by the mouse immune system and will not form tumors. Therefore, we have not continued to use HepG2 cells to construct the tumor model.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The advantages of low immunogenicity viruses as vaccines compared with conventional adenovirus and lentivirus, etc. should be discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the very suggestive comment. In the introduction starting from line 76, we first described the structure and function of lentiviruses and discussed the design and application of virus-like particles (VLPs) based on lentiviruses. To provide a more comprehensive comparison, we included a discussion on VLPs, lentiviruses, and adenoviruses in the discuss section (from line 441 to line 447) as follows: âFurthermore, comparing to the virus-based delivery vectors, the lentiviruses although can stably integrate into the host genome but carry risks of insertional mutagenesis; adenoviruses although have high transduction efficiency but strong immunogenicity, which leads to fast clearance by the immune system of the host and affects the efficiency of the secondary injection. Instead, our VLPs offer low immunogenicity and superior safety, making them more suitable for repeated use and vaccine development.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In Figure 6B, the authors should provide statistical results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much. We have provided the statistical results in revised Figure 6B following the reviewerâs suggestion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The entire article demonstrates a clear logical structure and substantial content in its writing. However, there are still some minor errors, such as the misspelling of &quot;Spleenic&quot; in Figure 3B, and the sentence from line 234 should be revised.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much. We have carefully checked and corrected the typos throughout the whole manuscript as much as possible.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The authors demonstrated the efficiency of CpG-ODN membrane modification by varying the concentration of DBCO, ultimately determining the optimal modification scheme for eVLP as 3.5 nmol of DBCO. However, in Figure 2B, the author did not provide the modification efficiency when the DBCO concentration is lower than 3.5 nmol. These results should be provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for the suggestion. We have repeated the experiment and reduced the concentration of DBCO to 2.1 nmol and 0.7 nmol, respectively. The results showed that in a 200 Âµl eVLP reaction system, 3.5 nmol DBCO achieved the highest modification efficiency. We have provided a detailed description in âResultsâ section of âEnvelope decoration of neoantigen-loaded eVLPâ as follows: Furthermore, by varying the concentration of DBCO-C6-NHS Ester from 0 to 14 nmol, ePAC exhibited different CpG-ODN loading efficiency as evidenced by agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 2B and Figure S3). And the results showed that in a 200 Âµl eVLP reaction system, 3.5 nmol DBCO achieved the highest modification efficiency.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) In Figure 3, the authors presented a series of data demonstrating that ePAC can activate mouse DC2.4 cells and BMDCs in vitro. However, in Figure 7, there is no evidence showing whether human DC cells can be activated by ePAC in vitro. This data should be provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks very much for this very helpful suggestion. We used ePAC to activate human DCs and the results indicate that, compared to the blank control group, both eVLP and ePAC increased the co-expression of CD80 and CD86 in DCs, and ePAC was the most efficient. We have provided a detailed description in the âResultsâ section of âAntitumor effect by HLA-A*0201 restricted vaccineâ as follows: After the stimulation, the DCs in ePAC treated group showed the highest level of maturation comparing to the eVLP treated group and control group (Figure S4), by using flow cytometry analysis.â</p>
