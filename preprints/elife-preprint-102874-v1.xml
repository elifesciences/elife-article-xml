<title>Abstract</title><p>Neuropathic pain, a major health problem affecting 7 - 10% of the global population, lacks effective treatment due to its elusive mechanisms. Cholecystokinin-positive (CCK<sup>+</sup>) neurons in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) are critical for neuropathic pain, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here we showed that the membrane estrogen receptor G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER/GPR30) in spinal was significantly upregulated in chronic constriction injury (CCI) mice and that inhibition of GPR30 in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons reversed CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Besides, GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons was essential for the enhancement of AMPA-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission in CCI mice. Furthermore, GPR30 was expressed in the spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons receiving direct projection from the primary sensory cortex (S1-SDH). Chemogenetic inhibition of S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Conversely, chemogenetic activation of these neurons mimicked neuropathic pain symptoms, which were attenuated by spinal inhibition of GPR30. Finally, we confirmed that GPR30 in S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons is required for CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Taken together, our findings suggest that GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons is pivotal for neuropathic pain and mediates descending facilitation by corticospinal direct projections, thereby representing a promising therapeutic target for neuropathic pain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neuropathic pain is a common chronic pain condition caused by a lesion or dysfunction of the somatosensory nervous system and affects nearly 7-10% of the population worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Neuropathic pain is characterized by mechanical allodynia, under which innocuous stimuli can produce pain, and thermal hyperalgesia where normally painful stimuli produce more intense pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. However, the complicated and elusive mechanisms of neuropathic pain still make it difficult to treat. Thus, it is urgent for us to identify exact mechanisms of neuropathic pain and discover new therapeutic targets.</p>
<p>Since the spinal cord (SC) is a major site for integration of peripheral sensory information and receiving descending modulation from higher center, neuropathic mechanical allodynia occurs via circuit-based transformation in this remarkable region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The superficial laminae of SC are responsible for the noxious perception while the deeper laminae are important for innocuous perception. However, under neuropathic conditions, the low-threshold mechanosensory stimulation would also activate nociceptive neurons localized in the superficial laminae under the mechanism of disinhibition and sensitization, thus resulting in mechanical allodynia. Excitatory interneurons cover a majority proportion of neurons (nearly 75%) in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) and are thought to take a vital role in neuropathic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Cholecystokinin-positive (CCK<sup>+</sup>) neurons are recently reported to be an important subtype of excitatory interneurons widely distributed in the deep laminae of the SDH and to play a crucial role in mediating mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Of great interest is that CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons also receive direct top-down projections from S1 cortex which have been reported to modulate neuropathic pain sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the contribution of CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons to neuropathic pain modulation.</p>
<p>Estrogen has been repeatedly verified to take a vital role in nociceptive modulation at peripheral and central level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Besides of its nuclear receptors-estrogen receptor α (ERα) and estrogen receptor β (ERβ), estrogen can produce various physiological and pathological effects by non-genetic pathways via membrane receptor-G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPR30)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Interestingly, GPR30 has been reported by several studies to be involved in pain modulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. However, it is still unclear whether GPR30 in the SDH plays a critical role in the modulating neuropathic pain.</p>
<p>In this study, we identified that GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons modulates neuropathic pain and mediates the descending facilitation by sensory cortex-spinal cord direct projection. We discovered that GPR30 activation in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons was both required and sufficient for the development of neuropathic pain. Interestingly, we found that GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons was required for the enhancement of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSC) in CCI mice, in an AMPA-dependent manner. Importantly, we further revealed that GPR30 was expressed in the spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons receiving direct projections from S1 sensory cortex and GPR30 in S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons was critical for CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Thus, our results suggest that GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons is a promising therapeutic target for treating neuropathic pain.</p>

<title>Spinal inhibition of GPR30 reverses CCI-induced neuropathic pain and neuronal activation</title>
<p>To assess the potential role of spinal GPR30 in the development of neuropathic pain, we investigated whether spinal inhibition of GPR30 could relieve neuropathic pain induced by CCI (chronic constriction injury) nerve injury model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed that mRNA expression of <italic>Gper1</italic> (GPR30) in lumbar SDH was upregulated in CCI mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). The intrathecal application of G-15, an antagonist of GPR30, significantly reversed the mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia induced by CCI in both genders of mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C-E</xref>). While intrathecal application of G-15 did not change the basal pain threshold in naïve mice (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Of note, the analgesic effects of G-15 lasted for up to 6 hours after intrathecal application in CCI mice (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1C</xref>). Immunochemistry data showed that light touch induced robust increase of c-Fos (a neuronal activation marker) expression, mainly in GPR30<sup>+</sup> cells, in the SDH of male and female CCI mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F-J</xref>). Furthermore, intrathecal injection of G-15 largely reversed c-Fos activation in CCI mice, suggesting that spinal inhibition of GPR30 reversed CCI-induced neuropathic pain and neuronal activation in both genders (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F-J</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we tested whether spinal activation of GPR30 could mimic neuropathic pain symptoms in naïve mice. Indeed, intrathecal application of selective GPR30 agonist G-1 dramatically induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in both genders of mice (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1D</xref>-<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">F</xref>), which could persist for over 48 hours (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1G</xref>). Moreover, immunochemistry results showed that the number of c-Fos<sup>+</sup> neurons (&gt;80% in GPR30<sup>+</sup> cells) in the SDH significantly increased by spinal activation of GPR30 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1H-J</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, these data demonstrate that activation of spinal GPR30 is essential for CCI-induced neuropathic pain in both genders of mice.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons is required for CCI-induced neuropathic pain</title>
<p>Then we tried to find out which groups of spinal cells are targeted by GPR30 in pain modulation. As shown in the results, GPR30 was almost exclusively expressed in the neuronal cells of SDH instead of astrocytes or microglial cells (Fig. S2). It should be noted that, as an estrogen receptor, GPR30 is indiscriminately expressed in both genders of mice (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2A</xref>). In addition, further results revealed that GPR30 was mainly expressed by excitatory interneurons of SDH as labeled by AAV2/9-Camk2-mCherry in WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A and B</xref>).</p>

<p>As mentioned before, it is well-established that spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons are involved in light touch perception and pain modulation during neuropathic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. By the way, CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons cover a large part of excitatory interneurons in the SDH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Thus, we intended to explored whether CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons modulate neuropathic pain via GPR30 and the involved mechanisms. CCK expression was characterized in the spinal cord by crossing of <italic>CCK-Cre</italic> mice with <italic>Ai14</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). ISH and immunochemistry studies confirmed that our transgenic mice recapitulated the majority of <italic>CCK</italic> expression in the deep laminae of the SDH as marked by isolectin B4 (IB4) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D-E</xref>). Immunochemistry results showed that GPR30 was expressed by almost all CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons in the SDH (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>Confirmed the structural connections between GPR30 and CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons, we next explored whether GPR30 in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons had a vital role in neuropathic pain. We injected AAV2/9-DIO-shGper1-EGFP into the lumbar SDH of <italic>CCK-Cre</italic> mice to knock down the expression of <italic>Gper1</italic> in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons, and 3 weeks later mice were subjected to CCI and subsequent behavioral tests (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). The immunochemistry confirmed the location of virus in the deep laminae of SDH which is consistent with the distribution of CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Knock down of <italic>Gper1</italic> in lumbar spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons significantly suppressed the increased expression of <italic>Gper1</italic> mRNA by CCI in mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3A</xref>).</p>

<p>We next tested whether GPR30 expressed on CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons was essential for CCI-induced pain-like behaviors. As expected, the knockdown of <italic>Gper1</italic> in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia induced by CCI in both genders of mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D-F</xref>). But it should be noted that, knockdown of <italic>Gper1</italic> in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons alone did not change the basic mechanical nociceptive threshold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D-F</xref>). To further determined whether GPR30 in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons is involved in the affective components of neuropathic pain, we used real-time PEA test with innocuous mechanical stimulation as shown before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>). As shown in the results, CCI mice treated by scramble spent less time on the stimulated side and exhibited an aversive response even during the post-stimulation period, while <italic>Gper1</italic> knockdown mice with CCI did not show any aversive behaviors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H-L</xref>).</p>

<title>GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons is essential for the enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission in the SDH of CCI mice</title>
<p>To determine how GPR30 expressed on CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons mediated the nociception of neuropathic pain, we recorded from fluorescently labeled cells with whole-cell patch clamp recording in spinal slices from CCI or sham <italic>CCK-Cre</italic> mice treated by shRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A and B</xref>). Since it has been reported that a large part of spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons exhibit excitatory synapses with upstream neurons, we mainly recorded postsynaptic currents from GFP labeled CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons in laminae Ⅲ-Ⅴ two weeks after the CCI surgery. Consistent with our speculation, the amplitude but not frequency of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons were significantly increased by CCI compared to sham (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C-E</xref>). Importantly, this increase of amplitude was absent in <italic>Gper1</italic> knockdown mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C, E</xref>). By the way, it should be noted that the inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) also took an important role in regulation of neuronal excitability.

<p>Known that EPSCs are mediated by glutamatergic receptors like AMPA receptors and several studies have been reported the relationship between GPR30 and AMPA receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, we next explored whether the EPSCs mediated by GPR30 depends on AMPA receptor.

<p>Previous studies suggested a functional connection between S1-SDH projections and spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, here we intend to further verify the structural connections. We injected antegrade trans-monosynaptic AAV2/1-hSyn-Cre into right S1 and then injected AAV2/9-DIO-mCherry into the contralateral lumbar SDH to visualize the mCherry<sup>+</sup> S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons in deep laminae of lumbar SDH (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G and H</xref>).

<p>Given that GPR30 has been verified to be expressed on CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons receiving S1-SDH direct projections (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5M</xref>), we then used chemogenetic and pharmacological methods to determine whether neurons innervated by S1-SDH direct projections mediate nociception via GPR30.

Pharmacological activation of these post-synaptic neurons by CNO application in Gq-treated mice could induce obviously more spontaneous pain-like behaviors including scratching, biting and licking of hind paws and the tail (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>).

<p>To examine whether S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons had a role in neuropathic pain modulation, we also used chemogenetic inhibitory methods to suppress these neurons in CCI mice (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons, located in the deep laminae of SDH, has long been confirmed to take a pivotal role in neuropathic pain and descending facilitation by sensory cortex-spinal cord projections, yet little is known about its molecular mechanisms underlying nociception. GPR30, as a membrane estrogen receptor, could exerts modulatory effects within seconds to minutes on various physiological and pathological conditions including neuropathic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. In this study, we discovered that spinal GPR30 expression was significantly upregulated after CCI and is vital for the development of neuropathic pain. Then we used transgenic mice, behavioral testing, pharmacological methods, chemogenetic methods and electrophysiological methods to further demonstrate that GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons takes an indispensable role in neuropathic pain via regulating AMPA-dependent EPSCs. Furthermore, we also confirmed that GPR30 is vital for the descending facilitation by corticospinal direct projections for the development of neuropathic pain. Thus, our data indicates that GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons might represent a promising therapeutic target for neuropathic pain.</p>
<p>Estrogen has long been found to take a predominant role in nociception, especially its drastic fluctuation could dramatically change the nociceptive thresholds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. However, the regulatory effects of estrogen in nociception were discriminative. Our previous studies found that moderate supplementation of estrogen could alleviate the hyperalgesia in ovariectomized (OVX) mice, while excessive supplementation of estrogen could further aggravate the hyperalgesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The discrepancy might result from that different concentrations of estrogen activate different kinds of estrogen receptors, including nuclear estrogen receptors (ER<italic>α</italic> and ER<italic>β</italic>) and membrane estrogen receptors (GPR30)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. With the consideration of our results that inhibition of spinal GPR30 fail to change the basic nociception of naïve mice, GPR30 might be less activated by estrogen in normal condition. Estrogen also has long been reported to have modulatory effects in neuropathic pain. Intra-dorsal root ganglion (DRG) administration of estrogen could promote mechanical and thermal pain in CCI rats via an ER<italic>α</italic>-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, the supplementation of estrogen in ACC could dramatically alleviate neuropathic hyperalgesia in CCI mice in a GPR30-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. These results further confirm the discriminative roles of different estrogen receptors.</p>
<p>GPR30 is widely expressed in the nervous system and exerts vital effects in nociceptive modulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. For example, the activation of GPR30 in DRG could aggravate the hyperalgesia in OVX mice, while inhibition of GPR30 relieved hyperalgesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Besides, the GPR30 expressed on GABAergic cells in rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) mediates the descending facilitation of nociception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. However, though GPR30 is also widely expressed in SDH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, still little is known about the functions as well as underlying mechanisms of spinal GPR30 in nociceptive modulation. Consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, here we found that intrathecal injection of G-1 could dramatically induce mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in mice. To further explore whether spinal GPR30 is involved in pathological nociception, we subjected mice to CCI surgery to mimic neuropathic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. In accordance with our expectations, the inhibition of spinal GPR30 significantly reversed the mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia induced by CCI. It should be noted that female is more susceptible to pain than man in clinical practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, which could attribute to the mediation of estrogen and its receptors including GPR30. Moreover, GPR30 has been reported to be involved in nociceptive sexual dimorphism. For example, the regulatory role of GPR30 in DRG in maintenance of hyperalgesia induced by repeated exposure of opioid only exists in female rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. However, the function spinal GPR30 in nociceptive modulation showed no sexual difference according to our results. Besides, we also found that nearly all GPR30 is indiscriminately expressed on the neurons of both genders of mice and that the proportion of activated GPR30<sup>+</sup> neurons is similar in CCI mice of both genders, which might account for the sex-independent function of spinal GPR30 in nociceptive modulation. Consistent with our results, several studies also have confirmed that the spinal <italic>Gper1</italic> expression showed no significant difference between male and female mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. What’s more, the fluctuation of estrogen failed to change the basic expression of spinal GPR30<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. These results further indicate the sex-independent function of spinal GPR30 in nociception.</p>
<p>The SDH is a major locus for the integration of peripheral sensory input and supraspinal modulation. Most peripheral nociceptive afferents project to the superficial laminae of the SDH which respond to the noxious stimulations, while low-threshold mechanoreceptors form synaptic contacts in the deep laminae which respond to innocuous stimulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. However, under the condition of mechanical allodynia, innocuous stimulation might also activate more superficial nociceptive circuits and lead to painful perception, which might come from the circuit-based transformation in the SDH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. It should be noted that the spinal dorsal horn is composed of a large number of excitatory (75%) and inhibitory (25%) interneurons, as well as a small part of projection neurons which relay integrated information to various supraspinal regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Excitatory interneurons have been confirmed to take a vital role in conveying mechanical allodynia according to the nature of injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Calretinin neurons convey mechanical allodynia induced by inflammatory injuries, while protein kinase C gamma neurons convey mechanical allodynia induced by neuropathic injuries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. As a distinct type of excitatory interneurons mainly located in the deeper laminae of SDH, CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons are important for neuropathic injuries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The inhibition of spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons could alleviate neuropathic mechanical allodynia to a great extent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. By the way, spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons also account for the thermal hyperalgesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. However, little is known how CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons mediate the nociception. Combined with our results that GPR30 is mainly expressed in spinal excitatory interneurons and involved in neuropathic pain modulation, we speculate that CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons might be convey neuropathic hyperalgesia depending on GPR30. As expected, most CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons express GPR30 and knock-down of the <italic>Gper1</italic> in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons dramatically relieve the pain induced by CCI, thus indicating the vital role of GPR30 in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons mediating neuropathic pain.</p>
<p>Abnormal activation of neurons in SDH is one of the causes of hyperalgesia and the change of post synaptic currents is the vital factor influencing neuronal excitability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Our electrophysiological results showed the elevation of EPSCs amplitudes in spinal CCk<sup>+</sup> neurons after CCI, indicating the increased excitability of CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons in CCI mice. Furthermore, the knock-down of <italic>Gper1</italic> in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons could inhibit the increase of EPSCs amplitude. induced by CCI. Together, these data illustrate that GPR30 take a vital role in activation of CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons after nerve injury via promoting the enhancement of EPSCs. It should be noted that EPSCs are specifically produced by glutamatergic receptors expressed on post-synaptic membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Indeed, it has been reported that the GPR30 exerts its effects by regulating the functions of AMPA or NMDA receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In our study, we confirmed that the selective activation of GPR30 by G-1 remarkedly enhanced the AMPA-current in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons, which might account for the increased excitability of CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons in neuropathic pain. It should be noted that the IPSCs could also influence the excitability of neurons, however, the knockdown of <italic>Gper1</italic> failed to change the IPSCs amplitude in CCI mice, suggesting that GPR30 did not take part in the inhibitory synaptic regulation.</p>
<p>Increasing evidence has mapped neural circuits from peripheral to central nervous system to illustrate the neural mechanisms of nociception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. In brief, pain is derived from the activation of peripheral nociceptors whose cell bodies lie in DRG, and then nociceptive signals are transduced to the SDH for preliminary regulation and finally projected to cerebral cortex via a series of brain region mediating nociception. In addition to the ascending pathways mentioned above, pain is also modulated by the descending modulatory pathways constituted of projections from ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (PAG) to the RVM and then to the spinal cord which takes several steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. However, A recent study has come up with the existence of long direct projections form S1 cortex to deep laminae of SDH and the vital role of S1-SDH projections in neuropathic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Inhibition of S1-SDH projections or transection of corticospinal tract could dramatically attenuate the neuropathic pain induced by spared nerve injury (SNI), while activation of these projections significantly decreases the nociceptive thresholds of naive mice. Consistent with previous studies, we confirmed the existence of S1-SDH direct projections and found that the S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons took an important role in neuropathic pain modulation. Of great interest is that S1-SDH long direct projections terminate in the deep laminae of the SDH and have functional connections with CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Activation of spinal terminals of S1 cortex could increase the activity of CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons. We also structurally verify that CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons receive direct projections from S1 cortex. Furthermore, we also found that the majority of CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons receiving S1-SDH projections express GPR30, thus indicating an important role of GPR30 in descending modulation of S1-SDH. As expected, the knockdown of <italic>Gper1</italic> in S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons dramatically alleviated the hyperalgesia induced by CCI. All these results further confirmed an important role of GPR30 in descending facilitation of neuropathic pain.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>our study demonstrates that GPR30 in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons is essential for the development of neuropathic pain. Furthermore, we revealed that GPR30 is critical for the enhancement of AMPA-dependent EPSCs which promotes the activation of CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons and subsequent abnormal nociception under neuropathic conditions. Additionally, we also discovered that GPR30 is pivotal for the descending facilitation by corticospinal projections in neuropathic pain. Our results suggested that inhibition of GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons could significantly relieve neuropathic pain via blockage the enhancement of AMPA-mediated EPSCs and S1-SDH descending facilitation under neuropathic conditions. GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons might be a promising therapeutic target for neuropathic pain in clinic.</p>

<p>For intracranial injection, mice were anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium solution (70 mg/kg per mice) and then secured in a stereotaxic frame (RWD Life Science, Shenzhen, China). A middle scalp incision exposed the skull, and then a hole was drilled on the skull above the right S1 cortex to allow passage of a glass microelectrode filled with the virus. Viral injections were performed with the following coordinates of S1: 0.95∼1.15 mm from bregma, 1.4∼1.6 mm from midline, and 0.9∼1.1 mm ventral to skull. A volume of 300 nL virus was injected at 50 nL/min with calibrated glass microelectrodes by a microsyringe pump (#78-8710 KD Scientific, USA). After infusion, the micropipette was slowly removed after five minutes. For spinal cord injection, mice were anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium solution. The spinal cord could be visible between T12 and T13 vertebral spines following a middle incision along the lumbar vertebrae. With a stereotaxic frame, a glass microelectrode was inserted between L3-L4 spinal cord to a depth of -400 um below the dura, avoiding the posterior spinal arteries. With a stereotaxic injector, 500 nL of viral solution or CTB-555 (1% in PBS; BrainVTA, Wuhan, China) was slowly infused over a period of 5 minutes.

<title>Chronic constriction injury (CCI)</title>
<p>The CCI-induced neuropathic pain model was employed as previously documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Mice were lightly anesthetized via inhaled 1.5% Isoflurane. An incision was made on the skin of each mouse, exposing the sciatic nerve. Four ligations with 6-0 chromic silk were loosely tied around the sciatic nerve. Nerve constriction should be minimal until a brief twitch can be observed. In sham mice, the sciatic nerve was exposed without ligation.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study investigates the mechanisms that contribute to nerve-injury-induced allodynia by studying the role of the estrogen receptor GPR30 in a population of CCK+ neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord that receive direct inputs from primary somatosensory cortex and modulate nociceptive sensitivity. The authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence, using a variety of complementary approaches, ranging from the cellular to physiology level; however, conclusions that descending corticospinal projections modulate nociceptive behaviors through GPR30 are <bold>incompletely</bold> supported. With some additional analyses, the findings will be better positioned within the context of spinal circuitry literature.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Chen et al. investigate the role of the membrane estrogen receptor GPR30 in spinal mechanisms of neuropathic pain. Using a wide variety of techniques, they first provide convincing evidence that GPR30 expression is restricted to neurons within the spinal cord, and that GPR30 neurons are well-positioned to receive descending input from the primary sensory cortex (S1). In addition, the authors put their findings in the context of the previous knowledge in the field, presenting evidence demonstrating that GRP30 is expressed in the majority of CCK-expressing spinal neurons. Overall, this manuscript furthers our understanding of neural circuity that underlies neuropathic pain and will be of broad interest to neuroscientists, especially those interested in somatosensation. Nevertheless, the manuscript would be strengthened by additional analyses and clarification of data that is currently presented.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors present convincing evidence for the expression of GPR30 in the spinal cord that is specific to spinal neurons. Similarly, complementary approaches including pharmacological inhibition and knockdown of GPR30 are used to demonstrate the role of the receptor in driving nerve injury-induced pain in rodent models.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although steps were taken to put their data into the broader context of what is already known about the spinal circuitry of pain, more considerations and analyses would help the authors better achieve their goal. For instance, to determine whether GPR30 is expressed in excitatory or inhibitory neurons, more selective markers for these subtypes should be used over CamK2. Moreover, quantitative analysis of the extent of overlap between GRP30+ and CCK+ spinal neurons is needed to understand the potential heterogeneity of the GRP30 spinal neuron population, and to interpret experiments characterizing descending SI inputs onto GRP30 and CCK spinal neurons. Filling these gaps in knowledge would make their findings more solid.</p>

<p>Using a variety of experimental manipulations, the authors show that the membrane estrogen receptor G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER/GPR30) expressed in CCK+ excitatory spinal interneurons plays a major role in the pain symptoms observed in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain. Intrathecal application of selective GPR30 agonist G 1induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in male and female mice. Downregulation of GPR30 in CCK+ interneurons prevented the development of mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity during CCI. They also show the up modulation of AMPA receptor expression by GPR30.</p>
<p>Generally, the conclusions are supported by the experimental results. I also would like to see significant improvements in the writing and the description of results.</p>
<p>Methodological details for some of the techniques are rather sparse. For example, when examining the co-localization of various markers, the authors do not indicate the number of animals/sections examined. Similarly, when examining the effect of shGper1, it is unclear how many cells/sections/animals were counted and analyzed.</p>
<p>In other sections, there is no description of the concentration of drugs used (for example, Figure 4H). In Figures 4C-E, there is no indication of the duration of the recordings, the ionic conditions, the effect of glutamate receptor blockers, etc</p>
<p>Some results appear anecdotal in the way they are described. For example, in Figure 5, it is unclear how many times this experiment was repeated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors convincingly demonstrate that a population of CCK+ spinal neurons in the deep dorsal horn express the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPR30 to modulate pain sensitivity in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain in mice. Using complementary pharmacological and genetic knockdown experiments they convincingly show that GPR30 inhibition or knockdown reverses mechanical, tactile, and thermal hypersensitivity, conditioned place aversion, and c-fos staining in the spinal dorsal horn after CCI. They propose that GPR30 mediates an increase in postsynaptic AMPA receptors after CCI using slice electrophysiology which may underlie the increased behavioral sensitivity. They then use anterograde tracing approaches to show that CCK and GPR30 positive neurons in the deep dorsal horn may receive direct connections from the primary somatosensory cortex. Chemogenetic activation of these dorsal horn neurons proposed to be connected to S1 increased nociceptive sensitivity in a GPR30-dependent manner. Overall, the data are very convincing and the experiments are well conducted and adequately controlled. However, the proposed model of descending corticospinal facilitation of nociceptive sensitivity through GPR30 in a population of CCK+ neurons in the dorsal horn is not fully supported.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments are very well executed and adequately controlled throughout the manuscript. The data are nicely presented and supportive of a role for GPR30 signaling in the spinal dorsal horn influencing nociceptive sensitivity following CCI. The authors also did an excellent job of using complementary approaches to rigorously test their hypothesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The primary weakness in this manuscript involves overextending the interpretations of the data to propose a direct link between corticospinal projections signaling through GPR30 on this CCK+ population of spinal dorsal horn neurons. For example, even in the cropped images presented, GPR30 is present in many other CCK-negative neurons. Only about a quarter of the cells labeled by the anterograde viral tracing experiment from S1 are CCK+. Since no direct evidence is provided for S1 signaling through GPR30, this conclusion should be revised.</p>
