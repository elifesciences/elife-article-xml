<title>Abstract</title><p>The members of the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTBC) causing human tuberculosis comprise ten phylogenetic lineages that differ in their geographical distribution. The human consequences of this phylogenetic diversity remain poorly understood. Here, we assessed the phenotypic properties at the host-pathogen interface of 14 clinical strains representing five major MTBC lineages. Using a human <italic>in vitro</italic> granuloma model combined with bacterial load assessment, microscopy, flow cytometry, and multiplexed-bead arrays, we observed considerable intra-lineage diversity. Yet, modern lineages were overall associated with increased growth rate and more pronounced granulomatous responses. MTBC lineages exhibited distinct propensities to accumulate triglyceride lipid droplets —a phenotype associated with dormancy— that was particularly pronounced in lineage 2 and reduced in lineage 3 strains. The most favorable granuloma responses were associated with strong CD4 and CD8 T cell activation as well as inflammatory responses mediated by CXCL9, granzyme B and TNF-α. Both of which showed consistent negative correlation with bacterial proliferation across genetically distant MTBC strains of different lineages. Taken together, our data indicate that different virulence strategies and protective immune traits associate with MTBC genetic diversity at lineage and strain level.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With an estimated 1.3 million deaths in 2022, tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">WHO, 2023</xref>). The main etiological agents of TB are a group of closely related bacteria collectively known as the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTBC). Human-adapted MTBC strains are classified into ten phylogenetic lineages (L1 to L10), which are considered “ancestral” (L1 and L5 to L10) or “modern” (L2 to L4) based on the presence or absence of the TbD1 genomic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brosch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Comas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Coscolla et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Guyeux et al., 2024</xref>). Among these lineages, L1 to L4 are responsible for most of the TB cases worldwide; with less prevalent lineages restricted to specific African regions. Local adaptation to specific human hosts has been proposed to support this uneven phylogeographic distribution and disease burden of different MTBC lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gagneux et al., 2006</xref>). Irrespective of the underlying reason for this phylogeographic population structure, the clinical implications of MTBC genetic diversity, particularly on vaccine efficacy, remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Perez et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Clinical and epidemiological studies have suggested that MTBC strains might contribute differently to disease presentation and transmissibility; with the difference between ancestral and modern lineages being particularly marked. For example, several reports have described an association between ancestral L1 and higher rates of extrapulmonary TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Caws et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Click et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Saelens et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Seraphin et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, strains belonging to ancestral lineages display a lower capacity to transmit compared to strains from the modern lineages L2 and L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Caws et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Guerra-Assuncao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nebenzahl-Guimaraes et al., 2015</xref>). However, these measures of virulence are influenced by non-bacterial factors, such as host genetics and immune competency or delays in health care seeking or access. The first experimental clues regarding the phenotypic consequences of strain genetic variation in the MTBC date from the 1960s with the observation that South Indian isolates were less virulent than strains from British patients in the guinea pig model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mitchison et al., 1960</xref>). Since then, much of our knowledge on the implications of MTBC diversity came from studies characterizing outbreak-causing strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Manca et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Manca et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Newton et al., 2006</xref>), or focusing on only a few representative strains of specific lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hiza et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Romagnoli et al., 2018</xref>). However, extrapolation of strain-specific characteristics to an entire lineage can be misleading due to considerable intra-lineage heterogeneity in experimental outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Portevin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Reiling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, even though awareness of strain variation and its consequences is raising, the majority of immunological studies are based on laboratory-adapted reference strains such as H37Rv or Erdman. In addition, our understanding of immune protective traits in TB remains insufficient and yet dominated by data from mouse and non-human primate studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Esaulova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gideon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Moreira-Teixeira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Plumlee et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>We previously demonstrated the clinical relevance of a three-dimensional (3D) <italic>in vitro</italic> granuloma model —which encompasses, with the exception of neutrophils, all immune cell types involved in TB— by mechanistically dissecting the differential resuscitation of MTB in granulomas exposed to distinct TNF-α antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arbues et al., 2020a</xref>). In this study, we aimed to extend this <italic>in vitro</italic> granuloma model to the study of a large collection of well-characterized and genetically diverse representatives of the MTBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Borrell et al., 2019</xref>). We assessed bacterial virulence in terms of growth rate and characterized the individual immune responses to the various MTBC strains. Our results reveal a broad spectrum of granulomatous responses that correlate with the level of mycobacterial proliferation. Overall, strains of the modern lineages are associated with higher growth rates that correlate with increased macrophage cell death and granuloma scores (based on size and shape); nevertheless, we also report substantial intra-lineage heterogeneity. Furthermore, our results show that granulomatous responses associated with the least replicating strains harbor an increased CD4 and CD8 T cell activation as well as the release of specific soluble factors encompassing CXCL9, granzyme B and TNF-α.</p>

<title>Mycobacterial growth in human <italic>in vitro</italic> granulomas shows marked intra-lineage diversity and is overall increased for MTBC modern lineages</title>
<p>We selected 14 isolates (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) from a reference set of clinical strains covering much of the global diversity of the human-adapted MTBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Borrell et al., 2019</xref>). As a first measure of virulence, we evaluated the capacity of the strains to proliferate within 3D <italic>in vitro</italic> granulomas. Bacterial load based on colony forming units (CFU) was quantified on days one and eight post-infection (p.i.) to determine the growth rate between these time points. The different strains proliferated with rates ranging from 8.1 to 136.0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Modern lineages (L2 to L4) proliferated significantly more than ancestral ones (L1 and L5) did (median rates 52.1 [modern] vs. 27.2 [ancestral], <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 by Mann-Whitney test) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Stratification of the data by lineage revealed that the growth rate of L2 tended to be higher than that of the other modern lineages (median rates 76.0 [L2] vs. 45.1 [L3] and 53.7 [L4]) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Nevertheless, substantial intra-lineage heterogeneity could be observed, particularly within L1 and L2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The lower virulence observed for ancestral lineages in general was contrasted by strain L1B that displayed a high growth rate (median 64.7) comparable to that of most strains belonging to modern lineages. Moreover, while L2 Beijing strains (L2B and L2C) exhibited a characteristic hyper-virulent phenotype (median rates 76.0 and 111.6, respectively), the proto-Beijing L2A was one of the most attenuated strains (median 14.7). In comparison, L3 to L5 representative strains behaved more homogeneously. Noteworthy, the reference strain H37Rv, belonging to L4, displayed a lower growth rate than any of the evaluated L4 clinical isolates. Taken together, our results confirm the higher virulence propensities of strains from modern lineages, and L2 Beijing strains in particular, although they also highlight considerable intra-lineage diversity.</p>

<title>Propensity to enter dormancy is particularly pronounced in lineage 2 and reduced in lineage 3 strains</title>
<p>MTBC pathogenicity relies on its ability to survive the hostile and hypoxic granulomatous environment. The transcription factor DosR orchestrates the adaptation to oxygen limitation by inducing a metabolic switch into a dormant state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Garton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gengenbacher and Kaufmann, 2012</xref>). A constitutive over-expression of <italic>dosR</italic> in L2 Beijing strains has been proposed to contribute to their enhanced virulence and transmissibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Reed et al., 2007</xref>). A genomic duplication including the DosR operon and a synonymous SNP within Rv3134c, which generates an alternative transcriptional start site, have been linked to this increased expression of the DosR regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Domenech et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Domenech et al., 2017</xref>). A hallmark of our <italic>in vitro</italic> granuloma model resides in the generation of a hypoxic environment leading to dormant-like MTBC features such as the loss of acid-fastness and accumulation of triacylglycerides, which can be quantified by differential auramine-O (Au)/Nile red (NR) fluorescent staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arbues et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arbues et al., 2021</xref>). We assessed whether MTBC genetic diversity would result in a differential propensity to enter dormancy when facing a hypoxic environment. Therefore, we quantified the ratio between dormant (Au<sup>−</sup> NR<sup>+</sup>) and metabolically active (Au<sup>+</sup> NR<sup>−</sup>) bacteria (hereafter referred to as ‘dormancy ratio’) for each MTBC strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). While approximately 50% of H37Rv bacilli acquired dormant-like features (median dormancy ratio 0.94), other MTBC clinical strains showed a level of dormancy induction spanning from 0.29 to 1.98. Upon grouping strains by lineage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), no significant difference was found between L1, L4 and L5 (median dormancy ratios 0.85 [L1], 0.86 [L4], and 1.06 [L5]). Nonetheless, L2 strains exhibited an increased propensity to accumulate triacylglycerides (median dormancy ratio 1.30; <italic>p</italic> = 0.072 vs. L1 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 vs. L4 by corrected Dunn’s multiple comparisons test). This result is in line with the fact that they are carriers of the aforementioned genomic events: the duplication in L2A, the Rv3134c SNP in L2B, and both in L2B. By contrast, L3 bacilli seemed more prone to remain in a metabolically active state in comparison to bacteria belonging to the other lineages (median dormancy ratio 0.54; <italic>p</italic> = 0.072 vs. L5 by corrected Dunn’s multiple comparisons test). Interestingly, the ratio between dormant and metabolically active bacilli showed no correlation with the respective growth rate of the individual MTBC strains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This finding suggests that an increased ability to enter dormancy is not necessarily associated with a more pronounced growth phenotype. Further studies are necessary to better understand the dormancy ratio-growth rate relationship, and to assess how this might relate to <italic>in vivo</italic> virulence.</p>

<title>MTBC strain diversity translates into a spectrum of granulomatous responses that correlates with bacterial growth and induction of macrophage apoptosis</title>
<p>We next investigated the impact of MTBC strain diversity on the host immune responses within <italic>in vitro</italic> granulomas. We monitored cellular aggregation by bright field microscopy imaging on day 7 p.i., and quantified the area and aspect ratio of the individual aggregates as well as their total number. While uninfected (UI) PBMCs did not lead to significant aggregation, all MTBC strains induced the formation of <italic>in vitro</italic> granulomas in variable numbers, shapes and sizes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Despite notable donor-to-donor variability, the differential granulomatous responses induced by the individual strains were consistent across all donors (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 1</xref>). Overall, 10 to 58 <italic>in vitro</italic> granulomas were identified per field (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 2A</xref>). Strains L1A, L2A and L5B displayed a tendency to induce more aggregates per field (median 42.5 [L1A], 40 [L2A] and 31.5 [L5B] vs. 22 [across all strains]) that were characterized by a less circular shape (i.e., higher aspect ratio) (median aspect ratios 1.38 [L1A], 1.35 [L2A] and 1.33 [L5B] vs. 1.25 [across all strains]) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 2B</xref>). By contrast, L3 and L4 strains triggered the formation of markedly larger granulomas (median average area per granuloma in μm<sup>2</sup>: 6,586.4 [L3] and 7,800 [L4] vs. 3,377.8 [L1], 5,199.2 [L2] and 4,638.4 [L5]) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 2C</xref>). In order to simplify the ensuing analyses, we integrated these parameters into a granuloma score (see Methods) that reflects the gamut of responses observed so that the bigger and more circular the granulomas, the higher the granuloma score (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Granuloma scores ranged from 42.2 to 1,801.1, with a median of 199.5. Infection with modern lineages, especially L3 and L4, led to granulomatous responses with significantly higher scores (median granuloma scores 205.6 [L2], 374.8 [L3] and 290.2 [L4] vs. 107.2 [L1] and 130.2 [L5]) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, the granuloma score showed a significant positive correlation with the respective strain growth rate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

<p>It has been reported that apoptosis of infected macrophages drives early dissemination and granuloma formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aguilo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Davis and Ramakrishnan, 2009</xref>). Therefore, we sought to evaluate macrophage apoptosis induced by the various strains in the context of granulomatous responses using flow cytometry (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 3</xref>). We did not observe significant differences in the total number of CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages recovered six days after infection with the various MTBC strains. Overall, the percentage of apoptotic macrophages (annexin V<sup>+</sup> 7-AAD<sup>−</sup>) ranged from 24.3% to 65.2%, with a median of 41.2% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Most of the strains shared intermediate levels of macrophage apoptosis, including the reference strain H37Rv (median percentage of apoptotic macrophages 40.2%). By contrast, L1A and L2A strains, which were associated with the lowest growth rates and granulomatous responses, also exhibited a reduced induction of macrophage apoptosis (median percentages 29.6% and 30.2%, respectively); whilst L2C, the most virulent strain, induced the highest apoptosis levels (median percentage of apoptotic macrophages 49.4%). In fact, the percentage of apoptotic macrophages showed a significant positive correlation with the replication rate of the respective infecting MTBC strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) as well as with granuloma scores (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that strains exhibiting greater proliferation are more prone to induce macrophage apoptosis, thereby contributing to the extent of the granulomatous response.</p>

<title>Rapid lymphocyte activation as well as CXCL9, granzyme B and TNF-α secretion are associated with reduced mycobacterial growth across the MTBC</title>
<p>We next sought to profile the immune granulomatous responses induced the MTBC strains and relate them to their respective growth rate. We first monitored by flow cytometry lymphocyte proliferation using carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dilution assay, as well as lymphocyte activation based on the expression of surface markers CD69, CD25, HLA-DR and CD38 on day 6 p.i. by flow cytometry (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 4</xref>). We focused our analysis on CD69-, CD38-, CD25- and HLA-DR-expressing CD4 T cells, along with CD69- and CD38-expressing CD8 T cells, whose frequency increased consistently across all donors upon infection with at least one strain (compared to the uninfected control) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 5</xref>). To account for inter-donor variability, we scaled the responses of every donor dividing the individual response to each strain by the average response across all strains of that same donor (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). As depicted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, granulomatous responses elicited by L1A, L2A and both L5 strains entailed marked CD4 T cell proliferation. Across all MTBC strains, proliferation was consistently associated with an increased expression of the assessed activation markers on both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Nevertheless, most activated CD4 T cells expressed only one of the studied markers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Overall, ancestral lineages were the most potent inducers of all the aforementioned T cell populations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 6A</xref>), with CD38-expressing CD4 T cells constituting the most differentially induced population (median scaled frequencies 1.21 [ancestral] vs. 0.79 [modern]). Among modern lineages, L4 induced the strongest T cell activation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 6B</xref>), which actually was not statistically different from that elicited by ancestral strains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 6A</xref>). Infection with L4 strains resulted in significantly higher percentages of CD38-positive CD4 T cells compared to L2 Beijing strains (median scaled frequencies 0.94 vs. 0.54, respectively), while L3 strains elicited intermediate responses (median scaled frequency 0.73). When considering bacterial growth, strains eliciting an enhanced T cell response appeared among the ones replicating the least. We computed Spearman’s rank correlation tests with Benjamin-Hochberg multiple testing correction between CD4 and CD8 T cell responses and the growth rate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 6C</xref>). CD4 T cell proliferation as well as all expression of all activation markers exhibited significant, moderate to strong, negative correlations with MTBC strain growth rate, with the expression of CD38 resulting in the strongest coefficient. Activation of CD8 T cells, determined by the expression of either CD38 or CD69, was also significantly associated with a hampered mycobacterial proliferation. Taken together, our data indicate that stronger T cell activation is associated with MTBC isolates exhibiting low bacterial replication, irrespective of the lineage they belong to.</p>

<p>Subsequently, we investigated whether a panel of soluble immune factors —linked or not to T cell activation— may also be associated with a reduced bacterial growth. We focused our analysis on molecules present in granuloma supernatants on days 1 or 8 p.i. that were modulated by the infection (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 7</xref>). We again scaled the data to account for inter-donor variability, as described above (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Differentially modulated molecules included the innate cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β at both time points, IL-10 and the chemokine CXCL9 at the earlier time point, and IFN-ψ, IL-17 (A and F), IL-22, IL-13 and granzyme B at the later (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Among these, IL-1β and IL-13 displayed significant lineage-associated trends. L4, and to a lesser extent L3, induced a significantly higher secretion of IL-1β on day 1 p.i. (median scaled responses 1.54 [L4] and 1.31 [L3] vs. 0.55 [L1], 0.94 [L2], and 0.89 [L5]) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). This pattern remained at the later time point for L4 (median scaled responses 1.37 [L4] vs. 0.79 [L1], 0.95 [L2], 1.17 [L3] and 1.03 [L5]) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Interestingly, the IL-1β response on day 1 p.i. showed a moderate positive correlation with granuloma score (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Moreover, we found that the CD4 T helper 2 cytokine IL-13 was preferentially induced in the context of infection with modern lineages compared to ancestral lineages (median scaled responses 1.18 [modern] vs. 0.78 [ancestral]) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Hence, IL-13 secretion exhibited a weak, but significant, positive correlation with the growth rate of the MTBC strains in granulomas (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 8</xref>). While we found no significant correlation for IFN-ψ, induction of CXCL9 secretion on day 1 p.i., and granzyme B as well as TNF-α on day 8 p.i. were associated with a reduced MTBC bacterial proliferation. Altogether, these results convey that a robust T cell activation characterized by an early CXCL9 detection and higher levels of TNF-α and granzyme B may orchestrate the control of mycobacterial growth.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is increasing epidemiological and experimental evidence that MTBC strain diversity may influence pathogenicity. Yet, only a small number of studies based on human specimens have compared a diverse range of strains belonging to more than two lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Portevin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Reiling et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we combine an <italic>in vitro</italic> granuloma model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arbues et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arbues et al., 2021</xref>) with a set of representative L1 to L5 strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Borrell et al., 2019</xref>) to demonstrate that MTBC genetic variation affects the crosstalk with human immune cells. We show that MTBC isolates display a range of growth rates correlating with the induction of macrophage apoptosis and the extent of the resulting granulomatous structures. This result is in agreement with the current view of the tuberculous granuloma as a structure that, beyond functioning as purely host-protective, is exploited by pathogenic mycobacteria as a niche for proliferation and dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pagan and Ramakrishnan, 2014</xref>). Our data reveal various features that associate with certain MTBC lineages and/or strains. Noteworthy, we have identified immune response traits that correlate with hampered mycobacterial proliferation.</p>
<p>“Modern” lineages (L2 to L4) are often associated with globally spread TB epidemics, whereas TbD1-intact “ancestral” lineages (L1 and L5 to L10) rather represent endemic strains restricted to a given geographical area. A general consensus arose that strains belonging to modern lineages would exhibit enhanced capacities to proliferate compared to those from ancestral ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Reiling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Romagnoli et al., 2018</xref>). Actually, in an elegant work using recombinant strains, Bottai and colleagues demonstrated that TbD1 deletion significantly increases MTB virulence in relevant infection models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bottai et al., 2020</xref>). In line with these previous studies, ancestral lineages display reduced virulence in <italic>in vitro</italic> granulomas compared to the modern lineages. L1 is found in countries along the rim of the Indian Ocean. This geographical confinement together with experimental evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bottai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Reiling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Romagnoli et al., 2018</xref>) prompted a general view of L1 as a low virulence lineage. Our data showed that, overall, L1 exhibited lower virulence than modern lineages. Nonetheless, we observed a significant intra-lineage variation, with strain L1C exhibiting a growth rate comparable to those of strains belonging to modern lineages. This phenotypic variability may be a reflection of the highly diverse population structure exhibited by this lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Netikul et al., 2021</xref>). In line with our findings, Mitchison and colleagues also documented a wide range of virulence among South Indian isolates, with one-third of them being as virulent as the British ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mitchison et al., 1960</xref>). Even though it is unclear whether all those strains belonged to L1, we can assume that a majority of them were when considering epidemiological data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Poonawala et al., 2020</xref>). These results exposing virulence variation across L1 isolates challenge the “low virulence” attribute generally given to L1. However, a recent report revealed that the contribution of L1 to the global TB pandemic is generally undervalued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Netikul et al., 2021</xref>). Due to its prevalence in countries with the highest TB incidence, L1 was estimated to account for 28% of the total TB cases. Interestingly, the strains with the higher replication rates, L1B and L1C, were isolated from patients of Indian and Filipino origin and belong to the most common sublineages, L1.1.2 and L1.2.1, respectively. Taken together these data suggest that some L1 sublineages may have evolved mechanisms to compensate for the attenuation associated to the presence of TbD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bottai et al., 2020</xref>). Meanwhile, L5, previously known as <italic>M. africanum</italic> 1, is geographically restricted to West Africa. Experimental data on L5 are scarce and most of our understanding about TB caused by <italic>M. africanum</italic> derives from the study of L6, previously reported as <italic>M. africanum</italic> 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Silva et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast to the down-regulation of the DosR regulon reported in the sputum of L6-infected patients compared to L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ofori-Anyinam et al., 2017</xref>), we observed a similar induction of dormant-like mycobacteria in L4 and L5. In accordance with their ancestral genotype, both L5 strains displayed comparable low replication rates and elicited increased frequencies of activated T cells. Nevertheless, we cannot dismiss a potential contribution of host genetics to the apparent attenuation of L5. In Ghana, infection by L5 has been associated with the Ewe ethnic group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Asante-Poku et al., 2015</xref>). L5 strains displayed lower growth in macrophages from the Akan ethnic group; still, proliferation in Ewe’s macrophages was comparable to that of L4 isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Osei-Wusu et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>The three modern lineages (L2 to L4) displayed comparable growth rates overall. Again, substantial strain-to-strain variability was observed within L2. The L2 Proto-Beijing strain L2A was markedly attenuated to a level comparable to that of the ancestral lineages. At the other end of the virulence spectrum, the representative of the most recently evolved L2 strains, the so-called “modern” L2 Beijing, displayed the highest proliferative capacity across all the MTBC strains studied. For its part, the “ancestral” Beijing isolate exhibited a bacterial burden comparable to those of strains belonging to other modern lineages. This finding suggests that L2 strains have evolved towards increased virulence. This is also consistent with prior studies showing that modern Beijing strains exhibited enhanced virulence in mice compared to those with an ancestral genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>). The L2 Beijing sublineage has received particular attention due to its high transmissibility and virulence in cellular and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Guerra-Assuncao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Manca et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Tram et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tsenova et al., 2005</xref>). One previously identified mechanism contributing to the hyper-virulent phenotype of L2 Beijing strains is the inhibition of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Reed et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, we found that both L2 Beijing strains were poor inducers of T cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines. By contrast, we found the high replication rate of L4 strains to be accompanied by a significant T cell activation and high levels of IFN-ψ. These data are consistent with the fact that MTBC strain CDC1551, responsible for one of the most studied L4 outbreaks, was characterized by very large skin test responses in infected subjects and a robust pro-inflammatory immune response in mice and in human monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Manca et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, we observed that L4, and to a lesser extent L3, promoted an increased secretion of IL-1β. Romagnoli and collaborators showed that higher IL-1β levels trigger autophagy; however, L4 isolates evade subsequent lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Romagnoli et al., 2018</xref>). Despite its protective role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mayer-Barber et al., 2010</xref>), increased IL-1β levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage or serum of TB patients have been associated with presence of cavities and higher bacterial loads in sputum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sigal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tsao et al., 2000</xref>). Consonantly, high transmission strains induced an increased expression of IL-1β in the lungs of infected mice compared to low transmission ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lovey et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, our and others’ findings indicate that L4 constitutes an example of impeded pro-inflammatory responses not to be the only way for the MTBC members to achieve global success. Lastly, L3 was characterized by a tendency to preferentially remain in a metabolically active state, in contrast with the increased propensity of L2 to enter dormancy, which was previously reported under standard culture conditions in broth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Reed et al., 2007</xref>). Whilst it was originally thought that this phenotype could be responsible for the increased virulence displayed by L2 Beijing strain in the mouse model, subsequent studies disproved this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Domenech et al., 2017</xref>). In line with this, our results show that even in the context of hypoxic granulomatous responses –which are lacking in the mouse model– there was no correlation between the propensity to switch into a dormant state and virulence, as reflected in bacterial burden in our model, across MTBC lineages. Last but not least, we have identified immune response traits that correlate with the hampered mycobacterial proliferation exhibited by various MTBC strains of independent lineages. T cells are essential for immunity against the MTBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kaufmann, 2002</xref>); hence, it is unsurprising that the level of CD4 and CD8 T cell activation inversely correlated with mycobacterial growth rate. Increased levels of CXCL9, granzyme B and TNF-α were also found to be associated with a better control of MTBC proliferation. Among the identified soluble factors, the prominent protective role of TNF-α in TB is well-known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Flynn et al., 1995</xref>). CXCL9’s paradigmatic function is directing the migration of CXCR3-expressing cells (i.e., T helper 1 CD4 T cells, effector CD8 T cells and natural killer cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Groom and Luster, 2011</xref>). CXCL9 has attracted attention as potential biomarker for TB diagnosis and treatment monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ambreen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Uzorka et al., 2022</xref>). However, some evidence suggests that CXCR3 ligands play a role in the positioning of effector cells within the lung for control of MTB proliferation. Protective vaccination in mice triggered the production of chemokines, including CXCL9, in the lung and associated recruitment of CXCR3<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Khader et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, increased densities of CXCR3<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells were found in the lungs of latently infected non-human primates (NHPs) relative to those with active TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Shanmugasundaram et al., 2020</xref>). CXCL9 has also been reported as a new marker of trained immunity in mycobacterial growth inhibition assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Joosten et al., 2018</xref>). Recently MTBC-exposed individuals, which exhibited the strongest control of mycobacterial proliferation, produced increased levels of CXCL9. Notably, our findings are in line with recent reports highlighting an important role of granzyme B in the control of MTBC infection in the early stages of TB. In NHPs, low burden granulomas were associated with a higher proportion of a T/NK cell cluster expressing granzyme B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gideon et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, individuals with latent TB infection exhibited increased expression of granzyme B in activated NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Esaulova et al., 2021</xref>). We did not find any correlation between IFN-ψ levels and mycobacterial replication rate. Our finding is supported by TB vaccine trials demonstrating that induction of strong IFN-ψ responses does not translate into enhanced protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tameris et al., 2013</xref>). However, strains with low replication rates were among those inducing high IFN-ψ levels. These results therefore suggest that IFN-ψ is required, yet not sufficient to mediate protection.</p>
<p>In summary, our investigation exposed various features that associate with certain MTBC lineages and/or strains, thereby reinforcing the concept that effective treatments and vaccines need to be tailored. We advocate <italic>in vitro</italic> granuloma models as relevant tools to understand the implications of MTBC strain diversity on the interaction with humans of diverse genetic backgrounds and to assess protective traits elicited by vaccines.</p>

<p>Granuloma formation was monitored on day 7 post-infection using a Leica THUNDER Imager Live Cell (Leica). Cellular aggregates present in a representative bright field per donor and condition were enumerated and measured using ImageJ 1.52n (National Institutes of Health, US). The total number of granulomas, their size and aspect ratio (i.e., the ratio of the major axis to the minor axis; and so, and aspect ratio of 1 corresponds to a circle, and &gt;1 to an ellipse) were integrated into a granuloma score as follows: the area of each individual granuloma was divided by its corresponding aspect ratio, then the average was calculated and divided by the total number of aggregates.

</disp-formula>
Thus, the induction of numerous but small aggregates with an elongated shape translates into the lowest granuloma scores; whilst generation of bigger, even if fewer, circular aggregates results in higher values.</p>

<p>At the relevant time points, supernatant was removed and the ECM was digested with 125 μl of collagenase (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 40 min at 37°C-5% CO2. Subsequently, host cells were lysed by adding 125 μl of 0.4% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubating for 20 min at room temperature. Released bacilli were subsequently used for bacterial load quantification by CFU assessment and dual auramine-O/Nile red staining.</p>

Subsequently they were spotted on glass slides, air dried and heat fixed at 70°C. Fluorescent acid-fast staining using TB Fluorescent Stain Kit M (BD) was performed in combination with neutral-lipid staining dye Nile red (Sigma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arbues et al., 2020a</xref>). Briefly, each sample was stained with auramine-O for 20 min, decolorized for 30 s, covered with Nile red (10 μg/ml) for 15 min and counterstained with potassium permanganate for 2 min, including gentle washes with distilled water between each step. Air-dried, stained slides were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vectorlabs) and examined using a Leica DM5000 B fluorescence microscope (Leica). For quantification purposes, at least 200 bacteria per sample were counted manually.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study further develops the potential of in vitro granulomas to study host-pathogen interactions in tuberculosis. It uses a human-based cellular model and a collection of M. tuberculosis isolates representative of the pathogen's diversity. It provides important methodologic information and some findings that help in defining protective responses in TB.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A strength of the study is the multitude of parameters addressed across different M. tuberculosis strains and donors. The inclusion of several strains of the same lineage shows that intra-lineage diversity is also relevant, illustrating how complex it is to model the immune response to M. tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A weakness of the study is that although several interesting findings are reported and a hypothesis proposed, the work is mainly descriptive and correlative. Some functional data based on the current observations would strengthen the findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript reports a comparison of microbial traits and host response traits in a laboratory model of infected granuloma using Mtb strains from different lineages. The authors report increased bacillary growth and granuloma formation, inversely associated with T cell activation that is characterized by CXCL9, granzyme B, and TNF expression. They therefore infer that these T cell responses are likely to be host-protective and that the greater virulence of modern Mtb lineages may be driven by their ability to avoid triggering these responses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The comparison of multiple Mtb lineages in a granuloma model that enables evaluation of the potential role of multiple host cells in Mtb control offers a valuable experimental approach to studying the biological mechanisms that underpin differential virulence of Mtb lineages that have been previously reported in clinical and epidemiological studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study is rather limited to descriptive observations and lacks experiments to test causal relationships between host and pathogen traits. Some of the presentation of the data is difficult to interpret, and some conclusions are not adequately supported by the data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In &quot;CXCL9, granzyme B, and TNF-α orchestrate protective in vitro granulomatous responses across Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex lineages&quot;, Arbués and colleagues describe the impact of mycobacterial genetic diversity on host-infection phenotypes. The authors evaluate Mtb infection and contextualize host responses, bacterial growth, and metabolic transitioning in vitro using their previously established model of blood-derived, primary human cells cultured on a collogen/fibronectin matrix. They seek to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in determining mycobacterial strain-specific granuloma-dependent host-pathogen interactions.</p>
<p>Strengths and weaknesses:</p>
<p>Understanding the way mycobacterial genetic diversity impacts granuloma biology in tuberculosis is an important goal. One of this work's strengths is the use of primary human cells and two constituents of the pulmonary extracellular matrix to model Mtb infection. The authors and others have previously shown that Mtb-infected PBMC aggregates share important characteristics with early pulmonary TB granulomas (Arbues et al., Bio Protoc, 2020, PMID: 3659472; Guirado et al., mBio, 2015, PMID: 25691598; Kapoor et al., PloS One, 2013, PMID: 23308269). The use of multiple genetically distinct strains of Mtb defines this work and further bolsters its potential impact. However, the study is not comprehensive as lineages 6 and 7 are not tested. Experiments are primarily descriptive, and the methodologies are conventional. Correlative relationships are the manuscript's focus and functional validation is not conducted. Convoluted data presentation hampers the readers' ability to effectively evaluate many of the findings for significance. The effect sizes are generally small and most quantitative data are unitless. A further weakness of the study is a lack of any in vivo modeling.</p>
<p>Achievement of aims, and support for conclusions:</p>
<p>The main aim of this work is to extend an in vitro granuloma model to the study of a large collection of well-characterized, genetically diverse representatives of the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). I believe that they accomplish that aim. The work does investigate MTBC infection of aggregated PBMCs using three strains each of Mtb lineages 1-5 and H37Rv, which is not a trivial undertaking. The experimental aims are to show that MTBC genetic diversity impacts the growth and dormancy of granuloma-bound bacteria and, the host responses of granulomatous aggregation as well as macrophage apoptosis, lymphocyte activation, and soluble mediator release within granulomas. A lack of basic descriptive statistics for raw data makes it difficult to determine if benchmarks for most of the experimental aims have been reached. Although the methodologies employed should have been able to test most of these aims. The title's conclusion that CXCL9, granzyme B, and TNF orchestrate a protective granulomatous response is not tested and is not supported by the findings. Those molecules are not a focus of the work, their effects are not investigated effectively and their relationship to the granulomatous response is not determined. The authors' conclusions regarding their results are a mixed bag. Their conclusion that lineage impacts growth within granulomas is likely true and the data as presented reflect such a relationship. However, even without the basic descriptive statistics needed to evaluate the data supporting that claim, the methods employed for bacterial collection call into question whether all Mtb plated for CFU assay resided within granulomatous aggregates. Their conclusions regarding lineage's impact on dormancy are not supported, as their findings demonstrate that assays for dormancy identify replicating bacteria as being dormant. Their conclusion that strain diversity results in a spectrum of granulomatous responses in their model system is strongly supported by the results. Their conclusion that strain diversity impacts macrophage apoptosis is supported by the data but a relationship of apoptosis to the granulomatous response is not effectively evaluated. Their conclusion that lymphocyte activation is associated with reduced mycobacterial growth as an aspect of granulomas is well supported in the literature and a negative correlation between T cell activation and growth is supported by their results.</p>
<p>Impact on the field:</p>
<p>The authors contribute some valuable insights, particularly in Figure 3 and supplementary Figures 1 and 2, where data is more accessible to critique. Their identification of donor-dependent aggregation phenotypes by mycobacterial strain has the potential to enable future reverse-genetic screens for human and Mtb loci that contribute to granulomatous inflammation. Their model is a higher echelon relative to others in the field, but I don't believe that it possesses all of the necessary tissue and cellular components to effectively replicate the formation of granulomas in nature. The bulk of the data in its current form is not of high value to the community, but I think it has the potential to contribute additional novel insights if panels that display descriptive statistics are added to the figures.</p>
