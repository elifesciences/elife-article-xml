<title>Abstract</title><p>Acute retinal ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury are primary causes of retinal neural cell death and vision loss in retinal artery occlusion (RAO). The absence of an accurate mouse model simulating the retinal ischemic process has hampered progress in developing neuroprotective agents for RAO. A unilateral pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery occlusion (UPOAO) mouse model was developed by employing silicone wire embolization combined with carotid artery ligation. The survival of retinal ganglion cells and visual function were evaluated to determine ischemia duration. Immunofluorescence staining, optical coherence tomography, and hematoxylin and eosin staining were utilized to assess changes in major classes of neural cells and retinal structure degeneration at two reperfusion durations. Transcriptomics was employed to investigate alterations in the pathological process of UPOAO following ischemia and reperfusion, highlighting transcriptomic differences between UPOAO and other retinal ischemia-reperfusion models. The UPOAO model successfully replicated the acute interruption of retinal blood supply seen in RAO. 60-minute ischemia was confirmed to lead the major retinal neural cells loss and visual function impairment. Notable thinning of the inner layer of the retina, especially the ganglion cell layer, was evident post-UPOAO. Temporal transcriptome analysis revealed various pathophysiological processes related to immune cell migration, oxidative stress, and immune inflammation during non-reperfusion and reperfusion periods. The resident microglia within the retina and peripheral leukocytes which access to the retina were pronounced increased on reperfusion periods. Comparison of differentially expressed genes between the UPOAO and high intraocular pressure models identified specific enrichments in lipid and steroid metabolism-related genes in the UPOAO model. The UPOAO model emerges as a novel tool for the screening of pathogenic genes, promoting further therapeutic research in RAO.</p>

<label>1</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Retinal artery occlusion (RAO) is a severe ophthalmic disease characterized by a sudden interruption of blood flow in the retinal artery, leading to retinal ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. More than 60% of RAO patients experience impaired vision, ranging from finger counting to complete vision loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. RAO patients face an elevated risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Retinal ischemia and hypoxia can cause irreversible damage to retinal cells in 90 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. This damage is possibly attributed to the continued apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), triggered by inflammation and oxidative stress. Unfortunately, conservative treatments for RAO, such as eye massage and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, offer limited therapeutic benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Thrombolysis, though effective, is also restricted by the narrow treatment time window (often within 4.5 hours) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. However, when blood flow is restored to the ischemic area after thrombolysis, it can cause a sudden elevation of tissue oxidative levels, resulting in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. IRI is a common pathological condition that can trigger inflammation, retinal tissue injury and visual impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Therefore, to comprehensively investigate the pathophysiological changes and explore potential neuroprotective therapeutics after retinal ischemia and reperfusion, it is of paramount importance to develop an animal model that can accurately simulate the pathological processes of RAO.</p>
<p>Various animal models have been employed to investigate the effects of retinal injury resulting from ischemia and subsequent reperfusion in RAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Based on the methods used for modeling, retinal ischemia-reperfusion models can be categorized into two groups: 1) Intravascular occlusion models, including photochemical-induced thrombosis model and vascular intervention model; 2) Extravascular occlusion models, including central retinal artery ligation (CRAL) model, unilateral common carotid artery occlusion (UCCAO) model, and high intraocular pressure (HIOP) model. The photochemical-induced thrombosis model and vascular intervention model have been reported as useful tools to assess retinal injury after ischemia and reperfusion. However, both models are limited by the need for trained interventional radiologists and high technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. CRAL, which directly clips or ligates the central retinal artery, also presents its drawbacks. This model may cause optic nerve damage, and it is difficult to apply in small animals like mice, which limits its use in experiments with larger sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. UCCAO, a retinal hypoperfusion model induced by occlusion of the unilateral common carotid artery (CCA), is better at simulating chronic ischemic retinal disease rather than acute retinal ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. The HIOP model is a widely utilized mouse model for studying ischemia-reperfusion in acute primary angle-closure glaucoma (APACG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. However, it is worth noting that the mechanical compression of the retina caused by saline injection may also lead to retinal damage, potentially influencing IRI research. Therefore, it is critically important to develop a simple and low-skill-required mouse model that can simulate the acute retinal ischemia and reperfusion injury in RAO patients.</p>
<p>To better simulate the retinal ischemic process and possible IRI following RAO, we developed a novel vascular-associated mouse model called unilateral pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery occlusion (UPOAO) model. In this model, we employed silicone wire embolization and carotid artery ligation to completely block the blood supply to the retina. We characterized the major classes of retinal neural cells and evaluated visual function following different durations of ischemia (30 minutes and 60 minutes) and reperfusion (3 days and 7 days) after UPOAO. Additionally, we utilized transcriptomics to investigate the transcriptional changes and elucidate changes in the pathophysiological process of the UPOAO model after ischemia and reperfusion. Lastly, we underscored the transcriptomic differences between the model and other retinal ischemic-reperfusion models, including HIOP and UCCAO, and revealed its unique pathological processes similar to that of retinal IRI in RAO. The UPOAO model offers new insights into the mechanisms and pathways involved in ischemia and reperfusion studies of RAO, providing a foundation for studying the protective strategy for ocular ischemic diseases.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>Animals</title>
<p>Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were used in the experiments. Only male mice were used to exclude the potential influence of estrogenic hormones. The mice were provided with sufficient food and water and were maintained on a 12-hour dark-light cycle in a room with regulated temperature conditions. All experimental procedures were designed and conducted according to the ethical guidelines outlined in the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. The study protocol and methods received approval from the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (approval number: WDRM-20220305A).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<label>2.2</label><title>Preparation work and surgical procedure of UPOAO model</title>
<p>Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice weighing 20-25 grams were used in this study. An isoflurane-based anesthesia system was prepared to induce and maintain general anesthesia in mice during surgical procedures. The mice were anesthetized with a 1.5-2% concentration of isoflurane delivered in a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen via rubber tubing. Body temperature was maintained at 37Â±0.5Â°C throughout the surgery. Surgical instruments were sterilized with 75% ethanol before use to ensure sterility.</p>
<p>The mouse was gently positioned in a supine posture on a heating blanket and its neck was exposed. The preparation involved depilation of the neck area, followed by skin disinfection, and finally, a midline incision along the neck was made. Following the neck gland separation with two tweezers, a careful blunt dissection was employed to separate the left CCA, internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA), avoiding compression of nearby nerves and veins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) (<bold>Video 1</bold>). Then, the CCA and ICA were ligated with a 6-0 suture. Secure a knot using a 6-0 suture at the distal end of ECA and create a slipknot at the proximal end (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Utilize an ophthalmic scissor to create a small inverted âVâ-shaped incision between the two suture knots on the ECA. Insert a specialized silicone wire embolus of which length is 7Â±0.1 mm and diameter is 0.19Â±0.1 mm through the incision, directing it into the ECA and further into the CCA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Next, the ligation on the ICA was removed, and the ECA was cut at the point where the artery had been previously incised with scissors. Subsequently, the silicone wire embolus was retracted to the bifurcation of the CCA, rotated counterclockwise and inserted into the ICA and further into the pterygopalatine artery (PPA) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D1</xref>). The silicone tail of the silicone wire embolus was near the bifurcation of CCA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D2</xref>), effectively obstructing the ophthalmic artery (OA) (<bold>Video 2</bold>). Then fasten the slipknot and suture the skin. The mouse was free to move around during arterial embolization.</p>

<p>Following a predetermined ischemia embolization time, the silicone wire embolus was carefully removed from the PPA without massive hemorrhage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). The CCA suture was removed and the arterial reperfusion was restored (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>) (<bold>Video 3</bold>).

<label>2.3</label><title>Staining of retinal vessels</title>
<p>To clearly visualize the retinal vessels, rhodamine-labeled canavalin A was used for mouse heart perfusion. The mouse was anesthetized by 1% sodium pentobarbital and placed in a supine position on a foam board resting on a tray. The mouseâs sternum was opened, exposing the heart. A needle attached to the perfusion tube was inserted into the left ventricle via the apex of the mouse heart and fixed. The right atrial appendage of the mouse was dissected with scissors to allow blood outflow. Saline solution was perfused through the left ventricle using a pump system to drain the blood from arteries. Subsequently, prepared solution of rhodamine labeled canavalin A was injected into the mice and circulated throughout the mouse vessels for 30 minutes. The mice were sacrificed and their eyes were extracted and immersed in PFA for one hour in the dark. Obtain a flat-mounted retina and capture retinal images using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with a 10Ã objective.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<label>2.4</label><title>Quantification of RGCs and microglia</title>
<p>The mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and their eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 60 minutes at room temperature (RT). Subsequently, the cornea and lense were excised, and the retina was isolated intact to perform retinal flat-mounting. The retina was immersed in PBS with 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and 0.5% Triton X-100 for overnight blocking and then incubated with Brn3a antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas, USA) or Iba1 antibody (Wako, Japan). Following a two-day incubation with the primary antibody, the retina was gently washed three times with PBS. Subsequently, the retina was incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 (AntGene, Wuhan, China) in a light-protected cassette for two days. After three rinses, the retina was uniformly sectioned into a four-leaf clover morphology and flattened using a coverslip. Finally, retinal flat-mounts labeled with Brn3a were imaged using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8, Germany) equipped with 20Ã objective, while those labeled with Iba1 were imaged utilizing a fluorescence microscope (BX63; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Each quadrant was consistently subdivided into central, middle and peripheral fields at regular intervals. The surviving RGCs and activated microglia were quantified and averaged using Image-J software (National Institutes of Health, USA).</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<label>2.5</label><title>Electroretinogram (ERG)</title>
<p>Mice were dark-adapted overnight before ERG and all subsequent procedures were carried out in the dark environment. Before ERG, mice were anesthetized by 1% sodium pentobarbital through intraperitoneal injection and their pupils were dilated. A subcutaneous electrode was inserted into the posterior cervical skin, a tail electrode was affixed to the posterior end of the mouse tail, and the corneal electrode was gently placed on the central corneal surface. The RetiMINER-C visual electrophysiological system (3VMED Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) was employed for recording electrical responses. The a-waves, b-waves, and Oscillatory Potentials (OPs)-waves after flash stimuli of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 cd.s/m<sup>2</sup> in scotopic adaptation were recorded. The amplitudes and implicit times of a-waves, b-waves and OPs-waves in response to various flash stimuli were analyzed.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<label>2.6</label><title>Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging (OCT) and Fluorescein Fundus Angiography (FFA)</title>
<p>The mice were placed on the platform of a Spectralis HRA+OCT device (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) for OCT imaging following anesthesia. Pupil dilation was performed, and normal saline was applied regularly to maintain corneal moisture in the mice. The focal length of the device was adjusted so that the mouse retina was clearly visible. Mouseâs head was gently repositioned to take pictures of the peripheral fundus. Multi-line mode was used to scan each layer of the retina and four-quadrant fields of view centered on the nipple on the upper left, lower left, upper right, and lower right were recorded. In this study, IMRL (inner middle retina layer) was defined as the combined thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), and the inner plexiform layer (IPL). MRL (middle retina layer) was defined as the combined thickness of the inner nuclear layer (INL) and the outer plexiform layer (OPL). ORL (outer retina layer) was defined as the combined thickness of the rest to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Total retinal thickness (TRT) of the sensory retina was manually segmented and encompassed the entire thickness from the nerve fiber layer to the photoreceptor layer. The thickness of retina at 1.5 papillary diameters (PD), 3.0 PD, and 4.5 PD from the center of the optic disc were measured using the Heidelberg measuring tool.</p>
<p>For FFA, mice were anesthetized and their pupils were also dilated. Subsequently, fundus angiography was recorded immediately following intraperitoneal injection of sodium fluorescein (for no longer than 5 seconds), with photos taken alternately for both eyes.</p>

<label>2.7</label><title>Hematoxylin and eosin (HE)</title>
<p>Mouse eyes were fixed in FAS eyeball fixation solution (Service-bio, Wuhan, China) for 48 hours, followed by dehydration and subsequent embedding in paraffin. Paraffin was trimmed parallel to the optic nerve to obtain 3-4 Î¼m thick sections where the optic nerve was located. Six paraffin sections from each eyeball were stained with HE. The Olympus fluorescence microscope was employed for taking pictures. Retinal thickness within 500 Î¼m of the optic disc was measured using the Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<label>2.8</label><title>Staining of Retinal Sections</title>
<p>For immunofluorescence, mouse eyes were fixed in 4% PFA solution and subjected to gradient dehydration using 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose solutions. The following day, the eyes were embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT.) compound (SAKURA, American) and frozen at -80Â°C. Several 14-Î¼m-thick frozen sections were obtained from each eyeball through the frozen microtome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). The section surface was parallel to the optic nerve, and 3-6 frozen sections were mounted on a single slide. The slides were stored at -20Â°C until use.</p>
<p>All sections were blocked with 5% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 hours. Primary antibodies, as listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, were diluted in PBS containing 5% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated at 4Â°C overnight. The following day, after three rinses, the sections were incubated with the second antibodies at RT for 2 hours in a cassette, followed by three washes. And then sections were stained with DAPI (Service-bio, Wuhan, China) for 15 minutes. After the final three rinses, the frozen sections were sealed.

<label>2.9</label><title>Surgical procedure of UCCAO model and HIOP model</title>
<p>Animals for UCCAO were prepared and managed as described in the UPOAO model procedure. After blunt dissection, the left CCA was ligated by a 6-0 suture. After 60 minutesligation, the suture was removed and the skin wound was subsequently closed with sutures. Mice were routinely fed during reperfusion and mouse retinas of UCCAO were harvested 7 days post-surgery.</p>
<p>HIOP model was performed based on previous methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 1% sodium pentobarbital. Mice pupils were dilated using Tropicamide Phenylephrine Eye Drops (0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% deoxyadrenaline hydrochloride, Santen Pharmaceutical) 5 minutes in advance. An insulin hypodermic needle, attached to a silicone elastomer tube, was inserted into the anterior chamber of the unilateral experimental eye. Elevate intraocular pressure (IOP) for 60 minutes by raising the height of the saline solution storage bag to 162 cm and remove the needle to immediately restore IOP to baseline levels. Iris whitening and loss of retinal red-light reflexes demonstrated retinal ischemia. After surgery, levofloxacin hydrochloride ophthalmic gel was applied to the eyes of mice. Mouse retinas of HIOP were collected 7 days post-surgery.</p>

<p>Retinal samples from UPOAO, HIOP, and UCCAO mice were extracted and promptly frozen in liquid nitrogen within 10 minutes of cervical dislocation. Total RNA extraction followed the protocol outlined in the TRIzol Reagent manual (Life Technologies, CA, USA). RNA integrity and concentration were assessed using an Agilent 2,100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The resulting RNA samples were then pooled and subjected to sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq3000 platform in a 150-bp paired-end read format. Raw RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) reads underwent preprocessing and quantification using the featureCounts function in the SubReads package version 1.5.3, with default parameters.</p>
<p>RNA-seq analysis was repeated across 5 mice in the no-perfusion group, 4 mice in the 3-day perfusion group, and 5 mice in the 7-day perfusion group of the UPOAO model. Additionally, retinas from both the 7-day HIOP experimental eyes and UCCAO bilateral eyes were collected (n=5) for analysis.</p>
<p>Data normalization and subsequent processing utilized the âlimmaâ package in R software (version 4.2.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. For visualization purposes, volcano plots and Venn diagrams were generated to identify significant differential expression genes (DEGs) and perform Gene Ontology (GO) annotation analysis. DEGs with |log2 fold change (FC)| &gt;1 and adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 were deemed statistically significant. Enrichment analysis focused on DEGs with an adjusted p &lt; 0.05 and an enriched gene count &gt;5. To visualize the expression patterns of significant DEGs, a heatmap was generated using the âpheatmapâ package. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was conducted using the GSEA program (version 4.3.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], employing the default gene set m-subset (mh.all.v2023.1.mm.symbols.gmt) to explore significant functional and pathway differences. Enriched pathways were classified based on criteria such as adjusted p-value (&lt;0.05), False Discovery Rate (FDR) q-value (&lt;0.25), and normalized enrichment score (|NES| &gt; 1). Furthermore, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was performed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://string-db.org/">https://string-db.org/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].

<p>To reproduce the retinal ischemic process and potential IRI in RAO, we established a mouse model of UPOAO by combining silicone wire embolization and ligation of the carotid artery. Model validation was conducted through a series of experiments, with detailed descriptions provided in the Materials and Methods (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-G</xref>). To confirm blood flow disruption, fluorescently labeled lectin cardiac perfusion and FFA were performed. Rhodamine-labeled canavalin A was perfused with the silicone wire embolus in vivo, and bilateral eyes were evaluated. The sham eye exhibited normal blood perfusion in the retina, while the experimental eye showed no perfusion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H, I</xref>). FFA revealed delayed and limited perfusion in the experimental lateral retina, primarily near the optic disc (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J, K</xref>).

<p>To investigate the optimal ischemic duration, mice underwent two ischemic periods: 30 and 60 minutes, followed by reperfusion periods of 3 and 7 days. Retinal structure and visual function were assessed through flat-mounted retina analysis and flash electroretinography (ERG).</p>
<p>In the 30-minute ischemia group, no significant RGCs death was observed after 3 days (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>) or 7 days of reperfusion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>). However, with 60 minutes of ischemia and 3 or 7 days of reperfusion, reductions in RGC density were evident (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-H</xref>). ERG results showed no statistical difference in amplitudes between bilateral eyes after 3 and 7 days of 30-minute reperfusion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref>). However, the b-wave amplitude notably declined after 60 minutes of ischemia and 3 days of reperfusion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). By 7 days of reperfusion, the b-wave amplitude had halved compared to sham eyes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). The appearance time of the a-wave and b-wave in the experimental and control eyes was consistent within each of the four groups (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). Additionally, the amplitudes of OPs in the experimental eyes, particularly in the 60-minute ischemia and 7-day reperfusion group, significantly decreased to less than 50% of those in the sham eyes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F, G</xref>).

<label>3.3</label><title>Evaluation of retinal thickness in UPOAO through OCT and HE</title>
<p>To assess retinal thickness non-invasively in the UPOAO model, we conducted OCT imaging during 3-day and 7-day reperfusion periods. Due to the challenge of distinguishing the RNFL, GCL, and IPL in OCT images, we utilized the IMRL to represent the cumulative thickness of these layers. Similarly, the MRL represented the INL and OPL, while the ORL encompassed the region from the inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) to the RPE. Following a 3-day reperfusion period, no significant changes were observed in IMRL, MRL, and ORL at distances of 1.5, 3, and 4.5 PD from the optic disc (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A, B</xref>). However, total retinal thickness decreased at a distance of 4.5 PD (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). After 7 days of reperfusion, total retinal thickness decreased at distances of 1.5 PD, 3 PD, and 4.5 PD, primarily due to inner retinal thinning (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-F</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C, D</xref>).</p>

<p>For a detailed analysis of inner retinal thickness, we extracted UPOAO mouse eyes and stained them with HE. The thickness of RNFL + GCL increased at 3 days of reperfusion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>), followed by a decrease at 7 days of reperfusion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref>). IPL thickness decreased at both 3 days and 7 days of reperfusion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I, M</xref>), while INL thickness decreased only at 7 days of reperfusion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N</xref>). We hypothesized that the initial swelling of GCL in response to acute ischemia and hypoxia led to early thickening, followed by gradual thinning due to tissue dysfunction. This hypothesis was supported by the observation of RGC loss and reduced IMRL thickness evaluated by OCT at 7 days (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>We observed that changes in retinal thickness became noticeable at 3 days post-UPOAO and exhibited a significant decrease at 7 days, as observed in OCT. HE results further elucidated that alterations in inner retinal thickness constituted a substantial portion of the total retinal thickness during the early reperfusion stage after UPOAO.</p>

<label>3.4</label><title>Survival of retinal neural cells in UPOAO</title>
<p>Given that mouse retinal function heavily relies on rod cells, and scotopic (low light) vision is primarily governed by rod photoreceptors, the observed reductions in b-wave and OPs-wave amplitudes indicate impaired synaptic transmission within the inner retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Our OCT and HE findings suggest structural injuries within the inner retina. Notably, a-waves in ERG and the thickness of the outer retinal layers in both OCT and HE remained unchanged. To delve deeper into these observations, we conducted immunofluorescence staining to investigate alterations in major retinal cell types, primarily focusing on Bipolar cells (BCs), photoreceptor cells, Horizontal cells (HCs), cholinergic amacrine cells.</p>
<sec id="s3d1">
<label>3.4.1</label><title>BCs loss and photoreceptor cells survival</title>
<p>PKCÎ± is a marker that delineates BCs, with their cell bodies primarily located in the outermost part of the INL, axonal terminals extending into the innermost part of the IPL, and dendrites confined to the OPL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A, B</xref>). In the experimental UPOAO eyes, BCs did not show significant changes at the 3-day reperfusion mark but exhibited dramatic alterations by the 7-day reperfusion period (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A2, B2</xref>). Particularly, the immunostaining density of BCsâ dendritic and axonal arbors notably decreased at the 7-day reperfusion mark. BCs account for approximately 40% of INL cells in mice, and their somata and axonal processes form a substantial part of the INL and IPL, consistent with the thinning of the INL observed in both OCT and HE at 7 days (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E, N</xref>). Itâs noteworthy that the decline in PKCÎ±+ BCs at the 7-day reperfusion point coincided with the decrease in b-wave amplitude in ERG (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>), indicating the functional interplay between BCs and other cells.</p>

<p>In the 7-day reperfusion group, 429 genes were upregulated and 310 genes were downregulated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>). The 7-day reperfusion DEGs were enriched in regulation of immune effector process, positive regulation of response to external stimulus and inflammation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6H</xref>). The heatmap showed the upregulated and downregulated genes of immune inflammation-related pathways at 7-day reperfusion in UPOAO and most hub genes were also enriched in this pathway, such as Cd86, Cd48, Tlr4, Tlr6 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6I</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig S6A</xref>).

<label>3.6</label><title>Leukocytes Infiltration and Microglial Activation</title>
<p>Time course transcriptome analysis underscore the predominant role of immune inflammatory responses during the reperfusion stage. Since the inflammatory response in RIRI has been reported was orchestrated by peripheral immune cells and resident immune cells within the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], we demonstrated the presence of leukocyte infiltration and microglial activation in UPOAO model. Immunofluorescent staining for CD45 was performed on retinas at different time points post-modeling to visualize the distribution and quantity of white blood cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A-D</xref>). Laser confocal Z-plane projections confirmed minimal leukocyte infiltration in the retinas of sham eyes, which showed CD45<sup>+</sup> cells at the vascular lumen likely representing patrolling cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). A significant increase in CD45<sup>+</sup> cells was observed in UPOAO model retinas at 1 day (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>), with a progressive increase in quantity over time (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F, G</xref>). Notably, the majority of CD45<sup>+</sup> cells in UPOAO model retinas at 1 day displayed a morphology similar to that of vascular leukocytes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>), suggesting a large influx of peripheral white blood cells into the retinal tissue. In contrast, CD45<sup>+</sup> cells at 3-day and 7-day reperfusion exhibited a combination of amoeboid and branched morphologies (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C, D</xref>), indicative of activated states.</p>

<p>Microglia, known to undergo activation and morphological changes in response to various insults, were examined in the superficial retina of sham and UPOAO eyes. Immunofluorescent staining for Iba1 was conducted on flat-mounted retinas at 3-day and 7-day post-reperfusion. In sham eyes, Iba1<sup>+</sup> microglia displayed small soma and elongated dendrites, evenly distributed within the retina (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7H1, I1</xref>). Conversely, UPOAO retinas exhibited numerous activated Iba1<sup>+</sup> microglia with enlarged soma, shortened dendrites, and an ameboid appearance (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7H2, I2</xref>). The number of Iba1<sup>+</sup> microglia in UPOAO retinas was approximately five times higher than that in sham eyes at 3 days (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7J</xref>), with a further increase observed at 7 days (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7K</xref>), albeit less prominent compared to the 3-day time point (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7J</xref>).

<label>3.7</label><title>RNA-seq comparison between UPOAO and extravascular occlusion models</title>
<p>The transcriptome of two extravascular occlusion models HIOP and UCCAO were analyzed for a further study of the characteristics of UPOAO. The HIOP model induces ischemia through anterior chamber perfusion with normal saline (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>), while the UCCAO model involves ligation of the unilateral common carotid artery (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8H</xref>). RNA-seq analysis of retinas exposed to 60 minutes of ischemia followed by 7-day reperfusion in the HIOP model revealed enrichment in immune-related pathways, specifically highlighting increased activity in leukocyte-mediated immunity and regulation of immune effector processes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>). This finding was consistent with GO analysis, which showed associations with toll-like receptor binding, T cell receptor binding processes, and immune-related functions in the overlapping DEGs between HIOP and UPOAO models (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C, D</xref>). To delve deeper, we explored the remaining DEGs in the HIOP model in addition to the overlapping genes. GO analysis revealed that the remaining DEGs in the HIOP model were also enriched in immune responses, such as the T cell receptor complex pathway, adaptive immune response, and B cell-mediated immunity function (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8E</xref>). Remarkably, upon examining the remaining DEGs specific to the UPOAO model, GO analysis showed DEGs distinctly related to lipid and steroid metabolic processes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8F</xref>, G). This observation indicates that the UPOAO model, closely related to RAO, not only exhibits conventional immune responses but also likely involves unique regulation of lipid and steroid metabolism.</p>

Further analysis of the UCCAO DEGs highlighted two genes (Mettl14 and YTHDF2) related to m6A modifications (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8L</xref>). Although both UPOAO and UCCAO models occludes arterial blood flow, our results revealed that the pathophysiological processes of two models were particularly different in 7-day reperfusion.</p>

<label>4</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study aimed to develop a more appropriate mouse model for investigating the ischemia-reperfusion process in RAO and unravelling the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. We combined silicone wire embolization with carotid artery ligation and effectively blocked the blood supply to the retina artery, which closely mimics the characteristics of the acute interruption of blood supply in RAO patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. In the UPOAO model, a 60-minute period of ischemia time could simulate the injury of the major retinal neural cells like RGCs, BCs, HCs, cholinergic amacrine cells, and the resultant visual impairment. Moreover, histologic examination demonstrated thinning of the inner layer of the retina, especially the GCL layer. Time course transcriptome analysis revealed various pathophysiological processes related to immune cell migration, oxidative stress, and immune inflammation during non-reperfusion and reperfusion periods. The resident microglia within the retina and peripheral leukocytes which access to the retina were pronounced increased on reperfusion periods. Additionally, we compared the transcriptomic signatures of the UPOAO model with two commonly used ischemia-reperfusion mouse models (HIOP and UCCAO), shedding light on the potential relevance of the UPOAO model to ocular vascular occlusive diseases.</p>
<p>The UPOAO mouse model can effectively simulate the characteristic features of RAO as observed in patients. RAO patients often exhibit distinctive patterns in dark ERGs, where b-waves are reduced while a-waves remain stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. In our study, we observed the same phenomenon in ERG amplitude after 60-minute ischemia in the UPOAO model. This was further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of bipolar cells and photoreceptor cells. Importantly, a previous study has linked the thinning of the inner retina with alterations of ERG in patients with RAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Our result showed that ischemic damage predominantly affected the inner layer of the retina, while the outer layer was almost unaffected. This distinction is attributed to the inner layerâs reliance on the retinal artery for blood supply while the outer layer is supplied by the choroid. Additionally, histological examination revealed increased thickness of retinal NFL and GCL layers, as well as decreased thickness of the IPL at 3-day reperfusion, indicating that ischemia-induced edema has not completely subsided.</p>
<p>This study comprehensively explored the transcriptomic signature after ischemia and revealed resident and peripheral Immune cells may play a major role in pathological processes. We uncovered that in the non-reperfusion group, the transcriptional changes are primarily involved in immune cells such as leukocytes, neutrophils migration from the blood vessels into the ischemic retinal tissue. This process is closely linked to the injury during ischemia and reperfusion, where leukocytes and neutrophils infiltrate into the neural tissue through the vascular endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Our results showed increased CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes in retina and retinal microvascular, suggesting that the leukocytes were recruited form the bloodstream to the damaged retinal tissue following reperfusion period. During the process of leukocytes access to the retina, chemokines, chemokine receptors, adhesion molecules and components of the cytoskeleton play an important role in regulating endothelial permeability and facilitating the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], which is consistent with our findings of related genes.</p>
<p>Moving on to the 3-day reperfusion period, we observed an increased number of DEGs significantly involved in the critical pathological response of oxidative stress in the context of IR tissues. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria and subsequent oxidative stress are widely recognized as major causes of retinal cell damage induced by IR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. This suggests that mitochondrial function, which is involved in oxidative stress processes, may play an important role in the pathophysiology of IRI during the early reperfusion stage. Oxidative stress can influence the permeability of the inner blood-retina barrier (iBRB), allowing leukocytes access to retinal tissues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. The infiltration and activation of immune cells are recognized as the underlying cause of many retinal diseases including ischemic ophthalmia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. In UPOAO model, the increase of CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes and Iba1<sup>+</sup> microglia in retina after 3-day reperfusion periods confirmed this viewpoint.</p>
<p>In the later stage of reperfusion (7 days), the DEGs are mainly enriched in immune regulation and inflammation. With more upregulated DEGs than downregulated ones, we believe that the activation of immune inflammatory response contributes to further IRI in retinal tissue. Previous studies found that the retina can elicit immunological responses during ischemia-reperfusion injury and immune inflammation is an important phenomenon in the progression of this injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. The excessive ROS generated by mitochondria in RGCs during the activation of inflammatory responses can damage cell structure and visual function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Microglia, which are considered as primary resident immune cells, contribute to the inflammatory responses and consequent neural damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Infiltrating leukocytes can activate resident microglia, forming a feedback loop that exacerbates inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. The complex interactions between immune cells and retina neurons after RIRI have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Interestingly, in our result of UPOAO model, the death of major retinal neural cells like RGCs, BCs, HCs correlate with the phase of increased infiltrating leukocytes and resident microglia. Therefore, we considered that the immune response and neuroinflammatory observed after 7 days of reperfusion may be the cumulative effect of the acute oxidative stress and resident and peripheral immune cells responses (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>). In a word, we described the pathological processes at different time points and highlight the important role of resident and peripheral Immune cells responses in the UPOAO model. This offers valuable insights for subsequent screening of pathogenic genes and potential immunotherapy approaches.</p>

<p>Compared with HIOP and UCCAO models, the UPOAO model stands out as a more appropriate choice for studying retinal IRI in RAO. The HIOP model, widely used for investigating the pathogenesis of APACG, exhibits retinal degeneration features similar to the UPOAO model during two reperfusion periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. In our UPOAO model, histologic and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrates that 60 minutes of ischemia followed by 3 days or 7 days reperfusion can cause irreversible damage to the retinal structure and visual function specifically, we observed distinct alterations such as the thinning of the inner retina, substantial apoptosis of RGCs, decreased b-wave. Multiple studies on the HIOP model reported consistent results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. However, some typical phenotypes in HIOP model such as thinning of the outer nuclear layer and the entire neuroretina and decreased a-wave were not observed in UPOAO model. moreover, our transcriptome sequence revealed a specific subset of DEGs unique to the UPOAO model, including Apoe, Abca1, Ldlr, Cyp39a1, Bmp6 etc. Notably, these DEGs are significantly enriched in pathways associated with lipid and steroid synthesis. Steroids and lipid metabolism homeostasis is disrupted under conditions of oxidative stress and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. In the UPOAO model, these lipid and steroid biological processes may result from the cumulative pathological responses triggered by IRI, setting it apart from the HIOP model. In the UCCAO model, RNA-seq results showed that DEGs were mainly enriched in two pathways: 1) epigenetic modification-related pathways, including nucleobase-containing compound catabolic process, RNA catabolic process, mRNA catabolic process and N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification; 2) cell death pathways, including regulation of autophagosome assembly, negative regulation of neuron death, negative regulation of neuron apoptotic process. Epigenetic mechanisms may play a key role in the pathophysiology of ocular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. m<sup>6</sup>A, one of the most common RNA modifications, has been reported to regulate the cell death processes including apoptosis and autophagy in the pathological process of IRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. The result suggests that epigenetic mechanisms may significantly influence cell death during UCCAO reperfusion for 7 days. Lee et al. evaluated the characteristics of UCCAO without reperfusion using visual, histologic and immunohistochemical approaches and their results showed delayed perfusion of the ipsilateral retina, thinning of the inner retinal layer 10 weeks after surgery, and dramatic decrease in the amplitudes of b-waves on day 14 after UCCAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. This suggested that UCCAO primarily represents a model of retinal hypoperfusion injury and may not effectively reflect acute ischemic-induced structural and functional damage in RAO (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>). The results have led us to consider UPOAO model as an effective experimental model to study pathological processes underlying acute ischemia and IRI.</p>
<p>Our research has certain limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, our study focused on the changes occurred within 60 minutes of ischemia and the first 7 days of reperfusion in the UPOAO model. Further exploration is needed to understand changes brought by longer reperfusion time. Additionally, we proposed the possible pathological mechanisms, including iBRB damage, oxidative stress and immune inflammation mainly based on the enrichment results of DEGs at three reperfusion time points. More molecular experimental validation is needed.</p>
<p>In summary, by thoroughly exploring the injury to major retinal neural cells, visual impairment and pathophysiological changes in the UPOAO model, we confirmed that the this model can effectively simulate the acute ischemia-reperfusion processes in RAO and serve as an ideal mouse model for investigating the underlying ischemia and reperfusion pathological processes. Furthermore, our UPOAO model holds great promise as a novel model for studies of pathogenic genes and potential therapeutic interventions for RAO.</p>

<p>The manuscript establishes a sophisticated mouse model for acute retinal artery occlusion (RAO) by combining unilateral pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery occlusion (UPOAO) with a silicone wire embolus and carotid artery ligation, generating ischemia-reperfusion injury upon removal of the embolus. This clinically relevant model is <bold>useful</bold> for studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms of RAO. The data overall are <bold>solid</bold>, presenting a novel tool for screening pathogenic genes and promoting further therapeutic research in RAO.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wang, Y. et al. used a silicone wire embolus to definitively and acutely clot the pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery in addition to carotid artery ligation to completely block the blood supply to the mouse inner retina, which mimics clinical acute retinal artery occlusion. A detailed characterization of this mouse model determined the time course of inner retina degeneration and associated functional deficits, which closely mimic human patients. Whole retina transcriptome profiling and comparison revealed distinct features associated with ischemia, reperfusion, and different model mechanisms. Interestingly and importantly, this team found a sequential event including reperfusion-induced leukocyte infiltration from blood vessels, residual microglial activation, and neuroinflammation that may lead to neuronal cell death.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Clear demonstration of the surgery procedure with informative illustrations, images, and superb surgical videos.</p>
<p>Two-time points of ischemia and reperfusion were studied with convincing histological and in vivo data to demonstrate the time course of various changes in retinal neuronal cell survivals, ERG functions, and inner/outer retina thickness.</p>
<p>The transcriptome comparison among different retinal artery occlusion models provides informative evidence to differentiate these models.</p>
<p>The potential applications of the in vivo retinal ischemia-reperfusion model and relevant readouts demonstrated by this study will certainly inspire further investigation of the dynamic morphological and functional changes of retinal neurons and glial cell responses during disease progression and before and after treatments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It would be beneficial to the manuscript and the readers if the authors could improve the English of this manuscript by correcting obvious grammar errors, eliminating many of the acronyms that are not commonly used by the field, and providing a reason why this complicated but clever surgery procedure was designed and a summary table with the time course of all the morphological, functional, cellular, and transcriptome changes associated with this model.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors of this manuscript aim to develop a novel animal model to accurately simulate the retinal ischemic process in retinal artery occlusion (RAO). A unilateral pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery occlusion (UPOAO) mouse model was established using silicone wire embolization combined with carotid artery ligation. This manuscript provided data to show the changes in major classes of retinal neural cells and visual dysfunction following various durations of ischemia (30 minutes and 60 minutes) and reperfusion (3 days and 7 days) after UPOAO. Additionally, transcriptomics was utilized to investigate the transcriptional changes and elucidate changes in the pathophysiological process in the UPOAO model post-ischemia and reperfusion. Furthermore, the authors compared transcriptomic differences between the UPOAO model and other retinal ischemic-reperfusion models, including HIOP and UCCAO, and revealed unique pathological processes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The UPOAO model represents a novel approach to studying retinal artery occlusion. The study is very comprehensive.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some statements are incorrect and confusing. It would be helpful to review and clarify these to ensure accuracy and improve readability.</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment:</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript establishes a sophisticated mouse model for acute retinal artery occlusion (RAO) by combining unilateral pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery occlusion (UPOAO) with a silicone wire embolus and carotid artery ligation, generating ischemia-reperfusion injury upon removal of the embolus. This clinically relevant model is useful for studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms of RAO. The data overall are solid, presenting a novel tool for screening pathogenic genes and promoting further therapeutic research in RAO.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wang, Y. et al. used a silicone wire embolus to definitively and acutely clot the pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery in addition to carotid artery ligation to completely block the blood supply to the mouse inner retina, which mimics clinical acute retinal artery occlusion. A detailed characterization of this mouse model determined the time course of inner retina degeneration and associated functional deficits, which closely mimic human patients. Whole retina transcriptome profiling and comparison revealed distinct features associated with ischemia, reperfusion, and different model mechanisms. Interestingly and importantly, this team found a sequential event including reperfusion-induced leukocyte infiltration from blood vessels, residual microglial activation, and neuroinflammation that may lead to neuronal cell death.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Clear demonstration of the surgery procedure with informative illustrations, images, and superb surgical videos.</p>
<p>Two-time points of ischemia and reperfusion were studied with convincing histological and in vivo data to demonstrate the time course of various changes in retinal neuronal cell survivals, ERG functions, and inner/outer retina thickness.</p>
<p>The transcriptome comparison among different retinal artery occlusion models provides informative evidence to differentiate these models.</p>
<p>The potential applications of the in vivo retinal ischemia-reperfusion model and relevant readouts demonstrated by this study will certainly inspire further investigation of the dynamic morphological and functional changes of retinal neurons and glial cell responses during disease progression and before and after treatments.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It would be beneficial to the manuscript and the readers if the authors could improve the English of this manuscript by correcting obvious grammar errors, eliminating many of the acronyms that are not commonly used by the field, and providing a reason why this complicated but clever surgery procedure was designed and a summary table with the time course of all the morphological, functional, cellular, and transcriptome changes associated with this model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your thorough review of the manuscript. We sincerely apologize for any grammatical errors resulting from our English language proficiency and have taken the necessary steps to polish the article. Additionally, we have heeded your advice and reduced the use of field-specific acronyms to enhance readability for both the manuscript and its readers.</p>
<p>Regarding the rationale behind the design of the UPOAO model, we have provided a description in Introduction section. Our group focuses on the research of pathogenesis and clinical treatment for RAO. The absence of an accurate mouse model simulating the retinal ischemic process has hampered progress in developing neuroprotective agents for RAO. To better simulate the retinal ischemic process and possible ischemia-reperfusion injury following RAO, we developed a novel vascular-associated mouse model called the unilateral pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery occlusion (UPOAO) model. We drew inspiration from the widely employed middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, commonly used in cerebral ischemic injury research, which guided the development of the UPOAO model.</p>
<p>We appreciate your valuable suggestion regarding the inclusion of a summary table outlining the time course of morphological, functional, cellular, and transcriptome changes associated with this model. To address this, we intend to include a supplementary table at the end of the article, which will offer a comprehensive overview of the experimental results, thereby aiding in clarity and interpretation.</p>
<p>Once again, we thank you for your insightful comments and suggestions, which have greatly contributed to the improvement of our manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors of this manuscript aim to develop a novel animal model to accurately simulate the retinal ischemic process in retinal artery occlusion (RAO). A unilateral pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery occlusion (UPOAO) mouse model was established using silicone wire embolization combined with carotid artery ligation. This manuscript provided data to show the changes in major classes of retinal neural cells and visual dysfunction following various durations of ischemia (30 minutes and 60 minutes) and reperfusion (3 days and 7 days) after UPOAO. Additionally, transcriptomics was utilized to investigate the transcriptional changes and elucidate changes in the pathophysiological process in the UPOAO model post-ischemia and reperfusion. Furthermore, the authors compared transcriptomic differences between the UPOAO model and other retinal ischemic-reperfusion models, including HIOP and UCCAO, and revealed unique pathological processes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The UPOAO model represents a novel approach to studying retinal artery occlusion. The study is very comprehensive.</p>
