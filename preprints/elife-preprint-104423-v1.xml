<title>Abstract</title><p>The differentiation and suppressive functions of regulatory CD4 T cells (Tregs) are supported by a broad array of metabolic changes, providing potential therapeutic targets for immune modulation. In this study, we focused on the regulatory role of glycolytic enzymes in Tregs and identified phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) as being differentially overexpressed in Tregs and associated with a highly suppressive phenotype. Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of PGAM reduced Treg differentiation and suppressive function while reciprocally inducing markers of a pro-inflammatory, T helper 17 (Th17)-like state. The regulatory role of PGAM was dependent on the contribution of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), the PGAM substrate, to de novo serine synthesis. Blocking de novo serine synthesis from 3PG reversed the effect of PGAM inhibition on Treg polarization, while exogenous serine directly inhibited Treg polarization. Additionally, altering serine levels <italic>in vivo</italic> with a serine/glycine-free diet increased peripheral Tregs and attenuated autoimmunity in a murine model of multiple sclerosis. Mechanistically, we found that serine limits Treg polarization by contributing to one-carbon metabolism and methylation of Treg-associated genes. Inhibiting one-carbon metabolism increased Treg polarization and suppressive function both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in a murine model of autoimmune colitis. Our study identifies a novel physiologic role for PGAM and highlights the metabolic interconnectivity between glycolysis, serine synthesis, one-carbon metabolism, and epigenetic regulation of Treg differentiation and suppressive function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Upon activation, immune cells undergo drastic metabolic changes that support their differentiation and effector functions. The regulation of immune responses by metabolic pathways, termed “immunometabolism”, has become a major focus of research with a goal of identifying pathways that can be targeted in conditions ranging from autoimmune and infectious diseases to cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>T lymphocytes in particular have emerged as a central focus of immunometabolic research with far reaching implications in human disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Among the metabolic adaptations associated with T cell activation, glycolytic reprogramming plays a prominent role. Increased glucose uptake and augmented glycolysis are critical for the differentiation and effector functions of inflammatory T cell subsets, including effector CD8 cells and T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 CD4 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In contrast, regulatory T cells (Tregs), which serve as the brakes of the immune response by promoting tolerance and suppressing inflammation, have a distinct glycolytic profile <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Prior work has shown that initial engagement of glycolysis supports proliferation and migration of Tregs, whereas downregulation of glycolysis and greater engagement of fatty acid oxidation are required for expression of the Treg-specific transcription factor FOXP3 and Treg suppressive functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In this regard, forced engagement of glycolysis was found to decrease FOXP3 expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> while inhibition of glycolysis favored Treg differentiation and suppressive functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The relationship between glycolysis and Treg function is not straightforward, however. For instance, in human Tregs induced following weak stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR), glycolysis supported Treg suppressive function by regulating DNA-binding activity of the glycolytic enzyme enolase-1 (ENO1) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Such findings suggest the possibility of a more nuanced role for glycolysis in Tregs, with individual glycolytic enzymes serving unique and perhaps disparate functions.</p>
<p>Here, we report that the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM), which converts 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) to 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG), is physiologically upregulated in Tregs and its enzymatic activity supports FOXP3 expression and Treg suppressive function. Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of PGAM inhibited Treg differentiation and shifted CD4 T cells toward a pro-inflammatory, Th17-like state. Mechanistically, we found that PGAM regulates Treg differentiation by controlling flux through the de novo serine synthesis pathway. The PGAM substrate 3PG is also utilized for serine synthesis, and decreased PGAM enzyme activity led to increased serine synthesis through accumulation of 3PG. Both newly synthesized and imported extracellular serine inhibited Treg differentiation by contributing to one-carbon metabolism and promoting the methylation, and therefore silencing, of genes associated with Treg function. Manipulation of serine availability and the methylation cycle increased peripheral Tregs and attenuated disease in mouse models of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune colitis. Our finding that PGAM, a key glycolytic enzyme, physiologically supports Treg differentiation further challenges the notion that glycolysis plays a singular, inhibitory role in Tregs and suggests that individual glycolytic enzymes can serve as nodes for the fine-tuning of immune responses. Furthermore, our work identifies novel metabolic targets for the therapeutic manipulation of Treg function in human disease.</p>

<title>PGAM regulates Treg differentiation and suppressive function</title>
<p>In order to identify the glycolytic enzymes that play the largest role in Treg differentiation, we analyzed multiple publicly available transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. We first investigated an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset that compared human naïve CD4 cells cultured under either Th0 or Treg polarizing conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. After library normalization, we examined genes included in the “Glycolysis and Gluconeogenesis” gene ontology (GO) term and found that PGAM1 was the most differentially expressed glycolytic gene, with upregulation in <italic>in vitro</italic>-induced Tregs (iTregs) compared to conventional Th0 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine whether PGAM expression is similarly upregulated in ex vivo-derived Tregs, we examined a single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from human healthy controls <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and compared glycolytic gene expression between Tregs and total CD4 cells. After removing glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) for scaling purposes, we found that PGAM1 was similarly upregulated in Tregs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). A proteomics dataset from human healthy donor PBMCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> demonstrated significantly upregulated protein levels of PGAM1 and PGAM2 in Tregs compared to total CD4 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), confirming findings from the mRNA level.</p>

</fig>
<p>The differential upregulation of PGAM in Tregs suggested that it might play a physiologic regulatory role in these cells. We therefore wondered whether PGAM inhibition impacts Treg differentiation. To answer this question, we used epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a known inhibitor of PGAM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. We cultured naïve murine CD4 cells under Treg polarizing conditions with either vehicle or EGCG and assessed Treg differentiation by quantifying the percentage of CD25<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells by flow cytometry after 96 hours. Treatment with EGCG significantly reduced Treg differentiation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) without affecting proliferation or cell viability (Figure S1). To validate the effects of pharmacologic inhibition with genetic knockdown, we utilized antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting PGAM to reduce gene expression. Compared to scrambled control ASOs, we found that ASOs targeting PGAM reduced PGAM1 protein levels (Figure S2A) and significantly reduced Treg differentiation assessed by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Because glycolysis is crucial for cell health, we wanted to know if PGAM knockdown was affecting survival and/or proliferation. We found that PGAM ASOs did not affect cell survival and led to a minor increase in cell proliferation (Figures S2B and S2C).</p>
<p>To gain further insights into the effects of PGAM knockdown on Treg differentiation, we performed RNA-seq transcriptional profiling from naïve murine CD4 cells cultured under Treg polarizing conditions with either scrambled or PGAM-specific ASOs. PCA analysis showed that PGAM ASOs led to major transcriptional changes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), with major effects on MYC targets and mTORC1 signaling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>), among other changes. We then performed differential expression analysis on a subset of genes important in the Treg-Th17 axis and found that cells treated with PGAM ASOs had significantly higher expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as IL-17, IL-22, and IL-9, while significantly lower expression of genes involved in Treg differentiation such as FOXP3 and IZKF3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). A complete list of differentially expressed genes can be found in Table S1.</p>
<p>Given the observed changes in transcriptional profile and differentiation markers, we next asked whether PGAM knockdown leads to functional changes in Treg suppressive activity. Compared to treatment with scrambled ASOs, PGAM ASO-treated Tregs were less effective at suppressing effector T (Teff) cell proliferation, indicating diminished suppressive function (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Consistent with this finding, analysis of a published scRNAseq dataset of tumor-infiltrating Tregs showed that PGAM1 is overexpressed relative to other glycolytic enzymes in the OX40<sup>hi</sup>GITR<sup>hi</sup> subset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>), which was the most highly suppressive of the 10 Treg subsets identified <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings demonstrate a critical role for PGAM in supporting Treg differentiation and suppressive function, <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as in healthy and diseased human states. The positive regulatory role of PGAM in Tregs was intriguing, since glycolysis has generally been associated with decreased Treg function. Our own prior work found that inhibition of GAPDH, which catalyzes a reaction only two steps upstream from PGAM in glycolysis, augments Treg differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>– a finding we replicated here with the GAPDH inhibitor koningic acid (Figure S3). The discordant roles of GAPDH and PGAM led us to focus on the metabolites whose concentrations are immediately impacted by PGAM enzymatic activity.</p>

<title>PGAM regulation of Treg differentiation is mediated by 3PG and de novo serine synthesis</title>
<p>PGAM metabolizes the glycolytic intermediate 3PG into 2PG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In addition to its role in glycolysis, 3PG is the starting substrate for the de novo serine synthesis pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Given previous work implicating various roles for serine in T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that PGAM enzymatic activity regulates Treg differentiation and function by controlling levels of 3PG with downstream effects on serine synthesis (Figure 2A). To test this hypothesis, we first cultured naïve murine CD4 cells under Treg-polarizing conditions with either vehicle or the PGAM inhibitor EGCG and measured intracellular serine levels by mass spectrometry. As anticipated, PGAM inhibition with EGCG increased intracellular levels of serine in Tregs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We next asked whether glucose-derived de novo serine synthesis is physiologically regulated during Treg differentiation, focusing on the reciprocal Treg-Th17 axis. We differentiated naïve murine CD4 cells into either Tregs or Th17 cells for 72 hours. After 6-hour glucose starvation, the cells were incubated with uniformly 13-carbon labeled glucose (U<sup>13</sup>C-glucose) for an additional 6 hours. Using mass spectrometry, we found that <sup>13</sup>C-labeling of serine was significantly higher in Th17 cells compared to Tregs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that flux through de novo serine synthesis is physiologically downregulated in Tregs compared to Th17 cells.</p>

<p>If the role of PGAM in Treg differentiation depends on de novo serine synthesis, then the effects of PGAM inhibition should be rescued by simultaneously blocking the serine synthesis pathway. To this end, we cultured naïve murine CD4 cells under Treg-polarizing conditions and treated them with the PGAM inhibitor EGCG ± NCT-503, an inhibitor of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH, the ratelimiting enzyme of serine synthesis from 3PG) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. As before, PGAM inhibition with EGCG inhibited Treg differentiation as assessed by FOXP3 expression, but this was reversed by PHGDH inhibition with NCT-503 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Similarly, if PGAM regulates Tregs by controlling concentrations of 3PG (the substrate for serine synthesis), then direct supplementation of 3PG should replicate the effects of PGAM inhibition. To test this, 3PG was delivered to naïve murine CD4 cells via electroporation followed by Treg polarization. As expected, 3PG supplementation decreased FOXP3 expression, which was rescued by PHGDH inhibition with NCT-503 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). To further validate the role of de novo serine synthesis in Tregs, we used PHGDH-targeted ASOs and found that genetic knockdown of PHGDH led to augmented Treg differentiation as assessed by FOXP3 expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>The above findings demonstrate that PGAM regulates Treg differentiation by controlling flux through the serine synthesis pathway. Because serine can be derived from both de novo intracellular synthesis and extracellular sources, we next asked whether extracellular serine also affects Treg differentiation. We cultured naïve murine CD4 cells under Treg-polarizing conditions in either serine/glycine-free media or control (serine/glycine-containing) media.

<p>After finding that serine derived from both extracellular sources and de novo synthesis inhibits Treg polarization <italic>in vitro</italic>, we investigated the effect on Tregs of altering serine availability <italic>in vivo</italic>. We first examined the impact of dietary serine restriction by maintaining mice immediately post-weaning on either a serine/glycine-free diet or isocaloric control diet.

<p>We next asked whether de novo serine synthesis is altered in human Tregs in disease. Using publicly available RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data, we estimated the rate of de novo serine synthesis using single cell flux estimation analysis (SCFEA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, which constructs a global set of metabolic reactions as a factor map and uses multi-layer neural networks to model reaction rates from mRNA levels of metabolic enzymes. We applied SCFEA to human Th0 and iTreg cells differentiated from naïve CD4 cells <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and found that serine synthesis was downregulated in iTregs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Autoimmunity occurs when Tregs fail to adequately regulate the immune response, so we wondered whether the predicted rate of de novo serine synthesis would be altered in Tregs derived from patients with autoimmune disease. Using scRNA-seq data derived from Tregs isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with treatment-naïve relapsing MS and controls <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, we found the predicted rate of serine synthesis was significantly higher in Tregs from MS patients (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Conversely, while autoimmunity results from inadequate Treg suppressive function, Tregs in the tumor microenvironment have pathologically high suppressive function. We examined scRNA-seq data from Tregs derived from healthy prostate and prostate cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> from the IMMUcan database <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> and found that prostate tumor-infiltrating Tregs had significantly lower predicted serine synthesis than Tregs from healthy prostate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Consistent with our earlier findings that serine synthesis inhibits Treg function, these analyses suggest that serine synthesis within Tregs is higher in autoimmunity and lower in the tumor microenvironment, thereby negatively correlating with expected Treg suppressive function in human disease.</p>

<title>Serine inhibits Treg generation by contributing to one-carbon metabolism and DNA methylation</title>
<p>We next examined the mechanistic links between serine metabolism and Treg function. Serine can serve as a one-carbon donor by entering the one-carbon metabolism cycle, which depends on conversion into glycine by the enzyme SHMT1/2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). To determine whether the effects of serine on Treg differentiation depend on contributions to one-carbon metabolism, we cultured naïve murine CD4 cells under Treg polarizing conditions with either vehicle or the SHMT1/2 inhibitor SHIN1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Inhibiting SHMT1/2 increased Treg polarization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) and mitigated the inhibitory effect of extracellular serine on Tregs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Because methionine can compensate as a one-carbon donor, other groups have found that the contribution of serine to one-carbon metabolism is greater in the absence of methionine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. To further the idea that serine inhibits Treg polarization by contributing to one-carbon metabolism, we cultured naïve murine CD4 cells under Treg polarizing conditions in methionine-free media supplemented with either methionine or additional serine. Although methionine supplementation had little effect, excess extracellular serine was highly potent in inhibiting Treg polarization in the absence of methionine (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). These studies suggest that the regulatory role of serine in Tregs is mediated at least in part through one-carbon metabolism.</p>

<p>A crucial role of one-carbon metabolism is to provide methyl groups for methylation reactions, and DNA methylation represents a key epigenetic mechanism used to silence gene transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. We therefore asked whether serine entry into one-carbon metabolism contributes to DNA methylation in Tregs, so we conducted a carbon tracing experiment in which Tregs were cultured in media containing uniformly 13-carbon labeled serine (U<sup>13</sup>C-serine) for 12 hours before DNA was isolated and analyzed by mass spectrometry. We found that serine directly contributed to cytosine methylation, as measured by carbon labeling of methylcytosine (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Demethylation of the Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) in Tregs is a critical step for generation of stable, bona fide Tregs, and methylation in this region is associated with transient or unstable expression of FOXP3 and suppressive activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. We therefore investigated the effects of extracellular serine and PGAM knockdown on methylation of the TSDR via pyrosequencing. In a first set of experiments, naïve murine CD4 cells were cultured under Treg polarizing conditions in either serine/glycine-free media or media containing serine. The presence of extracellular serine increased TSDR methylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Genetic knockdown of PGAM using ASOs similarly increased TSDR methylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that both extracellular serine and PGAM-regulated serine synthesis increase the methylation, and therefore silencing, of Treg-associated genes.</p>
<p>Given the promising results seen with pyrosequencing, we next used a next generation sequencing panel to identify CpG sites in Treg-specific genes whose methylation is regulated by serine (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). Methylation of <italic>IKZF2</italic> (Helios) was significantly increased with the addition of extracellular serine, but this was reversed by blocking serine entry into one-carbon metabolism with the SHMT inhibitor SHIN1. In the 5’ upstream region of the <italic>FOXP3</italic> gene, one CpG site showed significantly higher methylation in the presence of serine, and this effect was reversed by SHIN1. A complete list of CpG methylation levels can be found in Table S2.</p>
<p>To definitively link methylation to Treg differentiation and suppressive function, we blocked methylation in Tregs with 3-Deazaadenosine (3DZA), an inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase. SAH hydrolase degrades SAH and prevents recycling of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. In naïve murine CD4 cells cultured under Treg polarizing conditions, 3DZA increased Treg differentiation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>) without affecting cell viability (Figure S4). Treatment with 3DZA similarly augmented suppressive function in cultured murine Tregs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). To determine the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of these findings, we used an adoptive transfer autoimmune colitis mouse model. Conventional murine CD4 cells were activated ex vivo and injected into RAG<sup>-/-</sup> mice to induce colitis, along with simultaneous injection of Tregs that had been treated during differentiation with either vehicle or 3DZA. Mice injected with Tregs polarized in the presence of 3DZA had less severe disease as measured by weight loss and macroscopic examination of the colon (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4K</xref> and S5), indicating greater Treg suppressive function. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that one-carbon metabolism and methylation impair Treg differentiation and suppressive function both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we found that PGAM plays a key physiologic role in Treg differentiation and suppressive function through regulation of serine synthesis, which intersects with glycolysis immediately upstream of PGAM through the shared substrate 3PG. Analysis of published datasets revealed that PGAM expression is specifically increased within human Tregs at both transcriptional and protein levels, and further that PGAM expression is enriched in highly suppressive Treg phenotypes. Pharmacologic inhibition or genetic knockdown of PGAM reduced Treg polarization and suppressive function while promoting a proinflammatory gene signature. These effects were replicated by exogenous supplementation of 3PG and reversed by inhibition of serine synthesis. Single cell flux estimation analysis predicted increased serine synthesis in Tregs isolated from patients suffering from autoimmune disease and decreased serine flux in tumor-associated Tregs, underlining the clinical importance of this regulatory pathway. Consistent with a previous report <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, we found that both synthesized and exogenously imported serine impact Treg function. Mechanistically, serine inhibited Treg polarization by increasing flux through one-carbon metabolism with downstream effects on DNA methylation of Treg-related genes. Interfering with serine availability or methylation attenuated disease in <italic>in vivo</italic> models of autoimmunity.</p>
<p>The surprising role of PGAM in Treg differentiation has both physiologic and therapeutic implications. Although glycolysis has been shown to support initial proliferation and migration of Tregs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, most prior work has suggested that glycolytic flux supports effector T cell functions with concomitant downregulation of Treg stability and suppressive activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Indeed, previous studies have shown Tregs to depend on fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation, largely independent of glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Our own prior work found that inhibition of GAPDH, an enzyme two catalytic reactions upstream of PGAM in glycolysis, enhances Treg differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, with similar findings observed following inhibition or knock-down of other proximal glycolytic enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. It is striking, therefore, that PGAM enzymatic activity has the opposite effect, supporting Treg differentiation and suppressive functions. Inhibition or knockdown of PGAM not only prevented Treg polarization but reciprocally enhanced markers of a pro-inflammatory, Th17-like phenotype, implicating PGAM as a physiologic regulator of the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory lymphocyte responses via regulation of serine synthesis. These findings suggest that glycolytic regulation of immunity is more complex than previously appreciated, supporting a more granular view in which glycolytic enzymes can serve as independent regulatory nodes for the fine-tuning of immune responses.</p>
<p>From a therapeutic perspective, our findings identify novel targets for modulating Treg function in disease. Substantial prior work has shown that manipulation of glycolysis and other metabolic pathways has a therapeutic window for systemic administration despite the ubiquity of these pathways in cell biology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, systemic administration may not be necessary for several key therapeutic applications, for instance optimization of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Differentiation of CAR-T cells into a Treg-like state correlates with failure of CAR-T therapy in B cell lymphoma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>, such that manipulation of PGAM and downstream serine metabolism and DNA methylation is a potential strategy for improving the anti-cancer fitness of CAR-T cells <italic>ex vivo</italic> prior to infusion. Conversely, CAR-Tregs are currently in clinical trials for a variety of autoimmune disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, and there is widespread interest in treatments that improve the suppressive activity of Tregs.</p>
<p>Of note, a prior study reported that complete knockout of PGAM1 in T cells impaired differentiation and effector functions of pro-inflammatory T cell subsets with only mild impact on Treg generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. However, complete knockout of a glycolytic enzyme would be expected to abrogate glycolytic flux entirely, with wide-ranging effects (including decreased energy production) likely to mask the impact of physiologic or therapeutic modulation of enzyme function. As we showed here, partial knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of PGAM1, which decrease but do not fully abrogate enzymatic activity, substantially reduced Treg differentiation while supporting pro-inflammatory activation. Additionally, other groups studying glycolysis in cancer used partial knockdowns to show that PGAM supports tumor proliferation by controlling flux through the de novo serine synthesis pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our investigation focused on the contribution of one-carbon metabolism to DNA methylation, which is particularly relevant in Tregs given the established regulatory role of methylation of Treg-specific genes, including the Treg Specific Demethylated Region (TSDR) of the FOXP3 gene locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. However, one-carbon metabolism contributes to many cellular processes, including purine synthesis, amino acid metabolism, and phospholipid synthesis, among others <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, so it is likely that one-carbon metabolism inhibits Treg differentiation in a variety of ways. Although other groups have also identified the importance of one-carbon metabolism in Treg generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, we describe novel links between glycolysis, serine synthesis, and DNA methylation as a regulatory pathway of Treg differentiation.</p>
<p>In summary, we have found an unexpected role of PGAM that adds further nuance to the complex relationship between glycolysis and Treg function and further implicates serine and its contributions to onecarbon metabolism and DNA methylation as key regulators of Treg differentiation. In addition to yielding new biological insights into the metabolic regulation of lymphocyte fate and function, these findings point to new strategies for the therapeutic manipulation of Treg function.</p>

The extract was reconstituted in a 500-μl solution of methanol/water (1:1) and filtered through a 3-kDa molecular filter (Amicon® Ultra Centrifugal Filter, 3 kDa MWCO, Millipore Sigma) at 4°C for 90 minutes to remove proteins. The filtrate was dried at 37°C for 90 minutes in a SpeedVac and stored at –80°C until mass spectrometric analysis. Prior to mass spectrometric analysis, the dried extract was resuspended in methanol/water (1:1).</p>
<p>For amino acid flux analysis, CD4 T cells were cultured for 6 hours in glucose-free media, then 12 mM U13C-glucose was added for 6 hours. The cells were resuspended in a 500-μl mixture of 1:1 water/methanol, sonicated for one minute (two 30-second pulses), centrifuged at 4°C for ten minutes, and filtered through a 3-kDa molecular filter (Amicon® Ultra Centrifugal Filter, 3 kDa MWCO, Millipore Sigma) at 4°C for 90 minutes to remove proteins. The samples were dried at 37°C for 45 minutes in a SpeedVac system (Genevac EZ Solvent Evaporator, SP Industries, Inc.). Prior to mass spectrometry analysis, the dried extract was resuspended in methanol/water (1:1).</p>
<p>CD4 T cells were cultured under Treg polarizing conditions in serine-free media to measure methylcytosine flux, followed by the addition of either normal serine or 13C3-serine for 12 hours. The cells were harvested, the pellets were washed, and DNA was isolated using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit. DNA was quantified with a Nanodrop, and all samples were normalized based on total DNA content before mass spectrometry analysis. The details of the DNA hydrolysis methods were previously described (PMID: 27158554). DNA was denatured at 100°C for 3 minutes, incubated with ammonium acetate and nuclease P1, then mixed and incubated with venom phosphodiesterase I, followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase. The details of the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods were also described earlier (PMID: 27158554).</p>
<p>For the LC-MS analysis method for serine steady state and tracing study of serine and methylcytosine, chromatographic separation of extracted metabolites, including serine, was performed through Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography (HILIC) using an XBridge Amide column (3.5 µm, 4.6 x 100 mm, Waters, Milford, MA) in ESI-positive ionization mode. Solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and Solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) were used for chromatographic separation (Ref). The data were acquired via multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using a 6495 Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled to an HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) through Agilent Mass Hunter Data Acquisition Software (ver. 10.1) (PMID: 31360899, PMID: 30642841). The acquired mass spectra were analyzed and integrated into each targeted compound peak using Agilent Mass Hunter Quantitative Analysis Software. For serine measurement, peak areas were normalized with a spiked internal standard. Differential metabolites were determined using p-values from t-tests following the Benjamini-Hochberg method, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.25. For serine and methylcytosine tracing studies, the percentage of 13C incorporation was calculated using Microsoft Excel from peak areas and represented as bar graphs.</p>

<title>EAE Induction and Scoring</title>
<p>Active EAE was induced in female and male C57BL/6J mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> (10 weeks old) after pretreatment with either serine/glycine-free diet or control diet (Animal Specialty and Provisions, 1812281 and 1817070-209) for one week. MOG<sub>35 − 55</sub> peptide dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 2 mg/mL was mixed 1:1 with complete Freund’s adjuvant (8 mg/ml Tuberculin toxin in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant), then mixed for 12 min into an emulsion. On day 0, mice were immunized by injecting 75 μl of the emulsion subcutaneously into each of two sites on the lateral abdomen. In addition, on day 0 and again on day 2, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 375 ng pertussis toxin. Scoring was performed by a blinded individual according to the following scale: 0, no clinical deficit; 0.5, partial loss of tail tone; 1.0, complete tail paralysis or both partial loss of tail tone plus awkward gait; 1.5, complete tail paralysis and awkward gait; 2.0, tail paralysis with hind limb weakness evidenced by foot dropping between bars of cage lid while walking; 2.5, hind limb paralysis with little to no weight-bearing on hind limbs (dragging), but with some movement possible in legs; 3.0, complete hind limb paralysis with no movement in lower limbs; 3.5, hind limb paralysis with some weakness in forelimbs; 4.0, complete tetraplegia but with some movement of head; 4.5, moribund; and 5.0, dead.</p>

<title>Bisulfite Conversion and Pyrosequencing</title>
<p>Bisulfite conversion was performed by EpigenDx according to standard pyrosequencing and Next Gen Sequencing protocols. Briefly, cell pellets were lysed based on the total cell count per sample and total volume received using M-digestion Buffer (ZymoResearch; Irvine, CA; cat# D5021-9) and 5-10µL of protease K (20mg/mL), with a final M-digestion concentration of 1X. The samples were incubated at 65°C for a minimum of 2 hours. For bisulfite modification, 20µL of the supernatant from the sample extracts was bisulfite modified using the EZ-96 DNA Methylation-Direct Kit™ (ZymoResearch; Irvine, CA; cat# D5023) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. The bisulfite modified DNA samples were eluted using Melution buffer in 46µL. For Multiplex PCR, all bisulfite modified DNA samples were amplified using separate multiplex or simplex PCRs. PCRs included 0.5 units of HotStarTaq (Qiagen; Hilden, Germany; cat# 203205), 0.2µM primers, and 3µL of bisulfite-treated DNA in a 20µL reaction. All PCR products were verified using the Qiagen QIAxcel Advanced System (v1.0.6). Prior to library preparation, PCR products from the same sample were pooled and then purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit columns or plates (cat# 28106 or 28183). The PCR cycling conditions were: 95°C 15 min; 45 x (95°C 30s; Ta°C 30 s; 68°C 30 s); 68°C 5 min; 4°C ∞. Samples were run alongside established reference DNA samples with a range of methylation. They were created by mixing high- and low-methylated DNA to obtain samples with 0, 50, and 100% methylation. The high-methylated DNA was <italic>in vitro</italic> enzymatically methylated genomic DNA with &gt;85% methylation. The low-methylated DNA was chemically and enzymatically treated with &lt;5% methylation. They were first tested on numerous gene-specific and global methylation assays using pyrosequencing.</p>

<title>Methylation Sequencing</title>
<p>Libraries were prepared using a custom Library Preparation method created by EpigenDx. Next, library molecules were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter; Brea, CA; cat# A63882). Barcoded samples were then pooled in an equimolar fashion before template preparation and enrichment were performed on the Ion Chef™ system using Ion 520™ &amp; Ion 530™ ExT Chef reagents (Thermo Fisher; Waltham, MA; cat# A30670). Following this, enriched, template-positive library molecules were sequenced on the Ion S5™ sequencer using an Ion 530™ sequencing chip (cat# A27764). FASTQ files from the Ion Torrent S5 server were aligned to a local reference database using the open-source Bismark Bisulfite Read Mapper program (v0.12.2) with the Bowtie2 alignment algorithm (v2.2.3). Methylation levels were calculated in Bismark by dividing the number of methylated reads by the total number of reads. An R-squared value (RSQ) was previously calculated from controls set at known methylation levels to test for PCR bias.</p>

<title>T-cell Transfer Model of Inflammatory Bowel Disease</title>
<p>To induce autoimmune colitis, CD4 T cells were transferred into RAG-knockout mice (Jackson Laboratories #002216). Briefly, CD4 cells were isolated from wild-type C57BL/6 mice and cultured in a mixture of 50% cRPMI (RPMI+10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 1 % penicillin-streptomycin, and 0.1% 2-Mercaptoethanol) and 50% AIM-V media with plate bound anti-CD3 stimulation (3 ug/mL) and anti-CD28 stimulation (2 ug/mL) along with 10 ng/mL murine IL-2. Cells were stimulated for 3 days, rested for 2 days, and then restimulated for 2 days. 10 million activated cells were then transferred into each mouse via i.p. injection. At the same time, naïve CD4 cells were cultured under Treg polarizing conditions as described above and 1 million cells were transferred into each mouse at the same time as the injection of the activated cells. Weights were recorded weekly until euthanasia.</p>

<title>Quantification and Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software, Python, or R studio. Details of statistical analyses for each experiment and/or data set can be found in the figures and figure legends. When cumulative data was tabulated from multiple independent experiments, experimental groups from each independent experiment were normalized to a matched control condition to allow integration across experiments. In these cases, in which there is no variability among matched control values, statistical analysis was performed with a non-parametric test as outlined in standard statistical guidelines (doi: 10.1111/bph.14153).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work provides a new potential tool to manipulate Tregs function for therapeutic use. It focuses on the role of PGAM in Tregs differentiation and function. The authors, interrogating publicly available transcriptomic and proteomic data of human regulatory T cells and CD4 T cells, state that Tregs express higher levels of PGAM (at both message and protein levels) compared to CD4 T cells. They then inhibit PGAM by using a known inhibitor ECGC and show that this inhibition affects Tregs differentiation. This result was also observed when they used antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to knockdown PGAM1.</p>
<p>PGAM1 catalyzes the conversion of 3PG to 2PG in the glycolysis cascade. However, the authors focused their attention on the additional role of 3PG: acting as starting material for the de novo synthesis of serine.</p>
<p>They hypothesized that PGAM1 regulates Tregs differentiation by regulating the levels of 3PG that are available for de novo synthesis of serine, which has a negative impact on Tregs differentiation. Indeed, they tested whether the effect on Tregs differentiation observed by reducing PGAM1 levels was reverted by inhibiting the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of serine from 3PG.</p>
<p>The authors continued by testing whether both synthesized and exogenous serine affect Tregs differentiation and continued with in vivo experiments to examine the effects of dietary serine restriction on Tregs function.</p>
<p>In order to understand the mechanism by which serine impacts Tregs function, the authors assessed whether this depends on the contribution of serine to one-carbon metabolism and to DNA methylation.</p>
<p>The authors therefore propose that extracellular serine and serine whose synthesis is regulated by PGAM1 induce methylation of genes Tregs associated, downregulating their expression and overall impacting Tregs differentiation and suppressive functions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this paper is the number of approaches taken by the authors to verify their hypothesis. Indeed, by using both pharmacological and genetic tools in in vitro and in vivo systems they identified a potential new metabolic regulation of Tregs differentiation and function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Using publicly available transcriptomic and proteomic data of human T cells, the authors claim that both ex vivo and in vitro polarized Tregs express higher levels of PGAM1 protein compared to CD4 T cells (naïve or cultured under Th0 polarizing conditions). The experiments shown in this paper have all been carried out in murine Tregs. Publicly available resources for murine data (ImmGen -RNAseq and ImmPRes - Proteomics) however show that Tregs do not express higher PGAM1 (mRNA and protein) compared to CD4 T cells. It would be good to verify this in the system/condition used in the paper.</p>
<p>It would also be good to assess the levels of both PGAM1 mRNA and protein in Tregs PGAM1 knockdown compared to scramble using different methods e.g. qPCR and western blot. However, due to the high levels of cell death and differentiation variability, that would require cells to be sorted.</p>
<p>It is not specified anywhere in the paper whether cells were sorted for bulk experiments. Based on the variability of cell differentiation, it would be good if this was mentioned in the paper as it could help to interpret the data with a different perspective.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have tried to determine the regulatory role of Phosphoglycerate mutate (PGAM), an enzyme involved in converting 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate in glycolysis, in differentiation and suppressive function of regulatory CD4 T cells through de novo serine synthesis. This is done by contributing one carbon metabolism and eventually epigenetic regulation of Treg differentiation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have rigorously used inhibitors and antisense RNA to verify the contribution of these pathways in Treg differentiation in-vitro. This has also been verified in an in-vivo murine model of autoimmune colitis. This has further clinical implications in autoimmune disorders and cancer.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors have used inhibitors to study pathways involved in Treg differentiation. However, they have not studied the context of overexpression of PGAM, which was the actual reason to pursue this study.</p>
