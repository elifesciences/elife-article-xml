<title>Abstract</title><p>The success of an organism depends on the molecular and ecological adaptations that promote its beneficial fitness. Parasitoids are valuable biocontrol agents for successfully managing agricultural pests, and they have evolved diversified strategies to adapt to both the physiological condition of hosts and the competition of other parasitoids. Here, we deconstructed the parasitic strategies in a highly successful parasitoid, <italic>Trichopria drosophilae</italic>, which parasitizes a broad range of <italic>Drosophila</italic> hosts, including the globally invasive species <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. We found that <italic>T. drosophilae</italic> had developed specialized venom proteins that arrest host development to obtain more nutrients via secreting tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), as well as a unique type of cell— teratocytes—that digest host tissues for feeding by releasing trypsin proteins. In addition to the molecular adaptations that optimize nutritional uptake, this pupal parasitoid has evolved ecologically adaptive strategies including the conditional tolerance of intraspecific competition to enhance parasitic success in older hosts and the obligate avoidance of interspecific competition with larval parasitoids. Our study not only demystifies how parasitoids weaponize themselves to colonize formidable hosts but also provided empirical evidence of the intricate coordination between the molecular and ecological adaptations that drive evolutionary success.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is estimated that approximately 10% of insect species are parasitoids, with females typically depositing their eggs either in (endoparasitoids) or on (ectoparasitoids) the bodies of their hosts, leading to the consumption of the host by the parasitoid’s developing offspring (Eggleton et al., 1992; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Vinson and Iwantsch, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Charnov, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Harvey and Strand, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Pennacchio and Strand, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">van de Kamp et al., 2018</xref>). The antagonistic coevolution between parasitoids and hosts has spurred a vast array of adaptive and counter-adaptive strategies, in which the hosts have developed better immune responses and/or evasion behaviours to prevent parasitism; however, parasitoids have evolved diversified parasitic strategies to enable successful parasitism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Müller and Schmid-Hempel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kacsoh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Pang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Wertheim, 2022</xref>). This evolutionary arms race fosters a dynamic ecosystem characterized by either the emergence of strong resistance mechanisms in certain host species or the evolution of powerful parasitic strategies in certain parasitoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beckage and Gelman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Colinet et al., 2007</xref>; Wang et al., 2018b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gasmi et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>One example notable for strong resistance to parasitization is the spotted-wing fruit fly <italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic> (Diptera: Drosophilidae). This invasive species originated in Asia and has spread rapidly throughout the world over the last decade, with records in Europe (since 2008), North America (since 2008), South America (since 2013), and Africa (since 2017) (Depráet al., 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dos Santos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boughdad et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>D. suzukii</italic> attacks a broad spectrum of soft-skinned fruits and causes serious economic damage to fruit and wine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Rota-Stabelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Asplen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Knapp et al., 2021</xref>). Despite the broad interest in seeking natural enemies, the most well-recognized drosophilid parasitoids cannot parasitize <italic>D. suzukii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chabert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Poyet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lee et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>We conducted field investigations to identify natural parasitoids of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> from 2016 to 2020. We placed traps containing the favourite fruits of <italic>D. suzukii</italic> (e.g. banana pieces, cherries, and grapes) on <italic>Myrica rubra</italic> trees at several locations in East China (e.g. Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Taizhou), where <italic>D. suzukii</italic> is heavily distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Among the reclaimed parasitic wasps, we primarily characterized two species: <italic>Trichopria drosophilae</italic> (Td) (Hymenoptera: Diapriidae), which parasitizes <italic>D. suzukii</italic> pupae, and <italic>Asobara japonica</italic> (Aj) (Braconidae), which parasitizes larvae. Remarkably, we observed a constant proportion of Td in repeated traps, which attracted the most interest. The parasitic success of Td on <italic>D. suzukii</italic> has been documented in the USA and Europe independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Knoll et al., 2017</xref>; Wang et al., 2018a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Yi et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, Td provides a valuable model for studying the parasitic success in a pupal parasitoid and serves as a promising control agent on invasive pests. However, the mechanisms underlying the successful parasitization of Td remains largely unknown.</p>
<p>By conducting an interdisciplinary study that integrates multi-omics analyses and functional behavioural assays, we found that, to adapt to the limited resources of the pupal host, this parasitoid has evolved weaponized venom and teratocyte cells to help arrest host development and speed up the digestion of host tissues. In addition, Td allowed intraspecific competition as a conditional collaboration to compensate for its inability to find more appropriate hosts (the younger ones) but effectively avoided interspecific competition with larval parasitoids. The availability of multi-omics resources and knowledge of parasitism will further benefit the optimization and utilization of Td in pest management.</p>

<title>Td effectively parasitizes <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and a broad range of drosophilids</title>
<p>Both Td and Aj were trapped in the field and maintained in the laboratory for further study. Aj wasps mainly parasitize 2nd instar <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, showing a 60% parasitism rate (the proportion of hosts parasitized) and a 48% emergence rate (the proportion of hosts with wasps hatched) on <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. In comparison to Aj, Td laid eggs in the pupae (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and presented a much better parasitic performance on <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, showing an 85% parasitism rate (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and a 77% emergence rate (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B and C</xref>). To investigate the host range, we tested their parasitic efficiencies in another five <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, including three species in the melanogaster subgroup (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. simulans</italic>, and <italic>D. santomea</italic>) and two species outside the melanogaster subgroup (<italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> and <italic>D. virilis</italic>). Of these hosts, Td showed high parasitism rates in all species (ranging from 80% to 89%) and high emergence rates in most species (ranging from 73% to 79%), except in <italic>D. santomea</italic> (22%) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Aj could also parasitize these drosophilid species but showed much poorer performance in the non-melanogaster subgroup (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The parasitism spectrum in the laboratory showed that Td is also a generalist parasitoid with a wide host range, including <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and many other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species.</p>

<title>Td shows a relatively large genome and encodes many copies of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (<italic>Timp</italic>) genes</title>
<p>Genomic information is critical to characterize the molecular bases underlying parasitic strategies, which is absent for Td. We first sequenced and <italic>de novo</italic> assembled Td reference genome based on PacBio long reads (120.1 Gb). The assembled 938.6 Mb genome consisted of 1633 contigs with an N50 size of 146.9 Mb (Supplementary Table S1). BUSCO estimation showed a high level of completeness (96%) in terms of insect proteins (Supplementary Table S1). By combining 143.7 Gb Hi-C data, 97.8% of assembled contigs were further anchored to six pseudochromosomes, agreeing with the karyotype staining estimation (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p>
<p>The assembled Td genome (938.6 Mb) represents an occasionally large one in parasitoids, since most published parasitoid and hymenopteran genomes were relatively small (&lt; 500 Mb) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Parasitic lifestyle was previously assumed to be associated with reduced genome size and complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Moran, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Wicke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Poulin and Randhawa, 2015</xref>). While this study was in preparation, Ye <italic>et al</italic>. reported two large genomes (∼950 Mb) of <italic>Anastatus</italic> parasitoids (Chalcidoidae) and proposed that the unexpected genome expansion was due to recent bursts of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons. Similarly, we found recent bursts of transposon elements (TEs) in Td genome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), although a different class of TEs (DNA transposons, rather than LTRs) was the most abundant (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). We further found that the age of the TE burst and the abundance of different classes both highly varied across parasitoid genomes, regardless of the whole genome size (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, Figure 1—figure supplement 2). The previous study has also proposed that the expanded genome of <italic>Anastatus</italic> is stabilized owing to the expansion of the <italic>Piwi</italic> gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Ye et al., 2022</xref>); however, Td genome only encodes three <italic>Piwi</italic> genes, which is similar to most other Hymenoptera species but much lower than those of <italic>Anastatus</italic> (16 and 30 genes). These patterns suggest that the mechanisms to maintain the stability of genome size may vary between species and that the highly dynamic evolution of repeat contents has shaped great diversity across parasitoid genomes.</p>
<p>By combining <italic>ab initio</italic> gene signatures, transcriptome evidence, and homologue alignments, we generated an official gene set consisting of 16,287 protein-coding genes for Td (Supplementary Table S1; Methods). We used one-to-one orthologous protein genes to infer phylogenetic relationships across representative parasitoids. In Hymenoptera, parasitoidism evolved and underwent massive habitat diversification, including scattered secondary losses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Peters et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blaimer et al., 2023</xref>; Polaszek et al., 2023). Adaptations to a certain host life stage, i.e. eggs, larvae, or pupae, evolved independently in different sublineages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Td was placed as a sister sublineage to a large group of chalcid parasitoids with a divergence time of approximately 98 million years ago (Mya) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Its divergence from <italic>Leptopilina</italic>, another major genus of drosophilid parasitoids (Cynipoidea), dates back 120 Mya (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Orthologue analysis showed that half of each parasitoid gene set consisted of universal genes across species (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Interestingly, approximately 83% of universal genes in Td experienced gene duplication events. By sorting all the expanded gene families within and between species, we found that the gene family encoding tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs; IPR001820) was an extreme outlier (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, Supplementary Table S2). Td genome encodes 29 <italic>Timp</italic> genes, much more than that of any other hymenopteran species (0-7 genes). These copies were located in 10 neighbouring regions of all Td chromosomes and formed three phylogenetic clades unique to Td, indicating multiple recent duplications (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Expression profiling of <italic>Timps</italic> showed widespread expression in most copies except for a unique sublineage that showed specialized expression in the venom glands (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). These two copies (termed TdTimp1 and TdTimp2) are described below.</p>

<title>Td arrests host development via injection of venom</title>
<p>High-quality, fully annotated genomic resources allowed us to explore the molecular architecture of various adaptive traits of Td. Td is a typical pupal parasitoid that lays eggs exclusively in the pupal stage of hosts; adult wasps emerge from the host pupae after approximately 18 days at 25 °C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The pupal stage of the hosts is a non-feeding stage that normally lasts no longer than 5 days for <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> at 25 °C. Thus, pupal parasitoid wasps should have evolved unique strategies to utilize limited nutritional resources effectively during a limited period. One such adaptation is the consequent developmental arrest of the host, which is commonly observed in parasitized hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Rivers and Denlinger, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beckage and Gelman, 2004</xref>). We monitored this process in real-time at 24-hour intervals after parasitization of 1-day-old host pupae of <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. Compared to non-parasitized pupae, parasitized pupae showed evident defects in eye pigment deposition and bristle formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A), strongly indicative of developmental arrest. These phenotypic alterations started to occur on the second day post-parasitization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A), indicating that the development of the host pupae was immediately stopped after parasitization. We also performed parasitization experiments on another host species, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, for parallel comparisons and in-depth functional genetic investigations. Here, a similar pattern of developmental arrest was observed when <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> pupae were provided for parasitization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>— figure supplement 1B).</p>

<p>The most likely effector resulting in host development arrest is the venom, given that parasitoid wasps always inject venom into hosts along with oviposition to condition and manipulate the host for the successful development of wasp progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Werren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Asgari and Rivers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Moreau and Asgari, 2015</xref>). To test this hypothesis, the venom fluid from the reservoir of a single Td female was isolated and injected into 1-day host pupae under two levels of dilution (1:20 and 1:40) to monitor host development (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). As expected, doses 1:20 and 1:40 markedly delayed the development of both host species in comparison to the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B and C</xref>, Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Moreover, the alternating effects of a higher dose of venom (1:20 dilution) were very similar to those parasitized by Td and stronger than those of the lower dose (1:40 dilution). Thus, our results suggest that Td may arrest host development via the coinjection of venom.</p>

<title>Timps are the main venom compounds responsible for host development arrest</title>
<p>To uncover the venom components that confer host developmental arrest, we sequenced the transcriptome of Td venom glands (VGs) and characterized 641 genes with solid expression evidence (Supplementary Table S3). Given that not all expressed genes are necessarily translated and secreted into the reservoir, we performed LC‒MS/MS on Td venom to further characterize reliable venom proteins (VPs) (Supplementary Table S3). Of the 27 highly expressed (Z test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) VPs with known functions, a pair of <italic>Timp</italic> genes with the highest expression values attracted the most attention. Surprisingly, these two Timp genes were the previously highlighted <italic>Timp1</italic> and <italic>Timp2</italic> genes that showed expression specialization of venoms from the massive expansion in Td genome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>In insects, matrix metalloproteinases (Mmps) regulate pupal development by degrading extracellular matrix proteins, and Timp delays pupal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jia and Li, 2023</xref>). Thus, we wondered whether Td uses these specialized Timps to arrest host development. To test this hypothesis, we mimicked Td parasitization by applying a modified UAS/GAL4 system to drive spatiotemporally specific expression of exogenous <italic>Timp</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupae (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). As expected, the development of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> pupae was markedly delayed upon the expression of <italic>DmTimp</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and 3). Although ectopic expression of either <italic>TdTimp1</italic> or <italic>TdTimp2</italic> did not lead to a visible developmental delay, driving the expression of both <italic>TdTimp1</italic> and <italic>TdTimp2</italic> arrested the development of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> as effectively as the expression of <italic>DmTimp</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and 3). Taken together, these results suggest that cocktails of TdTimp1 and TdTimp2 are bioactive compounds of the venom that result in host development arrest.</p>

<title>Td releases teratocytes to dissociate host tissues</title>
<p>Parasitized wasp larvae feed largely on host fluids for development. We found that as host development was arrested, Td simultaneously released a special group of cells into the host haemocoel along with egg hatching (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Approximately 100 cells were secreted into the host haemocoel after larval hatching (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). The cell number remained constant during the first three days, then decreased drastically, and finally vanished on day 8 (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A); that is, these cells no longer divided after being released. Moreover, these cells rapidly grew, with initially 85 ±13 µm in diameter and up to approximately 249 ±57 µm before vanishment (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B and C). These characteristics agree with those of teratocytes found in other parasitoid sublineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hotta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Pedata et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Firlej et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, we defined these cells as teratocytes, which is the first discovery of teratocytes in the family Diapriidae. Transmission electron microscopy of Td teratocytes revealed a dense lawn of microvilli on the cell surface and that each cell consisted of a spherical nucleus, substantial amounts of rough endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). These features indicate high levels of protein synthesis and secretory activity in Td teratocytes.</p>

<p>We observed that host tissues started to be digested after the teratocytes were released into the host haemocoel. Do the teratocytes confer the digestion process? We tested this hypothesis by coculturing Td teratocytes and host tissues <italic>in vitro</italic>. Td teratocytes were purified from parasitized hosts and cultured with representative <italic>D. suzukii</italic> tissues, including the brain, testes, and ovaries, in Schneider’s medium. Compared with the control, which was maintained for 30 hours without digestion, host tissues incubated with teratocytes from a single parasitoid were partially digested at 12 hours and fully digested after 30 hours (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). These findings suggest that teratocytes facilitate the effective dissociation of host tissues, which may play a key role in nutritional exploitation for parasitoid larvae development.</p>

<title>Teratocytes digest host tissues via trypsins</title>
<p>Although teratocytes have been reported in several other species, their molecular composition remains largely unknown in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Burke and Strand, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Strand, 2014</xref>). We further conducted transcriptomic profiling to characterize the teratocyte genes that facilitate host tissue digestion. A total of 3784 genes were expressed in teratocytes (Supplementary Table S4). The majority of the 129 genes with significantly high expression (Z-test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were ribosome-(48 genes) and digestion-related genes (23 genes) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Eight trypsin genes dominated among the highly expressed digestion-related genes in teratocytes, indicating their essential role in digesting host tissues.</p>
<p>Trypsin is the most abundant proteinase in invertebrate digestive systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Muhlia-Almazán et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dias et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Shao et al., 2021</xref>). To verify their functions in parasitization, trypsin inhibitors (TLCK and TPCK) were added to the incubation system of teratocytes and host tissues (<italic>D. suzukii</italic> testes) to determine whether digestion could be prevented. Along with the increase in inhibitor concentration, we found that the digestion of host tissues was gradually inhibited (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, Figure 4—figure supplement 3, Figure 4—figure supplement 4A and B). We then injected trypsin inhibitors directly into the parasitized host pupae to investigate whether this digestion process benefits parasitization. As expected, applying a trypsin inhibitor resulted in significantly lower emergence rates of parasitoid wasps, especially upon the injection of higher amounts of inhibitors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, Figure 4—figure supplement 4C). Correspondingly, we noticed that the trypsin inhibitor injection led to abnormal wasp larvae development. Upon injection of 400 ng TLCK per host, the parasitoid larvae were found to be significantly smaller than the control on day 4 and almost dead on day 6 post-parasitization, owing to the lack of well-digested food (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, Figure 4—figure supplement 5). Altogether, these results suggest that teratocytes degrade host tissues using digestive enzymes, such as trypsin, to provide essential nutrients for the development and survival of wasps. Other digestion-related enzymes may also contribute to host tissue digestion, although their functions deserve further investigation.</p>

<title>Td benefits from parasitizing young host pupae but cannot discriminate between young and old hosts</title>
<p>We showed that Td had evolved the functional integration of arresting host development and digesting host tissues to facilitate the utilization of limited resources in host pupae. In drosophilids, larval structures are lysed during the early pupal period, and adult structures begin to develop during the late period. Thus, Td should parasitize younger host pupae to earn longer developmental times and better nutritional resources. Indeed, the respective functions of venom and teratocytes were tested with the prerequisite of parasitization on newly pupated hosts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). By testing the parasitism efficiency in host pupae of different ages (1-to 4-day-old <italic>D. suzukii</italic> or <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>), we found that Td fed old host pupae (4-day-old) showed a dramatic reduction in both parasitism rate and wasp emergence rate (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A and B</xref>, Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B). Simultaneously, both male and female wasps that emerged from young hosts (1-day-old) exhibited larger body sizes than those that emerged from old pupae (Student’s t-test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). For parasitoids, successful parasitism largely depends on the development of ovaries and VGs in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Segoli and Rosenheim, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Moreau and Asgari, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huang et al., 2021</xref>).

<p>The next compelling question was whether Td wasps could recognize host pupae of different ages before parasitization and subsequently prefer to parasitize younger pupae for maximum fitness. Thus, we designed a two-choice oviposition assay and monitored the host selection preferences of Td wasps (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Specifically, 20 young hosts (1-day-old <italic>D. suzukii</italic> or <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> pupae) were attached to the left side of a container, whereas pupae of different ages (1-to 4-day-old) were attached to the right side for competition. Ten Td female wasps (3-day-old) were released into the bottle and allowed to choose the host for oviposition freely (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). After a certain time (2 or 4 hours for oviposition choice), the number of eggs laid in the host pupae between the two sides was compared to determine the oviposition preference. Regardless of whether the choice lasted for 2 or 4 hours, Td wasps showed no significant preference for either young or old host pupae (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, Figure 5—figure supplement 1F). These results indicate that Td wasps have not evolved the ability to discriminate the young host pupae as a priority for parasitization.</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>Superparasitism enhances parasitic success in older hosts</title>
<p>The parasitic success of Td largely relies on locating a young host; however, Td does not have the ability to discriminate between young and old hosts. Whether Td has evolved any adaptive strategies to compensate for this disadvantage? We noted that more than one female wasp parasitized the same host in both the laboratory and field (Figure 5—figure supplement 2), leading us to speculate that unexpected superparasitic behaviour (laying more than one egg per host) might be allowed or adaptive in Td. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the parasitic efficiency of hosts with multiple infections. Strikingly, both the parasitism and emergence rates were significantly improved by superparasitism (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A and B</xref>). The resulting benefit was particularly evident in parasitizing old pupae (4-day-old), in which low parasitic efficiencies by monoparasitism were recovered 2.2-fold (parasitism rate) and 3.2-fold (emergence rate) by superparasitism (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A and B</xref>).</p>
<p>Superparasitism is generally uncommon in solitary parasitoids because only one adult can emerge from the host. Despite the better parasitization performance, we noted that only one adult Td emerged from the superparasitized pupae. Superparasitism likely leads to the additional introduction of venom and teratocytes, which maximizes the utilization of host nutrition, especially in older hosts with poorer resources. Therefore, superparasitism in Td may partially compensate for the inability to recognize young pupae as hosts.</p>

<title>Td avoids interspecific competition with larval parasitoids</title>
<p>Approximately 50 parasitoids have been reported to attack drosophilids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Carton et al., 1986</xref>), including larval (e.g. Aj) and pupal parasitoids (e.g. Td). This overlapping ecological niche leads to potential interspecific competition between larval and pupal parasitoids within the same host range. Because Td allows conditional intraspecific competition, the next compelling question would be whether Td allows interspecific competition with larval parasitoids. We provided Td with <italic>D. suzukii</italic> or <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> pupae that had been parasitized by Aj at the larval stage (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We found that Td wasps used their ovipositors to sting Aj-parasitized host pupae, similar to what they did for non-parasitized pupae. However, almost no eggs were laid inside these Aj-parasitized Td-stung pupae, in contrast to the high oviposition rate (approximately 93% for both <italic>Drosophila</italic> hosts) of non-Aj-parasitized pupae (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).

<p>Given that Td wasps use ovipositors to sting both parasitized and non-parasitized pupae before oviposition, we hypothesised that Td ovipositors, in addition to the well-defined function of oviposition, might serve as sensory organs to evaluate the status of host pupae. Td ovipositor is an anatomical and functional cluster consisting of an ovipositor sheath and ovipositor stylet (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), of which the unsheathed stylet is more likely to probe and stab. Using scanning electron microscopy, we found that the ovipositor stylet had two types of sensilla on its dorsal and ventral valves: the surface-dome and the coeloconic sensilla (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>–<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6I</xref>). Coeloconic sensilla was the most abundant type, and secretory pores and surface-dome sensilla were also found on Td ovipositor stylets (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>–<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6I</xref>). These sensilla and secretory pores occurred on the distal end of the ovipositor stylet but not on the proximal end, and there were more sensilla and secretory pores on the dorsal valve than on the ventral valve (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>–<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). These anatomical features support a possible role of the ovipositor stylet in host discrimination.</p>
<p>We sequenced the transcriptome of the ovipositors and made a comprehensive comparison with various Td tissues and organs. Based on the overall expression profiles, principal component analysis placed the ovipositor closer to the antennae and legs of both males and females (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J</xref>), indicating a strong functional correlation among these anatomically non-contact organs. Given that the antennae and legs are well-defined sensory organs for volatile and contact semiochemicals in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Vosshall et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Schütz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Scott et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kim et al., 2003</xref>), respectively, the expression correlation supports the role of oviposition in sensing host environmental signals. By further comparing the expression profiles of ovipositors and female antennae, we found that three chemosensory protein genes (CSPs) and two odourant-binding protein genes (OBPs) showed extremely high expression in both tissues, as well as a few genes encoding gustatory receptors (GRs) and olfactory receptors (ORs) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6K</xref>). More interestingly, the general co-receptor, Orco, which forms heteromultimeric complexes with other ligand-selective ORs, does not express in the ovipositor (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) and most genes related to odourant reception (i.e., OBPs and other ORs) showed biased expression in the antennae, while most taste recognition-related genes, i.e., GRs and CSPs, were more highly expressed in the ovipositor (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6K</xref>). Correspondingly, we found a few GRs with the highest expression in ovipositors (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, Supplementary Table S5). These patterns further support the hypothesis that, unlike the antennae that confer odourant chemoreception, Td ovipositors are more likely to serve as taste organs by sensing contact signals inside the host pupae for host discrimination. How gustation regulates the senses of other parasitoids requires further investigation.</p>

<title>Td has evolved an integrated molecular adaptation for nutrition utilization</title>
<p>Parasitoid wasps are a highly diverse group of insects that are renowned for their diverse life history strategies and co-evolution with their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Pennacchio and Strand, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">van de Kamp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Ode et al., 2022</xref>). Many koinobiont parasitoids that attack early host periods (e.g. larvae) maintain hosts alive and growing for sustained resource availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brodeur and Boivin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Pennacchio and Strand, 2006</xref>), while certain idiobiont parasitoids that usually attack non-feeding host stages (e.g. pupae) alternatively arrests host development for high-quality resources. <italic>Drosophila</italic> are natural hosts for multiple parasitic wasps of different genera, including both larval and pupal parasitoids. Their parasitic strategies have been widely studied and reported in multiple parasitoid species, with a particular focus on venom evolution and behavioural adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mortimer et al., 2013</xref>; Martinson et al., 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ramroop et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Wertheim, 2022</xref>). How to conflict with host immune responses and manipulate the host to create a suitable environment are important for larval parasitoids because the hosts are relatively active and proficient in immunity during the larval stage. For example, previous studies have shown that immune suppressors and virulence proteins dominate the VPs of <italic>Leptopilina</italic> larval parasitoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Colinet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Colinet et al., 2013</xref>; Poirié et al., 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Heavner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huang et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Td is a highly successful pupal parasitoid colonizing a broad range of <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, including <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. In the present study, we demonstrated the molecular adaptation of Td to achieve parasitic success (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Td uses venom to arrest host pupal development and maintain young status via the recruitment of <italic>Timps</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, Td released a special type of cell along with egg hatching, teratocytes, to accelerate the digestion of host tissues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The functional integration benefits Td as the utilization of nutritional resources is highly efficient during a limited period. The adaptations adopted by pupal parasitoids are largely unique to those of larval parasitoids and highly associated with the non-feeding and relatively inactive conditions of pupae. Correspondingly, few characterized genes of these parasitic effectors were related to immune responses (Supplementary File Tables S3 and S4), indicating that conflict with host immunity plays a minor role in the adaptation of pupal parasitoids.</p>

<caption><title>Proposed model of the molecular and ecological adaptions underlying the parasitic success in Td.</title><p>Td is a solitary parasitoid that presents high levels of pupal parasitism to <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, including <italic>D. suzukii</italic>. Td allows intraspecific superparatism to increase the success of wasp emergence from hosts with the help of two weapons. Specifically, two Timp VPs trigger the development arrest of <italic>Drosophila</italic> hosts, eventually leading to the maintenance of the hosts at a younger status, whereas trypsins in teratocytes contribute to the digestion of host tissues, providing suitable nutritional resources for the wasp larvae. Moreover, Td avoids interspecific competition with larval parasitoid species to extend their parasitic efficacy and mostly depends on chemoreception on the ovipositor.</p></caption>

<p>Another genus of pupal parasitoids, <italic>Nasonia</italic>, that feeds on multiple fly species but not drosophilid flies, has been the subject of genetic, ecological, developmental, and behavioural research for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Beukeboom and Desplan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Werren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Werren et al., 2010</xref>), but it serves as a model for specialized investigations of pupal parasitization. Notably, many strategies uncovered in this study have not been described in <italic>Nasonia</italic>, which may advance our understanding of the parasitism of pupae and the utilization of Td as a unique system for studying ecological niche differentiation of parasitoids.</p>

<title>Gene duplication and expression shift play a dominant role in Td functional adaptations</title>
<p>Parasitic effects on organs and tissues provide excellent systems for studying the evolutionary modes of novel genes. Although it was proposed that the co-option of single-copy genes plays a common role in recruiting venom genes in certain parasitoids, such as <italic>Nasonia</italic> (Martinson et al., 2017), specific cases have also been reported highlighting gene duplication events, including duplicated <italic>Lar</italic> in the venom of a generalist <italic>L. heterotoma</italic> that suppresses host immune responses and the massive expansion of <italic>Warm</italic> in <italic>L. boulardi</italic>, which helps the specialist parasitoid evade host immune attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huang et al., 2021</xref>). These differences suggest a highly diverse evolutionary mode of parasitism across different genera. In this study, we characterized Timps as a major compound in the venom that confers host developmental arrest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), trypsin as a major component in teratocytes that facilitates host digestion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), and a set of chemoreception proteins recruited by ovipositors for taste recognition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Strikingly, all affected genes were found to have undergone massive duplication events.</p>
<p>As described in the genome-wide analysis, <italic>Timp</italic> was the most expanded gene family in Td genome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). By searching for Timps across insects, we found that this gene family was mainly present in holometabolous insects such as Diptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Hymenoptera (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), possibly because of its role in regulating metamorphosis in this class of insects. The massive expansion of <italic>Timps</italic> in Td was derived from three independent phylogenetic sublineages, including one clustered with other hymenopteran copies, one clustered with patchy copies inside the clade of other insect orders, and one that is relatively unique (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The third sublineage is of the most expansion, in which most components were located on chromosome 6 and showed widespread expression across most tissues and developmental stages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B and D</xref>). The two VP genes (<italic>TdTimp1</italic> and <italic>TdTimp2</italic>) that confer host development arrest were derived from tandem duplication of this sublineage and further experienced expression specialization in venom. We noted another four copies of this sublineage that possibly translocated to other chromosomes, showing expression specialization in larvae and teratocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B and D</xref>). Similarly, we found that a few GRs originated from tandem duplications and experienced an expression shift to the ovipositor (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, we propose that gene expression, followed by gene expansion, may play a common role in the unique functional adaptations of Td.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Td allows intraspecific competition but refuses interspecific competition from larval parasitoids</title>
<p>Parasitoid wasps are also excellent systems for studying the complex interrelationships within an ecosystem, because their survival and reproduction depend highly on the limited nutrients within a single host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Ode et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to molecular adaptations, we uncovered ecological adaptations underlying Td parasitism, including the conditional allowance of intraspecific competition and strict refusal of interspecific competition (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
<p>Superparasitism usually lowers the reproductive efficiency of parasitoids by affecting their development, resulting in premature mortality of both hosts and parasitoids. Many parasitoid species avoid superparasitism by refusing to lay eggs in their parasitized hosts. For instance, the larval parasitoid <italic>L. boulardi</italic> utilizes EsGAP VPs to trigger parasitized hosts’ escape behaviour, resulting in avoiding superparasitism (Chen et al., 2022). However, superparasitism is conditionally allowed if it benefits parasitoids. Despite the evolved molecular adaptations, we found that Td’s parasitic success largely depended on its location to a host pupa of the appropriate age (newly pupated) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>–<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). However, the ability to discriminate young pupae is unavailable in Td (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Superparasitism was frequently observed in Td and was further verified by its role in improving parasitic efficiency in old hosts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A and B</xref>) despite the emergence of only one parasitoid. We hypothesized that the additional introduction of venom and teratocytes by partners within a single host pupa might accelerate the nutritional utilization of pupal parasitoids. Thus, intraspecific competition partially serves as a collaboration that can maximize the survival rate of offspring and favour the population at the cost of individuals.</p>
<p>Interspecific competition is widespread in the highly overlapped ecological niches among parasitoids. Approximately 50 hymenopteran parasitoids have been reported to infect various <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Carton et al., 1986</xref>), including larval parasitoids from Figitidae (e.g., <italic>Leptopilina</italic>) and Braconidae (e.g., Aj) as well as pupal parasitoids from Pteromalidae and Diapriidae (e.g., Td). Except for Pteromalidae parasitoids, most are highly specialized in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Importantly, larval parasitoids have priority in occupying hosts, imposing strong selection pressure on pupal parasitoids to locate hosts. Unlike intraspecific competition, Td strictly avoided interspecific competition with larval parasitoids. Our results showed that Td effectively recognized and refused to lay eggs in Aj-parasitized hosts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, this ability possibly depended on the evolved sensilla on the ovipositor stylet of Td, along with the ability for host discrimination via taste recognition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). These uncovered ecological adaptations of Td provide valuable empirical knowledge regarding how organisms deal with inter– and intraspecific competition in nature and how ecological adaptations reconcile with functional innovations.</p>

<title>Insights into the utilization of parasitoids as agents of pest control</title>
<p>In addition to serving as a study system in biology and ecology, parasitoids have been widely used as biological control agents because of their environmental friendliness and ability to suppress pest populations substantially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Smith, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beckage and Gelman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Our study began with identifying a highly successful parasitoid on <italic>D. suzukii</italic> and a broad range of other drosophilids. Although a few larval parasitoid species in Asia, such as Aj, have been reported to successfully parasitize <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, other parasitoids either do not prefer <italic>D. suzukii</italic> or show poor parasitic efficiency on <italic>D. suzukii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chabert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mazzetto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kremmer et al., 2017</xref>). We estimated that the parasitic efficiency of Aj in <italic>D. suzukii</italic> in this study was approximately 50% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B and C</xref>). In contrast, the great parasitic performance of Td on <italic>D. suzukii</italic> has been observed in this study, indicating the prospective potential of Td utility in the biological control of <italic>D. suzukii.</italic> The molecular and ecological adaptations of Td will provide important knowledge for further improving this potential agent.</p>

For PacBio sequencing, DNA was extracted from a pool of ∼1000 male Td adults of a monoisolate to meet the requirements for library construction using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany). DNA quality was checked using gel electrophoresis (0.8% agarose gel) and a High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent, USA) in combination with a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, USA). A 20-Kb genomic library was constructed and sequenced by Berry Genomics Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) according to the standard protocols on a PacBio Sequel platform. A total of 120.1 Gb raw reads were generated, accounting for 128x genome coverage.

The predicted genes were then annotated with functions based on both BLASTP v2.2.26 against NR databases and a local InterProScan search (v5.38-76.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jones et al., 2014</xref>) for domains. Expression values of each gene in each developmental stage or tissue were estimated as TPM using salmon v0.12.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Patro et al., 2017</xref>) with parameters of “quant –l A”. The expression of a specific gene in a given sample was determined based on the threshold value of N99, i.e. the value accounting for 99% of summarized transcripts in the corresponding sample.</p>

<title>Venom preparation and microinjection</title>
<p>The venom reservoirs of Td female wasps aged 3 to 5 days were dissected in Ringer’s saline solution on an ice plate under a stereoscope (Leica, Germany). The venom reservoirs were washed at least 3 times in Ringer’s buffer and placed into a 500 μl screw-top tube. The tube was then mixed with grinding glass beads with a size of 0.5 mm (Tansoole, China) and shaken on a vortex mixer six times for 10 s each time. After centrifugation at 10000 ×g at 4 °C for 5 min, the supernatant (venom fluid) was collected and quantified with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Invitrogen, USA). Approximately 1: 20 (16.2 ng) or 1: 40 (8.1 ng) amounts of the total venom extract derived from a single female wasp were injected into each <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. suzukii</italic> host pupa using the Eppendorf FemtoJet 4i device with the following parameters: injection pressure = 900 hPa; injection time = 0.15 s.</p>

<title>Identification of Td venom proteins</title>
<p>For LC‒MS/MS experiments, venom fluid from approximately 2000 Td female wasps aged 3 to 5 days was dissolved in 100 μl SDT lysis buffer (4% SDS, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.6). The sample was boiled for 15 min and then centrifuged at 13,000 ×g at 4 °C for 40 min. The detergent and DTT were removed with repeated ultrafiltration (Microcon units) using UA buffer (8 M urea, 150 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Then 100 μl 50 mM iodoacetamide was added to block reduced cysteine residues, and the samples were incubated for 30 min in the dark. Then, the protein suspensions were digested with 3 μg trypsin (Promega, USA) in 40 μl 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO3 buffer overnight at 37 °C, and the resulting peptides were desalted on C18 cartridges (Sigma, Germany), concentrated by vacuum centrifugation, and reconstituted in 40 μL of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid solution.</p>
<p>LC‒MS/MS analysis was performed on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) coupled to an Easy nLC HPLC liquid system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Briefly, 5 μg of the peptide mixture was loaded onto a reverse-phase trap column (Thermo Fisher Scientific Acclaim PepMap 100, 100 μm × 2 cm, nanoViper C18) connected to the C18 reversed-phase analytical column (Thermo Fisher Scientific Easy Column, 10-cm long, 75-μm inner diameter, 3 μm resin) in buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and separated with a linear gradient of buffer B (84% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The eluted peptides were ionized, and the full MS spectrum (from m/z 300 to 1800) was acquired by precursor ion scan using the Orbitrap analyser with a resolution of r = 70,000 at m/z 200, followed by 20 MS/MS events in the Orbitrap analyser with a resolution of r = 17,500 at m/z 200. The MS raw files were translated into mgf files and searched against the transcriptome of Td venom gland using Mascot 2.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Perkins et al., 1999</xref>). MS/MS tolerance was set at 20 ppm, and trypsin was defined as the cleavage enzyme allowing no more than two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine was specified as a variable modification.</p>
<p>Venom-protein genes were finally defined based on both transcriptomic and proteomic evidence as described above. Genes with TPM higher than 16.55 (N99 value) in the venom were defined as venom gland-expressed genes. VG-expressed genes that could be fully aligned to at least three proteomic peptides were defined as venom proteins (Supplementary Table S3). A Z test was performed to define significantly high expression (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>

(<bold>B</bold>) Chromosome staining of female Td diploid chromosome sets (2n = 12). Scale bars: 10 μm. (<bold>C</bold>) The heatmap of Hi-C all-by-all interaction among 6 chromosomes of Td. The y axis refers each chromosome. The x axis refers every chromosome with assembly scaffold length. The frequency of Hi-C interaction links is represented by the color, which ranges from white (low) to red (high). The map indicates that intrachromosomeinteractions (red blocks in the diagonal) were stronger than interchromosome interactions (white blocks). (<bold>D</bold>) Correlation between estimated chromosome sizes (in Mb) based on karyotype images and assembled scaffolds. The values on Y-axis indicate the estimated karyotype size of a chromosome, which is calculated based on collected the chromosome size and the length of chromosome in karyotype images of closely related species (<italic>Aphelinus varipes</italic>). Then we used them as a reference to obtain the estimated karyotype chromosome sizes basing on the length of chromosomes in the karyotype images of Td. Each dot indicates a single chromosome. The correlation coefficient is 0.99926, indicating near good correlation between chromosomal scaffold length and karyotypically determined chromosome length.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Major findings or outcomes include a genome for the wasp, characterization of the venom constituents and teratocyte and ovipositor expression profiles, as well as information about Trichopria ecology and parasitism strategies. It was found that Trichopria cannot discriminate among hosts by age, but can identify previously parasitized hosts. The authors also investigated whether superparasitism by Trichopria wasps improved parasitism outcomes (it did), presumably by increasing venom and teratocyte concentrations/densities. Elegant use of Drosophila ectopic expression tools allowed for functional characterization of venom components (Timps), and showed that these proteins are responsible for parasitoid-induced delays in host development. After finding that teratocytes produce a large number of proteases, experiments showed that these contribute to digestion of host tissues for parasite consumption.</p>
<p>
The discussion ties these elements together by suggesting that genes used for aiding in parasitism via different parts of the parasitism arsenal arise from gene duplication and shifts in tissue of expression (to venom glands or teratocytes).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this manuscript is that it describes the parasitism strategies used by Trichopria wasps at a molecular and behavioral level with broad strokes. It represents a large amount of work that in previous decades might have been published in several different papers. Including all of these data in a manuscript together makes for a comprehensive and interesting study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The weakness is that the breadth of the study results in fairly shallow mechanistic or functional results for any given facet of Trichopria's biology. Although none of the findings are especially novel given results from other parasitoid species in previous publications, integrating results together provides significant information about Trichopria biology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Key findings of this research include the sequencing of the wasp's genome, identification of venom constituents and teratocytes, and examination of Trichopria drosophilae (Td)'s ecology and parasitic strategies. It was observed that Td doesn't distinguish between hosts based on age but can recognize previously parasitized hosts. The study also explored whether multiple parasitisms by Td improved outcomes, which indeed it did, possibly by increasing venom and teratocyte levels. Utilizing Drosophila ectopic expression tools, the authors functionally characterized venom components, specifically tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (Timps), which were found to cause delays in host development. Additionally, experiments revealed that teratocytes produce numerous proteases, aiding in the digestion of host tissues for parasite consumption. The discussion suggests that genes involved in different aspects of parasitism may arise from gene duplication and shifts in tissue expression to venom glands or teratocytes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript provides an in-depth and detailed depiction of the parasitic strategies employed by Td wasps, spanning both molecular and behavioral aspects. It consolidates a significant amount of research that, in the past, might have been distributed across multiple papers. By presenting all this data in a single manuscript, it delivers a comprehensive and engaging study that could help future developments in the field of biological control against a major insect pest.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While none of the findings are particularly groundbreaking, as similar results have been reported for other parasitoid species in prior research, the integration of these results into one comprehensive overview offers valuable biological insights into an interesting new potential biocontrol species.</p>

<p>No additional comments</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>Line 68 : would be better to spell out the name of the genus at first mention of the species</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It has been corrected as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lines 90-92 : This statement does to coincide with the figure. Could you please explain this better?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have carefully checked the statement and the corresponding figure panels, but failed to find the disparity between them. Perhaps, the similar and neighboring labels of Dsuz and Dsan might cause confusion of the emergence rates. To further avoid this potential, we have modified fig.1b and 1c by highlighting the focal host Dsuz.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lines 124: could you tell the mention of these genes (Piwi) is important in this context, particularly, for non- full-on experts in this field?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A previous study has revealed the relationship between the expansion of piwi and large genome, we meant to report a different pattern in our focal genome. We understand your confusion might be caused by the inserted statement regarding the repeat that separated them. Thus, we have moved the citation of previous finding to the place immediately precedent to the conclusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 233: &quot;...composition remains largely unknown..&quot; for Td or in general? Not clear..</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. To make it clear, we have modified this sentence as “Although teratocytes have been reported in several other parasitoids, their molecular composition remains largely unknown in general”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 286: &quot;at a certain time&quot;.. confusing, please rephrase.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have rephrased it as “After a certain time (2 or 4 hours for oviposition choice)”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 293-294: I find this sentence quite hard to follow. Could you please rephrase it and/or expand this concept to make it clearer?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified this sentence as “The parasitic success of Td largely relies on locating a young host; however, Td does not have the ability to discriminate between young and old hosts. Whether Td has evolved any adaptive strategies to compensate for this disadvantage?”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 314: &quot;it would be interesting&quot;.. this is too weak of an argument. Please corroborate your motivation more soundly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have changed this statement as “Because Td allows conditional intraspecific competition, the next compelling question would be whether Td allows interspecific competition with larval parasitoids.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 391: Divergent evolution is too of a big word in this context. I would tune it down to something like: &quot;Studying ecological niche differentiation &quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. It has been corrected as suggested.</p>
