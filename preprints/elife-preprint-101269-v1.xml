<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Pain after surgery causes significant suffering. Opioid analgesics cause severe side effects and accidental death. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid therapies for managing post-surgical pain. Local application of Clarix Flo (FLO), a human amniotic membrane (AM) product, attenuated established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity without exhibiting known side effects of opioid use in mice. This effect was achieved through direct inhibition of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways. We further purified the major matrix component, the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 (HC-HA/PTX3) from human AM that has greater purity and water solubility than FLO. HC-HA/PTX3 replicated FLO-induced neuronal and pain inhibition. Mechanistically, HC-HA/PTX3 induced cytoskeleton rearrangements to inhibit sodium current and high-voltage activated calcium current on nociceptive neurons, suggesting it is a key bioactive component mediating pain relief. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain and unravel the underlying mechanisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Surgery or trauma may lead to persistent pain, impeding functional recovery and causing considerable distress.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) Continuous reliance on opioid analgesics causes severe side effects and accidental death, which resulted in a national public health emergency being declared in 2017.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid alternative therapies for managing post-surgical pain. An optimal strategy would be to develop local treatments that both inhibit pain and address the underlying pathophysiology, such as neuronal sensitization, while avoiding the central side effects of commonly used analgesics.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>)</p>
<p>A naturally occurring biologic derived from human birth tissues has recently gained our attention as a potential solution for this challenging problem. The birth tissue is predominantly comprised of the amniotic membrane (AM) and umbilical cord (UC), which share the same cell origin as the fetus. These versatile biological tissues have been used as medical therapy in a wide range of conditions.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) FLO (Clarix Flo; BioTissue, Miami, FL) is a sterile, micronized, and lyophilized form of human AM/UC matrix used for surgical and non-surgical repair, reconstruction, or replacement of soft tissue by filling in the connective tissue void. They have been shown to orchestrate regenerative healing within its anti[inflammatory and anti[scarring properties in ophthalmic applications.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) Interestingly, FLO appears to relieve pain effectively in several ocular surface disorders,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) and musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) and lower extremity neuropathy.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) However, the mechanisms underlying its potential pain inhibition properties and how it may affect sensory neuron excitability is also unknown.</p>
<p>In a plantar-incision mouse model of post-surgical pain, we explored whether FLO may be deployed as a viable biologic for the treatment of trauma pain. We further purified the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 (HC-HA/PTX3), which is in uniquely high amounts in human AM, and determined if HC-HA/PTX3 is a key bioactive component mediating pain relief. Our findings highlight the potential of a naturally derived biologic from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain and unravel the underlying mechanisms.</p>

<p>Intra-paw injection of FLO, but not the vehicle (saline) acutely inhibited heat nociception in naÃ¯ve wild-type (WT) mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Moreover, FLO dose-dependently (0.1-0.5 mg) attenuated heat hypersensitivity in the hindpaw receiving the plantar incision (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), and inhibited mechanical hyperalgesia in the Randall-Sellito test (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). In the Catwalk assay, FLO partially normalized the impaired gaiting caused by incision, as indicated by increases in print area and max contact area from pre-drug levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D, E</xref>), suggesting an attenuation of movement-evoked pain which is common after surgery. FLO caused no impairment in locomotor function or exploratory activity in the open-field test (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>); these symptoms are known side effects of opioid use. The concentration of FLO we used fell within the range reported in previous clinical studies.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>)</p>

<p>Since nociceptive neuron hyperexcitability may lead to persistent pain,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) cellular mechanisms of pain inhibition by FLO can be partly inferred from its modulatory effects on these neuronsâ excitability.

<label>2.</label><title>Purified HC-HA/PTX3 mirrored <italic>in vivo</italic> pain inhibition by FLO</title>
<p>We then purified Heavy chain 1-Hyaluronic acid/Pentraxin 3 (HC-HA/PTX3) from the water-soluble extract of human AM (Fig S1A, B), and biochemically and functionally characterized it using western blot and TRAP assays (Fig S1C-E).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) HC-HA/PTX3 was suggested to be a biologically active component with uniquely high amounts in human birth tissues. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) The natural process of HC-HA/PTX3 formation may involve: Tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 protein covalently binds to HC1 of inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor and then transfers it to high-molecular-weight hyaluronan (HMW-HA). At this point, HC1 becomes conjugated, and tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 is released. PTX3 then tightly associates with the HC1-HA complex by binding to the HC1.</p>
<p>HC-HA/PTX3 was shown to alleviate dry eye disease induced by chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) through suppressing inflammation and scarring in murine lacrimal glands.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) However, it remains unclear whether HC-HA/PTX3, as a key component, is responsible for FLOâs inhibitory effects on neuron activation and pain. Like FLO, intra-paw injection of HC-HA/PTX3 dose-dependently (10-20 Î¼g) induced heat antinociception in naÃ¯ve WT mice and attenuated heat hypersensitivity developed in the hindpaw after plantar-incision (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Moreover, HC-HA/PTX3-induced pain inhibition was comparable between male and female mice after plantar incision (Fig S2).</p>

<p>(A) Left: intra-paw injection of HC-HA/PTX3 (10 Î¼g or 20 Î¼g, 20 Î¼L), but not vehicle (saline), increased paw withdrawal latency (PWL) to heat stimulation in naÃ¯ve WT mice. N=8-11/group. Right: intra-paw injection of HC-HA/PTX3 (10 Î¼g or 20 Î¼g, 20 Î¼L) dose-dependently attenuated the heat hypersensitivity during Days 2-4 after plantar-incision. N=9-16/group. (B) Right: intra-paw injection of HC-HA/PTX3 (20 Î¼g, 20 Î¼L) showed superior anti-hyperalgesic effect compared to HMW-HA ((20 Î¼g, 20 Î¼L)) alone and the mixture of HMW-HA (20 Î¼g) and HC1 (720 ng) during days 2-4 after plantar-incision. Left: analyzing the Area Under the Curve (AUC) to assess the anti-hyperalgesic effect of each group. N=5-9/group.

<p>HMW-HA, a major component of HC-HA/PTX3, was suggested to attenuate inflammatory pain and the neuropathic pain induced by the cancer chemotherapy paclitaxel.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) We wondered about the effect of HMW-HA on post-surgical pain, which is unknown. We compared the efficacy of HC-HA/PTX3 and HMW-HA, both at an amount of 20 Î¼g since the weight of HC-HA/PTX3 was determined based on its HMW-HA content. At its peak (1 hour post-drug), HC-HA/PTX3 demonstrated a significantly more potent anti-hyperalgesic effect than HMW-HA, and this effect persisted for over 4 hours (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). In contrast, the effect of HMW-HA had largely dissipated by approximately the 4-hour mark. Additionally, we tested the treatment using a mixture of HMW-HA and HC1, another important component of HC-HA/PTX3. Based on our previous findings, which demonstrated that 1 Î¼g of HC-HA/PTX3 contained 1 Î¼g of HMW-HA, 36 ng of HC1, and 10 ng of PTX3(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), we combined 20 Î¼g of HMW-HA with 720 ng of HC1. However, this mixture did not demonstrate a greater pain-inhibitory effect compared to HMW-HA alone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). These findings suggest that the full HC-HA/PTX3 complex is superior to HMW-HA in attenuating post-surgical pain.</p>

<label>3.</label><title>HC-HA/PTX3 inhibited DRG neurons</title>
<p>Using <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging of DRG, we have demonstrated that intra-paw injection of FLO significantly reduced the activation of nociceptive neurons in the ganglia to peripheral stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>), possibly through inhibiting the transduction of âpainâ signals at the peripheral nerve terminals, leading to the alleviation of post-surgical pain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Due to the technical challenges and limitations of <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging and recording at nerve terminals in skin, we subsequently used cultured DRG neurons to examine the receptor mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in neuron inhibition by FLO.</p>
<p>Since HC-HA/PTX3 mimics FLO in producing pain inhibition, and it has high-purity and is more water-soluble than FLO, making it suitable for probing cellular mechanisms. In cultured DRG neurons, HC-HA/PTX3 exerted inhibitory effects in both calcium imaging (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C-F</xref>) and patch-clamp electrophysiology studies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G, H</xref>). Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), and mas-related G protein-coupled receptor D (MrgprD)-expressing DRG neurons are critical to heat and mechanical pain signaling.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) Applying capsaicin (a TRPV1 agonist), cinnamaldehyde (a TRPA1 agonist), or Î²-alanine (a MrgprD agonist) to bath solution increased intracellular calcium [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in 41%, 24%, or 17% of DRG neurons.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) Here, HC-HA/PTX3 (15 Î¼g/mL) significantly reduced the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase produced by these proalgesics. However, HMW-HA (15 Î¼g/mL) was not effective at the same concentration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C-F</xref>).</p>
<p>Intrinsic membrane excitability (IME) is a property of a neuron that refers to its general state of excitability, which is reflected in part by its ability to generate action potentials. While it is true that increased or decreased intrinsic excitability can imply how a neuron responds to a given input, it is reflective more of the neuronâs output into the spinal cord. Further, IME is assessed in the neuron via current injected directly from the patch electrode, not from any exogenous stimulus. IME of DRG neurons from WT mice after plantar-incision was measured 24 h after dissociation. In small DRG neurons, HC-HA/PTX3 concentration-dependently hyperpolarized the membrane potential (5, 10, 25 Î¼g/mL, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G, I</xref>), and increased the rheobase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H, J</xref>), indicating decreased neuronal excitability. However, HC-HA/PTX3 (10 Î¼g/mL) did not significantly affect the IME of large neurons (Fig S3A-H). These findings suggest that HC-HA/PTX3 may attenuate the activation of key receptors involved in pain control such as TRPV1, MrgprD, and TRPA1. Additionally, it fundamentally decreases nociceptor excitability by altering membrane hyperpolarization and intrinsic membrane properties.</p>

<p>CD44 is expressed in both neurons and glial cells,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) but its distribution in the DRG was unclear. In mouse DRG, CD44 immuno-reactivity highly colocalized with Na-K ATPase alpha1, a neuron surface marker, but presented at a much lower level in satellite glial cells (Fig S4A).

<p>Importantly, in DRG neurons from CD44 KO mice, HC-HA/PTX3 did not reduce the capsaicin-evoked increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C-E</xref>), nor did it alter the IME and the membrane potential (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F, G</xref>). The basal IMEs were comparable between WT and CD44 KO mice (Table S1). Behaviorally, the inhibition of heat hyperalgesia by FLO (0.5 mg, 20 Î¼L) and by HC-HA/PTX3 (10 or 20 Î¼g, 20 Î¼L) was both diminished in CD44 KO mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4H, I</xref>). Likewise, applying a neutralizing antibody (IgG, 10 Î¼g) to CD44, but not control IgG blocked HC-HA/PTX3-induced pain inhibition in WT mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4J</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that pain inhibition, as well as the exclusive inhibition of small DRG neurons, which are mostly nociceptive, by HC-HA/PTX3 and FLO, are CD44-dependent.</p>

These findings suggest that HC-HA/PTX3 may inhibit cell membrane ion channels through a CD44-mediated cytoskeleton rearrangement.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study revealed that human birth tissue products (FLO) mitigated post-surgical pain by directly inhibiting nociceptive neurons. The major matrix component purified from human AM, HC-HA/PTX3, mimics the pain and neuronal-inhibitory effects of FLO. Mechanistically, both compounds exert pain inhibition in a CD44-dependent manner. At the cellular level, HC-HA/PTX3 caused membrane hyperpolarization, modified the intrinsic properties, and inhibited I<sub>Nav</sub> and HVA-I<sub>ca</sub> in nociceptive DRG neurons through cytoskeleton rearrangement and interaction with these membrane ion channels.</p>
<p>Applying FLO locally inhibited heat and mechanical hyperalgesia, and movement-induced pain in WT mice following plantar incision. Similarly, HC-HA/PTX3 also inhibited heat hyperalgesia. Intriguingly, treatment with HC-HA/PTX3 demonstrated a stronger and longer-lasting pain-inhibitory effect compared to treatment with HMW-HA and the combination of HMW-HA and HC1, at their comparable dosages tested. This finding suggests the superiority of HC-HA/PTX3 over HMW-HA for post-surgical pain treatment, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. After <italic>in vivo</italic> administration, HMW-HA undergoes rapid and progressive degradation through a series of enzymatic reactions, resulting in the formation of polymers of decreasing sizes and altered bioactivity. Notably, different sizes of HA fragments exhibit a wide range of biological functions, which are sometimes opposing. For example, larger hyaluronan polymers (e.g., HMW-HA) possess anti-angiogenic, immunosuppressive, and anti-hyperalgesic properties. In contrast, smaller polysaccharide fragments are often inflammatory, immuno-stimulatory, angiogenic, and proalgesic. Moreover, they can compete with larger hyaluronan polymers for target receptors.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) The long-lasting drug action of HC-HA/PTX3 <italic>in vivo</italic> indicates that it may possess a more stable structure than HMW-HA, making it less prone to degradation and loss of bio-efficacy.</p>
<p>Small DRG neurons are activated by heat and noxious stimulation, while innocuous mechanical stimulation mainly activates large DRG neurons and low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Both FLO and HC-HA/PTX3 inhibited small DRG neurons, as evidenced by decreased excitability in functional GCaMP6s imaging and electrophysiologic recording. We found that the potent neuronal inhibitory effect of HC-HA/PTX3 may result from their high expression of CD44. Both pain and neuronal inhibitory effects from FLO and HC-HA/PTX3 were CD44-dependent. Importantly, scRNA-seq analysis showed a significantly higher expression of CD44 in small nociceptive DRG neurons, compared to large neurons (e.g., LTMRs and proprioceptors). Similar findings were also observed in DRG scRNA-seq datasets from another two studies.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>) In line with this notion, HC-HA/PTX3 exerted a minimal effect on large DRG neurons. Nevertheless, the mechanisms for the differential drug effects warrant further investigations.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional analgesics, which often target a single downstream effector, HC-HA/PTX3 may induce a range of changes that could fundamentally decrease nociceptor excitability. These changes include membrane hyperpolarization, altered intrinsic membrane properties, and the inhibitions of multiple membrane ion channels, including I<sub>Nav</sub> and HVA I<sub>ca</sub>. In addition, HC-HA/PTX3 reduced calcium responses evoked by several proalgesic compounds, including capsaicin, Î²-Alanine, and cinnamal in nociceptive DRG neurons. The activations of TRPV1, MrgprD, and TPRA1 are known to be important to heat and mechanical hypersensitivity and themselves are important targets for pain control. Therefore, HC-HA/PTX3 may effectively block the transmission of noxious afferent inputs through multiple modes of action.</p>
<p>To explore the molecular basis of HC-HA/PTX3-induced neuronal inhibition, our study unraveled that HC-HA/PTX3, but not HMW-HA, induced a rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, leading to an increase in sub-membranous F-actin polymerization and the translocation of CD44 to the vicinity of the cell membrane in small DRG neurons. This effect was not observed in large neurons, and was blocked by both LAT-A pretreatment and <italic>Pfn1</italic> knockdown, which disrupt actin polymerization. Given that polymerized F-actin serves as a scaffold for signaling that affects ion channels, we speculate that the cytoskeleton rearrangement triggered by HC-HA/PTX3 could thus profoundly change ion channel function and, consequently, neuronal excitability. Supporting this hypothesis, the intracellular infusion of a low dose of LAT-A, which had minimal effect on I<sub>Nav</sub>, and HVA-I<sub>ca</sub> and the morphology of DRG neurons, blocked the inhibition of I<sub>Nav</sub> and HVA-I<sub>ca</sub> by HC-HA/PTX3. Thus, HC-HA/PTX3 may inhibit ion channels through a CD44-mediated cytoskeleton rearrangement, representing a novel mechanism for neuron inhibition.</p>
<p>The signaling of HMW-HA also depends on CD44 clustering in lipid rafts, and disrupting this markedly reduces HMW-HA-induced anti-hyperalgesia.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) However, at the concentration tested (15 Î¼g/mL), HMW-HA did not increase cortical F-actin and CD44 translocation in small DRG neurons, nor attenuated capsaicin-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase. These findings suggest that different ligands may induce varying cellular effects after binding to CD44. Indeed, HA of different molecular weights can activate different downstream signaling pathways of CD44, leading to opposing effects. For example, HMW-HA produced anti-hyperalgesia, while low-molecular-weight HA (LMW-HA) induced hyperalgesia.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) While Src signaling was involved in LMW-HA-induced hyperalgeisa,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) other downstream signaling pathways of CD44s participated the anti-hyperalgesic effect of HMW-HA, including phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase gamma (PI3KÎ³)/ protein kinase B (AKT), RhoGTPases (RhoA and Rac1), phospholipases (phospholipases CÎµ and CÎ³1).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) These findings suggest a complex interplay of downstream signaling pathways of CD44 in pain modulation.</p>
<p>HMW-HA was reported to attenuate CIPN only in male rats.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) However, sex dimorphism was not observed in the inhibition of PGE2-induced inflammatory pain by HMW-HA.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) Similarly, HC-HA/PTX3 induced comparable pain inhibition in both sexes. For LMW-HA-induced hyperalgesia, three receptors, including CD44, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM), may be involved. Yet, estrogen dependence was only established for RHAMM-dependent hyperalgesia and its inhibition by HMW-HA.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>) These findings collectively suggest a complex interplay between estrogen and different types of HA and HA receptors in pain regulation.</p>

To reduce selection and observation bias, animals were randomized to the different groups and the experimenters were blinded to drug treatment. The comparisons of data consisting of two groups were made by Studentâs t-test. Comparisons of data in three or more groups were made by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test. Comparisons of two or more factors across multiple groups were made by two-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test. Two-tailed tests were performed, and p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant in all tests.</p>

<p>The authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> data that identify a novel, non-opioid biologic from human birth tissue products with anti-nociceptive properties in a preclinical mouse model of surgical pain. This <bold>important</bold> study highlights the potential use of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as safe and sustainable pain treatment options that do not possess the adverse side effects associated with opioids and synthetic pharmaceuticals. Whether these results will translate to the clinic remains to be seen, nevertheless, these preclinical findings are promising.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Opioids and related drugs are powerful analgesics that reduce suffering from pain. Unfortunately, their use often leads to addiction and there is an opioid-abuse epidemic that affects people worldwide. This study represents an ongoing effort to develop non-opioid analgesics for pain management. The findings point to an alternative approach to control post-surgical pain in lieu of opioid medications.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study responds to the urgent need for the development of non-opioid analgesics.</p>
<p>(2) The study demonstrates the efficacy of Clarix Flo (FLO) and HC-HA/PTX3 from the human amniotic membrane (AM) in reducing pain in a mouse model without the adverse effects of opioids.</p>
<p>(3) The study further explored the underlying mechanisms of how HC-HA/PTX3 produces its effects on neurons, suggesting the molecules/pathways involved in pain relief.</p>
<p>(4) The potential use of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues (AM) is safe and sustainable, compared to synthetic pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>(5) The study was conducted with scientific rigor, involving purification of active components, comparative analysis with multiple controls, and mechanistic explorations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) It should be cautioned that while the preclinical findings are promising, these results still need to be translated into clinical settings that are complex and often unpredictable.</p>
<p>(2) The study shows the efficacy of FLO and HC-HA/PTX3 in one preclinical model of post-surgical pain. The observed effect may be variable in other pain conditions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an outstanding piece of work on the potential of FLO as a viable analgesic biologic for the treatment of postsurgical pain. The authors purified the HC-HA/PTX3 from FLO and demonstrated its potential as an effective non-opioid therapy for postsurgical pain. They further unraveled the mechanisms of action of the compound at cellular and molecular levels.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Prominent strengths include the incorporation of behavioral assessment, electrophysiological and imaging recordings, the use of knockout and knockdown animals, and the use of antagonist agents to verify biological effects. The integrated use of these techniques, combined with the hypothesis-driven approach and logical reasoning, provides compelling evidence and novel insight into the mechanisms of the significant findings of this work.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I did not find any significant weaknesses even with a critical mindset. The only minor suggestion is that the Results section may focus on the results from this study and minimize the discussions of background information.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Non-opioid analgesics derived from human amniotic membrane (AM) product represents a novel and unique approach to analgesia that may avoid the traditional harms associated with opioids. Here, the study investigators demonstrate that HC-HAPTX3 is the primary bioactive component of the AM product FLO responsible for anti-nociception in mouse-model and in-vitro dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cell culture experiments. The mechanism is demonstrated to be via CD44 with an acute cytoskeleton rearrangement that is induced that inhibits Na+ and Ca++ current through ion channels. Taken together, the studies reported in the manuscript provide supportive evidence clarifying the mechanisms and efficacy of HC-HAPTX3 antinociception and analgesia.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Extensive experiments including murine behavioral paw withdrawal latency and Catwalk test data demonstrating analgesic properties. The breadth and depth of experimental data are clearly supporting mechanisms and antinociceptive properties.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A few changes to the text of the manuscript would be recommended but no major weaknesses were identified.</p>
