<abstract>
<title>Summary</title><p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects up to 80% of the world’s population. Here, we show that HCMV infection leads to widespread changes in human chromatin accessibility and chromatin looping, with hundreds of thousands of genomic regions affected 48 hours after infection. Integrative analyses reveal HCMV-induced perturbation of Hippo signaling through drastic reduction of TEAD1 transcription factor activity. We confirm extensive concordant loss of TEAD1 binding, active H3K27ac histone marks, and chromatin looping interactions upon infection. Our data position TEAD1 at the top of a hierarchy involving multiple altered important developmental pathways. HCMV infection reduces TEAD1 activity through four distinct mechanisms: closing of TEAD1-bound chromatin, reduction of YAP1 and phosphorylated YAP1 levels, reduction of TEAD1 transcript and protein levels, and alteration of <italic>TEAD1</italic> exon-6 usage. Altered TEAD1-based mechanisms are highly enriched at genetic risk loci associated with eye and ear development, providing mechanistic insight into HCMV’s established roles in these processes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is nearly ubiquitous in the human population. While primary infection of immunocompetent individuals is typically mild or asymptomatic, the virus can cause significant disease in developing neonates and immunocompromised individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rafailidis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Swanson and Schleiss, 2013</xref>). HCMV establishes a lifelong latent infection following primary infection that can periodically reactivate throughout the patient’s lifetime, leading to shedding of infectious virus or promotion of virus-associated morbidity in immunocompromised individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Forte et al., 2020</xref>). HCMV can infect a broad range of cells including fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and hematopoietic progenitor stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Sinzger et al., 2008</xref>). Fibroblasts and epithelial cells are typically supportive of a lytic infection, while hematopoietic cells are the reservoir of latent or persistent infection. Fibroblasts have been widely used to study the cellular changes that occur in response to viral infection and for viral propagation in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fortunato, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Sinzger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sinzger et al., 1995</xref>). Like all other viruses, HCMV is an obligate intracellular pathogen that relies on the host cell machinery for its replication, assembly, and egress. These complex host-pathogen interactions vary among different cell types, leading to viral infection manifesting itself in primarily a lytic or latent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lee and Grey, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Rothenburg and Brennan, 2020</xref>). Infection of permissive cells is accompanied by widespread changes in host cell gene expression. Indeed, several previous studies have examined pathways altered by HCMV infection of <italic>in-vitro</italic> cultured cells at the level of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hein and Weissman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lee and Grey, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Li and Kamil, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Van Damme et al., 2016</xref>; van Den <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Pol et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Regulation of gene expression involves intricate interplay between the binding of transcription factors and cofactors, chromatin accessibility, histone marks, and long-range chromatin looping interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lambert et al., 2018</xref>). A hallmark feature of viruses is their dependence on the host nuclear environment and host transcriptional processes. For example, some viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus extensively alter human chromatin architecture in order to replicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Campbell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). HCMV uses host-derived histones to chromatinize its genome for temporal regulation of the Immediate Early protein IE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Zalckvar et al., 2013</xref>). However, the mechanisms affecting HCMV driven regulation of host gene expression are not well defined, thus limiting our understanding of the complex interplay between virus and host.</p>
<p>To determine the human gene regulatory mechanisms impacted by HCMV, we examined the changes to chromatin accessibility, transcription factor occupancy, chromatin looping, and gene expression resulting from HCMV infection. We show that HCMV infection in human fibroblasts and retinal epithelial cells induces large-scale global changes in the human chromatin landscape. Accessible chromatin regions that closed upon HCMV infection were highly enriched for predicted TEAD sites and depleted of CTCF (CCCTC-Binding Factor) sites in both human fibroblasts and retinal epithelial cell lines. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments confirm that TEAD1 binding sites are significantly depleted at sites that become inaccessible with HCMV infection, with concomitant reduction of chromatin looping interactions and H3K27ac levels.</p>
<p>TEAD1 is a downstream effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation and cell fate to control organ growth and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Currey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ma et al., 2019</xref>). TEAD1 activity is primarily controlled by its co-activator YAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Totaro et al., 2018</xref>). We show that HCMV-induced loss of TEAD1 binding is mediated by four distinct mechanisms: 1. Extensive closing of human chromatin that is normally occupied by TEAD1; 2. Reduction of YAP1 and pYAP1 protein levels; 3. Reduction of TEAD1 transcript and protein levels; 4. Exclusion of TEAD1 exon 6. Consistent with these observations, pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes upon HCMV infection reveals extensive perturbation of the Hippo/TEAD signaling pathway. GWAS-based enrichment analysis reveals that these TEAD1 binding loss events are specifically enriched for genetic variants associated with ear and eye development. Collectively, our data provide novel insights into the mechanisms employed by HCMV upon infection of human cells, with important implications in HCMV-induced human growth defects.</p>

<title>Human cytomegalovirus infection extensively re-organizes human chromatin upon infection</title>
<p>Several previous studies have reported extensive changes in human gene expression profiles in HCMV infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hertel and Mocarski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">McKinney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Nightingale et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Nogalski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Oberstein and Shenk, 2017</xref>). However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying these vast changes remain largely unknown. Gene expression programs defined by <italic>cis</italic>-acting DNA elements such as enhancers and promoters typically occur in open or accessible regions of chromatin. We thus sought to determine if HCMV infection leads to genome-wide alterations in chromatin structure. To this end, we used ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Corces et al., 2017</xref>) to measure HCMV-induced changes to human chromatin accessibility in two widely used HCMV infection models: human fibroblasts (HS68 cells) and retinal epithelial cells (ARPE-19 cells) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). ATAC-seq experiments were performed in duplicate in uninfected conditions or 48 hours post infection (hpi) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). For each cell line, we obtained &gt;200,000 peaks in both uninfected and infected cells, with Fraction of Reads in Peaks (FRiP) scores greater than 0.5 and Transcription Start Sites (TSS) enrichment scores &gt;30 (average of 35.1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset1">Supplemental Dataset 1</xref>), all of which greatly exceed the recommendations set forth by the ENCODE Project consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Consortium, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hitz et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Luo et al., 2020</xref>; Meenakshi S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Kagda et al., 2023</xref>). Likewise, our ATAC-seq peaks align strongly with relevant publicly available datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset1">Supplemental Dataset 1</xref>), and we observed very strong agreement between replicates, with samples tightly clustering first by cell type and then by infection status (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs1">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>). Collectively, these results highlight the high quality and internal consistency of our datasets.</p>

<p>We next sought to systematically identify regions of the human genome with differential chromatin accessibility between infected and uninfected cells. To this end, we used DiffBind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Ross-Innes et al., 2012</xref>) (see Methods), which identified thousands of chromatin regions (ATAC-seq peaks) with statistically significant changes in signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset2">Supplemental Dataset 2</xref>). As expected, most accessible chromatin is common to both uninfected and HCMV infected cells in both cell types - we designate such regions ‘unchanged’ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). In fibroblasts, 38,651 peaks were unique to uninfected cells, and hence were closed following infection with HCMV (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Likewise, 49,003 regions were newly accessible in HCMV infected fibroblasts. We also observed large HCMV-dependent changes to chromatin accessibility in retinal epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Comparison of differentially accessible chromatin between ARPE and HFF revealed that the vast majority of the HCMV-induced changes are specific to one of the two cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs2">Supplemental Figure S2</xref>).

<p>Regions of open chromatin largely reflect regulatory regions such as enhancers, which can interact with promoters at large genomic distances spanning many megabases through chromatin looping interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Rowley and Corces, 2018</xref>). To measure the impact of HCMV infection on functional chromatin looping across the human genome, we next performed HiChIP with an antibody against H3K27ac in uninfected and infected fibroblasts (see Methods). Analysis of the resulting HiChIP data revealed 143,882 and 97,815 chromatin looping interactions in uninfected and infected cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset3">Supplemental Dataset 3</xref>). QC analyses using HiC-Pro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Servant et al., 2015</xref>) indicate that the data are of high quality: the final set of unique valid interaction pairs was 67% of the total sequenced pairs for the uninfected cells and 52% for the infected cells. The number of <italic>trans</italic> interactions was 21% of the sequenced pairs for the uninfected cells and 11% for the infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset4">Supplemental Dataset 4</xref>), similar to or better than the results obtained in the original HiChIP study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Mumbach et al., 2016</xref>). Peaks were called from the HiChIP data and compared to peaks called from H3K27ac ChIP-seq data (see Methods), revealing between 82% and 92% HiChIP peak overlap with H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset4">Supplemental Dataset 4</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that our HiChIP data are of high quality.</p>
<p>We next used the HiChIP data to identify HCMV-dependent differential chromatin looping events (see Methods). In total, uninfected cells have 143,882 loops. With HCMV infection, 90,198 of these loops are lost, and 44,045 new loops are gained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset3">Supplemental Dataset 3</xref>). Because the number of altered loops was large, we repeated loop calling and differential analysis with FDR values less than 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset3">Supplemental Dataset 3</xref>). For all three cutoffs, the percentage of loops specific to an infection state were very similar. We also randomly downsampled the number of input pairs used for calling loops to verify that our results were not due to a difference in read depth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset3">Supplemental Dataset 3</xref>). For the three smaller subsets of data, the number of loops specific to an infection state only changed slightly. The full quantification of each chromatin looping event and comparisons of events between conditions are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset6">Supplemental Dataset 6</xref>.</p>
<p>Next, we examined HCMV-altered regions of chromatin accessibility for enriched transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs (see Methods). We use unchanged accessibility regions as a baseline for motif enrichment analysis, in order to identify motifs specific to chromatin regions that are uniquely accessible in either uninfected or infected cells. In human fibroblasts, all three categories of regions (unchanged, closed with infection, open with infection) were highly enriched for AP-1 motifs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, purple dots), reflecting the important role played by this TF family in virtually every cell type regardless of infection status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lee et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Wolf et al., 2023</xref>). Intriguingly, we found substantial differences in motif enrichment for other TF families in HCMV-altered chromatin regions. In regions closed upon HCMV infection, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (CEBP), E-box (bound by bHLH TFs), and TEA domain (TEAD) binding motifs were uniquely enriched (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, left: blue, orange, and maroon dots along the Y-axis, respectively). In contrast, newly closed chromatin in HCMV infected cells was depleted of CTCF binding sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, left: dark green dots along the X-axis), and newly opened chromatin was enriched slightly more strongly for CTCF sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, right: dark green dots approaching the Y-axis).</p>

</fig>
<p>We next examined transcription factor binding site motif enrichment in retinal epithelial cells. Similar to human fibroblasts, we found that TEAD motifs were specifically enriched in peaks that were closed with infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, left). Unlike in fibroblasts, we did not identify strong enrichment of CEBP or E-box motifs, presumably due to cell-type differences. In addition to differences in enrichment levels, we also observed substantial and consistent changes in the overall predicted occupancy of TEAD TFs and CTCF in both cell types (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that HCMV infection extensively re-organizes the human genome in both fibroblasts and retinal epithelial cells. Further, this reorganization alters the accessibility of predicted binding sites for the TEAD TF family, and avoids closing the binding sites of CTCF, in both cell types.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>TEAD1 transcription factor genomic binding is substantially depleted upon HCMV infection</title>
<p>Because chromatin re-organization was more pronounced in fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), we focused on this cell type for subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments and analyses. We prioritized the two TF families (TEAD and CTCF) with consistent enrichment patterns across cell types within HCMV-dependent chromatin accessibility. We selected TEAD1 to represent the TEAD family because it is the only member whose expression levels are significantly altered by HCMV infection (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). We also examined the genome-wide distribution of H3K27ac, a histone mark correlated with active enhancers.</p>
<p>ChIP-seq experiments for TEAD1, CTCF, and H3K27ac were performed in duplicate in uninfected and HCMV infected conditions (48 hours post infection). The resulting data were of high quality, meeting or exceeding ENCODE data quality standards (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset7">Supplemental Dataset 7</xref>), with strong agreement between replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs3">Supplemental Figure S3</xref>). In particular, all H3K27ac datasets had &gt; 65,000 peaks and all TEAD1 and CTCF ChIP-seq datasets had &gt; 15,000 peaks, with FRiP scores ranging from 0.02 to 0.13 and very strong motif enrichment results (CTCF and TEAD motifs rank #1 in every respective experiment, with p-values &lt; 10<sup>-3000</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset7">Supplemental Dataset 7</xref>). As predicted, the number of TEAD1 ChIP-seq peaks was substantially diminished in infected cells (75,554 in uninfected compared to 17,567 peaks in infected cells), along with a substantial drop in H3K27ac peaks (110,308 vs. 66,644) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset7">Supplemental Dataset 7</xref>), suggesting that loss of TEAD1 binding might have a strong impact on enhancer functionality. In contrast, the total number of CTCF peaks was largely consistent with and without infection (54,697 vs. 57,936 peaks).</p>
<p>To further quantify these changes, we performed differential ChIP-seq peak analysis using the DiffBind software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Ross-Innes et al., 2012</xref>) (see Methods). For TEAD1, we identified 30,740 peaks specific to the uninfected condition, with only 237 peaks specific to infected cells. Likewise, we identified 40,656 H3K27ac peaks specific to uninfected cells, with 8,542 peaks specific to infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset8">Supplemental Dataset 8</xref>). As predicted by the motif enrichment analysis of differentially accessible chromatin, regions where the chromatin closed with infection did not contain CTCF ChIP-seq peaks. Instead, we found that losses of TEAD1 occupancy strongly coincide with losses in chromatin accessibility (enrichment: 9.1-fold, adjusted p-value: 1.4×10<sup>-215</sup>), losses in chromatin looping events (enrichment: 2.1-fold, adjusted p-value: 3.5×10<sup>-</sup> <sup>192</sup>), and losses in H3K27ac levels (enrichment: 6.1-fold, adjusted p-value: 8.7×10<sup>-214</sup>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset6">Supplemental Dataset 6</xref>). For example, we observe significant HCMV-induced loss of TEAD1 binding, chromatin accessibility, and H3K27ac levels proximal to the promoters of the Hippo pathway genes <italic>FRMD6</italic> and <italic>RASSF2</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), both of which have significantly diminished gene expression subsequent to infection (see next section). In the case of <italic>FRDM6</italic>, which involves a likely enhancer, we also observe loss of a chromatin looping interaction (blue loop) between the promoter (dashed box) and two TEAD1 binding sites lost upon infection (solid box). In the case of <italic>RASSF2</italic>, a TEAD1 binding site within the promoter (solid box) interacts (blue loop) with a downstream enhancer (dashed box). Both the TEAD1 binding site and the interaction are lost upon infection. These examples indicate that loss of TEAD1 binding rather than CTCF binding correlates with loss of chromatin interactions. Collectively, these observations confirm our motif-based predictions that loss of chromatin accessibility co-occurs with loss of TEAD1 binding, in addition to loss of enhancer function (H3K27ac) and enhancer looping interactions (HiChIP).</p>

We also observe strong enrichment for many of the major developmental pathways, including WNT, TGF-beta, and Hippo (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Strikingly, many of the genomic regions with extensive (five or more) TEAD1 binding loss events encode major regulators of these pathways, including <italic>WNT5B</italic> and <italic>FZD7</italic> (WNT pathway), <italic>SMAD3</italic>, <italic>TGFB2</italic>, and <italic>TGFBR2</italic> (TGF-beta pathway), and <italic>TEAD1</italic> itself (Hippo pathway), all of which have HCMV-altered expression levels (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset12">Supplemental Dataset 12</xref>).

<p>Overall, we observe extensive HCMV-induced alterations to Hippo gene expression levels. Of the 163 Hippo pathway genes annotated in the KEGG database, 21 were significantly downregulated (including <italic>TEAD1</italic>) and 20 were upregulated (including <italic>PARD6B</italic>, a negative regulator of Hippo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Frum et al., 2018</xref>)) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset13">Supplemental Dataset 13</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Notably, only TEAD1 was differentially expressed among the four TEAD family members, with a 3.7-fold decrease upon infection (adjusted p-vale: 1.9×10<sup>-29</sup>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset11">Supplemental Dataset 11</xref>). We confirmed alterations in expression levels at the protein level for the classic TEAD1 targets Thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) and Cellular Communication Network Factor 1 (CCN1), both of which were substantially downregulated upon HCMV infection. Specifically, THBS1 protein was not detected in infected cells, while CCN1 was reduced by over 3-fold (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>HCMV infection diminishes TEAD1 transcription factor activity through four distinct mechanisms</title>
<p>We next aimed to further explore the virus-induced mechanisms underlying the reduction in TEAD1 activity. The transcriptional regulatory activity of TEAD1 is primarily controlled by the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of its co-activator YAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Totaro et al., 2018</xref>). We thus examined the protein expression levels and phosphorylation status of YAP1 (pYAP1) with and without infection, along with the expression of HCMV proteins IE1/2, TEAD1, and the H3K27ac histone mark in uninfected and infected cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs5">Supplemental Figure S5</xref>). Consistent with diminished TEAD1 activity, we observed a reduction in levels of total YAP1 protein (1.8-fold, p&lt;0.03) and pYAP1 levels (1.5-fold, p&lt;0.0005) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs5">Supplemental Figure S5</xref>). It is likely that the reduction of pYAP1 is a direct function of reduced YAP1 expression. These results are consistent with a large-scale HCMV infection proteomics screen performed in human fetal foreskin fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Weekes et al., 2014</xref>). Likewise, TEAD1 protein levels decreased (3.7-fold, p&lt;0.0009) with HCMV infection (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs5">Supplemental Figure S5</xref>). Consistent with the H3K27ac ChIP-seq results (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), global H3K27ac was also substantially reduced (1.9-fold, p&lt;0.19) in infected cells. Since YAP1 activity is primarily controlled by phosphorylation of its serine residues (S127 and S381), which leads to its cytoplasmic translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Pocaterra et al., 2020</xref>), we next assessed the cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of pYAP1. These experiments revealed increased YAP1 and pYAP1 in the nuclear fraction of uninfected cells relative to HCMV infected cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that HCMV-induced loss of TEAD1 activity can also partially be accounted for by loss of active YAP1.</p>

<p>Recent reports have shown that alternative splicing of <italic>TEAD1</italic> also regulates TEAD1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Choi et al., 2022</xref>). We thus used the AltAnalyze software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Emig et al., 2010</xref>) to systematically examine alternative splicing changes between HCMV infected and uninfected cells within our RNA-seq data (see Methods). This analysis identified two differential exon use events within the <italic>TEAD1</italic> gene that are impacted by HCMV infection: 1) skipping of exon 6 with HCMV infection; and 2) diminished inclusion of an upstream intronic region just upstream (∼90 bases) of exon 5 with HCMV infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs6">Supplemental Figure S6</xref>). A recent study carefully examined the functional effect of the alternative exon 6 usage event, concluding that skipping of exon 6 diminishes TEAD1 activity by disrupting the intramolecular interaction between its DNA-binding domain and the YAP1-interacting domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Choi et al., 2022</xref>). We confirmed HCMV-induced differential splicing of TEAD1 exon 6 by RT-PCR of total RNA isolated from uninfected and HCMV infected fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs6">Supplemental Figure S6C</xref>).</p>

Among these, enrichment replicated in multiple GWAS for two phenotypes: lobe attachment and optic cup area (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Notably, HCMV infection of fibroblasts has previously been shown to contribute to hearing impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fowler and Boppana, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Goderis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Nystad et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Singh et al., 2023b</xref>) and MCMV infection can lead to hearing loss in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bradford et al., 2015</xref>).

Of note, the thrombospondin (<italic>THBS1</italic>) gene, which plays important, well-established roles in hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Smeriglio et al., 2019</xref>), has extensive proximal HCMV-induced TEAD1 binding loss and HCMV-induced gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset11">Supplemental Dataset 11</xref>) and protein level reduction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).

Hippo signaling plays well-established roles in eye development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Moon and Kim, 2018</xref>). Collectively, these results implicate HCMV-induced TEAD1 binding loss in both hearing and eyesight growth defects at multiple specific genomic loci, providing mechanistic insights into the well-established roles of both HCMV and Hippo signaling in these disorders.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>HCMV is a leading cause of birth defects in developing fetuses, including ear and eye developmental disorders. Upon infection, HCMV alters the expression of thousands of human genes. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these changes is critical for understanding the processes underlying HCMV-associated diseases. In this study, we used several complementary functional genomics approaches along with biochemical validation to show that HCMV employs multiple interrelated molecular mechanisms that diminish the activity of the human TEAD1 transcription factor: closing of chromatin in regions normally bound by TEAD1 (with concomitant reduction of H3K27ac levels and chromatin looping interactions), lowering of TEAD1 protein expression levels, preferential exclusion of TEAD1 exon 6, and lowering of protein expression of the TEAD1 co-activator YAP1. This widespread reduction in TEAD1 activity results in substantial alteration to the expression of many human genes, including targets of Hippo and other key developmental signaling pathways.</p>
<p>The human genome encodes four TEAD transcription factors (TEAD1-4), all of which are mediators of the Hippo signaling pathway. The Hippo pathway regulates key aspects of development, including control of organ size, stem cell identity, and lineage specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Currey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ma et al., 2019</xref>). The activity of TEAD transcription factors (TFs) is regulated by the availability of their co-factors YAP1, TAZ (WWTR1), and members of the vestigial-like protein family (VGLL1-4). While YAP1 and TAZ function as transcriptional co-activators of TEAD TFs, VGLL proteins function as co-repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Currey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Rausch and Hansen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Yamaguchi, 2020</xref>). The activity of TEAD1 has previously been shown to be affected by differential use of exon 6, with exclusion of exon 6 reducing activity due to an impaired ability to interact with YAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Choi et al., 2022</xref>). The YAP1-TEAD complex exerts its activity by binding to enhancers of genes involved in extracellular matrix organization, actin cytoskeleton organization, and cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Rausch and Hansen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Stein et al., 2015</xref>), all of which are pathways for which we see significantly altered gene expression levels subsequent to HCMV infection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>A previous report has shown that HCMV infection inhibits the proliferation and invasion of extravillous cytotrophoblasts (EVT) through mRNA downregulation of core Hippo pathway components, including downregulation of YAP1/TAZ and all four TEAD TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kong et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we observe a 3-fold depletion in TEAD1 protein levels and a substantial reduction in YAP1 protein levels, in addition to other mechanisms impacting TEAD1 activity. Additionally, the expression of key TEAD1 targets, including Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF), Fibronectin (FN), α-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) and Collagen 1a (COL1A) have all previously been found to be downregulated with HCMV infection of trabecular meshwork cells, leading to an increase in intra-ocular pressure, a leading cause of glaucoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Choi et al., 2017</xref>). Although the exact mechanisms seem to differ depending on the cell type, HCMV infection of permissible cells clearly perturbs the Hippo pathway in multiple cellular contexts by diminishing TEAD TF activity.</p>
<p>Recent studies have shown that other viruses perturb the Hippo pathway as part of their replicative cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). For example, oncogenic viruses, such as Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Human papillomavirus (HPV) promote dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of YAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). In the case of KSHV, the viral GPCR (vGPCR; ORF74) has been shown to inhibit the Hippo kinases LATS1/2, thereby activating YAP1/TAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, HPV16 oncoprotein E6 induces cell proliferation by dephosphorylating a serine residue of YAP1 (S379) and preventing its degradation by the proteasome complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">He et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, it has been discovered that Epstein-Barr virus subverts the YAP/TAZ pathway in lytic reactivation in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Singh et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Van Sciver et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of this study represent one of likely many examples of a single virus targeting the same host molecule through multiple mechanisms. For example, Human Papillomavirus targets TP53 through independent mechanisms involving both the E6 and E7 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fontan et al., 2022</xref>). Likewise, poxviruses target caspase activity through multiple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Nichols et al., 2017</xref>). Given the vast amount of evolutionary time that viruses have at their disposal due to their highly elevated mutation rates, and the reliance of viruses on host-encoded pathways, it is likely that many other viruses also target a single molecule through multiple mechanisms.</p>
<p>Several previous studies have examined changes to human gene expression induced by HCMV infection in a variety of contexts (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Marti-Carreras and Maes, 2019</xref>)). To date, only two studies have employed more than one type of genome-scale measurement to compare HCMV infected to uninfected cells. In the first study, multiple single cell approaches were employed (including scATAC-seq and CITE-seq) to compare NK cells with or without infection, revealing a possible role for AP-1 family TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Ruckert et al., 2022</xref>). In the second study, integration of Pol2, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data with ATAC-seq data revealed epigenetic reprogramming of the virus and host genomes in myeloid progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Forte et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, this study found only limited changes to chromatin accessibility between infected and uninfected cells, likely due to differences in cell type (Kasumi-3 vs. HS-68 and ARPE-19 in our study), time point (24 vs. 48 hours), infection strength (MOI of 1 with &lt;50% infection vs MOI of 5 and 10 with &gt;90% infection), and replication efficiency (∼30 vs. ∼250 viral genomes per cell). To our knowledge, our study is the first to employ a systematic approach to identify important host transcriptional regulators through unbiased analysis of virus-altered chromatin accessibility regions, with subsequent ChIP-seq-based validation. Future studies will be needed to systematically identify important host-encoded regulators in the context of other cell types and other viruses.</p>
<p>HCMV infects up to 86% of the world’s population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Zuhair et al., 2019</xref>). For most, this infection is largely benign. However, infection can cause complications in newborn infants and the immunocompromised. Our comprehensive analyses reveal that HCMV targets the Hippo signaling pathway through TEAD1, setting off a cascade of effects on other key developmental pathways. Importantly, these TEAD1 binding loss events are highly enriched for genetic variants associated with eye and ear phenotypes, providing possible mechanistic insights into the well-established role of HCMV infection in eye and ear disorders. Collectively, the results of our study offers new avenues to investigate HCMV-dependent mechanisms in healthy and disease states.</p>

<title>Gene expression (RNA-seq)</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated from 5×10<sup>6</sup> cells, either uninfected or infected (48 hrs), using the RNeasy RNA Isolation kit (Qiagen# 74104) as per instructions provided by the manufacturer. A total of 500 ng of RNA per sample was used as input material for ribosomal-RNA depleted RNA-sequencing. First, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was removed, and rRNA free residue was cleaned up by ethanol precipitation. Subsequently, sequencing libraries were generated using the rRNA-depleted RNA by the Directional RNA Library Prep Kit. Briefly, fragmentation was carried out using divalent cations under elevated temperature in first strand synthesis reaction buffer (5X). First strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNaseH-). Second strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. In the reaction buffer, dNTPs with dTTP were replaced by dUTP. Remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities. After adenylation of 3’ ends of DNA fragments, adaptors with hairpin loop structure were ligated to prepare for hybridization. In order to select cDNA fragments of preferentially 150∼200 bp in length, the library fragments were purified with the AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA). Then 3 µL USER Enzyme (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) was used with size-selected, adaptor-ligated cDNA at 37 °C for 15 minutes followed by 5 minutes at 95 °C before PCR. PCR was performed with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase, Universal PCR primers, and Index Primer. Finally, products were purified (AMPure XP system) and library quality was assessed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Inc; Santa Clara, CA, USA). The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 at Novogene (paired-end, 150 bp read length).</p>
<p>RNA sequencing data were processed using the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline (version 3.8.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Di Tommaso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ewels et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Harshil et al., 2022</xref>). Initial quality control of the raw sequencing data was performed using FastQC (version 0.11.9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andrews, 2010</xref>). Low-quality bases and adapter sequences were then trimmed and filtered from the reads using Cutadapt (version 3.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Martin, 2011</xref>) and Trim Galore (version 0.6.7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Krueger et al., 2021</xref>), respectively. Ribosomal RNA sequences were subsequently removed from the aligned data using SortMeRNA (version 4.3.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kopylova et al., 2012</xref>) to eliminate potential contamination from non-target RNA species. STAR aligner (version 2.7.10a) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>) was used to align the trimmed reads to a custom reference genome of hg19 and Human herpesvirus 5 strain TB40/E clone TB40-BAC4 sequence (GenBank: EF999921.1). The resulting alignments were sorted and indexed using SAMtools (version 1.15.1). To further evaluate the quality of the RNA sequencing data, several tools were employed, including RseqQC (version 3.0.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), Qualimap (version 2.2.2-dev) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Okonechnikov et al., 2016</xref>), dupRadar (version 1.18.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Sayols et al., 2016</xref>), and Preseq (version 3.1.1)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Daley and Smith, 2013</xref>). These tools provide comprehensive assessments of various quality metrics, such as read distribution, GC content, duplication rates, and library complexity, ensuring reliable data for downstream analysis. For transcript quantification, Salmon (version 1.5.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Patro et al., 2017</xref>) was utilized to estimate the expression levels of transcripts. Finally, differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (version 1.30.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Genes were considered differentially expressed if they had a 2-fold change and an adjusted p-value threshold of less than 0.01.

<title>Chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq)</title>
<p>Omni-ATAC-Seq was performed in replicates as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Corces et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, HCMV infected and uninfected control cells were harvested by trypsinization for 5 minutes. Approximately 70,000 cells were transferred to a microfuge tube and washed once with PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 µL of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% NP-40, 0.1% Tween-20, and 0.01% Digitonin) and incubated on ice for 3 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 500g for 5 minutes at 4 °C. For the transposition reaction, nuclei were resuspended in 50 µL of Nextera transposition reaction mix consisting of 25 µL 2x TD Buffer, 2.5 µL Nextera Tn5 transposase (Illumina # FC-121-1030), and 22.5 µL of nuclease free water. The reaction mixture was mixed 5-10 times by gentle pipetting and incubated at 37 °C for 45 minutes. The transposed DNA was then purified by Qiagen MinElute kit (Qiagen # 28004) and eluted in 11 µL of elution buffer. 1 µL of the eluted DNA was used to assess quality on an Agilent Tapestation 4510. For library preparation, 10 µL of tagmented DNA was PCR amplified for 14 cycles in a 50 µL reaction volume using NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix (NEB # M0541S) and Nextera primers. The amplified library was purified and size-selected using AMPure XP beads (Beckman # 63880) in a two-step protocol. First, DNA fragments &gt;1000 bp were removed from the PCR reaction mixture by adding 22.5 µL (0.5x volume) of AMPure XP beads followed by incubation at room temperature (RT) for 10 minutes. The beads were magnetized, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. In the second size selection step, 58.5 µL (1.2x volume) of AMPure XP beads were added to the supernatant, mixed by pipetting, and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. Beads were washed twice with 80% ethanol, air-dried and DNA eluted in 30 µL of 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]. Library DNA concentrations and quality were assessed by a Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (Q32854) and Agilent 4510 TapeStation system, respectively.

Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in L2 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 200 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 1x protease inhibitors) with rotation for 10 minutes at RT. Isolated nuclei were then resuspended in sonication buffer solution (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% SDS). To obtain chromatin fragments of 200-500 bp length, nuclei were sonicated using an S220 ultrasonicator (Covaris, LLC., Woburn, MA, USA) at 10% duty cycle, 175 peak power, 200 burst/cycle for 7 minutes at 4 °C. A portion of the sonicated chromatin was run on an agarose gel to verify fragment sizes. The chromatin solution was centrifuged to pellet the debris and the supernatant was collected in a fresh microfuge tube. Since the sonicated chromatin solution is devoid of any detergents or salts, the following were added at indicated final concentrations: Triton X-100 (1%), Sodium deoxycholate (0.1%), Glycerol (5%), NaCl (150 Mm), and Protease inhibitor cocktail (1x). Chromatin was pre-cleared with Protein G Dynabeads for 45 minutes at 4 °C on a rotator. Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed in an SX-8X IP-Star Compact automation system (Diagenode. LLC.,Denville, NJ CA, USA) with 200 µL of pre-cleared chromatin (approximately 3 million cells), 21 µL of Protein A or G Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA), and 5 µg of antibody. The following antibodies were used for ChIP: CTCF (ActiveMotif # 61311, lot 17118005), TEAD1 (ActiveMotif # 61643, lot 34614001) and H3K27ac (Abcam # ab4729, lot GR3357415-1). Immunoprecipitation of chromatin was carried-out for 8 hours, after which the Dynabeads were sequentially washed with Wash Buffer 1 (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100), Wash Buffer 2 (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100), Wash Buffer 3 (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 2 mM EDTA, and 0.2% N-Lauroylsarcosine sodium salt), and Wash Buffer 4 (TE + 0.2% Triton X-100) for 5 minutes each. For library preparation, immunoprecipitated chromatin was eluted in elution buffer (1x TE, 250 mM NaCl and 0.3% SDS). Chromatin proteins and RNA were digested with Proteinase-K and RNase A respectively and DNA purified with the Qiagen MinElute kit. A ChIP-DNA library was constructed using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA library preparation kit (E7645S) as per manufacturer’s instructions and purified with 0.6x volume of AMPure XP beads. Purified library DNA quality and quantity were assessed by an Agilent TapeStation 4150 and sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center Genomics Sequencing Facility (Single end, 100 bp read length).</p>
<p>ChIP-seq data were processed and aligned to the hg19 genome using the ENCODE ChIP-seq pipeline (V2.0.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Consortium, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hitz et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lee et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Luo et al., 2020</xref>). Peaks were called within the pipeline using MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>).

The “conservative overlap” peak sets generated from the individual replicates by the ENCODE ChIP-seq pipeline were used for differential analysis. Peaks were considered differentially enriched if the FDR was less than 0.01 and the fold change was 2-fold or greater.</p>

<title>Chromatin looping interactions (HiChIP)</title>
<p>HiChIP libraries were prepared following the protocol from Mumbach et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Mumbach et al., 2016</xref>). Experiments were performed using biological triplicates in both uninfected and infected cells. In brief, 10 million cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, followed by a cell lysis with Hi-C lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 10 mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40, 1x Roche protease inhibitors) for 30 minutes at 4 °C. Following cell lysis, 375 U of MboI (NEB, R0147) was used to digest, <italic>in-situ</italic>, the cross-linked chromatin for 2 hours at 37 °C. After filling-in the DNA ends by biotin-dTAP (Thermo # 19524016), dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP with 5 U/µL DNA polymerase (NEB # M0210), the DNA was ligated by T4 DNA ligase (NEB # M0202) at 4 °C overnight. The ligated DNA was sonicated using a Covaris S220 platform (Covaris, LLC., Woburn, MA, USA) in nuclear lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 10 mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40, 1x Roche protease inhibitors) at 4 °C. The fragmented DNA was then diluted 10 times with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 16.7 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 167 mM NaCl), and the samples were precleared with Protein A Dynabeads at 4 °C for 1 hour, followed by immunoprecipitation with 8 µL H3K27Ac antibody (Abcam # ab4729, lot GR3374555-1) at 4 °C overnight. DNA-protein complexes were captured by Protein A beads with rotation at 4 °C for 2 hours. The protein A beads were then washed sequentially with low salt, high salt, and LiCl wash buffer, followed by elution twice with 100 µL freshly prepared DNA elution buffer at 37 °C (50 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1% SDS). The eluted chromatin was reverse cross-linked and purified by a PCR purification Kit (Qiagen). 5 μL of Streptavidin C-1 beads (Thermo Fisher # 65001) was used to capture the Biotin Datp labeled DNA. The captured DNA was transposed with 2.5 μL Tn5 transposase (Illumina). The beads were then sequentially washed by Tween wash buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20), 50 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tris. After washing, PCR was performed by re-suspending the beads with 23 μL H<sub>2</sub>O, 25 μL 2X Phusion HF (New England Biosciences), 1 μL Nextera forward primer (Ad1_noMX), and 1 μL Nextera reverse primer (Ad2.X) at 12.5 μM. The PCR was run at 8 cycles of (1) 72 °C for 5 minutes, (2) 98 °C for 1 minute, (3) 98 °C for 15 seconds, (4) 63 °C for 30 seconds, followed by an extension at 72 °C for 1 minute. The post-PCR size selection was performed by two-sided selection with AMPure XP beads to capture the fragments between 300 and 700 bp. Samples were then sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 at Novogene (paired-end, 150 bp read length).</p>
<p>HiC-Pro (version 2.11.4) was used to align and filter read pairs and identify the contact map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Servant et al., 2015</xref>). MboI restriction sites and default parameters were used to align the reads to the hg19 genome. After alignment, the read pairs were filtered to remove those that mapped to multiple locations, were not in a valid orientation, or were duplicated. Quality control metrics were generated at each step. HiC-Pro also reports the number of <italic>trans</italic> pairs, short-range <italic>cis</italic> pairs and long-range <italic>cis</italic> pairs, as well as the number of pairs in each orientation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset4">Supplemental Dataset 4</xref>). The overlap conservative peaks generated by the ENCODE pipeline for the H3K27ac ChIP-seq data were used as input for calling loops using FitHiChIP (version 11.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bhattacharyya et al., 2019</xref>). The parameters for FitHiChIP were the following: interaction type of “peak to all”; bin size of 10 kb; lower loop distance of 20 kb; upper loop distance of 20 mb; background model of loose; bias correction of coverage bias regression; merge filtering enabled; and FDR of 0.01 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset3">Supplemental Dataset 3</xref>). Peaks were called from the HiChIP data using HiChIP-Peaks (version 0.1.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Shi et al., 2020</xref>) using the MboI restriction sites and an FDR of 0.01. The peaks were compared to the H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks using bedtools (version 2.30.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset4">Supplemental Dataset 4</xref>).

We identified shared loops by intersecting the coordinates of the anchors using a 5kb padding. Specifically, we performed two intersections (one for the left anchors and one for the right anchors) using the bedtools window command with a -w parameter of 5000. Loops that intersected at both anchors were classified as shared (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset4">Supplemental Dataset 3</xref>). We used the merged loops from the combined replicates as input. Replicate comparisons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figs7">Supplemental Figure S7</xref>) were performed using the multiBamSummary and plotCorrelation programs from the deepTools software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ramirez et al., 2016</xref>). The parameters used for multiBamSummary were --binSize 10000 and --distanceBetweenBins 0. The parameters used for plotCorrelation were --corMethod pearson, --skipZeros, and --removeOutliers.</p>

<title>TEAD1 binding event phenotype enrichment analysis</title>
<p>To determine the significance of the overlap between TEAD1 binding events and GWAS-derived disease- and phenotype-associated genetic variants, we generated a custom GWAS catalogue for each phenotype in an ancestry specific manner. To this end, we downloaded the Genome Wide Association Studies Catalogue (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/</ext-link>) v1.0.2, as queried on June 20<sup>th</sup> 2019. Independent risk loci for each disease/phenotype were identified based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning (r2 &lt; 0.2). Risk loci across these independent genetic risk variants were identified by linkage disequilibrium expansion (r2&gt;0.8) based on 1000 Genomes Data using PLINK (v.1.90b). This created a list of disease risk loci, along with the corresponding genetic variants within the LD block. This list of variants was then used for RELI analyses as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Harley et al., 2018</xref>). Phenotypes were considered “TEAD1 loss specific” if: (1) they had 3 or more overlaps with TEAD1 binding event losses; (2) this overlap was significant according to RELI (corrected p&lt;0.01); (3) this overlap was not significant for unchanged TEAD1 peaks (p&gt;0.01), and (4) TEAD1 binding loss events were at least 2-fold enriched according to RELI. The three phenotypes meetings these criteria are presented in the Results, with further data included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataset14">Supplemental Dataset 14</xref>.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Sayeed et al. uses a comprehensive series of multi-omics approaches to demonstrate that late-stage human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection leads to a marked disruption of TEAD1 activity, a concomitant loss of TEAD1-DNA interactions, and extensive chromatin remodeling. The data are thoroughly presented and provide evidence for the role of TEAD1 in the cellular response to HCMV infection.</p>
<p>However, a key question remains unresolved: is the observed disruption of TEAD1 activity a direct consequence of HCMV infection, or could it be secondary to the broader innate antiviral response? In this respect, the study would benefit from more in-depth experiments that assess the effect of TEAD1 overexpression or knockdown/deletion on HCMV replication dynamics. The new data provided by the authors in Reviewer Response Figures 1 and 2 suggest that the presence of constitutively expressed TEAD1 does not substantially impact HCMV replication and gene expression as assessed at 72 and 96 hours post-infection. However, this does not discount the fact that HCMV infection induces significant TEAD1-related chromatin changes that may impact other cellular functions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work uses genomic and biochemical approaches for HCMV infection in human fibroblasts and retinal epithelial cell lines, followed by comparisons and some validations using strategies such as immunoblots. Based on these analyses, they propose several mechanisms that could contribute to the HCMV-induced diseases, including closing of TEAD1-occupying domains and reduced TEAD1 transcript and protein levels, decreased YAP1 and phospho-YAP1 levels, and exclusion of TEAD1 exon 6. Some functional assays, using over-expression of TEAD1, are provided.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The genomics experiments were done in duplicates and data analyses show good technical reproducibility. Data analyses are performed to show changes at the transcript and chromatin level changes, followed by some Western blot validations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>For readers who are outside the field, some clarifications of the system and design would be helpful.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript by Sayeed et al. uses a comprehensive series of multi-omics approaches to demonstrate that late-stage human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection leads to a marked disruption of TEAD1 activity, a concomitant loss of TEAD1-DNA interactions, and extensive chromatin remodeling. The data are thoroughly presented and provide evidence for the role of TEAD1 in the cellular response to HCMV infection.</p>
<p>However, a key question remains unresolved: is the observed disruption of TEAD1 activity a direct consequence of HCMV infection, or could it be secondary to the broader innate antiviral response? In this respect, the study would benefit from experiments that assess the effect of TEAD1 overexpression or knockdown/deletion on HCMV replication dynamics. Such functional assays could help delineate whether TEAD1 perturbation directly influences viral replication or is part of a downstream/indirect cellular response, providing deeper mechanistic insights.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To examine the effect of TEAD1 on HCMV, we performed an experiment in primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) which were stably transduced with constitutive TEAD1. To constitutively express TEAD1, we cloned the open reading frame of TEAD1 into pLenti-puro (Plasmid #39481 from Addgene). We selected for transduced cells using puromycin. For these experiments, we first assessed two multiplicities of infection (MOI): 1 and 10 (Reviewer Response Figure 1). Based on the TEAD1 expression in these cells relative to non-transduced HFF cells, we performed HCMV infection experiments in cells transduced with TEAD1 lentivirus at an MOI of 1.</p>
<p>For infections, we used a version of HCMV in which the C terminus of the capsi-associated tegument protein pUL32 (pp150) is tagged by enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) (PMID: 15708994). This experimental design allowed us to assess the impact of constitutive TEAD1 expression on HCMV infection. GFP and immediate early protein expression levels were measured 48 hours after infection by flow cytometry.</p>
<p>After infecting parent cells (no constitutive TEAD1) and TEAD1 constitutively expressing cells with a GFP-positive HCMV at MOIs of 0.3 and 1, we identified equivalent GFP expression in the two conditions, indicating equivalent levels of HCMV infection 48 hours after initial infection (Reviewer Response Figure 1A). We also identified equivalent immediate early protein expression at 48 hours after infection, as measured both by percent positivity (Reviewer Response Figure 1B) and mean florescent intensity (Reviewer Response Figure 1C). At 96 hours with an MOI of 3, constitutive expression of TEAD1 led to a slight reduction in the expression of the HCMV proteins pp65 (encoded by UL83) and UL44 at 72 and 96 hours post initial infection (Reviewer Response Figure 1D). These results suggest that TEAD1 expression has minimal effects, if any, on the expression of these two late HCMV proteins in fibroblasts.  Regulation of particular HCMV genes by TEAD1 is likely to be central for HCMV replication and reactivation in other specialized cell types relevant to viral pathogenesis and disease. However, definitive studies are beyond the scope of the current study.</p>

<title>Constitutive TEAD1 expression reduces expression of two HCMV late genes at 72 and 96 hours after infection.</title>
<p>A-C. Primary human foreskin fibroblasts with and without constitutive TEAD1 expression were infected with pp150-GFP HCMV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.3 or 1 and assessed 48 hours post infection. A. HCMV positive cells were quantified by measuring the percent of cells that were GFP positive. B. The percentages of immediate early (IE1/IE2) positive cells were quantified by flow cytometry. C. The mean florescence intensity of immediate early positive cells was quantified by flow cytometry. D. Primary human foreskin fibroblasts with and without constitutive TEAD1 expression were infected with pp150-GFP HCMV at an MOI of 1 and assessed by Western blot at various time point post infection. UL44 and pp65 are expressed late in the cascade of HCMV gene expression. TEAD1 expression levels and uncropped Westerns are provided in Supplemental Figure S8</p>

<p>Reviewer Response Methods:</p>
<p>Flow cytometric analysis of viral entry and spread using GFP expression and HCMV immediate early (IE) protein staining</p>
<p>Parental and TEAD1 transduced human foreskin fibroblasts were seeded into 12-well plates at 1.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well and either mock infected or infected with pp150-GFP HCMV (PMID: 15708994) at MOIs of 0.3 or 1 on the same day. Cells were trypsinized at appropriate time points and then neutralized with complete medium. Cell suspensions were spun down at 500g for 5 minutes, and the cell pellet was fixed in 70% ethanol for 30 minutes. Following fixation, cells were permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.5% Tween 20 for 10 minutes at 4°C, pelleted, and then stained with IE1/IE2 antibody (mAb810-Alexa Fluor 488) diluted in PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA for 2 hours. Cells were washed with PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA–0.5% Tween 20 and then resuspended in PBS. Cells were analyzed using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Infected cells were also trypsinized at appropriate time points, neutralized in the appropriate media, and directly analyzed for GFP positivity on the flow cytometer.</p>
<p>Western blot analyses of HCMV protein expression in infected cells with and without constitutive TEAD1 expression</p>
<p>TEAD1 transduced and parental human foreskin fibroblasts were seeded into 6-well cell culture plates at a density of 3.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well and either mock infected or infected with pp150-GFP HCMV (PMID: 15708994) at an MOI of 1. Whole-cell lysates were collected at various time points post-infection, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis. Western blots were probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-IE1/IE2 (Chemicon), anti-UL44 (kind gift of John Shanley), anti-pp65 (Virusys Corporation), and cellular β-actin antibody (Bethyl Laboratories). Next, each blot was incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies. Chemiluminescence was detected and quantified using a C-DiGit blot scanner from Li-Cor.</p>

<p>This work, at the current stage, is quite correlative since no functional studies are done to show any causal links. For readers who are outside the field, some clarifications of the system and design need to be stated.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Here are some specific questions:</p>
<p>(1) Since all current analyses are correlative, it is difficult to know which changes are of biological significance. For example, experiments manipulating TEAD transcription factor or YAP with effects on how cells respond to HCMV infection would significantly strengthen the conclusions, which are largely speculations now.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see response to Reviewer 1, which highlights newly added functional assays that include the constitutive (forced) expression of TEAD1, as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) How similar are these cell lines (human fibroblasts and retinal epithelial cell lines) resembling the actually infected cells in patients that lead to symptoms?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In infected cells in patients, HCMV initially infects both fibroblasts and epithelial cells. HCMV penetrates fibroblasts by fusion at the cell surface but is endocytosed into epithelial cells (PMID: 18077432). Thus, most experimental studies of HCMV in vitro use primary human foreskin fibroblasts and a retinal epithelial cell line, as we do in this study.</p>
<p>Additional information on primary human fibroblasts as a model of HCMV infection in humans</p>
<p>There is a nice review article that provides the history of the study of the molecular biology of HCMV that describes how Stanley Plotkin from the Wistar Institute first identified human fibroblast HCMV infected cells (PMID: 24639214). The primary fibroblasts of the foreskin of neonates are available commercially (sometimes called HS68) and model neonatal HCMV infection. Neonatal HCMV, or Congenital Cytomegalovirus, is a leading cause of congenital infection and a significant cause of non-genetic hearing loss in the US (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/cytomegalovirus/congenital-infection/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/cytomegalovirus/congenital-infection/index.html</ext-link>). While many infected newborns appear healthy at birth, a substantial percentage experience long-term health problems, including hearing loss, developmental delays, and vision problems (PMID: 39070527).</p>
<p>More information on ARPE-3 as a model of HCMV infection in humans</p>
<p>HCMV retinitis is a leading cause of vision loss and results from HCMV infection of retinal cells. Retinal epithelial cells are the primary target for HCV infection in the eye. The cell line ARPE-19 is derived from a primary human adult retinal pigment epithelium explant and is commonly used to study HCMV and is thought to be physiologically relevant to the human infection (PMID: 8558129 and 28356702). When compared to primary retinal pigment epithelia, ARPE-19 cells develop a similar cellular and molecular phenotype to primary cells from adults and neonates (PMID: 28356702).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) What is the rationale for using 48 hours' infection? Is this the typical timeframe for patients to develop symptoms?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>HCMV genes are expressed in a temporally controlled manner (PMID: 35417700). Early genes (within the first 4 hours) are involved in regulating transcription, while genes within 4-48 hours are involved in DNA replication and further transcriptional regulation. The 48 hour mark corresponds to the onset of significant viral replication and interactions between the virus and the host immune response. After 48 hours, late genes are expressed, which encode structural proteins as well as viral proteins that inhibit host anti-viral responses.  Most studies that focus on the role of HCMV’s early and immediate early genes are performed at 24 or 48 hours. Similarly, most studies that assess the initial innate immune response to HCMV are performed within the initial 48 hours after in vitro infection.</p>
<p>In most people with healthy immune systems, there are no symptoms (PMID: 34168328). While 60% of people in developed countries and 90% of those in developing countries are serologically positive for past infection, it is challenging to study the kinetics of symptom development due to heterogeneity in the initial virion exposure, the cell types that are initially infected, and immune response. HCMV persists throughout the lifetime of the infected individual by establishing latent infection.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, among all these large-scale global changes, what are primary and what are secondary?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A kinetic study with many timepoints would be needed to identify the primary and secondary genomic changes associated with HCMV infection. These experiments, while exciting, are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Fig.2: In addition to the changes for each cell type, comparison of unchanged, closed and opened with infection regions between the two cell types could be informative for commonalities and differences between cell types.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This was a good suggestion.  We have added a new Supplemental Figure S2, which compares the differentially accessible regions between the two cell types:</p>
<p>We have also added the following sentence to the Results section:</p>
<p>“Comparison of differentially accessible chromatin between ARPE and HFF revealed that the vast majority of the HCMV-induced changes are specific to one of the two cell types (Supplemental Figure S2).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) &quot;Of the 23,018 loops present in both infected and uninfected cells, only 10 are differential at a 2-fold cutoff and a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt;0.01.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to the differential chromatin looping analysis.  Your comment prompted us to re-examine the methodologies we employed to identify differential chromatin looping events between uninfected and infected cells.  In the process, we realized that the relatively low resolution of chromatin looping assays such as HiChIP might require additional care in classifying a particular loop as shared or differential when comparing two experimental conditions. We have thus revamped our differential chromatin looping methodologies by adding 5kb “pads” to either end of each chromatin loop “anchor”.</p>
<p>The corresponding passage now reads:</p>
<p>“We next used the HiChIP data to identify HCMV-dependent differential chromatin looping events (see Methods). In total, uninfected cells have 143,882 loops. With HCMV infection, 90,198 of these loops are lost, and 44,045 new loops are gained (Supplemental Dataset 3). Because the number of altered loops was large, we repeated loop calling and differential analysis with FDR values less than 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 (Supplemental Dataset 3). For all three cutoffs, the percentage of loops specific to an infection state were very similar. We also randomly downsampled the number of input pairs used for calling loops to verify that our results were not due to a difference in read depth (Supplemental Dataset 3). For the three smaller subsets of data, the number of loops specific to an infection state only changed slightly. The full quantification of each chromatin looping event and comparisons of events between conditions are provided in Supplemental Dataset 6.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Are these cells asynchronous and how to determine whether certain changes are not due to cell cycle stage differences?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Cells were plated to an identical density of cells per well before either mock or HCMV infection for this study. Based on the differentially expressed genes cell cycle pathways were not amongst the top 50 enriched molecular pathways.</p>
