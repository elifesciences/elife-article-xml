<title>Abstract</title><p>Photosynthetic organisms exhibit remarkable diversity in their light-harvesting complexes (LHCs). LHCs are associated with photosystem I (PSI), forming a PSI-LHCI supercomplex. The number of LHCI subunits, along with their protein sequences and pigment compositions, has been found to differ greatly among the PSI-LHCI structures. However, the mechanisms by which LHCIs recognize their specific binding sites within the PSI core remain unclear. In this study, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a PSI supercomplex incorporating fucoxanthin chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>/<italic>c</italic>-binding proteins (FCPs), designated as PSI-FCPI, isolated from the diatom <italic>Thalassiosira pseudonana</italic> CCMP1335. Structural analysis of PSI-FCPI revealed five FCPI subunits associated with a PSI monomer; these subunits were identified as RedCAP, Lhcr3, Lhcq10, Lhcf10, and Lhcq8. Through structural and sequence analyses, we identified specific protein-protein interactions at the interfaces between FCPI and PSI subunits, as well as among FCPI subunits themselves. Comparative structural analyses of PSI-FCPI supercomplexes, combined with phylogenetic analysis of FCPs from <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> and the diatom <italic>Chaetoceros gracilis</italic>, underscore the evolutionary conservation of protein motifs crucial for the selective binding of individual FCPI subunits. These findings provide significant insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and selective binding of FCPIs in diatoms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria, algae, and land plants converts solar energy into chemical energy and releases molecular oxygen into the atmosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The conversion of light energy takes place within two multi-subunit membrane protein complexes, known as photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), which perform light harvesting, charge separation, and electron transfer reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). To optimize light energy capture, numerous light-harvesting antenna subunits are associated with the periphery of the PSI and PSII core complexes, transferring excitation energy to the respective photosystem cores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). These light-harvesting antennae exhibit significant diversity among photosynthetic organisms, both in protein sequences and pigment compositions, and can be broadly categorized into two major groups: membrane proteins and water-soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>).</p>
<p>The membrane protein category primarily consists of the light-harvesting complex (LHC) protein superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), which absorbs light energy through chlorophylls (Chls) and carotenoids (Cars). The number and types of Chls and Cars vary significantly among LHCs, which can be grouped into green and red lineages, leading to color diversity in photosynthetic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). The green lineage includes green algae and land plants, while the red lineage encompasses red algae, diatoms, haptophytes, cryptophytes, and dinoflagellates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). LHCs specific to PSI (LHCIs) bind to a eukaryotic PSI monomer, forming a PSI-LHCI supercomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), the structures of which have been revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) in various eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). In the red lineage, the number of LHCIs and their protein sequences and pigment compositions exhibit considerable variation among the PSI-LHCI structures of red algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), a diatom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), a cryptophyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), and dinoflagellates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, we demonstrated the conservation and diversity of LHCIs among red-lineage algae through structural and phylogenetic analyses of PSI-LHCI supercomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). This study revealed that while the binding sites of LHCIs to PSI were conserved to some extent among red-lineage algae, their evolutionary relationships were weak. It is known that LHCIs have similar overall protein structures across photosynthetic organisms, with particular similarity in their three-transmembrane helices, regardless of whether they belong to the green or red lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). However, individual LHCIs have altered their sequences and structures to adapt their respective binding sites to the PSI cores during the assembly of PSI-LHCI supercomplexes. These observations raise a critical question: how do LHCIs recognize their binding sites in the PSI core?</p>
<p>Diatoms are among the most essential phytoplankton in aquatic environments, playing a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, supporting marine food webs, and contributing significantly to nutrient cycling, thus ensuring the health and sustainability of marine ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Diatoms possess unique LHCs known as fucoxanthin Chl <italic>a</italic>/<italic>c</italic>-binding proteins (FCPs), which differ in pigment composition and amino acid sequences from the LHCs of land plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Previous studies have reported the isolation and structural characterization of PSI-FCPI supercomplexes isolated from the diatom <italic>Chaetoceros gracilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Kumazawa et al. showed significant diversity in FCPs between <italic>C. gracilis</italic> and <italic>Thalassiosira pseudonana</italic>, with 46 and 44 FCPs identified, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). These FCPs are categorized into multiple, closely related subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), and their amino acid sequences are not entirely identical between the two diatoms. Consequently, comparing FCPIs, including their amino acid residues and protein structures at similar binding sites in PSI-FCPIs, may provide molecular insights into how FCPIs interact with PSI. However, an overall structure of the <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> PSI-FCPI supercomplex has yet to be solved.</p>
<p>In this study, we solved the structure of the PSI-FCPI supercomplex from <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> CCMP1335 at a resolution of 2.30 Å by cryo-EM single-particle analysis. The structure reveals a PSI-monomer core and five FCPI subunits. Structural and sequence comparisons highlight unique protein-protein interactions between each FCPI subunit and PSI. Based on these findings, we discuss the molecular assembly and selective binding mechanisms of FCPI subunits in diatom species.</p>

<title>Overall structure of the <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> PSI-FCPI supercomplex</title>
<p>The PSI-FCPI supercomplexes were purified from the diatom <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> CCMP1335 and analyzed by biochemical and spectroscopic techniques (Fig. S1). Notably, the protein bands of PSI-FCPI closely resembled those reported in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Cryo-EM images of the PSI-FCPI supercomplex were obtained using a JEOL CRYO ARM 300 electron microscope operated at 300 kV. The final cryo-EM map was determined at a resolution of 2.30 Å with a C1 symmetry (Fig. S2, S3, Table S1), based on the “gold standard” Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion (Fig. S3A).</p>
<p>The atomic model of PSI-FCPI was built based on the cryo-EM map obtained (see Methods; Fig. S3, Table S1–S3). The structure reveals a monomeric PSI core associated with five FCPI subunits (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). The five FCPI subunits were named FCPI-1 to 5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), following the nomenclature of LHCI subunits in the PSI-LHCI structure of <italic>Cyanidium caldarium</italic> RK-1 (NIES-2137) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Specifically, the positions of FCPI-1 and FCPI-2 in the <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> PSI-FCPI structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) correspond to those of LHCI-1 and LHCI-2 in the <italic>C. caldarium</italic> PSI-LHCI structure. The PSI core comprises 94 Chls <italic>a</italic>, 18 β-carotenes (BCRs), 1 zeaxanthin (ZXT), 3 [4Fe-4S] clusters, 2 phylloquinones, and 6 lipid molecules, whereas the five FCPI subunits include 45 Chls <italic>a</italic>, 7 Chls <italic>c</italic>, 2 BCRs, 15 fucoxanthins (Fxs), 7 diadinoxanthins (Ddxs), and 3 lipid molecules (Table S3).</p>

<title>Structure of the <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> PSI core</title>
<p>The PSI core contains 12 subunits, 11 of which are identified as PsaA, PsaB, PsaC, PsaD, PsaE, PsaF, PsaI, PsaJ, PsaL, PsaM, and Psa29 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The remaining subunit could not be assigned due to insufficient map resolution and was therefore modeled as polyalanines (Fig. S4A). This unidentified subunit, designated as Unknown, occupies the same site as Psa28 in the <italic>C. gracilis</italic> PSI-FCPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The structural comparison reveals that Unknown closely resembles Psa28 in the <italic>C. gracilis</italic> PSI-FCPI (Fig. S4B). Psa28, a novel subunit identified in the <italic>C. gracilis</italic> PSI-FCPI structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), follows the previously established nomenclature rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Historically, genes encoding PSI proteins have been designated as <italic>psaA</italic>, <italic>psaB</italic>, and so forth. PsaZ was identified in the PSI cores of <italic>Gloeobacter violaceus</italic> PCC 7421 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Subsequent discoveries led to the designation of a new subunit as Psa27, which was identified in the PSI cores of <italic>Acaryochloris marina</italic> MBIC11017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Consequently, we designated this novel subunit as Psa28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). However, Xu et al. referred to this subunit as PsaR in the PSI-FCPI structure of <italic>C. gracilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>).</p>
<p>Psa29 is newly identified in the <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> PSI-FCPI structure using ModelAngelo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) and the NCBI database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The subunit corresponding to Psa29 was also observed previously in the <italic>C. gracilis</italic> PSI-FCPI structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), where it was modeled as polyalanines and referred to as either Unknown1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) or PsaS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Psa29 exhibits a unique structure distinct from the other PSI subunits in the <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> PSI-FCPI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, Fig. S4C) and engages in multiple interactions with PsaB, PsaC, PsaD, and PsaL at distances of 2.5–3.2 Å (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B–G</xref>). Sequence analyses suggest that Psa29 has undergone evolutionary divergence between Bacillariophyceae (diatoms) and Bolidophyceae, the latter of which is a sister group of diatoms within Stramenopiles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>), although this subunit has not been found in other organisms. The arrangement of PSI subunits in the <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> PSI-FCPI is virtually identical to that in the <italic>C. gracilis</italic> PSI-FCPI structures already reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). However, the functional and physiological roles of Psa29 remain unclear at present. It is evident that Psa29 does not have any pigments, quinones, or metal complexes, suggesting no contribution of Psa29 to electron transfer reactions within PSI. Further mutagenesis studies will be necessary to investigate the role of Psa29 in diatom photosynthesis.</p>

<p>The number and arrangement of Chls and Cars within the PSI core in the <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> PSI-FCPI structure (Fig. S4D, E) are largely similar to those in the <italic>C. gracilis</italic> PSI-FCPI structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>).

It is important to note that <italic>RedCAP</italic> is not included among the 44 <italic>Lhc</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) but is classified within the LHC protein superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). For the assignment of each FCPI subunit, we focused on characteristic amino acid residues derived from their cryo-EM map, especially S61/V62/Q63 in FCPI-1; A70/R71/W72 in FCPI-2; Y64/R65/E66 in FCPI-3; M63/R64/Y65 in FCPI-4; and A62/R63/R64 in FCPI-5 (Fig. S5). The root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of the structures between FCPI-4 and the other four FCPIs range from 1.91 to 3.73 Å (Table S4).</p>
<p>Each FCPI subunit binds several Chl and Car molecules: 7 Chls <italic>a</italic>/1 Chl <italic>c</italic>/2 Fxs/3 Ddxs/2 BCRs in FCPI-1; 10 Chls <italic>a</italic>/1 Chl <italic>c</italic>/3 Fxs/1 Ddx in FCPI-2; 7 Chls <italic>a</italic>/3 Chls <italic>c</italic>/2 Fxs/2 Ddxs in FCPI-3; 11 Chls <italic>a</italic>/2 Chls <italic>c</italic>/4 Fxs in FCPI-4; and 10 Chls <italic>a</italic>/4 Fxs/1 Ddx in FCPI-5 (Fig. S6A–E, Table S3). The axial ligands of the central Mg atoms of Chls within each FCPI are primarily provided by the main and side chains of amino acid residues (Table S5). Potential excitation-energy-transfer pathways can be proposed based on the close physical interactions among Chls between FCPI-3 and PsaA, between FCPI-3 and PsaL, between FCPI-1 and PsaI, and between FCPI-2 and PsaB (Fig. S7).</p>

<title>Structural characteristics of RedCAP and its evolutionary implications</title>
<p>Among the FCPI subunits, only FCPI-1 contains two BCRs in addition to Fxs and Ddxs (Fig. S6A, F). This is the first report of BCR binding to FCPIs in diatoms. FCPI-1 is identified as RedCAP, a member of the LHC protein superfamily but distinct from the LHC protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>); however, the functional and physiological roles of RedCAP remain unknown. FCPI-1 is positioned near PsaB, PsaI, and PsaL through protein-protein interactions with these subunits on both the stromal and lumenal sides (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). At the stromal side, I138 and S139 of FCPI-1 interact with K121, G122, and F125 of PsaL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), whereas at the lumenal side, multiple interactions occur between I109 of FCPI-1 and F5 of PsaI, between T105/L106/T108 of FCPI-1 and W92/P94/F96 of PsaB, and between E102/W103 of FCPI-1 and S71/I73 of PsaL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The protein-protein interactions at the lumenal side (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) appear to be caused by a loop structure of FCPI-1 from Q96 to T116 (pink in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), which is unique to FCPI-1 but absent in the other four FCPI subunits (pink in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). This loop structure is inserted into a cavity formed by PsaB, PsaI, and PsaL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, D</xref>). These findings indicate that the Q96–T116 loop of FCPI-1 specifically recognizes and binds to the cavity provided by the PSI subunits.</p>

As previously discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), we proposed that CgRedCAP may bind to the <italic>C. gracilis</italic> PSI core at a site similar to LHCI-1 in the red alga <italic>C. caldarium</italic> PSI-LHCI through sequence analysis. This site corresponds to the FCPI-1 site in the PSI-FCPI of <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> in this study. A sequence alignment between RedCAP of <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> (TpRedCAP) and CgRedCAP is shown in Fig. S8A, exhibiting a 72% sequence similarity. CgRedCAP contains a protein motif, Q106–I113 (QWGTLATI), corresponding to E102–I109 (EWGTLATI) in TpRedCAP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). These findings suggest the potential binding of CgRedCAP to PSI in <italic>C. gracilis</italic> at a position similar to FCPI-1 in the <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> PSI-FCPI structure. However, it remains unclear (i) whether CgRedCAP is indeed bound to the <italic>C. gracilis</italic> PSI-FCPI supercomplex and (ii) if a loop structure corresponding to the Q96–T116 loop of TpRedCAP exists in CgRedCAP. Further structural studies of the <italic>C. gracilis</italic> PSI-FCPI are required to elucidate the molecular assembly mechanism of diatom RedCAPs.</p>

Multiple sequence alignments of TpRedCAP with PpRedCAP and CpRedCAP are shown in Fig. S8C, revealing sequence similarities of 39% and 60%, respectively. PpRedCAP contains a protein motif of V105–L112 (VWGPLAQL), while CpRedCAP has a protein motif of Q117–A124 (QWGPLASA). These motifs correspond to E102–I109 (EWGTLATI) in TpRedCAP; however, the sequence conservation between TpRedCAP and PpRedCAP/CpRedCAP is lower than between TpRedCAP and CgRedCAP. Among the four RedCAPs, the amino acids Trp, Gly, Leu, and Ala are conserved in the protein motifs (xWGxLAxx), implying that this conserved loop structure contributes to the binding of RedCAP to PSI across the red-lineage algae.</p>

<title>Molecular insights into the assembly of FCPIs in diatom PSI-FCPI supercomplexes</title>
<p>To evaluate the molecular assembly of FCPI subunits in the <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> PSI-FCPI structure, we focused on protein-protein interactions based on their close proximities (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>–<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and the amino acid residues in non-conserved regions among 44 FCPs (Fig. S9–S12). This approach is based on the premise that selective associations of FCPIs with PSI require specific amino acid residues unique to each FCPI. Protein-protein interactions among FCPI subunits, as well as between FCPI and PSI subunits, occur at both the stromal and lumenal sides (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>–<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), and are likely recognized by unique amino acid residues of FCPIs that are not conserved in each LHC subfamily (Fig. S9–S12).

<p>Phylogenetic analysis clearly showed that at the FCPI-1, 2, 3, and 5 sites in the <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> PSI-FCPI structure, TpRedCAP, TpLhcr3, TpLhcq10, and TpLhcq8 are orthologous to CgRedCAP, CgLhcr1, CgLhcr9, and CgLhcq12, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). The characteristic protein loops of TpRedCAP and CpRedCAP likely participate in interactions with PSI at the FCPI-1 site, as noted above (Fig. S8). At the FCPI-2 site, comparative analyses revealed that the amino acid residues facilitating interactions between TpLhcr3 and TpPsaB/TpPsaM closely parallel those observed in the CgLhcr1-CgPsaB and CgLhcr1-CgPsaM pairs (Fig. S13). Similarly, a high degree of similarity characterized the residues involved in the interaction pairs of TpLhcq10-TpPsaL/CgLhcr9-CgPsaL at the FCPI-3 site (Fig. S14A, B), as well as TpLhcq8-TpPsaL/CgLhcq12-CgPsaL at the FCPI-5 site (Fig. S14C, D), underscoring the conserved nature of these interactions. However, TpLhcf10 was not homologous to CgLhcf3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), despite both being located at the FCPI-4 site in their respective PSI-FCPI structures (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). These findings suggest that the two diatoms possess both a conserved mechanism of protein-protein interactions across characteristic protein motifs between FCPI and PSI subunits, and a different mechanism of interactions among FCPIs.</p>
<p>It is notable that the <italic>C. gracilis</italic> PSI-FCPI structure binds remarkably more FCPI subunits than that of <italic>T. pseudonana</italic>, e.g., 16 or 24 subunits in <italic>C. gracilis</italic> as reported in the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), versus 5 subunits in <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> in the present study. The reason for this difference remains unclear. One possibility is that some FCPI subunits are released during detergent solubilization in <italic>T. pseudonana</italic>, while they are retained in <italic>C. gracilis</italic>. Alternatively, the number of FCPI subunits may be inherently lower in <italic>T. pseudonana</italic>, which may reflect adaptations to different living environments. Further studies are needed to resolve this question.</p>

<title>Extension to molecular assembly of PSI-LHCI supercomplexes</title>
<p>The mechanisms of protein-protein interactions in diatom PSI-FCPI supercomplexes are likely developed by the specific binding of FCPs selected from 44 TpFCPs and 46 CgFCPs in addition to RedCAPs. Like a lock-and-key mechanism, one FCP cannot be substituted by another in forming the PSI-FCPI supercomplexes in the two diatoms; for example, TpLhcq10 binds specifically at the FCPI-3 site but not at the other sites such as FCPI-2. This selective binding mechanism of FCPIs may dictate the molecular assembly of PSI-FCPI. Importantly, the selective binding of FCPIs was identified for the first time by comparing the structures of PSI-FCPI supercomplexes and the amino acid sequences of FCPIs between the two diatom species. This approach can be extended to the LHC protein superfamily in the green and red lineages, enabling comparisons of protein structures and sequences of PSI-LHCI supercomplexes among closely related species. This, in turn, lays the foundation for elucidating the underlying mechanism of PSI-LHCI supercomplex assembly. Thus, this study will shed light on answering the evolutionary question of how LHCIs recognize their binding sites at PSI in photosynthetic organisms.</p>

The PSI-FCPI supercomplexes (4 µg of Chl) were solubilized in 3% lithium lauryl sulfate and 75 mM dithiothreitol for 10 min at 60°C, and then loaded onto the gel. A standard molecular weight marker (SP-0110; APRO Science) was used. The absorption spectrum of PSI-FCPI was measured at room temperature using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-2450; Shimadzu) (Fig. S1C), and the fluorescence emission spectrum of PSI-FCPI was measured at 77 K upon excitation at 430 nm using a spectrofluorometer (RF-5300PC; Shimadzu) (Fig. S1D). The pigment composition of PSI-FCPI was analyzed by HPLC following the method of Nagao et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), and the elution profile was monitored at 440 nm (Fig. S1E).</p>

<title>Cryo-EM data collection</title>
<p>A 3-μL aliquot of the <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> PSI-FCPI supercomplex (3.0 mg of Chl mL<sup>−1</sup>) in 20 mM MES-NaOH (pH 6.5) buffer containing 0.5 M betaine, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.03% β-DDM was applied to Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 Cu 300 mesh grids in the chamber of FEI Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The grid was then blotted with filter paper for 4 sec at 4°C under 100% humidity and plunged into liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen. The frozen grid was transferred to a CRYO ARM 300 electron microscope (JEOL) equipped with a cold-field emission gun operated at 300 kV. All image stacks were collected from 5 × 5 holes per stage adjustment to the central hole and image shifts were applied to the surrounding holes while maintaining an axial coma-free condition. The images were recorded using an in-column energy filter with a slit width of 20 eV at a nominal magnification of × 60,000 on a direct electron detector (Gatan K3, AMETEK). The nominal defocus range was −1.8 to −1.2 μm, and the physical pixel size corresponded to 0.752 Å. Each image stack was exposed at a dose rate of 21.46 e<sup>−</sup>Å<sup>−2</sup>sec<sup>−1</sup> for 2.33 sec in CDS mode, with dose-fractionated 50 movie frames. A total of 8,950 image stacks were collected.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM image processing</title>
<p>The resultant movie frames were aligned and summed using MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) to produce dose-weighted images. The contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation was performed using CTFFIND4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). All subsequent processes were carried out using RELION-4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). A total of 2,733,572 particles were automatically picked and subjected to reference-free 2D classification. From these, 1,132,721 particles were selected from well-defined 2D classes and further processed for 3D classification without imposing any symmetry. An initial model for the first 3D classification was generated <italic>de novo</italic> from the 2D classification. A 240-Å spherical mask was used during the 3D classification and refinement processes. As illustrated in Fig. S2C, the final PSI-FCPI structure was reconstructed from 75,667 particles. The overall resolution of the cryo-EM map was determined to be 2.30 Å, based on the gold-standard FSC curve with a cut-off value of 0.143 (Fig. S3A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Local resolutions were calculated using RELION (Fig. S3C).</p>

<title>Model building and refinement</title>
<p>Two types of the cryo-EM maps were employed for the model building of the PSI-FCPI supercomplex: a postprocessed map and a denoised map generated using Topaz version 0.2.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). The postprocessed map was denoised using a trained model over 100 epochs using two half-maps. Initial models of each subunit in the PSI-FCPI supercomplex were generated by ModelAngelo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) and subsequently inspected and manually adjusted against the maps with Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Each model was built based on interpretable features from the density maps at a contour level of 2.5 σ in both the denoised and postprocessed maps. For the assignment of Chls, Chls <italic>a</italic> and <italic>c</italic> were distinguished by inspecting the density map corresponding to the phytol chain at the least level not to link the map of Chls with that of noise. All Chls <italic>c</italic> were assigned as Chl <italic>c</italic>1 due to the inability to distinguish between Chl <italic>c</italic>1 and Chl <italic>c</italic>2 at the present resolution. For the assignment of Cars, Fx and Ddx were distinguished based on the density surrounding the head groups of Cars with the above threshold. The PSI-FCPI structure was refined using phenix.real_space_refine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) and Servalcat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>), incorporating geometric restraints for protein-cofactor coordination. The final model was validated with MolProbity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>), EMRinger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), and <italic>Q</italic>-score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). The statistics for all data collection and structure refinement are summarized in Table S1, S2. All structural figures were prepared using PyMOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>), UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), and UCSF ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Since the numbering of Chls, Cars, and other cofactors in this paper differs from those in the PDB data, the corresponding relationships are provided in Table S6–S8.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study presents a high-resolution cryoEM structure of the supercomplex between photosystem I (PSI) and fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins (FCPs) from the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana CCMP1335, revealing subunits, protein:protein interactions and pigments not previously seen in other diatoms or red/green photosynthetic lineages. Combining structural, sequence and phylogenetic analyses, the authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence of conserved motifs crucial for the binding of FCPs, accompanied by interesting speculation about the mechanisms governing the assembly of PSI-FCP supercomplexes in diatoms and their implications for related PSI-LHC supercomplexes in plants. The findings set the stage for functional experiments that will further advance the fields of photosynthesis, bioenergy, ocean biogeochemistry and evolutionary relationships between photosynthetic organisms.</p>

<p>The authors present the cryo-EM structure of PSI-fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins (FCPs) supercomplex from the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana CCMP1335 at a global resolution of 2.3 Å. This exceptional resolution allows the authors to construct a near-atomic model of the entire supercomplex and elucidate the molecular details of FCPs arrangement. The high-resolution structure reveals subunits not previously identified in earlier reconstructions and models, as well as sequence analysis of PSI-FCPIs from other diatoms and red algae. Additionally, the authors use their model in conjunction with a phylogenetic analysis to compare and contrast the structural features of the T. pseudonana supercomplex with those of Chaetoceros gracilis, uncovering key structural features that contribute to the efficiency of light energy conversion in diatoms.</p>

<p>The authors present the cryo-EM structure of of PSI-fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins (FCPs) supercomplex from the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana CCMP1335 at a global resolution of 2.3 Å. This exceptional resolution allows the authors to construct a near-atomic model of the entire supercomplex and elucidate the molecular details of FCPs arrangement. The high-resolution structure reveals subunits not previously identified in earlier reconstructions and models, as well as sequence analysis of PSI-FCPIs from other diatoms and red algae. Additionally, the authors use their model in conjunction with a phylogenetic analysis to compare and contrast the structural features of the T. pseudonana supercomplex with those of Chaetoceros gracilis, uncovering key structural features that contribute to the efficiency of light energy conversion in diatoms.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript elucidated the cryo-electron microscopic structure of a PSI supercomplex incorporating fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins (FCPs), designated as PSI-FCPI, isolated from the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana CCMP1335. Combining structural, sequence, and phylogenetic analyses, the authors provided solid evidence to reveal the evolutionary conservation of protein motifs crucial for the selective binding of individual FCPI subunits and provided valuable information about the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly and selective binding of FCPIs in diatoms.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well-written and presented clearly as well as consistently. The supplemental figures are also of high quality.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Only minor comments (provided in recommendations for authors) to help improve the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Understanding the structure and function of the photosynthetic machinery is crucial for grasping its mode of action. Photosystem I (PSI) plays a vital role in light-driven electron transfer, which is essential for generating cellular reducing power. A primary strategy to mitigate light and environmental stresses involves incorporating peripheral light-harvesting proteins. Among various lineages, the number of LHCIs and their protein and pigment compositions differ significantly in PSI-LHCI structures. However, it is still unclear how LHCIs recognize their specific binding sites in the PSI core. This study aims to address this question by obtaining a high-resolution structure of the PSI supercomplex, including fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins (FCPs), referred to as PSI-FCPI, isolated from the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. Through structural and sequence analyses, distinct protein-protein interactions are identified at the interfaces between FCPI and PSI subunits, as well as among FCPI subunits themselves.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The primary strength of this work lies in its superb isolation and structural determination, followed by clear discussion and conclusions. However, the interactions among the protein complexes and their relevance in formulating general rules are not definitively established. While efficiency is a crucial aspect, preventing damage is equally important, and currently, we cannot infer this from the provided structures.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank you very much for your highly positive evaluation and comments on our manuscript. This study is aimed to decipher the interactions among different protein subunits within the PSI-FCPI supercomplex, from which we wish to draw their relevance in formulating general rules. While we agree that damage is equally important, it is unclear to us what kind of damage you are mentioning, and we consider that this may need to be treated in another publication, as we cannot elucidate everything in one paper.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Line 69: &quot;Diatoms are one of the most important phytoplankton in aquatic environments and contribute to the primary production in the ocean remarkably.&quot; Check the sentence, something is missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We modified the sentence as follow:</p>
<p>&quot;Diatoms are among the most essential phytoplankton in aquatic environments, playing a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, supporting marine food webs, and contributing significantly to nutrient cycling, thus ensuring the health and sustainability of marine ecosystems&quot;</p>

<p>(2) Supplementary Figure 1B: The SDS-PAGE gel shows multiple bands. Do the authors know the identity of these proteins, or have they considered analyzing the bands using mass spectrometry? The band at ~17 kDa is particularly intense. Could you comment on this? Have you tried running a Native-PAGE gel?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not identify protein bands by MS analysis. The protein bands in the PSI-FCPI supercomplex of this diatom have been identified by Ikeda et al. 2013. The protein bands of our sample were similar to those of Ikeda et al. 2013. To explain this, we modified the sentences and cited Ikeda et al. 2013 in the revised manuscript (lines 89-91).</p>
<p>&quot;The PSI-FCPI supercomplexes were purified from the diatom <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> CCMP1335 and analyzed by biochemical and spectroscopic techniques (Fig. S1). Notably, the protein bands of PSI-FCPI closely resembled those reported in a previous study (31).&quot;</p>
<p>The ~17 kDa protein band appears to be FCPIs, which was identified in Ikeda et al. 2013. We did not perform BN-PAGE of this sample; however, we performed trehalose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. S1A).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Can the authors comment on the position of the FCPI subunits in the PSI supercomplex in diatoms compared to the arrangement of LHCIs in complex with PSI in cyanobacteria, green algae, and angiosperms? This information would be useful to incorporate into the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We previously compared the PSI-FCPI structures of the diatom <italic>C. gracilis</italic> to the PSI-LHCI structures of land plant, green alga, and red alga (Nagao et al., 2020). Also, Xu et al. 2020 compared the <italic>C. gracilis</italic> PSI-FCPI structure to the PSI-LHCI structures of land plant, green alga, and red alga. The binding sites between FCPIs and LHCIs are conserved to some extent. However, our recent study revealed that no orthologous relationship exists among LHCs bound to PSI between primitive red algae and diatoms (Kato et al., 2024). Consequently, we found that the information obtained from structural comparisons alone is extremely limited. To avoid misinterpretation, this study focused on comparing the structures and amino acid sequences of FCPIs between <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> and <italic>C. gracilis</italic>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Line 104: Despite achieving high resolution, the authors modeled only six lipid densities (the PDB model contains actually 9 lipids, you should correct it in the text). Do you believe this is due to the detergent used for purification? Can you comment on the position, identity, and potential role of the lipids within your model?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are 6 lipids associated with the PSI core and 3 with FCP, giving rise to a total of 9 lipids. We have described it in our original text (lines 102-104 in the modified manuscript). Additionally, our structure reveals unidentified densities which likely represent lipids; they are modeled as 88 unknown lipids (UNLs). Thus, there are more lipids in the supercomplex. However, we also observed 4 β-DDM molecules (LMT) in the structure, which are used as detergents. Thus, it is possible that some lipids have dissociated and replaced by detergents. Many of the observed lipids are located between subunits, likely contributing to the stabilization of the complex.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Line 111: The global resolution is very high. Why does the unknown protein have such low resolution that it was impossible to model it properly and perform de novo identification from the density map? Is it due to a lower abundance of particles with this subunit bound? Have you tried improving this with 3D classification/ focus refinement /density modification?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Unknown subunit (UNK) is located peripherally, and its density is significantly lower compared to the neighboring subunits, which may suggest a low abundance. We applied density modification using Topaz for 3D map denoising, but the effect was minimal. As the low abundance of UNK may be the cause, 3D classification and focus refinement also had limited impact.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Figure 2A: It would be useful to show the density map for the subunit together with the model, especially to demonstrate visualization of the long loop.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added the model and map of Psa29 to Figure S4C in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Given the proximity of Psa29 to PsaC, is the protein involved in electron shuttling? If so, could you comment on this? In line 131, you state that Psa29 was not found in other organisms. Can the authors speculate on the potential role of this protein in diatoms?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have no idea about the function of Psa29 at present. However, Psa29 does not contain any cofactors, indicating no contribution of it to electron transfer reactions. To understand the function of Psa29, a deletion mutant of this gene is required for examining its functional and physiological roles in diatom photosynthesis. To explain this, we added the following sentences to the revised manuscript (lines 129-133):</p>
<p>&quot;However, the functional and physiological roles of Psa29 remain unclear at present. It is evident that Psa29 does not have any pigments, quinones, or metal complexes, suggesting no contribution of Psa29 to electron transfer reactions within PSI. Further mutagenesis studies will be necessary to investigate the role of Psa29 in diatom photosynthesis.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Line 163: &quot;Among the FCPI subunits, only FCPI-1 has BCRs in addition to Fxs and Ddxs (Figure S6A). FCPI-1 is a RedCAP, which belongs to the LHC protein superfamily but is distinct from the LHC protein family (6, 7).&quot; It would be useful if the authors could add the carotenoid model embedded in the cryoEM density map to the figure to show the features that led to modeling BCR instead of other carotenoids. Additionally, it would be helpful to include in the text why RedCAPs differ from LHCIs and their proposed role.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added the model and map of two BCRs in FCPI-1 (RedCAP) to Figure S4F in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Phylogenetic analysis showed that RedCAPs are distinct from the LHC protein family. This has been explained in lines 163-164. Also, the functional and physiological roles of RedCAP remain unclear. To explain this, we added the sentence &quot;; however, the functional and physiological roles of RedCAP remain unclear&quot; to the revised manuscript (lines 164-165).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Line 185: &quot;However, it is unknown (i) whether CgRedCAP is indeed bound to the C. gracilis PSI-FCPI supercomplex and (ii) if a loop structure corresponding to the Q96-T116 loop of TpRedCAP exists in CgRedCAP.&quot; Have the authors attempted to model the protein using AlphaFold? If so, are there significant differences? Could you speculate on the absence of RedCAP in C. gracilis? Do you believe it is due to using a different detergent or related to environmental factors?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not model CgRedCAP using AlphaFold. Our recent study “Kato et al. 2024” proposed that CgRedCAP binds to the LHCI-1 site in the PSI-FCPI structure based on sequence comparison. There are two types of PSI-FCPI supercomplexes, one having 16 FCPIs and the other having 24 FCPs, from <italic>C. gracilis</italic>. The different antenna sizes may depend on the growth conditions of <italic>C. gracilis</italic> (Nagao et al. 2020). These explanations were already described in the manuscript (lines 243-246).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) Line 193: Figure 8 is mentioned before Figures 4-7.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for the mistake of Figure number. Figure 8 is Supplementary Figure 8, so that we modified Fig. S8B in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) Line 223: FCPI-4 interacts only with FCPI-5, primarily through the interaction of Y196/4 with the FCPI-5 backbone. Is this interaction facilitated by other factors such as lipids, carotenoids, or other ligands? Also, FCPI-4 occupies a peculiar position compared to other LHCIs proteins (it is peripheral to FCPI-4 and FCPI-5). Do you believe this could be due to a transient interaction with the complex? Could the presence of this protein be related to the growth conditions experienced by the plant? Are there any literature reports on environmental conditions influencing FCPI arrangements? Including this information in the text would be interesting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Y196/4 interacts with only backbones by hydrogen-bond interactions; therefore, other cofactors do not contribute to the interactions.</p>
<p>We do not believe that the interaction of FCPI-4 is transient; rather, this binding appears to be stable within the complex. Given that the PSI-FCPI supercomplexes were isolated by anion exchange chromatography, FCPI-4 and FCPI-5 are tightly associated within this complex. However, it is important to note that the expression of diatom FCPI proteins can indeed vary depending on growth conditions, as highlighted in our previous study (Nagao et al., 2020). While the peculiar position of FCPI-4 may not be directly related to transient interactions, environmental conditions could still influence the overall arrangement and expression levels of FCPIs. This information has already been described in the manuscript (lines 243-246).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) Given the high resolution of your map, the overall model quality does not seem to match the map quality. Specifically, the clash score (10) and sidechain outliers (3%) are elevated. Could you comment on this? Do you believe it is related to the high number of ligands?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our structure contains a total of 295 ligands, including cofactors, detergents, and unknown lipids. We believe the high clash score and number of sidechain outliers are due to the large number of ligands present.</p>

<p>(13) Supplementary Figure 2: You should show the 3D classes that were discarded.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to your comment, we added the 3D classes that were discarded and the sentence &quot;Red boxes highlight selected particles from each 3D classification.&quot; to Figure S2 and its legend in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(14) Which masks were used for refinement? How were they generated, and which parameters were chosen? This information should be added to the Materials and Methods section. You should show the masks used during classification, for example.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used a 240 Å spherical mask for refinement and classification, without applying any reference mask as input. To explain this, we added the corresponding sentence to Methods in the revised manuscript (lines 347-348) as follow:</p>
<p>&quot;A 240-Å spherical mask was used during the 3D classification and refinement processes.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(15) Were any extra proteins detected in the early stages of the cryoEM analysis (i.e., 2D classification) that were discarded? Could you visualize the superior oligomeric states of the supercomplex?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the single-particle analysis, no larger particles than the analyzed complex were detected. The results of 2D classification using a sufficiently large spherical mask with a diameter of 320 Å are shown below.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I have some minor comments below to help improve the manuscript. The line numbers below refer to those in the Word version of the manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) Figure 1 legend, line 559, &quot;membrane normal&quot;? Panel A and B, structures with the same colors, do they refer to the closely related or interacted parts? For example, the red color for FCP1-1 in A and PsaA in B. If not, the authors may want to clarify it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The term 'membrane normal' refers to the direction perpendicular to the surface of a membrane. It is a concept frequently used in physics and biology to describe the orientation relative to the membrane's plane.</p>
<p>We do not refer to either the closely related or interacted parts used in Figure 1. According to your comments, the colors of subunits were revised in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Line 109-117. &quot;Psa28 is a novel subunit found in the C. gracilis PSI-FCPI structure, and its name follows the nomenclature as suggested previously (31).... After psaZ, the newly identified genes should be named psa27, psa28, etc., and the corresponding proteins are called Psa27, Psa28, etc... Psa28 was also named PsaR in the PSI-FCPI structure of C. gracilis (16)&quot;. It is confusing. Was Psa28 named twice, PsaR and Psa28? It would be helpful to add a simple explanation here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to your comment, we modified the sentence as follow (lines 117-118):</p>
<p>&quot; However, Xu et al. named the subunit as PsaR in the PSI-FCPI structure of <italic>C. gracilis</italic> &quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>BCR112 was misnumbered; the correct number is BCR103. In response to your comments, we revised Figure S4C and D by labeling the characteristic pigments in the revised manuscript.</p>
