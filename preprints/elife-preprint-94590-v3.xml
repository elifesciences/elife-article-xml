<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Macrophages are crucial in the body’s inflammatory response, with tightly regulated functions for optimal immune system performance. Our study reveals that the RAS-p110α signalling pathway, known for its involvement in various biological processes and tumorigenesis, regulates two vital aspects of the inflammatory response in macrophages: the initial monocyte movement and later-stage lysosomal function. Disrupting this pathway, either in a mouse model or through drug intervention, hampers the inflammatory response, leading to delayed resolution and the development of more severe acute inflammatory reactions in live models. This discovery uncovers a previously unknown role of the p110α isoform in immune regulation within macrophages, offering insight into the complex mechanisms governing their function during inflammation and opening new avenues for modulating inflammatory responses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) are a family of lipid kinases that phosphorylate phosphatidylinositides (Ptdlns) at the 3’-hydroxyl group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Upon activation, PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>). PIP<sub>3</sub> serves as a second messenger that recruits proteins containing pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, such as Akt (also known as protein kinase B)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. This activation of PI3K regulate various cellular functions, including cell proliferation, growth, survival, motility, inflammation, and metabolism, among others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. In macrophages, the activation of PI3K-Akt signalling is crucial to restrict inflammation and to promote anti-inflammatory responses in Toll Like Receptors (TLR)-induced macrophages, contributing to macrophage polarization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>PI3Ks are heterodimeric lipid kinases composed of catalytic and adaptor/regulatory subunits that can be categorized into three classes based on their structures and substrate specificities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Class I catalytic isoforms, including p110α, p110β, p110γ, and p110δ, play essential roles in integrating signals from growth factors, cytokines, and other environmental cues. While p110α and p110β are ubiquitously expressed, p110δ and p110γ are largely restricted to the myeloid and lymphoid lineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. While p110α is primarily associated with cell growth regulation and survival in epithelial cells, it must be considered that this isoform is also expressed in immune cells, including macrophages. The role played by p110α in macrophages is not well understood, although some studies have suggested that it might regulate the survival and the regulation of the phagocytic activity of macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. In the context of cancer, impairment of RAS binding to p110α in macrophages results in reduced recruitment of macrophages to the tumour site <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Additionally, this disruption leads to a change in macrophage polarization, favouring a more proinflammatory M1 state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that p110α plays a crucial role in regulating macrophage-dependent functions. However, despite these insights, the precise impact of p110α on macrophage function and the underlying molecular mechanisms influencing the inflammatory response are not yet fully understood.</p>
<p>Inflammation is a complex and tightly regulated series of events triggered by various stimuli such as pathogens, harmful mechanical and chemical agents, and autoimmune reactions. The inflammatory response primarily occurs in vascularized connective tissues, involving a dynamic interplay of plasma components, circulating cells, blood vessels, and cellular and extracellular factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. During inflammation, mediators released by recruited leukocytes orchestrate a response that aims to facilitate tissue repair and protect the body against harmful stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Macrophages play a vital role in the inflammatory response by performing functions such as antigen presentation, phagocytosis, and immunomodulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Their role begin with the active recruitment of monocytes from the bloodstream to the site of infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> where they differentiate into macrophages and recognize microbes and cellular debris through specific mechanisms. Macrophages subsequently actively participate in phagocytosis, a vital process involving the internalization and elimination of pathogens. Microbial destruction predominantly takes place within lysosomes and phagolysosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. At later stages of inflammation, macrophages contribute to the resolution of inflammation, thus preventing progression from acute to persistent inflammation that would cause additional tissue damage.</p>
<p>In this study we have used a combination of cell biology techniques and animal models to better understand the role of RAS-dependent activation of p110α at the different stages of the inflammatory response. Our findings show that RAS-p110α signalling plays a key role in the initial stages of inflammation, facilitating the extravasation of monocytes from the bloodstream by promoting the necessary cytoskeletal changes. Subsequently, RAS-p110α has a crucial role in lysosomal acidification and activation of cathepsins, which are indispensable for efficient degradation of lysosomal cargo; when these functions are impaired, prolonged acute inflammatory responses and delayed resolution steps are observed. These results significantly enhance our understanding of the complex mechanisms governing the immune response to inflammation, emphasizing the pivotal role played by RAS-p110α signalling in orchestrating proper monocyte extravasation and maintaining optimal lysosomal function.</p>

<title>Disruption of RAS-p110α causes prolonged and more acute responses to inflammatory stress <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Previous data suggested that, in a tumoral setting, somatic disruption of RAS-p110α prevents macrophage recruitment to tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and favours polarization of macrophages to a proinflammatory phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, suggesting a possible role for p110α in macrophage function. To determine whether RAS-dependent activation of p110α participates in innate or adaptive immune responses to inflammation in macrophages, we used an established mouse model designed for the tamoxifen-inducible disruption of RAS binding to p110α<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 1-Supplement 1A</xref>). This mouse model introduces two-point mutations, T208D and K227A, in the RAS Binding Domain (RBD) of the endogenous Pik3ca allele (<italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD</sup></italic>), enabling the selective disruption of the RAS-p110α interaction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Wild-type (<italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT</sup></italic>) and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD</sup></italic> mice were bred with mice containing a floxed <italic>Pik3ca</italic> allele<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, along with a strain containing a conditional Cre recombinase (Cre-ERT2) allele targeted to the ubiquitously expressed Rosa26 locus. The resulting Pik3ca<sup>WT/Flox</sup> and Pik3ca<sup>RBD/Flox</sup> mice displayed no discernible phenotype and exhibited behavior consistent with Pik3ca<sup>WT</sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Activation of Cre-recombinase by tamoxifen led to the excision of the floxed <italic>Pik3ca</italic> allele, resulting in mice expressing either one <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT</sup></italic> allele (<italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic>) or one Pik3ca<sup>RBD</sup> allele (<italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. This inducible genetic manipulation strategy allows us to selectively disrupt the RAS-p110α interaction in a controlled and temporally regulated manner, providing a valuable tool for dissecting the contributions of this pathway to immune responses in the context of inflammation.</p>
<p>Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) were generated from tibias and femurs of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/Flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/Flox</sup></italic> mice, ensuring efficient removal of the floxed allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 1-Supplement 1B</xref>). Subsequently, these BMDMs were induced towards a proinflammatory state through stimulation with LPS and IFN-γ. To assess the impact of RAS-p110α binding deficiency on inflammatory intracellular signalling, we first examined Akt activation. The results revealed a decrease in Akt activation levels under inflammatory conditions in BMDMs lacking RAS-p110α binding, while no discernible change was observed in ERK activation, another well-known RAS effector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 1-Supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">D</xref>). Interestingly, the decrease in Akt activation was accompanied by a decrease in the activation of NF-κB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Given the role of p65 in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> we next analyzed the expression of various inflammation mediators using a cytokine array in unstimulated and LPS- and IFN-γ-stimulated macrophages. Results showed that, under unstimulated conditions, RAS-PI3K disruption decreases the expression of IP-10, MIP-1α (Ccl3), JE (Ccl2/MCP1), IL-16, and IL-12p70, with no upregulated cytokines observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 1-Supplement 1E</xref>). The downregulation of IP-10, MIP-1α, and JE indicates an impaired ability to recruit monocytes, macrophages, and T cells to sites of inflammation. This suggests that macrophages lacking RAS-PI3K interaction may have a reduced capacity to mount a robust immune response, particularly in recruiting and activating essential immune cells needed to combat pathogens or initiate inflammation.</p>
<p>Regarding LP +IFN-γ stimulated macrophages, results showed a decrease in the expression of IL-1β and IL-17, key drivers of pro-inflammatory responses, and an upregulation of IL-7, Ilra, JE, BLC, I-309, Eotaxin, and G-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 1-Supplement 1F</xref>). Elevated levels of these factors are associated with enhanced chemotactic signals and regulatory functions. Thus, the cytokine and chemokine expression profile observed in RAS-PI3K deficient macrophages suggests impaired pro-inflammatory responses and altered immune cell recruitment patterns, potentially influencing the resolution of inflammation and tissue repair processes.</p>
<p>Next we assessed whether the absence of RAS binding to p110α affects the ability of BMDMs to acquire a pro-inflammatory state characterized by increased expression of markers such as CD80, CD86, and MHCII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. To assess this, <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic>and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDMs were stimulated with LPS+IFN-γ, followed by flow cytometry analysis. Expression levels of CD80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 1-Supplement 1G</xref>), CD86 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 1-Supplement 1H</xref>), and MCHII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 1-Supplement 1I</xref>) were examined. No significant differences were observed in the expression levels of any of these markers between the two genotypes under study.</p>
<p>Consequently, our next objective was to investigate whether in vivo disruption of RAS-p110α might lead to altered inflammatory responses. To address this, we administered tamoxifen to 10-12-week-old <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/flox</sup></italic> mice with tamoxifen and, after a two-week interval, conducted a paw swelling assay. In this assay, zymosan (10 μg/μl) or PBS was injected into the hind paws of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> mice with paw thickness measured at regular intervals over a 5-day period. The results revealed a significant increase in paw inflammation in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice compared to <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> mice, evident from the earlier time points measured and persisting throughout the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D and 1E</xref>). Paws from the <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/flox</sup></italic> mice, which had not received tamoxifen, exhibited comparable levels of inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 1-Supplement 1J</xref>). This reaffirms that the absence of p110α triggers a significant alteration in the inflammatory response and confirms that <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/flox</sup></italic> mice do not show any phenotype, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Additionally, analysis of the blood sedimentation rate, a reliable indicator of systemic inflammation levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, showed a lower basal sedimentation ratio in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice under PBS-treated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 1-Supplement 1K</xref>). Following zymosan injection, both genotypes exhibited an increase in sedimentation rate, but the rise was more pronounced in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice, indicating a heightened systemic inflammatory response. These findings underscore that disruption of RAS-p110α interaction results in an exacerbated inflammatory state, reflected in both localized paw inflammation and systemic inflammatory mediator levels.</p>
<p>To delve deeper into the inflammatory response induced by zymosan, we collected paw samples at two- and five-days post-injection and conducted Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin (H&amp;E) studies. This approach enabled a comprehensive analysis, allowing us not only to scrutinize the early stages of inflammation but also to monitor the subsequent resolution phase of the inflammatory process. Paws obtained from mice injected with zymosan for 2 days displayed extensive areas of damaged connective tissue in both <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> paws (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Notably, the inflamed region in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice was larger compared to control samples. After 5 days of zymosan injection, there was a significant reduction in the inflamed area, although it remained comparatively larger in the paws from <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>). This observation suggests a prolonged and heightened inflammatory response in mice lacking RAS-p110α interaction, emphasizing the role of this interaction in the regulation of inflammatory processes.</p>
<p>The cellular composition within the inflammatory abscess offers crucial insights into the severity and progression of the disease. Close examination with the pathologist revealed features indicative of an acute inflammatory response, including an inflammatory abscess with elevated numbers of polymorphonuclear cells, primarily neutrophils, and macrophages displaying altered cell shape and increased cell death, accompanied by fibrin and chromatin deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E and F</xref>). Notably, <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited lower numbers of macrophages, a larger necrotic area with increased chromatin remnants, and reduced fibrin content compared to the paws from <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E and F</xref>). By day 5, paws from <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> mice showed a significant increase in the number of macrophages, a decrease in polymorphonuclear cells, and a nearly complete resolution of the necrotic area, indicating the initiation of the resolution phase. Moreover, there were abundant activated fibroblasts), suggesting active production of new connective tissue. In contrast, paws from <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited a delayed healing process characterized by a larger central area of polymorphonuclear cells, abundant fibrin deposits, reduced numbers of infiltrating macrophages, and limited fibroblast activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E and F</xref>). These findings collectively indicate an imbalance in the inflammatory response and a slower progression towards resolution in the absence of RAS-p110α interaction, emphasizing the pivotal role of this interaction in orchestrating an effective and timely resolution of inflammation.</p>
<p>To evaluate the presence of macrophages within the inflammatory lesion, we performed specific immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis using the macrophage-specific marker CD68 in paws from day 5, where more cellular preservation and initiation of the healing process had been observed. A notable decrease in the number of CD68-positive cells was observed in the inflamed abscess region of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>To further confirm the involvement of p110α signalling in the acute inflammatory response, <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/WT</sup></italic> mice were subjected to daily treatment with BYL719 (Alpelisib), a specific inhibitor of p110α isoform. After an initial 48-hour treatment period, the mice received injections of zymosan or PBS into their back-hind paws and were sacrificed 2 days later for analysis. Similar to what we had observed in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic>mice, the inflamed area in BYL719-treated mice exhibited a larger extension than the inflamed are from non-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 1-Supplement 1L</xref>). The central necrotic region was significantly larger in the BYL719-treated mice, and it contained large amount of apoptotic polymorphonuclear cells, lower number of macrophages, and increased deposits of chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1H</xref>) resembling the observations from <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice. Immunostaining for CD68 revealed a reduction in the number of macrophages present in the inflammatory abscess upon inhibition of p110α signalling with BYL719 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1I</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, our findings highlight that both genetic disruption of RAS-p110α interaction and pharmacological inhibition of p110α contribute to an expanded inflamed area and central necrotic region, concurrently reducing macrophage infiltration in a zymosan-induced inflammation model. These results collectively underscore the pivotal role of the p110α isoform of PI3K in orchestrating the resolution of inflammatory responses, emphasizing its significance in modulating the dynamics and outcomes of inflammatory processes.</p>

<title>Disruption of RAS binding to p110α impairs the number of inflammatory monocytes in blood and spleen</title>
<p>Given the decrease in macrophages observed in the inflammatory abscess, we next set out to determine whether disruption of RAS binding to p110α had an effect on the number of monocytes circulating in the blood of adult mice. <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/flox</sup></italic> mice were treated with tamoxifen at 12-14 weeks of age and 4 weeks later, blood was collected by cardiac puncture and immune populations were analysed by flow cytometry. To assess the effects of RAS-p110α disruption on immune populations, we employed a flow cytometry gating strategy as described in the Methods section. Briefly, CD45+ cells were initially gated to define the overall immune cell population. Within this population, B cells were identified by CD19+ CD11b-staining, and T cells were defined by CD3+ expression. Further differentiation of T cell subtypes (CD4+, CD8+, and double-negative T cells) was conducted based on CD4 and CD8 markers within the CD3+ cell population. Additionally, myeloid cells were gated as CD11b+ cells, with further identification of granulocytes and monocytes based on Ly6G and Ly6C expression. Specifically, granulocytes/neutrophils were characterized as Ly6G+ Ly6C+, classical monocytes as Ly6G- Ly6C+, and alternative monocytes as Ly6G- Ly6C- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 2-Supplement 2A</xref>). We found a decrease in the number of circulating classical (or inflammatory) monocytes (Ly6C<sup>Hi</sup>/Ly6G<sup>–</sup>/CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells) in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>) and no changes were observed in non-classical (or non-inflammatory) monocytes (Ly6C<sup>Lo</sup>/Ly6G<sup>–</sup>/CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Together with the decrease in inflammatory monocytes, we observed an increase in the number of neutrophils (Ly6C<sup>–</sup>/Ly6G<sup>+</sup>/CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 2-Supplement 3A</xref>). We did not detect differences in the numbers of T-cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 2-Supplement 3B</xref>) or B-cells (CD19<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 2-Supplement 3C</xref>) in the blood after the disruption of RAS binding to p110α. We also analysed these same cell populations in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/flox</sup></italic> mice and no differences were found (data not shown).</p>

<p>Since splenic monocytes resemble their blood counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> we next aimed at determining whether splenic monocyte population would also be altered after disruption of RAS p110α interaction. Flow cytometry from <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice was performed following the same gating strategy as described for blood samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 2-Supplement 2B</xref>). As observed in circulating blood, the number of classical monocytes (Ly6C<sup>Hi</sup>/Ly6G<sup>–</sup>/CD11b<sup>+</sup>) in the spleen decreased after disruption of RAS-p110α interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>) and no differences were found in non-classical activated monocytes (Ly6C<sup>Lo</sup>/ Ly6G<sup>–</sup> /CD11b<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>). We also checked the levels of resident macrophages present in the spleen and results showed that spleens from the <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice had a decrease in the number of differentiated macrophages (F4/80<sup>+</sup>/CD11b<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Analysis of macrophages in the white and red pulp of the spleen indicated that <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice had a significant decrease in the macrophage population in the former region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2F and 2G</xref>). No differences were found in the number of granulocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 2-Supplement 3D</xref>), B-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 2-Supplement 3E</xref>) or T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 2-Supplement 3F</xref>) present in the spleen between <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> mice. There were no differences in spleen size from <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> mice either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 2-Supplement 3G</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the decrease in the number of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages observed in blood and spleens of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice, we wondered if disruption of RAS activation of p110α could lead to a decrease in myeloid bone marrow precursors. Myeloid lineage descends from a common myeloid progenitor (CMP) in bone marrow and traverse into blood as mature cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. CMP differentiates into the Granulocyte-Macrophage Progenitor (GMP) and the Megakaryocyte-Erythroid Progenitor (MEP). The CMP can generate all types of myeloid colonies, whereas the GMP or the MEP produces only granulocyte macrophage (GM) or megakaryocyte erythrocyte (MegE) lineage cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 2-Supplement 3H</xref>). No significant differences were noted in the quantity of CMP progenitors within the bone marrow <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 2-Supplement 3I-L</xref>). This observation suggests that the variations observed in blood and spleen parameters are not attributable to impairments in progenitor fate.</p>
<p>Finally, bone marrow precursors from <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/flox</sup></italic> mice were differentiated into macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic>, and the number of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) was determined by flow cytometry analysis. No differences were found in the number of BMDMs obtained from <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 2-Supplement 3M</xref>), suggesting that the disruption of RAS-p110a signalling do not interfere with the ability of bone marrow precursors to differentiate to macrophages.</p>

<title>Disruption of RAS binding to p110α impairs monocyte transendothelial extravasation in response to inflammatory cues</title>
<p>The decrease in classical monocytes observed in the inflammatory abscess of paws from <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice may indicate a decreased ability to mount an effective immune response. We carried out transwell assays since they are widely used to quantify transendothelial migration. Fibroblasts were seeded in the lower chamber to provide a continuous supply of Ccl2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, as this cytokine is well known for its ability to drive chemotaxis of myeloid cells under inflammatory conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> or <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDMs were seeded in the upper chamber of the transwell. Additionally, we stimulated <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> or <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDMs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) to mimic/recapitulate the proinflammatory phenotype typically associated with bacterial infection that causes macrophage activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Results showed that in both unstimulated and LPS+IFN-γ stimulated BMDMs, a lower number of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs were able to go through the trans-well pore membranes compared to <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>).

<p>Extravasation entails the migration of monocytes through the endothelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, so we conducted random migration assays of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDMs growing in matrigel coated plates under unstimulated conditions or activated towards an inflammatory phenotype by addition of LPS and IFN-γ to the media. Analysis of the data revealed that, under pro-inflammatory conditions, <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs displayed a decrease in migration speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Migration was also evaluated in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/WT</sup></italic> BMDMs treated with BYL-719. Results confirmed a decrease in migration speed of macrophages upon treatment with BYL-719 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>) indicating that inhibition of p110α, either genetically or pharmacologically, reduces the ability of macrophages to migrate under inflammatory conditions.</p>
<p>To determine if disruption of RAS binding to p110α impairs monocyte ability to extravasate through the endothelium <italic>in vivo</italic> in response to an inflammatory stress, we analysed monocyte extravasation through the mesenteric vein in response to intraperitoneal Ccl2 injection. It is well established that loss of p110α function leads to significant impairment in endothelial and lymphatic system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, so in order to determine if monocytes from <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice presented an alteration in extravasation, we generated chimeric mice in which only the bone marrow were defective in RAS binding to p110α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>). For this, bone marrow from <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> or <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> mice was injected through the tail vein of irradiated LysM-GFP donor mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Engraftment of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> bone marrow could be followed by disappearance of the eGFP signal in donor mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 3-Supplement 4A</xref>).</p>
<p>Neutrophils (but no monocytes) were depleted using an anti-GR1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 3- Supplement 4B</xref>) to avoid interference with monocyte extravasation. Intraperitoneal injection of Ccl2 was performed in the peritoneum of the chimera mice to induce extravasation of monocytes through the mesenteric vein and rolling, adhesion and extravasation was measured by intravital microscopy. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated no differences in Ccr2 expression between <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 3-Supplement 4C</xref>). We observed that blocking RAS-p110α interaction did not induce a decrease in the number of rolling monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3F</xref>) or in the number of monocytes that adhere to the endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3G</xref>). However, when extravasation was measured, data showed that disruption of RAS binding to p110α caused a significant decrease in the number of monocytes that were capable of extravasating through the endothelium of the mesenteric vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3H</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, in order to determine whether the differences observed in the inflammatory response of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice were due to lack of monocyte extravasation, we repeated the zymosan paw swelling assay in the chimera mice. As previously, we observed that disruption of RAS-p110α only in the immune system led to higher inflammatory response and a delay in the initiation of the resolution phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3I</xref>).</p>

<title>Disruption of RAS-p110α activation in macrophages induces changes in cytoskeleton reorganization</title>
<p>During transendothelial migration, leukocytes undergo cytoskeletal rearrangements that allow them to squeeze through the tight spaces between endothelial cells and enter the underlying tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Therefore, we next sought to determine whether the differences observed in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs extravasation and migration were attributable to altered cytoskeletal dynamics. To do so, we first aimed at examining cell shape and spread in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDMs in pro-inflammatory conditions after LPS+IFN-γ treatment.

However, cell spread in LPS+IFNγ activated <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs was significantly decreased compared to that observed <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A and 4B</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs were more elongated and did not acquire the typical rounded shape known to be induced in macrophages after treatment with LPS+IFN-γ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A and 4C</xref>). We also analysed cell height and results showed that <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs are higher both in unstimulated conditions and after LPS+IFN-γ stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>Actin is a bona fide regulator of cell shape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, so we next aimed at exploring the actin cytoskeleton in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDMs. Actin fractionation assays were carried out in unstimulated or LPS+IFNγ activated <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDMs. Our results revealed that disruption of RAS-p110α binding caused a decrease in the F-actin pool in unstimulated BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>), with no changes observed in the G-actin pool when compared to matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Analysis of actin dynamics after activation with LPS+IFNγ showed that, in proinflammatory conditions, the F-actin pool is increased, as expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>). However, actin polymerization was significantly active in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs, leading to a striking increase in F-actin when compared to that observed in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>). In parallel, a decrease in the G-actin pool in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs was observed, suggesting an increase in the stabilization of F-actin after disruption of RAS binding to p110α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>We next sought to investigate whether the enhanced F-actin stabilization corresponded to increased cellular rigidity. Consequently, we measured the elastic modulus of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs, revealing a significant increase in cell stiffness following RAS-p110α disruption under both basal and proinflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4G</xref>). To validate that the heightened cell stiffness was attributed to p110α, we treated <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/WT</sup></italic> BMDMs with BYL-719 and observed an amplified elastic modulus in these cells when stimulated with LPS+IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4G</xref>), confirming that the inhibition of p110α indeed results in augmented cellular rigidity.</p>
<p>These observations led us to hypothesize that phagocytosis, which heavily relies on actin rearrangement, might also be affected in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the ability of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDMs to phagocytose fluorescent microspheres, Borrelia burgdorferi, and apoptotic cells. The results revealed varying outcomes depending on the target. When phagocytosing 1 μm non-opsonized green-fluorescent beads, <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs were less efficient at engulfing the microspheres compared to their WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 4-Supplement 5A</xref>). Similar results were obtained when <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/WT</sup></italic> BMDMs were treated with BYL-719 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 4-Supplement 5A</xref>). In contrast, no significant differences were observed between <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDMs in their ability to phagocytose Borrelia burgdorferi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 4-Supplement 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, we evaluated the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs over extended periods. There were no differences in the initial uptake of apoptotic cells between <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic>and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDMs. However, at later time points, <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs showed an accumulation of phagocytosed particles. Similar results were obtained when <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/WT</sup></italic> BMDMs were treated with BYL-719. These data suggest a delay in processing and degradation, indicating a potential role for RAS-p110α in the later stages of phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4H</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, our findings suggest that loss of RAS-p110α interaction leads to increased actin polymerization, resulting in stiffer and less deformable cells, which impairs phagocytic efficiency for certain targets. Specifically, RAS-p110α is important for the effective phagocytosis of non-biological particles and may also play a role in the proper processing and degradation of phagocytosed apoptotic cells. The differential effects on various phagocytic targets highlight the complexity of RAS-p110α’s role in macrophage biology and underscore the importance of cytoskeletal flexibility in efficient phagocytosis.</p>

<title>Disruption of RAS-p110α activation impacts the secretome of macrophages</title>
<p>Given our previous observations, we hypothesized that the cytoskeletal alterations observed after disruption of RAS-p110a interaction, may significantly impact the secretory functions of macrophages. The accumulation of apoptotic material in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs suggests a disruption in normal phagocytic processing, which could influence the release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. Thus, we analysed the secretome of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDMs both under steady state condition and during phagocytosis. We utilized apoptotic LKR10 cells, a murine lung cancer cell line, as the substrate in our phagocytosis assay. LKR10 cells were exposed to cisplatin for 16 h and apoptosis was confirmed by Western Blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 5-Supplement 6A</xref>). Our goal was to create a more physiologically relevant experimental setting that more closely mimics the complex nature of the inflammatory response. For the secretome analysis, macrophages were incubated with or without apoptotic cells for 16 h. Culture supernatants were collected, clarified, and subjected to label-free quantitative proteomics analysis.</p>
<p>A total of 127 peptides corresponding to 105 proteins (Supplementary File 1) showed differential expression between <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDM secretomes at steady state conditions. Additionally, 359 peptides corresponding to 210 proteins (Supplementary File 2) were present a significantly different levels in the secretomes of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDM during phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Next, we compared these peptides with the list of secreted proteins available at The Human Protein Atlas, and removed those that do not correspond to secreted proteins. After this step, 18 proteins were found to be differentially secreted by <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDM in steady state conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>), and 38 by <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDM during phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 5-Supplement 6B and 6C</xref>).

<p>Functional analysis of differentially secreted proteins in unstimulated BMDMs showed no significant pathways related to these group of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>). However, differentially secreted proteins in phagocytosing conditions were involved in two main biological processes: complement activation (C1qa, C1qb and C1qc connected through physical interaction and C3, C9 and Cfb through coexpression) and lysosome function, mainly cathepsins (Ctsd, Ctsb, Ctsz, Cst3, Psap, Anxa1 and Gsn) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Together, the complement cascade and lysosome function work in concert to provide an effective defence against pathogens and promote overall maintenance of cellular homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> and data from the secretome analysis of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDMs suggests that RAS activation of p110α may play a crucial role in the regulation of both response pathways.

<p>We hypothesised that the increase in Lamp1 expression in BMDMs lacking RAS-p110α interaction during phagocytosis could be attributed to aberrant lysosomal function and phagolysosome retention. Thus, we next evaluated lysosomal activity by using the lysosomotropic dye lysotracker red coupled with epifluorescence analysis, since it is specifically taken up by acidic organelles. As such, its accumulation is proportional to the number of acidic vesicles. Data analysis showed that disruption of RAS-PI3K in BMDMs leads to a significant decrease in lysotracker uptake, both in unstimulated conditions and also after activation with LPS+IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Similar results were obtained with control BMDMs treated with BYL719, the p110α specific inhibitor. Data analysis showed a decrease in the uptake of lysotracker after p110α inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>), further suggesting that loss of p110α function in BMDMs results in altered lysosomal pH. To confirm that lysosomal pH of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs was less acidic, we next stained <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDMs with Green lysosensor, a pH-sensitive dye that exhibit a pH-dependent increase in fluorescent intensity upon lysosomal acidification. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>, <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs presented attenuated fluorescent intensity both in unstimulated and activated when compared with that in the control group, indicating that their lysosomal content is less acidic than in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDMs.</p>
<p>Considering that <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> lysosomes were less acidic, we next investigated the expression level and activation of some of the cathepsins identified in the secretome analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>) by western blotting. Cathepsins play a critical role in lysosomal protein degradation. They are initially synthesized as inactive precursors and are activated through proteolysis in the lysosome at a low pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. We found a reduction in the expression and activation of cathepsin D and cathepsin B in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs upon stimulation with LPS+IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6D</xref>). This observation suggests that the impaired lysosomal pH observed in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs could potentially account for the observed decrease in cathepsin activity.</p>
<p>Acidification of lysosomes and cathepsin activation are critical steps for activation of the resolutive stage of the inflammatory response, so we next evaluated the ability of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDM’s lysosomal compartment to degrade internalised particles. We set up another phagocytosis assay in which <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDMs would phagocytose apoptotic cells that were transduced with GFP (which is pH sensitive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>) and also labelled with Celltracker Red CMTPX (pH insensitive). <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> BMDMs were allowed to engulf these apoptotic cells for 16 h and after this time, apoptotic cells were eliminated by washes and BMDMs were analysed by flow cytometry at different time points to measure GFP signal. Our results showed that GFP signal is lost significantly faster in control BMDMs than in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6E</xref>). As expected, we did not observe any decay in the red tracker signal. Collectively, these data evidence that <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> BMDMs exhibit a significant impairment in removing engulfed particles, that can be attributed to the absence of lysosome acidification.</p>
<p>We have shown a delayed clearance of apoptotic cells in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice after zymosan injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). This, together with previous data took us to analyse the levels of Cathepsin D in the inflamed abscess from the paws of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> mice. Results showed a significant decrease in the levels of Cathepsin D in the inflamed area of <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6F</xref>) and BYL719-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6G</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we provide compelling evidence that disruption of RAS-p110α signalling or chemical inhibition of p110α impairs response to inflammatory stresses due to defects in both monocyte extravasation during the early stages of the inflammatory response and decreased lysosomal function during the later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). Although RAS-p110α signaling disruption affects all the hematopoietic cells, several lines of evidence indicate that macrophages play a central role in the observed phenotype. In our chimera mice experiments, neutrophil depletion did not alter the reduced transendothelial extravasation, suggesting that macrophages are the primary cell type involved. Furthermore, in the paw edema model, macrophages were the population exhibiting the most significant functional defects. Together, these findings, along with the specific deficiencies observed in myeloid populations, support a predominant role of macrophages in mediating the impaired inflammatory response. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that other myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells or additional immune populations, may also contribute to the global phenotype and further analysis should be performed to address this.</p>

<caption><title>The role of RAS-p110α in macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses.</title>
<p>In the presence of functional RAS-p110α, monocytes efficiently migrate through the endothelium in response to inflammatory signals. Following extravasation, monocyte-derived and resident macrophages clear apoptotic cells via phagocytosis and lysosomal degradation, facilitating resolution of inflammation. In contrast, loss of RAS-p110α leads to cytoskeletal changes that hinder monocyte transendothelial migration. Additionally, resident macrophages exhibit impaired degradation of phagocytosed particles, resulting in unresolved inflammation and more severe acute inflammatory responses.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="3191814v5_fig7.tif" mime-subtype="tif" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Monocyte extravasation during the inflammatory response is a critical step that allows immune cells to reach the site of infection or injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Impairment on this process causes slower or inadequate immune response, as macrophages are crucial for detecting and engulfing pathogens or cellular debris at the site of inflammation, as well as delayed resolution of inflammation, resulting in prolonged inflammation and subsequent tissue damage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our data shows that RAS binding to p110α is involved in macrophage extravasation by modulating actin dynamics. During monocyte extravasation, actin filaments form actin-rich protrusions that are essential for monocyte migration across the endothelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Our data show that, during extravasation, RAS-p110α signalling regulates actin dynamics so monocytes are able to squeeze through endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The disruption of RAS-p110α in macrophages emerges as a pivotal determinant in cellular mechanics, elucidating a cascade of events resulting in increased F-actin levels. The increase in cytoskeletal components, particularly F-actin, causes a notable increase in cell stiffness and a concurrent decrease in cell deformability. The orchestration of these changes underscores the intricate balance in cytoskeletal dynamics. Notably, the regulatory role of Rho-GTPases comes into focus as potential mediators of this phenomenon. Rho-GTPases are well-known mediators of actin cytoskeletal rearrangements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, and their dysregulation is known to impact cell mechanics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. The observed increase in cell stiffness and deformability, may thus be governed by the modulation of Rho-GTPase activity. This intricate interplay provides a compelling avenue for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms through which RAS-p110α disruption influences Rho-GTPases, ultimately shaping the biomechanical properties of macrophages and may open avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting cytoskeletal dynamics in macrophages.</p>
<p>Monocyte extravasation shares many features with monocyte egression from the bone marrow. During monocyte egress, monocytes also undergo changes in cytoskeleton dynamics to detach from the sinusoidal endothelial cells and to migrate through the endothelial fenestrae and basement membrane into the bone marrow sinusoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Thus, the decrease in the number of classical monocytes in the <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice in blood may be due, at least in part, to a defect in the extravasation process. This result may also explain, at least partially, the lack of macrophage recruitment to lung tumours found in previous studies using the RBD mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our findings also revealed a crucial role of RAS-p110α activation in the acute phase of the inflammatory response by regulating effective lysosomal degradation of phagocytosed and engulfed material. Phagocytosis constitutes a vital step in the inflammatory response, whereby phagosomes bind to lysosomes to form phagolysosomes in which pathogens are eradicated to facilitate an appropriate host response. This response encompasses antigen presentation to engage T-cell responses, secretion of inflammatory mediators that guide the adaptive immune response, and initiation of tissue repair mechanisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Our data provide evidence that the activation of RAS-p110α signalling pathway is involved in the critical process of lysosomal acidification, which is essential for the efficient degradation of internalized particles and the activation of proteolytic enzymes, ultimately resulting in the formation of fully functional lysosomes. Consequently, lack of lysosome acidification impairs the expression and activation of important proteases such as cathepsin B and cathepsin D. The proper functioning of lysosomes is essential for mounting a robust response to inflammatory stress. Lysosomes play a central role in the breakdown of pathogens and dead cells by providing the necessary degradative enzymes and maintaining an acidic environment that facilitates the degradation of engulfed particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. When lysosomal function is compromised in macrophages, the degradation of phagocytosed material becomes impaired, leading to the accumulation of toxic debris. This accumulation subsequently triggers inflammation and causes damage to the surrounding tissues, leading to chronic inflammation and appearance of lysosomal storage diseases (LSD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our data showed that the disruption of Ras-p110α in macrophages presents a multifaceted impact in inflammatory response, notably manifesting as a reduction in NF-κB activation and cathepsin expression coupled with diminished lysosomal function. NF-κB, a pivotal regulator of inflammatory responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, is intricately linked to lysosomal dynamics, with lysosomes playing a crucial role in modulating NF-κB signalling through the degradation of relevant molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Additionally, the observed decrease in NF-κB activation aligns with the decline in lysosomal function, which has previously been suggested in previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. This bidirectional influence, where perturbations in lysosomal function coincide with alterations in NF-κB activity, underscores the intricate and contextdependent nature of this regulatory network, suggesting a plausible mechanistic interdependence. Our data suggest that disruption in Ras-p110α signalling cascade could trigger downstream effects impacting both NF-κB activity and lysosomal integrity. This intricate nexus between Ras-p110α signalling, NF-κB activation, cathepsin expression, and lysosomal function underscores the complexity of cellular regulatory networks. Further analysis of the molecular pathways connecting these observations holds the potential to reveal novel insights into the coordinated regulation of inflammatory and lysosomal processes in macrophages. Thus, further investigations are necessary to decipher the causal relationships and unravel the broader implications of Ras-p110α disruption in shaping these intricate cellular responses during the inflammatory response.</p>
<p>The possible functional link between the increased actin polymerization and lysosomal dysfunction observed in <italic>Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> mice remains an unanswered question. Lysosome acidification and actin polymerization are tightly interconnected processes that have pivotal roles in numerous cellular functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Studies have demonstrated that lysosome acidification can influence actin polymerization dynamics through the activation of specific actin-binding proteins and the modulation of actin-regulatory proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Conversely, disruption in lysosome acidification, such as impaired proton pump activity or lysosomal storage disorders, have been associated with changes in actin polymerization and the organization of the cytoskeleton. Notably, it has been reported that depolimeryzation of F-actin plays a crucial role in assembling the macromolecular components of the acidification machinery in nascent endosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Therefore, the intricate relationship between lysosome acidification and actin polymerization suggests a potential reciprocal influence, where perturbations in one process could impact the other. Further investigation is required to determine the precise regulatory mechanisms by which p110α influences both lysosome acidification and actin polymerization, whether it occurs in a linear manner or through separate pathways.</p>
<p>This study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms that govern the immune response to inflammation, particularly emphasizing the essential role of RAS-p110α signaling. Our results underscore the pivotal role of RAS-p110α signaling in both the initiation and resolution of inflammation. The impaired ability of RAS-PI3K-deficient monocytes and macrophages to effectively migrate, initiate a robust inflammatory response, and resolve inflammation highlights the critical importance of this pathway in maintaining immune homeostasis. The persistent inflammation observed in these models may contribute to the development and perpetuation of chronic inflammatory conditions. Given the centrality of p110α in both initiating and resolving inflammation, its dysfunction could be a key factor in the chronic, dysregulated inflammation characteristic of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, or systemic lupus erythematosus.</p>
<p>The potential of p110α as a therapeutic target in these conditions is especially intriguing. The recent identification of a p110α small molecule activator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> offers a promising tool to explore this avenue. By transiently enhancing p110α function, it may be possible to promote the resolution of inflammation and thereby alleviate the symptoms and progression of these inflammatory diseases. Further research into this therapeutic strategy could open new pathways for treating chronic inflammatory disorders, providing much-needed relief for patients affected by these debilitating conditions.</p>

<p>For removal of Pik3ca-floxed allele, Pik3ca<sup>RBD/lox</sup> and Pik3ca<sup>WT/flox</sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> were given 3.2 mg tamoxifen (Sigma) dissolved in 80 μl of corn oil by oral gavage once per day during 3 consecutive days. Efficiency of tamoxifen treatment was routinely performed by genotyping for the presence of the floxed allele.</p>
<p>For <italic><bold>paw oedema studies</bold> Pik3ca<sup>RBD/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Pik3ca<sup>WT/-</sup></italic> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> were divided into groups of four two weeks before oedema induction. Before inducing the paw oedema, the mice were anesthetized with 4% isofluorane. To induce the oedema, mice received ipsilateral i.pl. injection (30 μl) of either zymosan (10 μg/μl, Sigma Aldrich) or PBS into the back-hind paw. Injection of 0.1mg/kg Buprenorphine (NOAH, Vetergesic) was given for pain prevention. Paw thickness was measured using a calliper every hour during the first 6 hours after injection and then at 8, 10 hours and twice per day afterwards. Buprenorphine was injected twice per day during the length of the experiment.</p>
<p>Animals were randomly assigned to experimental groups to ensure unbiased allocation and minimize potential confounding factors. Animals were randomly assigned to groups with similar numbers, ensuring all were born on the same date to control for age-related factors. No formal sample size calculation was conducted. Blinding was implemented during data collection and analysis to reduce bias, with researchers unaware of the group allocations when assessing outcomes. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were pre-established to ensure consistency; animals showing pre-existing health conditions were excluded from the study to maintain experimental integrity; only females were included in this study. Mice were kept, managed, and sacrificed in the NUCLEUS animal facility of the University of Salamanca according to current European (2007/526/CE) and Spanish (RD 1201/2005 and RD53/2013) legislation. All experiments were approved by the Bioethics Committee of the Cancer Research Center. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines and humane endpoints established in our animal experimental license to minimize pain, suffering, and distress. Interventions such as Buprenorphine were employed as needed, and procedures were designed to be minimally invasive. Animals were monitored daily for expected and unexpected signs of pain or distress, with specific criteria—such as weight loss, lethargy, abnormal grooming—set as humane endpoints to ensure early intervention if required. No unexpected adverse events occurred during the study.</p>

<p>Mesenteric inflammation was induced following intraperitoneal injection of mouse recombinant CCL2 (500ng/mouse in 500uL of PBS). Six hours later, anesthetized chimeric mice (150 mg/kg ketamine, 7.5 mg/kg xylazine, i.p.) were placed in supine position on a heating pad (37 °C) for maintenance of body temperature. The mesenteric vascular bed was exteriorized, placed on a purpose-built stage of an upright brightfield microscope (Zeiss Axioskop). Mesenteries were superfused with warmed (37 °C) Tyrode’s solution (Sigma). After a 5-min equilibration period, analysis of leukocyte-endothelium interactions was made in at least 9 (and up to 16) randomly selected segments (100 μm in length) of post-capillary venules (20–40 μm in diameter) for each mouse. Leukocyte rolling was quantified by counting the number of rolling cells passing a fixed transversal line in the middle of the vessel segment for 5 min. Leukocyte adhesion (stationary position of the cell for 30 s or longer) was quantified along a 100 μm vessel length and data were normalized as the number of cells per 500um vessel segments. Leukocyte extravasation response was quantified within 50 μm on either side of the 100 μm vessel segment in the perivenular tissue; and data were normalized as the number of extravasated leukocytes per mm2 of extravascular tissue.

<title>BMDM elastic modulus</title>
<p>The elastic modulus of BMDMs was quantitatively assessed utilizing Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Specifically, cells were cultured on cover glass slides, which were subsequently positioned in a specialized BIO-AFM setup integrated with an inverted optical microscope (Nikon TE2000). The BIO-AFM was equipped with a V-shaped, four-sided pyramidal silicon nitride tip (Bruker AFM Probes) to facilitate accurate force measurements. To avoid localized variations and ensure data representativeness, no more than three cells were selected from a single field of view for mechanical characterization, and these cells were never contiguous. Subsequently, the stiffness of each individual cell was characterized through measurements obtained at three perinuclear points. For each point, force-displacement (F vs. z) curves were captured (10 μm amplitude at a speed of 5 μm/s). The determination of the elastic modulus was performed based on the analysis of force-displacement curves. A total of five curves were recorded for each perinuclear point at an indentation depth of 300 nm.

<p>Dried peptides were dissolved in 0.1% TFA and analysed by nano ACQUITY liquid chromatography (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) coupled on-line to a tandem LTQ Orbitrap XL, mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific)<sup>131</sup>. Gradient elution was from 5% to 25% buffer B in 180 min at a flow rate 300nL/min with buffer A being used to balance the mobile phase (buffer A was 0.1% formic acid in water and B was 0.1% formic acid in ACN). The mass spectrometer was controlled by Xcalibur software and operated in the positive mode. The spray voltage was 1.95 kV and the capillary temperature was set to 200 °C. The LTQ Orbitrap XL was operated in data dependent mode with one survey MS scan followed by 5 MS/MS scans. Label-free quantitative proteomics analysis was performed using three independent biological samples per group. Additionally, each sample was analysed in technical duplicates. To ensure robust quantitative analysis, we utilized LTQ Orbitrap XL tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to generate six distinct mass spectral profiles from each group.</p>

For each of these samples, proteomic experiments were performed with 6 replicates (3 biological replicates × 2 technical replicates), yielding a data set of 30 samples.</p>
<p>The first analytical step was to remove all peptides for which there was no information contained in the proteomic raw data matrix and the peptides for which 85% or more of the signal values were missing. All these peptides were specific of mouse proteins and in many cases were unique. The corresponding proteins were annotated and labelled together with each measured peptide. Next, low-quality samples were also removed, testing the overall signal per sample to identify if there were clear outliers with very low signal or with a very different signal distribution. Comparison of the overall signal distributions of the 30 samples (comparing boxplots) and identified 3 samples that were very different were obtained and discarded (WT/-Phag_s3r2 (sample 3, replicate 2), RBD/-_s2r1 and LKRc_s1r1).

<p>The gating strategy for analysing distinct cellular populations began by isolating cells positive for the CD45 marker. Subsequently, B cells, identified by their positivity for CD19 and negativity for CD11b, were selected. To determine the frequency of T cells, the CD45+ cell population, devoid of both CD19 and CD11b, underwent examination for CD3 expression. CD3+ cells were further categorized based on CD4 and CD8 expression, distinguishing CD4+, CD8+, and double-negative (DN) T cells. Following the application of these gating criteria across all samples, the percentages of CD45-positive cells expressing CD19 and T cells (CD3+) within the CD45+ population were calculated. Additionally, myeloid populations were analysed by quantifying the proportion of CD11b+ cells. To distinguish between circulating monocytes and granulocytes, we assessed their expression of Ly6G (granulocytes) and Ly6C proteins (monocytes). Classical monocytes were characterized by negativity for Ly6G and positivity for Ly6C, while alternative monocytes lacked both markers, and neutrophils/granulocytes displayed weak positivity for Ly6C and positivity for Ly6G.</p>

Additionally, two-way ANOVA was used to evaluate interaction effects between factors in our experimental design, enabling comparisons across multiple groups and conditions</p>

<p>(A) Schematic representation of the mouse model used in which the interaction of p110α with RAS was disrupted by the introduction of two-point mutations, T208D and K227A, into the endogenous Pik3ca gene (Pik3caRBD). Wild-type (Pik3caWT) and Pik3caRBD mice were bred with mice containing a floxed Pik3ca allele and a mouse carrying a conditional Cre recombinase (Cre-ERT2) allele targeted to the ubiquitously expressed Rosa26 locus; (B) Representative PCR showing efficiency of floxed allele removal after treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen for 48 hours; (C) Graph quantifying p-AKT signal from 3 independent WB and normalized against its loading control; (D) Graph quantifying p-ERK signal from 3 independent WB and normalized against its loading control; (E) Volcano plots corresponding to identified cytokines differentially expressed in unstimulated BMDMs; (F) Volcano plots corresponding to identified cytokines differentially expressed in LPS + IFN-γ BMDMs; (G) (H) (I) Pik3caRBD/- and Pik3caRBD/- BMDMs were stimulated with LPS+IFN-γ and expression of (G) CD80; (H) CD86; and (I) MHCII were analysed by flow cytometry (Pik3caRBD/- n = 5; Pik3caWT/- n = 3). Error bars indicate mean ± SEM. Significance using Mann-Whitney test: n.s. no-significant.; (J) Pik3caWT/Flox and Pik3caRBD/Flox mice were injected with zymosan or PBS in the back-hind paws and inflammation was measured and plotted over time, Pik3caWT/Flox n = 5; Pik3caRBD/Flox PBS n = 5; Pik3caWT/Flox Zymosan n = 5; Pik3caRBD/Flox Zymosan n = 5; Error bars indicate mean ± SEM. Significance using 2way ANOVA test: n.s. non-significant (K) Blood from the same mice was obtained by cardiac puncture prior culling and blood sedimentation was measured. The clear layer formed at the top was used for data quantification. Black dots represent data from Pik3caWT/- mice and red dots represent data from Pik3caRBD/- mice.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Cell intrinsic signaling pathways controlling the function of macrophages in inflammatory processes, including in response to infection, injury or in the resolution of inflammation are incompletely understood. In this study, Rosell et al. investigate the contribution of RAS-p110α signaling to macrophage activity. p110α is a ubiquitously expressed catalytic subunit of PI3K with previously described roles in multiple biological processes including in epithelial cell growth and survival, and carcinogenesis. While previous studies have already suggested a role for RAS-p110α signaling in macrophage function, the cell intrinsic impact of disrupting the interaction between RAS and p110α in this central myeloid cell subset is not known.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Exploiting a sound previously described genetically engineered mouse model that allows tamoxifen-inducible disruption of the RAS-p110α pathway and using different readouts of macrophage activity in vitro and in vivo, the authors provide data consistent with their conclusion that alteration in RAS-p110α signaling impairs various but selective aspects of macrophage function in a cell-intrinsic manner.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>My main concern is that for various readouts, the difference between wild-type and mutant macrophages in vitro or between wild-type and Pik3caRBD mice in vivo is modest, even if statistically significant. To further substantiate the extent of macrophage function alteration upon disruption of RAS-p110α signaling and its impact on the initiation and resolution of inflammatory responses, the manuscript would benefit from a more extensive assessment of macrophage activity and inflammatory responses in vivo.</p>
<p>In the in vivo model, all cells have disrupted RAS-p100α signaling, not only macrophages. Given that other myeloid cells besides macrophages contribute to the orchestration of inflammatory responses, it remains unclear whether the phenotype described in vivo results from impaired RAS-p100α signaling within macrophages or from defects in other haematopoietic cells such as neutrophils, dendritic cells, etc.</p>
<p>Inclusion of information on the absolute number of macrophages, and total immune cells (e.g. for the spleen analysis) would help determine if the reduced frequency of macrophages represents an actual difference in their total number or rather reflects a relative decrease due to an increase in the number of other/s immune cell/s.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I thank the authors for addressing my comments.</p>
<p>
- I believe that additional in vivo experiments, or the inclusion of controls for the specificity of the inhibitor, which the authors argue are beyond the scope of the current study, are essential to address the weaknesses and limitations stated in my current evaluation.</p>
<p>
- While the neutrophil depletion suggests neutrophils are not required for the phenotype, there are multiple other myeloid cells, in addition to macrophages, that could be contributing or accounting for the in vivo phenotype observed in the mutant strain (not macrophage specific).</p>
<p>
- Inclusion of absolute cell numbers (in addition to the %) is essential. I do not understand why the authors are not including these data. Have they not counted the cells?</p>
<p>
- Lastly, inclusion of representatives staining and gating strategies for all immune profiling measurements carried out by flow cytometry is important. This point has not been addressed, not even in writing.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the current reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I thank the authors for addressing my comments.</p>
<p>- I believe that additional in vivo experiments, or the inclusion of controls for the specificity of the inhibitor, which the authors argue are beyond the scope of the current study, are essential to address the weaknesses and limitations stated in my current evaluation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully acknowledge the reviewer's concern but would like to reiterate that demonstrating the specificity of the inhibitor is beyond the scope of this study. Alpelisib (BYL-719) is a clinically approved drug widely recognized as a specific inhibitor of p110α, primarily used in the treatment of breast cancer. Its selectivity for the p110α isoform has been extensively validated in the literature.</p>
<p>In our study, we used Alpelisib to assess whether pharmacological inhibition of p110α would produce effects similar to those observed in our genetic model, which is particularly relevant for the potential translational implications of our findings. Given the well-documented specificity of this inhibitor, we believe that additional controls to confirm its selectivity are unnecessary within the context of this study. Instead, our focus has been to investigate the functional role of p110α activity in macrophage-driven inflammation using the models described.</p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insight and hope this clarification addresses their concern.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- While the neutrophil depletion suggests neutrophils are not required for the phenotype, there are multiple other myeloid cells, in addition to macrophages, that could be contributing or accounting for the in vivo phenotype observed in the mutant strain (not macrophage specific).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's observation regarding the potential involvement of other myeloid cells. However, it is important to highlight that the inflammatory process follows a well-characterized sequential pattern. Our data clearly demonstrate that in the paw inflammation model:</p>
<p>·       Neutrophils are effectively recruited, as evidenced by the inflammatory abscess filled with polymorphonuclear cells.</p>
<p>·       However, macrophages fail to be recruited in the RBD model.</p>
<p>Given that this critical step is disrupted, it is reasonable to expect that any subsequent steps in the inflammatory cascade would also be affected. A precise dissection of the role of other myeloid populations would require additional lineage-specific models to selectively target each subset, which, as we have previously stated, would be the focus of an independent study.</p>
<p>While we cannot entirely exclude the contribution of other myeloid cells, our data strongly support the conclusion that macrophages are, at the very least, a key component of the observed phenotype. We explicitly address this point in the Discussion section, where we acknowledge the potential involvement of other myeloid populations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Inclusion of absolute cell numbers (in addition to the %) is essential. I do not understand why the authors are not including these data. Have they not counted the cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern regarding the inclusion of absolute cell numbers. However, as stated in the Materials and Methods section, we analyzed 50,000 cells per sample, and the percentages reported in the manuscript are directly derived from this standardized count.</p>
<p>Our decision to present the data as percentages follows standard practices in flow cytometry-based analyses, as it allows for a clearer and more biologically relevant comparison of relative changes between conditions. This approach ensures consistency across samples and facilitates the interpretation of population dynamics during inflammation.</p>
<p>We would also like to clarify that all data are based on actual counts, and rigorous controls were implemented throughout the study to ensure accuracy and reproducibility. We hope this explanation addresses the reviewer’s concern and provides further clarity on our approach.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This study by Alejandro Rosell et al. reveals the immunoregulatory role of the RAS-p110α pathway in macrophages, specifically in regulating monocyte extravasation and lysosomal digestion during inflammation. Disrupting this pathway, through genetic tools or pharmacological intervention in mice, impairs the inflammatory response, leading to delayed resolution and more severe acute inflammation. The authors suggest that activating p110α with small molecules could be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating chronic inflammation. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms by which p110α regulates macrophage function and the overall inflammatory response.</p>
<p>The updates made by the authors in the revised version have addressed the main points raised in the initial review, further improving the strength of their findings.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this point. We understand the reviewer’s concern regarding the modest yet statistically significant differences observed between wild-type and mutant macrophages in vitro, as well as between wild-type and Pik3ca<sup>RBD</sup> mice in vivo. Our current study aimed to provide a foundational exploration of the role of RAS-p110α signaling in macrophage function and inflammatory response, focusing on a set of core readouts that demonstrate the physiological relevance of this pathway. While a more extensive in vivo assessment could offer additional insights into macrophage activity and the nuanced effects of RAS-p110α disruption, it would require an array of new experiments that are beyond the current scope.</p>
<p>However, we believe that the current data provide significant insights into the pathway’s role, highlighting important alterations in macrophage function and inflammatory processes due to RAS-p110α disruption. These findings lay the groundwork for future studies that can build upon our results with a more comprehensive analysis of macrophage activity in various inflammatory contexts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the in vivo model, all cells have disrupted RAS-p100α signaling, not only macrophages. Given that other myeloid cells besides macrophages contribute to the orchestration of inflammatory responses, it remains unclear whether the phenotype described in vivo results from impaired RAS-p100α signaling within macrophages or from defects in other haematopoietic cells such as neutrophils, dendritic cells, etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this point. To address this, we have added a paragraph in the Discussion section acknowledging that RAS-p110α signaling disruption affects all hematopoietic cells (lines 461-470 in the discussion). However, we also provide several lines of evidence that support macrophages as the primary cell type involved in the observed phenotype. Specifically, we note that neutrophil depletion in chimera mice did not alter transendothelial extravasation, and that macrophages were the primary cell type showing significant functional defects in the paw edema model. These findings, combined with specific deficiencies in myeloid populations, suggest a predominant role of macrophages in the impaired inflammatory response, though we acknowledge the potential contributions of other myeloid cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Inclusion of information on the absolute number of macrophages, and total immune cells (e.g. for the spleen analysis) would help determine if the reduced frequency of macrophages represents an actual difference in their total number or rather reflects a relative decrease due to an increase in the number of other/s immune cell/s.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We understand the value of presenting actual measurements; however, we opted to display normalized data to provide a clearer comparison between WT and RBD mice, as this approach highlights the relative differences in immune populations between the two groups. Normalizing data helps to focus on the specific impact of the RAS-p110α disruption by minimizing inter-sample variability that can obscure these differences.</p>
<p>To further address the reviewer’s concern regarding the interpretation of macrophage frequencies, we have included a pie chart that represents the relative proportions of the various immune cell populations studied within our dataset. Author response image 1 provides a visual overview of the immune cell distribution, enabling a clearer understanding of whether the observed decrease in macrophage frequency represents an actual reduction in total macrophage numbers or a shift in their relative abundance due to changes in other immune populations.</p>
<p>We hope this approach satisfactorily addresses reviewer’s concerns by providing both a normalized dataset for clearer interpretation of genotype-specific effects and an overall immune profile that contextualizes macrophage frequency within the broader immune cell landscape.</p>

<p>As proof of concept data that activation of RAS-p110α signaling constitutes indeed a putative approach for treating chronic inflammation is not included in the manuscript, I suggest removing this implication from the abstract.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have now removed this implication from the abstract to maintain clarity and to better reflect the scope of the data presented in the manuscript.</p>

<p>Inclusion of a control in which RBD/- cells are also treated with BYL719, across experiments in which the inhibitor is used, would be important to determine, among other things, the specificity of the inhibitor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to include RBD/- cells treated with BYL719 as an additional control. However, we would like to clarify that this approach would raise a different biological question, as treating RBD mice with BYL719 would not only address the specificity of the inhibitor but also examine the combined effects of genetic and pharmacologic disruptions on PI3K pathway signaling. Investigating this dual disruption falls outside the scope of our current study, which is focused specifically on the effects of RAS-p110α disruption.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that our RBD mouse model selectively disrupts RAS-mediated activation of p110α, while PI3K activation can still occur through other pathways, such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Thus, inhibiting p110α with BYL719 would produce broader effects beyond the inhibition of RAS-PI3K signaling, impacting PI3K activation regardless of its upstream source.</p>
<p>In addition, incorporating this control would require us to repeat nearly all experiments in the manuscript, as it would necessitate generating and analyzing new samples for each experimental condition. Given the scope and resources involved, we believe this approach is unfeasible at this stage of the revision process.</p>
<p>We hope this explanation is satisfactory and that the current data in the manuscript provide a rigorous assessment of the RAS-p110α signaling pathway within the defined experimental scope.</p>

<p>Figure 3I is missing the statistical analysis (this is mentioned in the legend though).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We apologize for the oversight. The statistical analysis for Figure 3I has now been added.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Gating strategies and representative staining should be included more generally across the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. To address this, we have added a new supplementary figure (Figure 2-Supplement Figure 2) that illustrates the gating strategy along with a representative dataset. Additionally, a brief summary of the gating strategy has been included in the main text to further clarify the methodology.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is recommended that authors show actual measurements rather than only data normalized to the control (or arbitrary units).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We understand the value of presenting actual measurements; however, we opted to display normalized data to provide a clearer comparison between WT and RBD mice, as this approach highlights the relative differences in immune populations between the two groups. Normalizing data helps to focus on the specific impact of the RAS-p110α disruption by minimizing inter-sample variability that can obscure these differences.</p>
<p>To further address the reviewer’s concern regarding the interpretation of macrophage frequencies, we have included a pie chart that represents the relative proportions of the various immune cell populations studied within our dataset. Author response image 1 provides a visual overview of the immune cell distribution, enabling a clearer understanding of whether the observed decrease in macrophage frequency represents an actual reduction in total macrophage numbers or a shift in their relative abundance due to changes in other immune populations.</p>
<p>We hope this approach satisfactorily addresses reviewer’s concerns by providing both a normalized dataset for clearer interpretation of genotype-specific effects and an overall immune profile that contextualizes macrophage frequency within the broader immune cell landscape.</p>
