<abstract><p>In eukaryotes with DNA methylation, the histone variant H2A.Z and DNA methylation are maintained in mutually exclusive sections of the genome. How this antagonism is established, however, remains an open question. Here, we examined the impacts of DNA methylation on both the intrinsic stability of H2A.Z nucleosomes and chaperone-mediated H2A.Z deposition. Cryo-EM and endonuclease accessibility analyses show that H2A.Z nucleosomes with methylated DNA are more open and accessible compared to their unmethylated counterparts. In <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, H2A.Z preferentially associates with unmethylated DNA in both the fibroblast cell line XTC-2 and sperm pronuclei formed in the transcriptionally silent egg extract. The proportion of H2A.Z that colocalizes with methylated DNA, however, is higher in sperm pronuclei than in XTC-2. By monitoring nucleosome assembly on synthetic DNA constructs in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, we find that the H2A.Z bias for unmethylated substrates is dependent on the SRCAP complex, the major H2A.Z deposition chaperone. Consistently, recruitment of the SRCAP complex to DNA is suppressed by DNA methylation. Altogether, we propose that the SRCAP complex is the major determinant for preferential H2A.Z enrichment on unmethylated DNA, whereas DNA methylation destabilizes DNA wrapping in H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Structural features of the nucleosome, a protein-DNA complex composed of ∼146 bp DNA wrapped around a histone octamer, directly affect and regulate genomic accessibility to a diversity of DNA binding proteins, in part, through incorporating histone variants with unique physical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kurumizaka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Talbert and Henikoff, 2016</xref>). The highly evolutionarily conserved H2A variant, H2A.Z, is involved in transcriptional regulation with a well described localization at the transcription start sites (TSSs) of active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bönisch and Hake, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Giaimo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Zlatanova and Thakar, 2008</xref>). However, while typically associated with gene activation, H2A.Z has also been connected to a range of functions including DNA repair, chromosome segregation, heterochromatin maintenance, and transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Colino-Sanguino et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Giaimo et al., 2019</xref>). Loss of H2A.Z induces lethality in many eukaryotes, such as mice, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Faast et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Van Daal and Elgin, 1992</xref>), and dysregulation of its localization has been linked to several diseases, including various cancers and the developmental disorder Floating-Harbor syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Buschbeck and Hake, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Diegmüller et al., 2025</xref>). What mechanisms mediate proper H2A.Z localization, and how that connects with its broad-reaching functions, represents an important area of study.</p>
<p>Genomic sequencing analysis of a wide range of eukaryotes have found H2A.Z and DNA methylation, typically occurring as 5-methylcytosine (5mC), to be strikingly anti-correlated across the genome, at both a global and local level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Coleman-Derr and Zilberman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Conerly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Nie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Zemach et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Zilberman et al., 2008</xref>). The high conservation of this antagonism points to the existence of a shared fundamental pathway involved in creating this dichotomy and emphasizes its functional importance. In <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> H2A.Z mediates recruitment of the demethylase ROS1, thereby promoting DNA demethylation; however, this pathway uses plant-specific machinery that targets only a particular set of genomic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Nie et al., 2019</xref>). More general mechanisms for how the mutually exclusive H2A.Z and DNA methylation compartments exist at large remain to be resolved.</p>
<p>DNA methylation may mediate H2A.Z exclusion via two distinct mechanisms: 1) influencing the intrinsic physical stability of the nucleosome, and/or 2) modulating the activity of nucleosome-remodelers. H2A.Z and H2A diverge in sequence along areas important for stabilizing intra-nucleosome interactions, such as the L1 loop, docking domain, and C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bönisch and Hake, 2012</xref>). DNA methylation can influence the geometry of DNA, particularly its roll and twist, which then likely affect nucleosome wrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Li et al., 2022b</xref>). A large body of work has been conducted on the physical impacts of either H2A.Z or DNA methylation on the nucleosome, but conflicting conclusions have been reported; incorporation of H2A.Z or DNA methylation independently has been shown to cause stabilizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Choy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Collings et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ishibashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Lee and Lee, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Park et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Thambirajah et al., 2006</xref>), destabilizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Horikoshi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jimenez-Useche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Jimenez-Useche and Yuan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Ngo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Rudnizky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Weber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), or no detectable effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fujii et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Langecker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Osakabe et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, it is possible that the combination of H2A.Z and DNA methylation’s effects may physically bias against retention of H2A.Z nucleosomes on methylated DNA and contribute to their overall antagonism.</p>
<p>H2A.Z remodeling is primarily carried out by the Ino80 family of nucleosome remodelers. Both the SRCAP complex (SRCAP-C) and Tip60 complex (Tip60-C) mediate exchange of canonical H2A to H2A.Z within a nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Ruhl et al., 2006</xref>), while the Ino80 complex (Ino80- C) has been reported to evict H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Scacchetti and Becker, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Watanabe and Peterson, 2010</xref>). Tip60-C can also associate with the H2A.Z chaperone, ANP32e, to evict H2A.Z from nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Mao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Obri et al., 2014</xref>). Members of this remodeler family are prime candidates for enforcing the separation of H2A.Z and DNA methylation; however, it is unknown whether any of these complexes exhibit DNA methylation sensitivity.</p>
<p>To determine molecular mechanisms contributing to the mutual exclusion of H2A.Z and DNA methylation within the genome, here we investigated the effects of DNA methylation on both the physical stability of H2A.Z nucleosomes and remodeler-mediated deposition of H2A.Z onto synthetic DNA constructs by employing cryo-EM structural analysis and the physiological <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract system, respectively.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM analysis of H2A.Z nucleosomes in the presence or absence of DNA methylation</title>
<p>To assess the physical impacts of DNA methylation on H2A.Z nucleosomes, we solved cryo-EM structures of human H2A.Z nucleosomes reconstituted with either methylated (Me) or unmethylated (UM) Sat2R-P DNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Suppl Table 1</xref>). The Sat2R-P sequence is a 152 bp artificial palindromic sequence containing 9 evenly distributed CpG sites and was engineered from a published canonical nucleosome crystal structure containing a methylated derivative of the human satellite II sequence (termed Sat2R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Osakabe et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). This sequence was chosen for two reasons: 1) human satellite II (HSat2) represents a highly abundant methylated sequence which undergoes disease-associated differential methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ehrlich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Jackson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Tilman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Unoki, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Wong et al., 2001</xref>), and 2) the symmetric palindromic sequence was needed to increase final structure resolutions due to the two-fold pseudo symmetry about the nucleosome dyad axis. Prepared nucleosomes were run on a native PAGE gel to assess for quality, where both samples appeared as a singular band with minor comparable populations of unincorporated DNA (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Cryo-EM structures of UM and Me Sat2R-P H2A.Z nucleosomes were solved at a final resolution of 3.05 Å and 2.78 Å, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and C</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 1</xref>). We found that the nucleosome dyad was shifted roughly two base pairs from the center of the Sat2R-P palindrome, introducing a sequence asymmetry despite our intended use of the palindromic sequence. The shifted nucleotide positions were determined using the higher resolution densities surrounding the nucleosome dyad, which allowed for pyrimidine and purine distinction (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 2A-D</xref>). Two atomic models (termed v1 and v2) with mirrored DNA sequences were generated for each structure to account for the resultant sequence asymmetry, with the final EM densities likely reflecting an average of these two models (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>As a whole, both the methylated and unmethylated structures resembled previously published H2A.Z nucleosome structures and exhibited a linker DNA asymmetry where one side of the nucleosome (distal face 2, DF2) contained a highly flexible linker DNA region compared to the other (distal face 1, DF1) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Horikoshi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Lewis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Suto et al., 2000</xref>). As a palindromic DNA sequence was used, it is likely that the asymmetrical faces in the cryo-EM structures arose due to an averaging of closed and open H2A.Z nucleosome particles into the same structure rather than representing an asymmetry found in individual particles.</p>
<p>In a direct comparison of DF2 linker DNA lengths, we found that the Me Sat2R-P map had much weaker linker DNA density than UM Sat2R-P, resulting in a ∼7 bp shorter resolved DNA model for the methylated structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). This loss of linker density indicates destabilized histone-DNA interactions and increased DNA structural variability in the presence of DNA methylation. Along similar lines, Root Mean Squared Distance (RMSD) analysis identified the H2A.Z-H2B dimer of DF2, as well as the overall DNA backbone, as regions of considerable difference between the methylated and unmethylated structures, whereas DF1, the closed side of the nucleosome with a highly resolved linker DNA, was largely similar between the two (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>DNA methylation creates open H2AZ nucleosome structures</title>
<p>To further characterize areas of change, maps of unmethylated and methylated H2A.Z structures were filtered and resampled to the same resolution (∼3 Å) for fair comparison (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Three major differences between the maps were identified. First, cryo-EM densities of the H3 N-terminus and H2A.Z C-terminus on DF2 were much weaker in the methylated structure as compared to unmethylated, preventing model construction in these areas (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Second, an extra density on the H2A.Z-H2B acidic patch was seen on the methylated map but was not present on the unmethylated map (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Third, between the two major orientations the H4 N-terminal tail can adopt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arimura et al., 2021</xref>), the unmethylated map showed a strong preference for the inward orientation whereas the methylated structure exhibited similar populations of inward and outward orientations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>

<p>The H3 N-terminus interacts with the H2A/H2A.Z C-terminus and DNA to hold the linker DNA close to the body of the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Li and Kono, 2016</xref>). Loss of the H3 N- terminal density from the methylated structure suggests destabilized DNA-histone interactions that are consistent with the shorter resolved linker DNA on DF2 of the methylated model compared to unmethylated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). The H4 N-terminal tail, on the other hand, mediates inter- nucleosomal interactions through contacts with a neighboring acidic patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). The extra density on the Me Sat2R-P acidic patch may then have come from the H4 tail of another nucleosome, in line with the changes also observed in H4 tail orientation. These observations may be consistent with reports that DNA methylation increases condensation of nucleosomes, as well as bare DNA, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Buitrago et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jimenez-Useche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Yang et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>To more quantitatively assess methylation-dependent structural changes, we conducted an <italic>in silico</italic> mixing 3D classification analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arimura et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hite and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>) by combining micrographs collected from both methylated and unmethylated nucleosome samples and then sorted particles picked from the combined micrographs into six 3D classes of nucleosomes, each with varying degrees of open or closed linker DNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E and F</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 3</xref>). Most of the unmethylated particles (&gt;60%) were sorted into the closed linker classes (Class 1 and 2) whereas the majority of methylated particles (∼60%) belonged to classes with open linkers (Classes 3, 4, 6) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). The fraction of hexasomes (Class 5) is minor in both conditions with a slight increase in methylated particles (Class 5). Among these open linker classes that are preferentially found in methylated particles, class 4 also represents nucleosomes where the palindromic center of the DNA has slid and is considerably offset from the dyad axis of the histone octamer. This may explain the weaker DF2 linker density seen in the high resolution Me Sat2R-P structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Additionally, the DNA backbone of the methylated nucleosome structure had a lower local resolution compared to unmethylated, despite the methylated map having a higher global resolution (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 4</xref>). This is consistent with the increased population of open linker and slid nucleosome particles in the methylated structure. Altogether, our cryo- EM structural analysis suggests that the presence of DNA methylation creates open and potentially destabilized H2A.Z nucleosome structures.</p>

<title>DNA methylation increases accessibility of H2A.Z but not H2A nucleosomes</title>
<p>In order to validate the observed opening of the H2A.Z nucleosome structure by DNA methylation, and to determine if this methylation effect is also present on nucleosomes containing canonical H2A, we measured nucleosome DNA accessibility via restriction enzyme digest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref><bold>, </bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 7</xref><bold> and 8</bold>). We tested both human H2A and H2A.Z nucleosomes reconstituted with methylated and unmethylated versions of 152 bp non-palindromic Sat2R DNA that was modified to include a singular HinfI site 18 bp in from the 5’-end containing a Cy5-fluorophore (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Homogeneity of the reconstituted nucleosomes was assessed via native PAGE and mass photometry analysis prior to restriction digest analysis (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 7A-C</xref>). Digest of bare control DNA confirmed that HinfI behaved similarly on both methylated and unmethylated Sat2R substrates over the time scale used in the experiment (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 7D</xref>). We found that H2A.Z nucleosomes were more accessible to enzymatic digest than H2A nucleosomes, independent of DNA methylation status (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B and C</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 8</xref>). When comparing methylation-dependent differences for each type of nucleosome, methylated and unmethylated H2A nucleosomes were largely digested at the same rate. Methylated H2A.Z nucleosomes, on the other hand, exhibited a small but more pronounced increase in accessibility as compared to its unmethylated counterpart (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B and C</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 8</xref>). These results corroborate our structural findings and also suggest that the effects of DNA methylation may be negligible on an intrinsically stable nucleosome (i.e. containing H2A) but can further destabilize, in a selective manner, the already open and accessible H2A.Z nucleosome.</p>

<title>H2A.Z and DNA methylation localization in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> sperm pronuclei and a fibroblast cell line</title>
<p>Results from our structural and biochemical experiments indicate decreased wrapping stability of H2A.Z nucleosomes on methylated DNA. While functional implications likely exist, this subtle effect on the intrinsic physical stability of the H2A.Z nucleosome is unlikely to be the sole driver of the mutually exclusive H2A.Z and DNA methylation compartmentalization in cells. To identify the major biochemical mechanism underlying this dichotomy, we turned to the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extract system, a unique cell-free system that allows for characterization of chromatin proteins under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Lohka and Maller, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Postow et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Wassing et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Xue et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Zierhut et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>To ensure that <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract is a valid tool for studying the H2A.Z-DNA methylation antagonism, we conducted CUT&amp;Tag – Bisulfite Sequencing (CnT-BS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Li et al., 2021</xref>), a method which allows for the direct assessment of DNA methylation on CUT&amp;Tag reads, against H2A.Z of <italic>Xenopus</italic> sperm nuclei incubated in interphase extract. This condition mimics fertilization and allows for full nucleosome assembly onto sperm (primarily composed of protamines and H3/H4 tetramers) to create functional pronuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Oikawa et al., 2020</xref>). We also collected samples against H3 to serve as a pan-nucleosome control. Since sperm pronuclei in egg extract represents a unique transcriptionally silent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Engelke et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Newport and Kirschner, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Veenstra et al., 1999</xref>), we also performed CnT-BS on XTC-2 cells, a <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> fibroblast cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Pudney et al., 1973</xref>), to assess changes in DNA methylation and H2A.Z overlap across different nuclei types.</p>
<p>Initial comparisons of CnT-BS reads across two biological replicates of our four conditions demonstrated good reproducibility between replicates, while each set of experimental conditions exhibited distinct characteristics. A greater than 99 % bisulfite conversion efficiency rate, as assessed through our unmethylated lambda DNA spike-in, was achieved, and correlation matrices of both the mapped reads and methylation calls were highly similar between biological replicates (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 9</xref><bold>, </bold><xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Suppl Table 2</xref><bold> and 3</bold>). When comparing across conditions, for both the H3/H2A.Z mapped reads and DNA methylation sites, the first degree of difference seen was between XTC-2 and sperm samples, and then H3 vs H2A.Z following after, indicating that large-scale changes in the DNA methylation and genomic landscape occurred between the two different nuclear states (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 9</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess characteristics of H2A.Z and H3 genomic distributions, we subset the <italic>Xenopus</italic> genome into 1,000 bp bins and classified the top 20 % of bins containing the most mapped reads for each condition based on annotated functionalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Fisher et al., 2023</xref>). We found that a greater proportion of highly mapped H2A.Z bins were located near promoter regions as compared to H3 for both sperm and XTC-2 samples (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 10A</xref>). Although transcription is suppressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, H2A.Z in sperm pronuclei were well positioned at TSSs, as generally seen for actively transcribed genes in somatic cells (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 10B and C</xref>).

<title>The SRCAP complex mediates H2A.Z’s preferential deposition on unmethylated DNA</title>

Consequently, in SRCAP-C-depleted (ΔSRCAP) extracts, residual H2A.Z binding to DNA became insensitive to DNA methylation status, while the amount of H2A.X-F on DNA was not affected by SRCAP-C depletion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B and D</xref>, <xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 13A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we found that DNA methylation can affect H2A.Z deposition and stability via two distinct mechanisms (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). DNA methylation directly opposes H2A.Z deposition by inhibiting SRCAP-C DNA binding. SRCAP-C accounts for the majority of H2A.Z deposition on unmethylated DNA and is the primary mediator behind DNA methylation’s exclusion of H2A.Z in the transcriptionally inactive <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract. A subpopulation of H2A.Z, however, is still deposited onto methylated DNA, driven by methylation insensitive mechanism(s) whose identity remains to be established. Once formed, H2A.Z nucleosomes on methylated DNA are more open and accessible compared to their unmethylated counterparts. This decrease in DNA-histone contact stability of methylated H2A.Z nucleosomes may then further facilitate clearance of H2A.Z from methylated regions of the genome.</p>

<p>Left, SRCAP-C is capable of depositing H2A.Z on unmethylated substrates, but presence of DNA methylation prevents binding and deposition activity. Another unidentified mechanism deposits H2A.Z in a DNA methylation insensitive manner.

</fig>
<p>Supporting our observation that a SRCAP-independent mechanism(s) exists to deposit H2A.Z on methylated DNA in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract, a substantial fraction (∼40%) of H2A.Z-associated genomic DNA is methylated in sperm pronuclei. In the fibroblast cell line XTC-2, that methylated H2A.Z fraction is greatly reduced to 3%. However, due to the accessibility bias inherent within CUT&amp;Tag, our data likely underestimates the true degree of H2A.Z and DNA methylation overlap, particularly in the XTC-2 samples. For comparison, a previous study in human myometrium reported that ∼20% of CpGs overlapping with H2A.Z are methylated, indicating that a sizeable population of colocalized H2A.Z and DNA methylation exists in somatic cells which warrants further investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berta et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, we believe the decreased trend in H2A.Z and DNA methylation overlap of XTC-2 cells holds true and suggests that the high degree of H2A.Z and DNA methylation coincidence in sperm pronuclei reflects its unique early development and/or transcriptionally silent state. Given the strong preference of SRCAP-C binding to unmethylated DNA in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, we predict that additional pathways missing in the egg extract system are necessary to reinforce the antagonism between DNA methylation and H2A.Z enrichment.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest difference between XTC-2 cells and <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs is the presence of transcription, which is one of the main evictors of H2A.Z and necessary for global H2A.Z turnover as well as pruning of randomly deposited H2A.Z within gene bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hardy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lashgari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Ranjan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Tramantano et al., 2016</xref>). Traversing of RNA polymerase (Pol) II across nucleosomes, aided by the FACT complex, results in transient histone dimer displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Belotserkovskaya et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bevington and Boyes, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bintu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Kireeva et al., 2002</xref>), leading to the possibility that the more accessible H2A.Z nucleosome structures formed on methylated DNA may have increased susceptibility to Pol II disruption.</p>
<p>Furthermore, FACT and Spt6 do not reincorporate H2A.Z into the reassembled nucleosome post Pol II encounter, reinforcing selective loss of H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Heo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Jeronimo et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Outside of transcription, the egg extract system also lacks both the DNMT3 enzymes responsible for <italic>de novo</italic> methylation and the TET system responsible for DNA methylation removal in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Wühr et al., 2014b</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, H2A.Z promotes ROS1-associated DNA demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Nie et al., 2019</xref>) and must be excluded to ensure faithful heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, H2A.Z-driven mechanisms to limit DNA methylation remain relevant pathways to increase the H2A.Z/DNA methylation separation within the genome which may be missing in eggs/early embryonic states.</p>
<p>Exactly how SRCAP-C senses DNA methylation remains a pertinent question. Recent structural work on the yeast SWR1 complex and human SRCAP-C indicate that both the ATPase and the ZNHIT1 subunit (Swc6 in yeast) mediate binding of, and one-dimensional diffusion on, naked DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Louder et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Park et al., 2024</xref>), marking them as likely candidates responsible for methylation sensing. Additionally, the YEATS domain-containing subunit GAS41, found in both SRCAP-C and Tip60-C, recognizes H3K14ac and H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hsu et al., 2018a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">2018b</xref>), and deposition of H3K27ac, itself, is antagonized by DNA methylation at enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">King et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that both direct recognition of DNA methylation and changes in the PTM landscape of methylated chromatin play a role in dictating SRCAP-C localization and activity.</p>
<p>Although a consensus on how DNA methylation influences nucleosome stability has yet to be achieved, our results indicate that DNA methylation creates more open nucleosome structures, particularly on H2A.Z nucleosomes, similar to reports from FRET-based and molecular simulation studies on the canonical H2A nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jimenez-Useche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Jimenez-Useche and Yuan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Li et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Ngo et al., 2016</xref>). Although the ambiguity in DNA positioning of our cryo-EM structures prevents us from discussing the structural coordination of specific CpG sites, we favor the idea that the increase in accessibility is due to effects of DNA methylation on global DNA structure rather than at specific methylated segments. This is in line with observations that methylation increases overall DNA stiffness, making it harder for the DNA to bend and wrap around histone octamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Ngo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Pérez et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Our restriction enzyme accessibility assay shows that H2A.Z nucleosomes are considerably more open and accessible compared to canonical H2A, regardless of methylation status. This difference is substantially larger than that induced by DNA methylation on H2A.Z, suggesting that the physical influence of DNA methylation on nucleosomes is overall subtle. This apparent subtlety, however, may be due to the internal placement of the cut site that we tested, and thus the effect of DNA methylation was preferably observed on an already destabilized nucleosome with H2A.Z. Similar findings have been reported on canonical H2A 601 nucleosomes, where the effects of DNA methylation manifest greatest on an open nucleosome sub-population compared to their closed counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Jimenez-Useche and Yuan, 2012</xref>). This is likely why we saw no methylation-dependent structural differences with the 601L sequence (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 5</xref>), as its innate nucleosome wrapping and positioning ability is even stronger than the classic Widom 601. Overall, we suggest that the subtle nucleosome destabilization effect of DNA methylation is selectively pronounced on H2A.Z nucleosomes, which already exhibit an intrinsic instability compared to canonical H2A nucleosomes.</p>
<p>Beyond its interaction with DNA methylation, we show that H2A.Z promoter localization occurs immediately upon conditions mimicking fertilization in a transcription-independent manner. Unlike the almost complete loss of histones seen in mammalian sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Ward and Coffey, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Wykes and Krawetz, 2003</xref>), <italic>Xenopus</italic> sperm is packaged as a mixture of protamines and H3/H4 tetramers with very low levels of H2A/H2B dimers, which are then remodeled into full nucleosomes upon fusion with an egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Katagiri and Ohsumi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Mann et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Oikawa et al., 2020</xref>). In our egg extract system, which lacks the maternal genome, we expect the bulk of H2A.Z in sperm pronuclei to be newly deposited and find that H2A.Z is still specifically targeted to promotors either via underlying sequence motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ibarra-Morales et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>) or tetramer modifications maintained in sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Oikawa et al., 2020</xref>). This is similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> where H2A.Z is recruited to TSSs prior to both Pol II binding and ZGA, marking genes for zygotic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ibarra-Morales et al., 2021</xref>), indicating conservation of this initial transcription-independent H2A.Z positioning across both vertebrates and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Our work here provides a critical step in the pathways dictating genomic organization by uncovering the previously undescribed methylation sensitivity of SRCAP-C along with the destabilizing effects of DNA methylation on H2A.Z nucleosomes. Together, these findings provide molecular mechanisms driving the conserved antagonism between H2A.Z and DNA methylation in the genome. However, many questions remain to be answered, such as why the existence of both methylation sensitive and insensitive H2A.Z deposition pathways, the broader functional implications of the H2A.Z-DNA methylation antagonism as a whole, and mechanisms driving its maintenance in species that experience periods of global demethylation. These questions represent important areas of future study for our understanding of epigenome dynamics throughout development.</p>

Downstream analysis was conducted in CryoSPARC v4.6 (Structura Biotechnology Inc.). Motion-corrected micrographs then underwent patch CTF correction. Particles were picked using Topaz v0.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bepler et al., 2019</xref>) trained on a set of 1,000-2,000 manually picked nucleosome-like particles and then extracted to 384 pix (∼330 Å) boxes with 4x binning and used for 2D classification into 200-250 classes. Particles from selected classes were then run through a series of heterogeneous refinements with 1-2 nucleosome-like models and 4 decoy models generated through <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction to sort out junk particles from those containing nucleosomes. The heterogenous refinements were iterated until greater than 90 % of particles in the round were classified as nucleosome-like. These particles were then further refined either via Refine 3D, CTF refinement, and polishing in Relion v4 (601L structures) or homogeneous and non-uniform refinements in CryoSPARC v4.6 (Sat2R-P). Particles for the methylated Sat2R-P structure underwent another heterogeneous refinement using a closed nucleosome, open, and hexasome model as starting classes to select for the highest resolved closed nucleosome structure. Final resolutions were determined using the gold standard FSC threshold (FSC = 0.143).

Samples were then incubated with 50 µl of transposome complex (1:1 pG-Tn5:adaptor primer mix, ∼0.1-0.2 µM final to each sample) in CnT-300 [CnT-WB with 300 mM NaCl] for 1 h at RT then washed with CnT-300. Transposome activity was initiated with addition of 300 µl Tagmentation Buffer [20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1x ROCHE cOmplete™ protease inhibitor cocktail, 0.1 % Tween-20] and incubated 37 ᵒC, 1500 rpm on thermomixer, 1 h. Reactions were stopped with addition of stop buffer [15 mM EDTA, 0.1 % SDS, 0.2 mg/mL Proteinase K final concentrations] and incubated at 55 ᵒC overnight, then phenol-chloroform extracted. Purified samples were resuspended in 11 µl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and oligonucleotide replacement/gap repaired carried out through addition of 2 µl of 10 µM Tn5mC-ReplO1 DNA oligo (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), 2 µl 10x Ampligase Buffer (Lucigen), 2 µl dNTP mix (2.5 mM for each dNTP). Solutions were subject to the following heating protocol: 50 ᵒC 1 min, 45 ᵒC 10 min, cool to 37 ᵒC at -0.1 ᵒC/second. Once at 37 ᵒC, 3U of T4 DNA polymerase and 12.5U of Ampligase (Lucigen) were added and samples incubated for 30 min.

<title>Count matrix generation and sequencing depth normalization</title>
<p>The <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> genome was subset into 1000 bp bins. Reads from processed bam files were then tallied according to bins to generate a genome-wide count matrix. Mitochondrial associated reads and bins which contained no reads across all samples were removed.

<title>DNA Methylation analysis</title>
<p>To get methylated CpG proportions for each sample (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>), H2A.Z peaks were first identified with SEACR (v1.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Meers et al., 2019</xref>) using a cutoff of 0.025 by AUC with a stringent threshold. Individual CpG data was then extracted using Bismark with a cutoff of 5 reads and disregarding the first 9 bp of read 2 (due to adapter fill-in). Methylation proportions for H2A.Z samples were then calculated for CpGs overlapping with H2A.Z peaks. For H3, only regions outside of identified H2A.Z peaks were used to assess the CpG methylation status of general genomic background non-coincident with H2A.Z enriched areas. To generate H3-associated methylation 500 bp tiles for use in plotting (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Suppl Fig 9B-D</xref>), methylation data was extracted with a specified cutoff of 1 read and disregarding the first 9 bp of read 2 then imported into a methylRawList object with a minimum read coverage of 2 and counted over 500 bp tiles with a 500 bp step size and a minimum of 2 CpG sites using methylKit v1.28.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akalin et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

DNA fragments containing the array sequence were then purified through a PEG precipitation titration, starting at 4.5 % of PEG (MW8000) and increasing in 0.5 % increments until 8 % (NaCl added to 0.5 M final concentration in the starting solution). Fragment containing fractions were then assessed via agarose gel and purified via phenol-chloroform extraction. Fragment ends were biotinylated with biotin-14-dATP (Jena Bioscience, Cat# NU-835-BIO14-S) using Klenow Fragment (3’→ 5’ exo-) (NEB Cat# M0212) following manufacturer’s protocol. Biotinylated DNA was phenol-chloroform extracted and bound to M-280 Streptavidin Dynabeads™ (Invitrogen, Cat# 11206D) at 300 ng DNA per 1 µl of beads.

<p>This study provides <bold>valuable</bold> mechanistic insight into the mutually exclusive distributions of the histone variant H2A.Z and DNA methylation by testing two hypotheses: (i) that DNA methylation destabilizes H2A.Z nucleosomes, thereby preventing H2A.Z retention, and (ii) that DNA methylation suppresses H2A.Z deposition by ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complexes. Through a series of well-designed and carefully executed experiments, findings are presented in support of both hypotheses.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors considered the mechanism underlying previous observations that H2A.Z is preferentially excluded from methylated DNA regions. They considered two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms. First, they tested the hypothesis that nucleosomes containing both methylated DNA and H2A.Z might be intrinsically unstable due to their structural features. Second, they explored the possibility that DNA methylation might impede SRCAP-C from efficiently depositing H2A.Z onto these DNA methylated regions.</p>
<p>Their structural analyses revealed subtle differences between H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes assembled on methylated versus unmethylated DNA. To test the second hypothesis, the authors allowed H2A.Z assembly on sperm chromatin in Xenopus egg extracts and mapped both H2A.Z localization and DNA methylation in this transcriptionally inactive system. They compared these data with corresponding maps from a transcriptionally active Xenopus fibroblast cell line. This comparison confirmed the preferential deposition or enrichment of H2A.Z on unmethylated DNA regions, an effect that was much more pronounced in the fibroblast genome than in sperm chromatin. Furthermore, nucleosome assembly on methylated versus unmethylated DNA, along with SRCAP-C depletion from Xenopus egg extracts, provided a means to test whether SRCAP-C contributes to the preferential loading of H2A.Z onto unmethylated DNA.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength and originality of this work lie in its focused attempt to dissect the unexplained observation that H2A.Z is excluded from methylated genomic regions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study has two weaknesses. First, although the authors identify specific structural effects of DNA methylation on H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes, they do not provide evidence demonstrating that these structural differences lead to altered histone dynamics or nucleosome instability. Second, building on the elegant work of Berta and colleagues (cited in the manuscript), the authors implicate SRCAP-C in the selective deposition of H2A.Z at unmethylated regions. Yet the role of SRCAP-C appears only partial, and the study does not address how the structural or molecular consequences of DNA methylation prevent efficient H2A.Z deposition. Finally, additional plausible mechanisms beyond the two scenarios the authors considered are not investigated or discussed in the manuscript.</p>

<p>This manuscript aims to elucidate the mechanistic basis for the long-standing observation that DNA methylation and the histone variant H2A.Z occupy mutually exclusive genomic regions. The authors test two hypotheses: (i) that DNA methylation intrinsically destabilizes H2A.Z nucleosomes, thereby preventing H2A.Z retention, and (ii) that DNA methylation suppresses H2A.Z deposition by ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling complexes. However, neither hypothesis is rigorously addressed. There are experimental caveats, issues with data interpretation, and conclusions that are not supported by the data. Substantial revision and additional experiments, including controls, would be required before mechanistic conclusions can be drawn. Major concerns are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The cryo-EM structure of methylated H2A.Z nucleosomes is insufficiently resolved to address the central mechanistic question: where the methylated CpGs are located relative to DNA-histone contact points and how these modifications influence H2A.Z nucleosome structure. The structure provides no mechanistic insights into methylation-induced destabilization.</p>
<p>The experimental system also lacks physiological relevance. The template DNA sequence is artificial, despite the existence of well-characterised native genomic sequences for which DNA methylation is known to inhibit H2A.Z incorporation. Alternatively, there are a number of studies examining the effect of DNA methylation on nucleosome structure, stability, DNA unwrapping, and positioning. Choosing one of these DNA sequences would have at least allowed a direct comparison with a canonical nucleosome. Indeed, a major omission is the absence of a cryo-EM structure of a canonical nucleosome assembled on the same DNA template - this is essential to assess whether the observed effects are H2A.Z-specific.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the DNA template is methylated at numerous random CpG sites. The authors' argument that only the global methylation level is relevant is inconsistent with the literature, which clearly demonstrates that methylation effects on canonical nucleosomes are position-dependent. Not all CpG sites contribute equally to nucleosome stability or unwrapping, and this critical factor is not considered.</p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, the reported increase in accessibility of the methylated H2A.Z nucleosome is negligible compared with the much larger intrinsic DNA accessibility of the unmethylated H2A.Z nucleosome. These data do not support the authors' hypothesis and contradict the manuscript's conclusions. Claims that methylated H2A.Z nucleosomes are &quot;more open and accessible&quot; must therefore be removed, and the title is misleading, given that no meaningful impact of DNA methylation on H2A.Z nucleosome stability is demonstrated.</p>
<p>(2) The cryo-EM structures of methylated and unmethylated 601L H2A.Z nucleosomes show no detectable differences. As presented, this negative result adds little value. If anything, it reinforces the point that the positional context of CpG methylation is critical, which the manuscript does not consider.</p>
<p>(3) Very little H3 signal coincides with H2A.Z at TSSs in sperm pronuclei, yet this is neither explained nor discussed (Supplementary Figure 10D). The authors need to clarify this.</p>
<p>(4) In my view, the most conceptually important finding is that H2A.Z-associated reads in sperm pronuclei show ~43% CpG methylation. This directly contradicts the model of strict mutual exclusivity and suggests that the antagonism is context-dependent. Similarly, the finding that the depletion of SRCAP reduces H2A.Z deposition only on unmethylated templates is also very intriguing. Collectively, these result warrants further investigation (see below).</p>
<p>(5) Given that H2A.Z is located at diverse genomic elements (e.g., enhancers, repressed gene bodies, promoters), the manuscript requires a more rigorous genomic annotation comparing H2A.Z occupancy in sperm pronuclei versus XTC-2 cells. The authors should stratify H2A.Z-DNA methylation relationships across promoters, 5′UTRs, exons, gene bodies, enhancers, etc., as described in Supplementary Figure 10A.</p>
<p>(6) Although H2A.Z accumulates less efficiently on exogenous methylated substrates in egg extract, substantial deposition still occurs (~50%). This observation directly challenges the strong antagonistic model described in the manuscript, yet the authors do not acknowledge or discuss it. Moreover, differences between unmethylated and methylated 601 DNA raise further questions about the biological relevance of the cryo-EM 601 structures.</p>
<p>(7) The SRCAP depletion is insufficiently validated i.e., the antibody-mediated depletion of SRCAP lacks quantitative verification. A minimum of three biological replicates with quantification is required to substantiate the claims.</p>
<p>(8) It appears that the role of p400-Tip60 has been completely overlooked. This complex is the second major H2A.Z deposition complex. Because p400 exhibits DNA methylation-insensitive binding (Supplementary Figure 14), it may account for the deposition of H2A.Z onto methylated DNA. This possibility is highly significant and must be addressed by repeating the key experiments in Figure 5 following p400-Tip60 depletion.</p>
<p>(9) The manuscript repeatedly states that H2A.Z nucleosomes are intrinsically unstable; however, this is an oversimplification. Although some DNA unwrapping is observed, multiple studies show that H3/H4 tetramer-H2A.Z/H2B interactions are more stable (important recent studies include the following: DOI: 10.1038/s41594-021-00589-3; 10.1038/s41467-021-22688-x; and reviewed in 10.1038/s41576-024-00759-1).</p>
<p>In summary, the current manuscript does not present a convincing mechanistic explanation for the antagonism between DNA methylation and H2A.Z. The observation that H2A.Z can substantially coexist with DNA methylation in sperm pronuclei, perhaps, should be the conceptual focus.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Histone variant H2A.Z is evolutionarily conserved among various species. The selective incorporation and removal of histone variants on the genome play crucial roles in regulating nuclear events, including transcription. Shih et al. aimed to address antagonistic mechanisms between histone variant H2A.Z deposition and DNA methylation. To this end, the authors reconstituted H2A.Z nucleosomes in vitro using methylated or unmethylated human satellite II DNA sequence and examined how DNA methylation affects H2A.Z nucleosome structure and dynamics. The cryo-EM analysis revealed that DNA methylation induces a more open conformation in H2A.Z nucleosomes. Consistent with this, their biochemical assays showed that DNA methylation subtly increases restriction enzyme accessibility in H2A.Z nucleosomes compared with canonical H2A nucleosomes. The authors identified genome-wide profiles of H2A.Z and DNA methylation using genomic assays and found their unique distribution between Xenopus sperm pronuclei and fibroblast cells. Using Xenopus egg extract systems, the authors showed SRCAP complex, the chromatin remodelers for H2A.Z deposition, preferentially deposit H2A.Z on unmethylated DNA.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is solid, and most conclusions are well-supported. The experiments are rigorously performed, and interpretations are clear. The study presents a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of human H2A.Z nucleosome with methylated DNA. The discovery that the SRCAP complex senses DNA methylation is novel and provides important mechanistic insight into the antagonism between H2A.Z and DNA methylation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study is already strong, and most conclusions are well supported. However, it can be further strengthened in several ways.</p>
<p>(1) It is difficult to interpret how DNA methylation alters the orientation of the H4 tail and leads to the additional density on the acidic patch. The data do not convincingly support whether DNA methylation enhances interactions with H2A.Z mono-nucleosomes, nor whether this effect is specific to methylated H2A.Z nucleosomes.</p>
<p>(2) It remains unclear whether DNA methylation alters global H2A.Z nucleosome stability or primarily affects local DNA end flexibility. Moreover, while the authors showed locus-specific accessibility by HinfI digestion, an unbiased assay such as MNase digestion would strengthen the conclusions.</p>

<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>This study provides valuable mechanistic insight into the mutually exclusive distributions of the histone variant H2A.Z and DNA methylation by testing two hypotheses: (i) that DNA methylation destabilizes H2A.Z nucleosomes, thereby preventing H2A.Z retention, and (ii) that DNA methylation suppresses H2A.Z deposition by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. Through a series of well-designed and carefully executed experiments, findings are presented in support of both hypotheses. However, the evidence in support of either hypothesis is incomplete, so that the proposed mechanisms underlying the enrichment of H2A.Z on unmethylated DNA remain somewhat speculative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the editor and reviewers for their critical assessments of our manuscript. While we do acknowledge the limitations of our work, we believe that our results provide important mechanistic insights into the long-standing question of how H2A.Z is preferentially enriched in hypomethylated genomic DNA regions. First, our structural and biochemical data suggest that DNA methylation increases the openness and physical accessibility of H2A.Z, albeit the effect is relatively subtle and is sequence-dependent. Second, using Xenopus egg extracts and synthetic DNA templates, we provide the first clear and direct evidence that DNA methylation-sensitive H2A.Z deposition is due to the H2A.Z chaperone SRCAP-C, corroborated by our discovery that SRCAP-C binding to DNA is suppressed by DNA methylation. Although the molecular details by which DNA methylation inhibits binding of SRCAP-C is an important area of future study, in our current manuscript, we do provide evidence that directly links the presence of SRCAP-C to the establishment of the DNA methylation/H2A.Z antagonism in a physiological system. Thanks to criticisms by the reviewers, we realized that we did not clearly state in our Abstract that the impact of DNA methylation on intrinsic H2A.Z nucleosome stability is relatively subtle, although we did explain these observations and limitations in the main text. In our revised manuscript, we are willing to edit the text to better clarify the criticisms raised by the reviewers.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors considered the mechanism underlying previous observations that H2A.Z is preferentially excluded from methylated DNA regions. They considered two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms. First, they tested the hypothesis that nucleosomes containing both methylated DNA and H2A.Z might be intrinsically unstable due to their structural features. Second, they explored the possibility that DNA methylation might impede SRCAP-C from efficiently depositing H2A.Z onto these DNA methylated regions.</p>
<p>Their structural analyses revealed subtle differences between H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes assembled on methylated versus unmethylated DNA. To test the second hypothesis, the authors allowed H2A.Z assembly on sperm chromatin in Xenopus egg extracts and mapped both H2A.Z localization and DNA methylation in this transcriptionally inactive system. They compared these data with corresponding maps from a transcriptionally active Xenopus fibroblast cell line. This comparison confirmed the preferential deposition or enrichment of H2A.Z on unmethylated DNA regions, an effect that was much more pronounced in the fibroblast genome than in sperm chromatin. Furthermore, nucleosome assembly on methylated versus unmethylated DNA, along with SRCAP-C depletion from Xenopus egg extracts, provided a means to test whether SRCAP-C contributes to the preferential loading of H2A.Z onto unmethylated DNA.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength and originality of this work lie in its focused attempt to dissect the unexplained observation that H2A.Z is excluded from methylated genomic regions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study has two weaknesses. First, although the authors identify specific structural effects of DNA methylation on H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes, they do not provide evidence demonstrating that these structural differences lead to altered histone dynamics or nucleosome instability. Second, building on the elegant work of Berta and colleagues (cited in the manuscript), the authors implicate SRCAP-C in the selective deposition of H2A.Z at unmethylated regions. Yet the role of SRCAP-C appears only partial, and the study does not address how the structural or molecular consequences of DNA methylation prevent efficient H2A.Z deposition. Finally, additional plausible mechanisms beyond the two scenarios the authors considered are not investigated or discussed in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although we acknowledge the limitations of our study and are willing to expand our discussion to more thoroughly discuss these points, we believe our manuscript provides several important mechanistic insights which this reviewer may not have fully appreciated.</p>
<p>Our first conclusion that H2A.Z nucleosomes on methylated DNA are more open and accessible compared to their unmethylated counterparts is supported by both our cryo-EM study and the restriction enzyme accessibility assay. Although the physical effect of DNA methylation is relatively subtle and is likely sequence dependent, as we clearly noted within the manuscript, the difference does exist and is valuable information for the chromatin field at large to consider.</p>
<p>The second major conclusion of our manuscript is that SRCAP-C exhibits preferential binding to unmethylated DNA over methylated DNA, and that SRCAP-C represents the major mechanism that can explain the biased deposition of H2A.Z to unmethylated DNA in Xenopus egg extracts. Furthermore, our experiments using Xenopus egg extract clearly demonstrated that H2A.Z is deposited by both DNA-methylation sensitive and insensitive mechanisms. Depletion of SRCAP-C almost completely eliminated the levels of DNA-methylation-sensitive H2A.Z deposition and reduced the total level of H2A.Z on chromatin to less than half of that seen in non-depleted extract. This result demonstrated that DNA methylation-sensitive H2A.Z loading is primarily regulated by SRCAP-C, at least in our experimental context where transcription, replication, and other epigenetic modifications are not involved. It is likely that additional mechanisms do further contribute, implicated by our sequencing experiments, particularly at regions with active transcription, and we have noted these possibilities and the rationale for their existence in the Discussion.</p>
<p>Our study also suggests that a SRCAP-independent, DNA methylation-insensitive mechanism of H2A.Z loading exists, which we suspect to be mediated by Tip60-C. In line with this possibility, our data suggest that Tip60-C binds DNA in a DNA methylation-insensitive manner in Xenopus egg extract. Since antibodies to deplete Tip60-C from Xenopus egg extract are currently unavailable, we were unable to directly test that hypothesis and decided not to include Tip60-C into our final model as we lacked experimental evidence for its role. However, whether or not Tip60-C is the complex responsible for the DNA methylation-insensitive pathway does not influence our final conclusion that SRCAP-C plays a major role in DNA methylation-sensitive H2A.Z loading. We are planning to edit our manuscript to more comprehensively discuss these points.</p>
<p>Please note that while Berta et al reported that DNA methylation increases at H2A.Z loci in tumors defective in SRCAP-C, they selected those regions based off where H2A.Z is typically enriched within normal tissues (Berta et al., 2021). They did not show data indicating whether H2A.Z is still retained specifically at those analyzed loci upon mutation of SRCAP-C subunits. Thus, although we greatly admire their work and are pleased that many of our findings align with theirs, their paper did not directly address whether SRCAP-C itself differentiates between DNA methylation status nor the impact that has on H2A.Z and DNA methylation colocalization. In contrast, our Xenopus egg extract system, where de novo methylation is undetectable (Nishiyama et al., 2013; Wassing et al., 2024) offers a unique opportunity to examine the direct impact of DNA methylation on H2A.Z deposition using controlled synthetic DNA substrates. Corroborated with our demonstration that DNA binding of SRCAP-C is suppressed by DNA methylation, we believe that our manuscript provides a specific mechanism that can explain the preferential deposition of H2A.Z at hypomethylated genomic regions.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript aims to elucidate the mechanistic basis for the long-standing observation that DNA methylation and the histone variant H2A.Z occupy mutually exclusive genomic regions. The authors test two hypotheses: (i) that DNA methylation intrinsically destabilizes H2A.Z nucleosomes, thereby preventing H2A.Z retention, and (ii) that DNA methylation suppresses H2A.Z deposition by ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling complexes. However, neither hypothesis is rigorously addressed. There are experimental caveats, issues with data interpretation, and conclusions that are not supported by the data. Substantial revision and additional experiments, including controls, would be required before mechanistic conclusions can be drawn. Major concerns are as follows:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the critical assessment of our manuscript by this reviewer. Although we acknowledge the limitations of our study and will revise the manuscript to better describe them, we would like to respectfully argue against the statement that our &quot;conclusions […] are not supported by the data&quot;.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) The cryo-EM structure of methylated H2A.Z nucleosomes is insufficiently resolved to address the central mechanistic question: where the methylated CpGs are located relative to DNA-histone contact points and how these modifications influence H2A.Z nucleosome structure. The structure provides no mechanistic insights into methylation-induced destabilization.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The fact that the DNA resolution in the methylated structure was not high enough to resolve the positions of methylated CpGs despite a high overall resolution of 2.78 Å implies that 1) the Sat2R-P DNA was not as stably registered as the 601L sequence, requiring us to create two alternative Sat2R-P atomic models to account for the variable positioning in our samples, and 2) that the presence of DNA methylation increases that positional variability. We understand that one may prefer to see highly resolved density around each methylation mark, but we do believe that our inability to accomplish that is actually a feature rather than a weakness and has important biological implications. The decrease in local DNA resolution on the methylated Sat2R-P structure compared to its unmethylated counterpart is meaningful and suggests to us that DNA methylation weakens overall DNA wrapping and positioning on the nucleosome, supported by the increased flexibility seen at the linker DNA ends as well as an increase in the population of highly shifted nucleosomes amongst the methylated particles. Additionally, one major view in the DNA methylation/nucleosome stability field is that the presence of DNA methylation can make DNA stiffer and harder to bend, causing opening and destabilization of nucleosomes (Ngo et al., 2016). The increased opening of linker DNA ends and accessibility of methylated H2A.Z nucleosomes in our hands also aligns with such an idea, again suggesting decreased histone-DNA contact stability on methylated DNA substrates. We plan to revise the writing in our manuscript to better reflect these ideas.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The experimental system also lacks physiological relevance. The template DNA sequence is artificial, despite the existence of well-characterised native genomic sequences for which DNA methylation is known to inhibit H2A.Z incorporation. Alternatively, there are a number of studies examining the effect of DNA methylation on nucleosome structure, stability, DNA unwrapping, and positioning. Choosing one of these DNA sequences would have at least allowed a direct comparison with a canonical nucleosome. Indeed, a major omission is the absence of a cryo-EM structure of a canonical nucleosome assembled on the same DNA template - this is essential to assess whether the observed effects are H2A.Z-specific.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises a fair question about whether canonical H2A would experience the same DNA methylation-dependent structural effects. We had considered solving the H2A structures, however, ultimately decided against it for a few reasons. First, there already exists crystal structures of canonical H2A nucleosomes using a DNA sequence highly similar to our Sat2R-P with and without the presence of DNA methylation (PDB: 5CPI and 5CPJ). The authors of this study did not see any physical differences present in their structures (Osakabe et al., 2015). Additionally, we had included canonical H2A conditions within our restriction enzyme accessibility assay and did not see a significant impact of DNA methylation on those samples (Fig 3). Because of the previous report and our own negative data, we expected that only limited additional insights would be obtained from the canonical H2A structures and decided not to pursue that analysis.</p>
<p>One of the primary reasons we chose the Sat2R-P sequence was, as noted above, that there already was a published study examining how DNA methylation affects nucleosome structure using a variant of this sequence which we could compare to our results, as the reviewer has suggested. We did have to modify the sequence, namely by making it palindromic, in order to increase the final achievable resolution. We viewed the Sat2R-P sequence as an attractive candidate because it is physiologically relevant; the initial sequence was taken directly from human satellite II. Several modifications were made for technical reasons, including making the sequence palindromic as described above and also ensuring that each CpG is recognizable by a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme so that we could be certain about the degree of methylation on our substrates. These practical concerns outweighed the necessity of maintaining a strict physiological sequence to us. However, we still believe the final Sat2R-P more closely mimics physiological sequences than Widom 601. Additionally, human satellite II is a highly abundant sequence in the human genome that is known to undergo large methylation changes on the onset of many disorders, like cancer, as well as during aging. Thus, there are interesting biological questions surrounding how the methylation state of this particular sequence affects chromatin structure. Furthermore, it has been reported that satellite II is devoid of H2A.Z (Capurso et al., 2012). Beyond those reasons, the satellite II sequence is generally interesting to our lab because we have been studying genes involved in ICF syndrome, where hypomethylation of satellite II sequences forms one of the hallmarks of this disorder (Funabiki et al., 2023; Jenness et al., 2018; Wassing et al., 2024). We understand that sequence context plays a large role in nucleosome wrapping and stability. This is why we strived to test multiple sequences in each of our assays. We do agree that it would be interesting to use DNA sequences where H2A.Z binding has already been described to be affected in a DNA methylation-dependent manner, forming an exciting future study to pursue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, the DNA template is methylated at numerous random CpG sites. The authors' argument that only the global methylation level is relevant is inconsistent with the literature, which clearly demonstrates that methylation effects on canonical nucleosomes are position-dependent. Not all CpG sites contribute equally to nucleosome stability or unwrapping, and this critical factor is not considered.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not argue that only the global methylation level is relevant. We also would appreciate it if the reviewer could provide specific references that &quot;clearly demonstrates that methylation effects on canonical nucleosomes are position-dependent&quot;. We are aware of a series of studies conducted by Chongli Yuan's group, including one testing the effect of placing methylated CpGs at different positions along the Widom 601 sequence. In that study (Jimenez-Useche et al., 2013), they did find that positioning of mCpGs has differential impacts on the salt resistance of the nucleosomes, with 5 tandem mCpG copies at the dyad causing the most dramatic nucleosome opening whereas having mCpGs only at the DNA major grooves, but not elsewhere, increased nucleosome stability. However, they did also find that methylation of the original Widom 601 sequence also caused destabilization, albeit to a lesser degree, and another study by the same group (Jimenez-Useche et al., 2014) also found that CpG methylation decreased nucleosome-forming ability for all tested variants of the Widom 601 sequence, regardless of CpG density or positioning.</p>
<p>Other studies monitored how distribution of methylated CpGs correlates with nucleosome positioning (Collings et al., 2013; Davey et al., 1997; Davey et al., 2004). However, these studies assessed the sequence-dependent effects specifically on nucleosome assembly during in vitro salt dialysis, which is a different physical process than the one our manuscript focuses on, especially when considering the fact that H2A.Z is deposited onto preassembled H2A-nucleosome. Our cryo-EM analysis examines the structural changes induced by DNA methylation on already formed nucleosomes rather than the process of formation. Thus, probing accessibility changes using a restriction enzyme was the more appropriate biochemical assay to verify our structures.</p>
<p>We do very much agree that DNA context can influence nucleosome stability under different conditions. A study of molecular dynamics simulations concluded that the &quot;combination of overall DNA geometrical and shape properties upon methylation&quot; makes nucleosomes resistant to unwrapping (Li et al., 2022), while another modeling study suggests that DNA methylation impacts nucleosome stability in a manner dependent on DNA sequence, where &quot;[s]trong binding is weakened and weak binding is strengthened&quot; (Minary and Levitt, 2014). While G/C-dinucleotides are preferentially placed at major groove-inward positions in the nucleosomes in vivo (Chodavarapu et al., 2010; Segal et al., 2006) and G/C-rich segments are excluded from major groove-outward positions in Widom 601-like nucleosomes (Chua et al., 2012), methylated CpG dinucleotides are preferably, if not exclusively, located at major groove-outward positions in vivo. Mechanisms behind this biased mCpG positioning on the nucleosome remain speculative, likely caused by a combination of multiple factors, but the fact that we did not observe clear structural impacts using the Widom 601L sequence, where mCpGs are located at the major groove-outward and -inward positions ((Chua et al., 2012) and our structure), deserves a space for discussion. On the other hand, positioning of mCpG on satellite II-derived sequences that we used in this study was based on a physiological sequence, and thus it may not be appropriate to say that those CpGs are placed at multiple &quot;random&quot; positions. Although we decided not to discuss the position of 5mC on our Sat2R nucleosome structure due to ambiguous base assignments, neither of our two atomic models is consistent with an idea that DNA methylation repositions the CpG to the outward major grooves. As the potential contribution of how DNA methylation affects the nucleosome structure via modulating DNA stiffness has been extensively studied (Choy et al., 2010; Li et al., 2022; Ngo et al., 2016; Perez et al., 2012), we believe that it is appropriate to consider overall DNA properties along the whole DNA sequence, though we are willing to discuss potential positional effects in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most important points that we did not emphasize enough in our original manuscript was that in contrast to the subtle intrinsic effect of DNA methylation that was DNA sequence dependent, we observed SRCAP-dependent preferential H2A.Z deposition to unmethylated DNA over methylated DNA in both 601 and satellite II DNAs. In the revised manuscript, we will make the value of comparative studies on 601 and satellite II in two distinct mechanisms.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, and most importantly, the reported increase in accessibility of the methylated H2A.Z nucleosome is negligible compared with the much larger intrinsic DNA accessibility of the unmethylated H2A.Z nucleosome. These data do not support the authors' hypothesis and contradict the manuscript's conclusions. Claims that methylated H2A.Z nucleosomes are &quot;more open and accessible&quot; must therefore be removed, and the title is misleading, given that no meaningful impact of DNA methylation on H2A.Z nucleosome stability is demonstrated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with this reviewer's criticism. We investigated the potential impact of DNA methylation on nucleosome stability to the best of our abilities through complementary assays and reported our observations. The effect of DNA methylation is smaller than the difference between H2A.Z and H2A, but we were able to see an effect. It is also not uncommon for small differences to have functional impacts in biological systems. We agree that further testing is required to determine whether this subtle effect is functionally important, and it remains the subject of future research due to the many technical challenges associated with addressing said question. We would like to note that 18 years have passed since Daniel Zilberman first reported the antagonistic relationship between H2AZ and DNA methylation (Zilberman et al., 2008) but very few studies have since directly tested specific mechanistic hypotheses. We believe that our study lays the groundwork for exciting future investigation that better elucidates the pathways that contribute to this antagonism and will have meaningful impacts on the field in general. However, thanks to the reviewer's criticism, we realized that we did not clearly state in the Abstract the relatively subtle effect of DNA methylation on the intrinsic H2A.Z nucleosome stability. Therefore, we will accordingly revise the Abstract to make this point clearer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The cryo-EM structures of methylated and unmethylated 601L H2A.Z nucleosomes show no detectable differences. As presented, this negative result adds little value. If anything, it reinforces the point that the positional context of CpG methylation is critical, which the manuscript does not consider.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe the inclusion and factual reporting of negative data is important for the scientific community as one of the major issues currently in biology research is biased omission of negative data. We considered eLife as a venue to publish this work for this reason. We understand that the reviewer believes our 601L structures may detract from the overall message of our manuscript. We believe this data rather emphasizes the importance of DNA sequence context, something that the reviewer also rightfully notes. It is standard practice in the nucleosome field to use the Widom 601 sequence, along with its variants. Our experience has shown that use of an artificially strong positioning sequence may mask weaker physical effects that could play a physiological role. Thus, we were careful to validate all further assays with multiple DNA sequences and believed it important to report these sequence-dependent effects on nucleosome structure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Very little H3 signal coincides with H2A.Z at TSSs in sperm pronuclei, yet this is neither explained nor discussed (Supplementary Figure 10D). The authors need to clarify this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our H3 signal, which represents the global nucleosome population, is more broadly distributed across the genome than H2A.Z, which is known to localize at specific genomic sites. Since both histone types were sequenced to similar read depths, H3 peaks are generally shallower than H2A.Z and peak heights cannot be directly compared (i.e. they should be represented in separate appropriate data ranges).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In my view, the most conceptually important finding is that H2A.Z-associated reads in sperm pronuclei show ~43% CpG methylation. This directly contradicts the model of strict mutual exclusivity and suggests that the antagonism is context-dependent. Similarly, the finding that the depletion of SRCAP reduces H2A.Z deposition only on unmethylated templates is also very intriguing. Collectively, these result warrants further investigation (see below).</p>
<p>(5) Given that H2A.Z is located at diverse genomic elements (e.g., enhancers, repressed gene bodies, promoters), the manuscript requires a more rigorous genomic annotation comparing H2A.Z occupancy in sperm pronuclei versus XTC-2 cells. The authors should stratify H2A.Z-DNA methylation relationships across promoters, 5′UTRs, exons, gene bodies, enhancers, etc., as described in Supplementary Figure 10A.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(below is response to (4) and (5) together)</p>
<p>We agree that the substantial presence of co-localized H2A.Z and DNA methylation specifically in the sperm pronuclei samples and the changes in pattern between nuclear types are highly interesting and require further investigation. However, we faced technical challenges in our sequencing experiments that made us refrain from conducting a more detailed analysis for fear of over-interpreting potential artifacts. These challenges mainly stemmed from the difficulties in collecting enough material from Xenopus egg extracts and Tn5’s innate bias towards accessible regions of the genome. Because of this, open regions of the genome tend to be overrepresented in our data (as noted in our Discussion), making it challenging to rigorously compare methylation profiles and H2A.Z/H3 associated genomic elements.</p>
<p>While the degree of separation seems to be dependent on nuclei type, we still believe the antagonism exists in both the sperm pronuclei and XTC-2 samples when comparing H2A.Z methylation profiles to the corresponding H3 condition. Our study also demonstrates that H2A.Z is preferentially deposited to hypomethylated DNA in a manner dependent of SRCAP-C (the loss of SRCAP only reduces H2A.Z on unmethylated substrates) but an additional methylation-insensitive H2A.Z deposition mechanism also exists. We realized that this interesting point was not clearly highlighted in Abstract, so we will revise it accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Although H2A.Z accumulates less efficiently on exogenous methylated substrates in egg extract, substantial deposition still occurs (~50%). This observation directly challenges the strong antagonistic model described in the manuscript, yet the authors do not acknowledge or discuss it. Moreover, differences between unmethylated and methylated 601 DNA raise further questions about the biological relevance of the cryo-EM 601 structures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As depicted in Figure 6 and described in the Discussion, we clearly indicated that both methylation-sensitive and methylation-insensitive pathways exist to deposit H2A.Z within the genome. We also directly stated in our Discussion that a substantial proportion of H2A.Z colocalizes with DNA methylation both in our study as well as in previous reports, which is of major interest for future study. Additionally, we further discussed how the absence of transcription in Xenopus eggs is a likely reason for the more limited effect of DNA methylation restricting H2A.Z deposition in our egg extract system.</p>
<p>As noted in our response to (2), the lack of a clear impact on our 601L structures implies that this is due to the extraordinarily strong artificial nucleosome positioning capacity of the 601 sequence and its variants. Since 601 is heavily used in chromatin biology, including within DNA methylation research, such negative data are still useful to include and publish.</p>

<p>(7) The SRCAP depletion is insufficiently validated i.e., the antibody-mediated depletion of SRCAP lacks quantitative verification. A minimum of three biological replicates with quantification is required to substantiate the claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are willing to address this concern. However, please note that our data showed that methylation-dependent H2A.Z deposition is almost completely erased upon SRCAP depletion, indicating functionally effective depletion. The specificity of the custom antibody against Xenopus SRCAP was verified by mass spectrometry. Additionally, we have obtained the same effect using another commercially available SRCAP antibody, though we did not include this preliminary result in our original manuscript. Due to its relatively low abundance and high molecular weight, SRCAP western blot signals are weak, making it challenging to quantify the degree of depletion. We also believe that the value of quantification in this context, with the points noted above, is rather limited. In the past, our lab has published papers on depleting the H3T3 kinase Haspin from Xenopus egg extracts (Ghenoiu et al., 2013; Kelly et al., 2010) but were never able to detect Haspin via western blot. This protein was only detected by mass spectrometry specifically on nucleosome array beads with H3K9me3 (Jenness et al., 2018). However, depletion of Haspin was readily monitored by erasure of H3T3ph, the enzymatic product of Haspin. In these experiments, it was impossible, and not critical, to quantitatively monitor the depletion of Haspin protein in order to investigate its molecular functions. Similarly, in this current study, the important fact is that depletion of SRCAP suppressed methylation-sensitive H2A.Z deposition and quantifying the degree of SRCAP depletion would not have a major impact on this conclusion.</p>

<p>(8) It appears that the role of p400-Tip60 has been completely overlooked. This complex is the second major H2A.Z deposition complex. Because p400 exhibits DNA methylation-insensitive binding (Supplementary Figure 14), it may account for the deposition of H2A.Z onto methylated DNA. This possibility is highly significant and must be addressed by repeating the key experiments in Figure 5 following p400-Tip60 depletion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are aware that the Tip60 complex is a very likely candidate for mediating DNA methylation-insensitive H2A.Z deposition, which is why we tested whether DNA binding of p400 is methylation sensitive. Therefore, the reviewer's statement that we &quot;completely overlooked&quot; Tip60-C’s role does not fairly report on our efforts. We wished to test the potential contribution of Tip60-C, but, unfortunately, the antibodies we currently have available to us were not successful in depleting the complex from egg extract. Since we had no direct experimental evidence indicating the role Tip60-C plays, we decided to take a conservative approach to our model and leave the methylation-insensitive pathway as mediated by something still unidentified. While further investigating Tip60-C’s contribution to this pathway is of definite value, we do not believe that it impacts our major conclusion that SRCAP-C is the main mediator responsible for H2A.Z deposition on unmethylated DNA and thus remains a subject for future study.</p>

<p>(9) The manuscript repeatedly states that H2A.Z nucleosomes are intrinsically unstable; however, this is an oversimplification. Although some DNA unwrapping is observed, multiple studies show that H3/H4 tetramer-H2A.Z/H2B interactions are more stable (important recent studies include the following: DOI: 10.1038/s41594-021-00589-3; 10.1038/s41467-021-22688-x; and reviewed in 10.1038/s41576-024-00759-1).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand that the H2A.Z stability field is highly controversial. We have introduced the many conflicting reports that have been published in the field but can further expand on the controversies if desired. We also understand that the term “nucleosome stability” is broad and encompasses many physical aspects. As noted in a prior response, we will better specify our use of the term within the manuscript. In our assays, we are most focused on the DNA wrapping stability of the nucleosome and have consistently seen in our hands that H2A.Z nucleosomes are much more open and accessible compared to canonical H2A on satellite II-derived sequences, regardless of methylation status. However, we do understand that many groups have observed the opposite findings while others have obtained results similar to us. We reported on our findings of the general H2A.Z stability with the hopes to help clarify some of the field’s controversies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In summary, the current manuscript does not present a convincing mechanistic explanation for the antagonism between DNA methylation and H2A.Z. The observation that H2A.Z can substantially coexist with DNA methylation in sperm pronuclei, perhaps, should be the conceptual focus.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this reviewer’s advice. However, please note that the first author who led this project has already successfully defended their PhD thesis primarily based on this project, making it impractical and unrealistic to completely change the focus of this manuscript to include an entirely new avenue of research. We believe that our data provide important insights into the mechanisms by which H2A.Z is excluded from methylated DNA, particularly via the DNA methylation-sensitive binding of SRCAP-C, which has never been described before. We agree that many questions are still left unanswered, including the exact molecular mechanism behind how DNA methylation prevents SRCAP-C binding. We have preliminary data that suggest none of the known DNA-binding modules of SRCAP-C, including ZNHIT1, by themselves can explain this sensitivity. This implies that domain dissection in the context of the holo-SRCAP complex is required to fully address this question. We believe this represents a very exciting future avenue of study; however, it does not negate our finding that SRCAP-C itself is important for maintaining the DNA methylation/H2A.Z antagonism. Therefore, we respectfully disagree with this reviewer's summary statement, which misleadingly undermines the impact of our work.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Histone variant H2A.Z is evolutionarily conserved among various species. The selective incorporation and removal of histone variants on the genome play crucial roles in regulating nuclear events, including transcription. Shih et al. aimed to address antagonistic mechanisms between histone variant H2A.Z deposition and DNA methylation. To this end, the authors reconstituted H2A.Z nucleosomes in vitro using methylated or unmethylated human satellite II DNA sequence and examined how DNA methylation affects H2A.Z nucleosome structure and dynamics. The cryo-EM analysis revealed that DNA methylation induces a more open conformation in H2A.Z nucleosomes. Consistent with this, their biochemical assays showed that DNA methylation subtly increases restriction enzyme accessibility in H2A.Z nucleosomes compared with canonical H2A nucleosomes. The authors identified genome-wide profiles of H2A.Z and DNA methylation using genomic assays and found their unique distribution between Xenopus sperm pronuclei and fibroblast cells. Using Xenopus egg extract systems, the authors showed SRCAP complex, the chromatin remodelers for H2A.Z deposition, preferentially deposit H2A.Z on unmethylated DNA.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is solid, and most conclusions are well-supported. The experiments are rigorously performed, and interpretations are clear. The study presents a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of human H2A.Z nucleosome with methylated DNA. The discovery that the SRCAP complex senses DNA methylation is novel and provides important mechanistic insight into the antagonism between H2A.Z and DNA methylation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful that this reviewer recognizes the importance of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study is already strong, and most conclusions are well supported. However, it can be further strengthened in several ways.</p>
<p>(1) It is difficult to interpret how DNA methylation alters the orientation of the H4 tail and leads to the additional density on the acidic patch. The data do not convincingly support whether DNA methylation enhances interactions with H2A.Z mono-nucleosomes, nor whether this effect is specific to methylated H2A.Z nucleosomes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The altered H4 tail orientation and extra density seen on the acidic patch were incidental findings that we thought could be interesting for the field to be aware of but decided not to follow up on as there were other structural differences that were more directly related to our central question. We do believe that the above two differences are linked to each other because we used a highly purified and homogenous sample for cryo-EM analysis and the H4 tail/acidic patch interaction is a well characterized contact that mediates inter-nucleosome interactions. Additionally, other groups have reported that the presence of DNA methylation causes condensation of both chromatin and bare DNA (cited within our manuscript), though the mechanics behind this phenomenon remain to be elucidated. We believed that our structure data may also align with those findings. However, the reviewer is fair in pointing out that we do not provide further experimental evidence in verifying the existence of these increased interactions. We can revise our writing to clarify that these points are currently hypotheses rather than validated results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It remains unclear whether DNA methylation alters global H2A.Z nucleosome stability or primarily affects local DNA end flexibility. Moreover, while the authors showed locus-specific accessibility by HinfI digestion, an unbiased assay such as MNase digestion would strengthen the conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for bringing up these issues. Although our current data cannot explicitly clarify these possibilities, we favor an idea that DNA methylation specifically alters histone to DNA contacts and that this effect is felt globally across the entire nucleosome rather than only at specific locations. The intrinsic flexibility of linker DNA ends means that that region tends to exhibit the greatest differences under different physical influences, hence the focus on characterizing that area; flexibility of a thread on a spool is most pronounced at the ends. However, we also found that the DNA backbone of H2A.Z on methylated DNA had a lower local resolution compared to its unmethylated counterpart, despite that structure having a higher global resolution, which suggested to us that DNA positioning along the nucleosome is overall weaker under the presence of DNA methylation. This is corroborated by the increased population of open/shifted structures in our classification analysis. The reviewer raises a fair point about the use of a specific restriction enzyme versus MNase. We agree that our accessibility assay is highly influenced by the position of the restriction site and have previously seen that moving the cut site too close to the linker DNA end will abolish any DNA methylation-dependent differences. We did initially attempt an MNase digestion-based assay, but the data were not as reproducible as with the use of a specific restriction enzyme. We do not know the reason behind this irreproducibility though we believe that the processivity of MNase could make it difficult to capture subtle effects like those induced by DNA methylation on already highly accessible H2A.Z nucleosomes. Overall, while we believe that DNA methylation does exert a physical effect, its subtlety may explain the many contradictory studies present within the DNA methylation and nucleosome stability field.</p>
