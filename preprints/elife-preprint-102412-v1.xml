<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Fever raises body temperature (T<sub>b</sub>) from ∼37°C to beyond 38°C to combat pathogens. While generally well tolerated below 40°C, fevers can induce seizures in 2-5-year-old neurotypical children. This study investigates how neuronal activity is maintained during fever-range temperatures. Recordings of layer (L) 4-evoked spiking in L2/3 mouse somatosensory cortex show that excitatory pyramidal neurons (PNs) may remain inactive, stay active, cease activity, or initiate activity as temperature rises from 30°C (standard in electrophysiology studies) to 36°C (normal T<sub>b</sub>) and then to 39°C (fever-range). Similar proportions of neurons cease or initiate spiking. Thus, “STAY” PNs, which remain active across temperatures changes, are crucial for maintaining stable spiking activity. STAY PNs are more prevalent at younger postnatal ages. To sustain spiking during temperature increases, STAY PNs adjust their depolarization levels to match the spike threshold while remaining temperature-insensitive in input resistance. In the striatum, STAY medium-spiny neurons are likely dopamine (D)2-type receptor-expressing and share similar characteristics with STAY PNs. Intracellular blockade of the thermosensitive channel <italic>TRPV3</italic>, but not <italic>TRPV4</italic>, significantly decreased the population of STAY PNs and reduced spiking at 39°C. Therefore, <italic>TRPV3</italic> function may be critical for maintaining cortical activity during fever.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In most mammals, including humans, core body temperature (T<sub>b</sub>) is tightly regulated between 36.1 and 37.8°C, with a daily fluctuation of 0.5°C (Campbell I, 2008). Fever or thermal challenges can impede heat dissipation to significantly increase T<sub>b</sub> beyond 38°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Since global brain and T<sub>b</sub> are largely congruent, these large temperature elevations affect both areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). T<sub>b</sub> increases up to 40°C are generally well-tolerated, but temperatures above 42°C are noxious, causing protein breakdown and cell death. The body and brain have protective mechanisms, such as heat shock proteins, to handle heat stress. These proteins are rapidly induced or upregulated at noxious temperatures to aid in refolding and degrading damaged proteins upon return to physiological temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Miller and Fort, 2018</xref>). However, mechanisms that preserve firing activity at lower, more physiological temperatures within the fever-range are not well understood.</p>
<p>In rare cases, moderate-grade fevers (Tb = 38.1 to 39°C) cause seizures in children aged 6 months to 6 years, with the highest susceptibility between 2 and 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Oakley et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Shinnar and O’Dell, 2004</xref>). These febrile seizures (FS) are almost typically triggered by the thermal aspect of fever, as infections or metabolic disorders are absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Shinnar and O’Dell, 2004</xref>). Additionally, FS can be induced solely by increased T<sub>b</sub> due to ambient heat, such as a warm bath, hot room, or overdressing. FS generally do not occur beyond five years of age, suggesting the development of biophysiological properties that stabilize brain activity during fever within this 2- to 5-year-old window of susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Shinnar and O’Dell, 2004</xref>). In rodents, there is also an age-dependent susceptibility to seizures induced via exposure to innocuous temperatures (37.5-40°C), which rapidly decreases and is quickly abolished within the first 1-2 postnatal weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Holtzman et al., 1981</xref>). Seizures induced by noxious heat above 42.5°C likely arise via different mechanisms, as such temperatures are associated with cellular protein breakdown and death.</p>
<p>For practical reasons, EEG recordings for the onset of FS in humans are limited. However, EEG traces from rodents with thermally induced seizures show that ictal events often initiate in the hippocampus and propagate to the cortex, with the later spread to the cortex being correlated to the more severe behavioral stages of the seizure i.e. Racine stage &gt; 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dube et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baram et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, the cortex represents a critical locus in the seizure phenotype and likely contains mechanisms that may alter neural activity in response to temperature changes.</p>
<p>Using wildtype mice across three postnatal developmental periods—postnatal day (P)7-8 (neonatal/early), P12-14 (infancy/mid), and P20-26 (juvenile/late)—we investigated the electrophysiological properties, <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, that enable excitatory pyramidal neurons (PNs) neurons in mouse primary somatosensory (S1) cortex to remain active during temperature increases from 30°C (standard in electrophysiology studies) to 36°C (physiological temperature), and then to 39°C (fever-range).</p>
<p>We also attempted to generalize our findings by performing similar recordings of evoked activity in two main striatal projection cell types: medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing dopamine (D)1-type receptors (D1<sup>+</sup> MSNs) and D2-type receptors (D2<sup>+</sup> MSNs). As very few studies have recorded activity in striatal neurons at fever temperatures, these studies also help inform about functional effects of fever temperature on striatal cell function. Furthermore, in humans and mice, methamphetamine (a misused substance), which targets the striatum, can significantly elevate T<sub>b</sub>, as much as 3.5–4.0°C above basal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brown et al., 2003</xref>), so these studies may help uncover neuronal cell types that function at these elevated temperatures to exert behavioral effects.</p>
<p>Lastly, to begin to identify molecular determinants that may mediate the electrophysiological properties that enable PNs to remain spiking, we extended our studies to two members of a family of thermosensitive, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable, nonselective cation channels, the transient receptor potential vanilloid 3-4 (<italic>TRPV</italic> 3-4) channels, that are activated within the innocuous warm temperature range (31-39°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Su et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Shibasaki et al., 2007</xref>). Other members, like <italic>TRPV1</italic> and <italic>TRPV2</italic> are activated by noxious heat above 42°C and 52°C (Kasho and Tominaga, 2022). <italic>TRPV3</italic> and <italic>TRPV4</italic> share low (∼41%) amino acid sequence overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Smith et al., 2002</xref>) and differ somewhat in the temperature threshold for activation. <italic>TRPV3</italic> and <italic>TRPV4</italic> are both expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Xu et al., 2002</xref>; Caterina MJ, 2007; Kanju et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2022</xref>) and are activated between 31–39°C and &gt;27-34 °C, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Su et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Shibasaki et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we aimed to elucidate the adaptative neural mechanisms that enable excitatory PNs to maintain spiking despite substantial increases in brain temperature into the fever range. Our electrophysiological assessments were conducted across three postnatal stages, during which susceptibility to fever-induced seizures naturally varied. With temperature increases from 30°C to 39°C, excitatory PNs responded to depolarizing stimuli by either remaining inactive, staying spiking, ceasing spiking, or initiating spiking. Nearly equal proportions of neurons ceased or initiated activity, so firing stability was largely maintained by the PNs that remained active throughout temperature increases, i.e., the STAY neurons. STAY neurons likely sustain spiking across temperatures due to their unique ion channel composition, including <italic>TRPV3</italic>, which allows for higher depolarization levels through increased excitatory synaptic input relative to inhibitory input.</p>

<title>Body Temperature rises to fever levels during regular activity and exposure to higher ambient temperatures</title>
<p>Contrary to common belief, T<sub>b</sub> is not fixed but varies with arousal state, motor activity, and environmental temperature (Kiyatkin EA, 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hankenson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Using a sterile IPTT-300 implantable temperature transponder (Bio Medic Data Systems, LLC) with a 0.025-second time constant and 0.1°C accuracy, T<sub>b</sub> measurements were recorded every five-minutes over six hours from 2–3-week-old wildtype mice in an open-field arena at room temperature (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This analysis revealed a stable median temperature of 36.5°C with a maximum and minimum fluctuation of 0.5°C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). However, within-subject analysis showed brief T<sub>b</sub> elevations into the fever range (shaded red bars) during increased activity like cage climbing or digging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-C</xref>). Exposure to infrared light elevates ambient temperatures and induces prolonged T<sub>b</sub> elevations into the fever range, with an onset within minutes and a duration of several hours (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Spiking in P12-P14 cortical excitatory pyramidal neurons remains stable as temperature enters the fever range</title>
<p>To investigate how postnatal cortical neurons respond to fever-range temperature, we used whole-cell current clamp electrophysiology to record natural spiking, evoked synaptically, as brain slice temperature gradually rose from 30°C to 36°C to 39°C in PNs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>). Acute S1 cortex slices (350 μm thick) were prepared using standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Antoine et al., 2019</xref>). PNs were visually identified via infrared DIC optics, and physiological verification for regular spiking was done in current clamp. Neuronal activity in PNs was evoked by stimulating in the barrel center of cortical layer (L) 4 using a bipolar electrode (0.2 ms pulses) at a specific stimulation intensity: 1.4X Eθ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Eθ is defined as the minimal intensity evoking an excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) during more than 3 of 5 consecutive sweeps with 10 s inter-sweep interval. Eθ was determined in voltage clamp for each recorded cell, prior to recording post-synaptic potentials (PSPs) and spiking in current clamp. L4- evoked PSPs and spiking, were recorded from L2/3 PNs, with resting membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) set just below spike threshold (-50mV) to simulate in vivo conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Yamashita et al., 2013</xref>).</p>

<p>Recordings of synaptically-evoked activity in L2/3 wildtype cortical excitatory PNs from P12-14 mice showed significant effects of temperature elevations from 30°C to 39°C. These changes resulted in an increased depolarization required to reach spike threshold (ST) (defined as the minimal V<sub>m</sub> that just elicits spiking) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-C</xref>). Consistent with previous findings, measurements of input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>) which reflect the extent to which membrane channels are open, showed significant reductions across all recorded neurons with increasing temperature (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Similar temperature-induced effects on R<sub>in</sub> have been reported in L2/3 PNs in the rat visual cortex (Hardingham and Larkman, 1997) and in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 PNs from P13-P16 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kim and Connors, 2012</xref>). The depolarized ST and reduced R<sub>in</sub> in PNs would likely decrease cell excitability and spiking. Indeed, the percentage of spiking cells decreased during temperature elevations from 30°C to 39°C (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). However, contrary to expectations, average spiking remained remarkably stable (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F-G</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Spiking in P7-8 cortical excitatory pyramidal neurons decreases as temperature enters the fever range</title>
<p>This stability in average spiking at 39°C, despite the loss of some previously active neurons, suggests the presence of temperature-adaptive changes in PNs that help to maintain normal circuit activity levels. These changes may either initiate firing in previously non-spiking neurons or either maintain or elevate spiking levels in currently active cells. Interestingly, in P7-8 mice, temperature elevations from 30°C to 39°C produced similar effects on ST and R<sub>in</sub>, with ST increasing and R<sub>in</sub> decreasing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-D</xref>). However, in P7-8 PNs, during temperature elevations from 36 to 39°C, ST did not increase, and R<sub>in</sub> decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref> and 3C-D ). Additionally, the percentage of spiking PNs decreased during temperature elevations from 30°C to 39°C (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast to P12-14 PNs, the average spiking levels in P7-8 PNs significantly decreased during these temperature elevations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-G</xref>). This suggests that temperature-adaptive changes, possibly involving R<sub>in</sub> and ST, which help maintain average spiking levels at fever temperatures despite the loss of some previously active neurons, may be underdeveloped or absent at this earlier age.</p>

<title>Increased depolarization at higher spike thresholds helps maintain stable spiking activity in cortical pyramidal neurons during temperature elevations</title>
<p>The temperature-induced increases in ST at P12-14, would make it harder for a cell to spike, as larger depolarization levels would be required to maintain spiking (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that in cells with increased ST that remain spiking, a temperature-adaptive change might involve a proportional increase in depolarization. To determine if larger depolarizations were associated with higher (less negative) STs, we analyzed the relationship between peak postsynaptic potential (PSP), which measures maximum depolarization, and ST (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Correlation analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between peak PSP and spike threshold at P12-14, which was absent at P7-8 and P20-23 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). This correlation was specific to these parameters, as it did not occur for comparisons involving input resistance, an intrinsic property which is affected by temperature changes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-E</xref>).</p>

<p>One mechanism that could promote enhanced depolarization is a reduction in the inhibitory PSP (IPSP) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). In addition to the early component of the PSP (the peak), where excitation is maximal, we also quantified the late component, where inhibition levels are greatest and thus largely represents the IPSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhatia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Antoine et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). This analysis revealed that the late PSP was significantly reduced with temperature elevations from 30°C to 39°C with (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>).Correlation analysis indicated that there was no correlation between the ST and LPSP at any age (P7-8: r=0.17, P=0.41, XY pairs=25; P12-14: r=0.24, P=0.31, XY pairs=19; P20-23: r=0.33, P=0.28, XY pairs=13 Pearson’s test). However, a significant, moderate relationship occurred between the magnitude of the LPSP and the PSP threshold (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). Thus, PNs with increased STs and larger PSPs were part of a circuit where synaptic inhibition was reduced across all or most PNs, regardless of whether STs were elevated. These results suggest that at P12-14, ST is sensitive to temperature increases and spiking is maintained by larger depolarization levels in these neurons.</p>

<title>Cortical neurons that remain active at febrile temperatures spike at higher rates, but the excitatory-inhibitory balance remains unchanged</title>

<p>As both excitatory and inhibitory PNs that stay spiking increase their firing rates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) and considering that some neurons within the network are inactive throughout or stop spiking, it is plausible that these events are calibrated such that despite temperature increases, the excitatory to inhibitory (E-I) balance within the circuit may remain relatively unchanged. Indeed, recordings of L4-evoked excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (respectively EPSCs and IPSCs) in wildtype L2/3 excitatory PNs in S1 cortex, where inhibition is largely mediated by the parvalbumin positive (PV) interneurons, showed that E-I balance (defined as E/E+I, the ratio of the excitatory current to the total current) remained unchanged as temperature increased from 36 to 39°C (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Along with the 11.1% of recorded excitatory PNs that stayed spiking during temperature increases from 36°C to 39°C, roughly equal proportions of neurons stopped spiking and started spiking (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, neurons that maintain spiking at fever temperatures play a crucial role in determining the overall activity levels of the circuit. Additionally, we found that the proportion of PNs that remain spiking from 36°C to 39°C is higher at earlier ages (P12-14) compared to later ages (P20-23) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>).</p>

<title>Excitatory pyramidal neurons that remain spiking with temperature elevations into fever range exhibit unique intrinsic properties</title>
<p>As neurons that remain spiking with temperature elevations may be crucial in setting overall cortical circuit activity levels, we sought to uncover additional information about the intrinsic characteristics of cortical PNs at P12-14 that facilitate their activity at 36°C to 39°C. We refer to neurons that retained spiking at all three temperatures (30°C, 36°C, and 39°C) as STAY neurons, while those that stopped spiking upon temperature transitions from 30°C to 36°C or 36°C to 39°C are denoted as STOP neurons. Firstly, in STOP and STAY neurons, ST increased during temperature elevations from 30°C to 39°C (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). However, in STOP PNs, the increases in ST were greater than in those neurons that continued spiking (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).

<p>There was an interaction of temperature and whether the PNs were STOP or STAY cells in the PSP (P=0.048, two-way ANOVA, mixed-effects model), with a trend toward larger PSPs in the STAY PNs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). STAY cells showed a strong positive correlation between PSP and ST (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-D</xref>). At 30°C, STAY neurons had larger LPSPs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). However, inhibition levels in these PNs were unique in that inhibition levels significantly decreased with temperature elevations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Moreover, we found a significant moderate inverse correlation between ST and LPSP in the STAY cells that remain spiking at 39°C (r=-0.57, P=0.046, XY pairs=13, Spearman). Thus, in PNs that STAY spiking, the excitation and inhibition levels are matched to facilitate greater depolarization and maintain spiking activity. Temperature-induced alterations in spike height and spike afterhyperpolarization (AHP) were not different between STAY and STOP cells, while R<sub>in</sub> was largely insensitive to temperature changes in STAY PNs but not in STOP PNs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F-H</xref>).</p>

<title>Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that remain spiking with temperature elevations into fever range exhibit unique intrinsic properties</title>
<p>To determine whether the effects on ST, PSP, and R<sub>in</sub> were specific to STAY PNs or also extended to other cell types, we used BAC transgenic <italic>Drd1a-tdTomato</italic> and <italic>Drd2-EGFP</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ade et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gong et al., 2003</xref>) to record evoked spiking from the two main striatal projection cell types: medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing dopamine (D)1-type receptors (D1<sup>+</sup> MSNs) and D2-type receptors (D2<sup>+</sup> MSNs), respectively. As with the cortical PNs recordings, firing in MSNs was evoked via a fixed magnitude of stimulation (1.4X Eθ) via an electrode placed nearby in the corpus callosum (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Whole-cell current clamp recordings were made from D1<sup>+</sup> MSNs and D2<sup>+</sup> MSNs in the dorsolateral striatum.

Similar to the PNs, a strong interaction effect of temperature and whether the D1<sup>+</sup> MSNs were STOP or STAY cells was observed for the PSP (P=0.041, Two-way repeated measures ANOVA, mixed-effects model). The magnitude of the PSPs in STOP D1<sup>+</sup> MSNs decreased during temperature elevations from 30°C to 39°C and 36°C to 39°C, while the PSPs in STAY cells remained unchanged (STOP (mV): 30°C: 2.96 ± 0.72, 36°C: 2.57 ± 0.40, 39°C: 1.74 ± 0.33; 36°C to 39°C: P=0.003; 30°C to 39°C: P=0.045; STAY(mV): 30°C: 2.22 ± 0.30, 36°C: 2.63 ± 0.91, 39°C: 3.90 ± 1.40, Two way repeated measures ANOVA, mixed-effects model) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>).

However, it did abolish the temperature induced increases in the PSP (<italic>TRPV3</italic> blocker: 30°C: 2.37 ± 0.36, 36°C: 2.45 ± 0.38, 39°C: 2.22 ± 0.25; No blocker: 30°C: 2.47 ± 0.32, 36°C: 2.90 ± 0.32, 39°C: 3.32 ± 0.52 , 30 vs 39°C: P=0.030, One-way repeated measures ANOVA, mixed-effects model with Dunnett’s test). Consistently, <italic>TRPV3</italic> block abolished the positive correlation between ST and PSP (No block: XY pairs=27, <italic>TRPV3</italic> blocker: XY pairs=18, Pearson’s test) (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9D</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in keeping with the correlation between the magnitude of the LPSP and the PSP threshold, we found that <italic>TRPV3</italic> blockade also prevented the temperature induced decreases in the LPSP (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9E</xref>). Moreover, these reductions in spiking with <italic>TRPV3</italic> blockade were not dependent on temperature-induced decreases in R<sub>in</sub>, as changes to PNs were similar in the <italic>TRPV3</italic> block and no-block conditions (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9F</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that either <italic>TRPV3</italic> expression or the functional effects of <italic>TRPV3</italic> ( e.g., mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> or other cation (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>) influx), may define the subset of STAY neurons. Given this role, loss of <italic>TRPV3</italic> is not expected to contribute to seizure activity but rather to promote temperature-induced hypoactivity in cortical circuits. Intriguingly, <italic>TRPV4</italic> blockade caused a subset of PNs to initiate spiking at 39°C (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>). Thus, low <italic>TRPV4</italic> expression could define cells that are likely to become active at 39°C.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we aimed to elucidate adaptive neural mechanisms that enable excitatory PNs to remain active despite substantial increases in brain temperature into the fever range. Our electrophysiological assessments across three postnatal ages, P7-8, P12-14 and P20-23 showed that excitatory PNs responded to temperature increases from 30°C to 39°C by either remaining inactive, staying active, ceasing activity, or initiating activity. Roughly equal portions of neurons ceased or initiated activity, so firing stability was largely maintained by those that remained active, i.e., STAY neurons. The overall proportion of PNs that remain spiking from 36°C to 39°C was higher in infancy compared to juvenile ages. This increased proportion at earlier ages could potentially reflect the increased risk for febrile seizure occurrence at earlier postnatal ages.</p>
<p>STAY neurons likely possess a unique composition of ion channels that enable them to exhibit temperature sensitivity in spike threshold but not in input resistance, and adjust their depolarization levels to match the ST value. Our initial characterization focused on <italic>TRPV</italic> 3 and TRPV4, two members of a family of thermosensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid channels that are expressed in the brain and activated between 30-39°C, the temperature range of our study. Intracellular blockade of <italic>TRPV3</italic>, but not <italic>TRPV4</italic>, significantly decreased the population of STAY PNs and prevented stability in spiking activity during temperature increases into fever range.</p>
<p><italic>TRPV3</italic> is highly expressed in various tissues, including epithelial cells of the skin and oropharynx, the tongue, testis, dorsal root ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, spinal cord and brain (Moussaieff A et al., 2008 and Xu et al., 2002). It plays a crucial role in skin and hair generation as well as in the perception of pain and warmth on the skin. However, its role in the central nervous system remains to be further elucidated. In the brain, TRPV3 is expressed in several neuronal types, including cortical and striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Xu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>TRPV3</italic> has a reported temperature threshold for activation between 31–39°C, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Smith et al., 2002</xref> noting activation at 39°C. Consistent with this, we observed the strongest physiological effects in cortical PNs at 39°C. At this temperature, intracellular blockade of <italic>TRPV3</italic> reduced average spiking levels and temperature-induced increases in the PSP. Additionally, a potential early postnatal temperature-dependent activity mechanism in PNs, where levels of excitatory and inhibitory input are adjusted to match the cell’s ST, was abolished with <italic>TRPV3</italic> blockade. Altogether, these results suggest that TRPV3 blockade reduces net activity in sensory cortical circuits by decreasing activity in STAY cells.</p>
<p>Although, <italic>TRPV3</italic> channels are cation-nonselective, they exhibit high permeability to Ca<sup>2+</sup> ( Ca2+&gt;Na<sup>+</sup>≍K<sup>+</sup>≍Cs<sup>+</sup>) with permeability ratios (relative to Na<sup>+</sup>) of 12.1, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Xu et al., 2002</xref>). Opening of <italic>TRPV3</italic> channels activates a nonselective cationic conductance and elevates membrane depolarization, which can increase the likelihood of generating action potentials. Indeed, our observations of a loss of the temperature-induced increases in the PSP with <italic>TRPV3</italic> blockade are consistent with a reduction in membrane depolarization. In S1 cortical circuits at P12-14, STAY PNs appear to rely on a temperature-dependent activity mechanism, where depolarization levels (mediated by higher excitatory input and lower inhibitory input) are scaled to match the cell’s ST. Thus, an inability to increase PSPs with temperature elevations prevents PNs from reaching ST, so they cease spiking.</p>
<p>Previous research in <italic>Trpv3</italic> <sup>-/-</sup> KO mice revealed a similar phenotype of reduced activity with diminished <italic>TRPV3</italic> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Whole-cell current-clamp recordings from striatal MSNs and L2 stellate neurons in the entorhinal cortex at 36.5-37.5°C showed that <italic>TRPV3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells exhibited reduced intrinsic excitability, as evidenced by fewer spikes in response to 400-ms current steps, a hyperpolarized RMP, and a decrease in mEPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). These electrophysiological effects were also replicated using pharmacological inhibition of <italic>TRPV3</italic> with 50 μmol/L forsythoside B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, consistent with the idea that ischemic injury upregulates <italic>TRPV3</italic> expression, leading to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and progressive cell death, inhibition of <italic>TRPV3</italic>, rather than N-methyl-D-aspartate (<italic>NMDA</italic>) receptors, protected against progressive cell death after stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>As STAY PNs and neurons that initiate spiking at fever temperature (“START” cells) are active at fever temperature, future research will focus on the molecular characterization of these cells in the cortex and elsewhere in the brain at P12-14 and other ages. Interestingly, neurons that initiate spiking at fever temperature are more prevalent at P20-23 than at the earlier ages examined. <italic>TRPV4</italic> block caused a subset of PNs to initiate spiking at 39°C, suggesting that low <italic>TRPV4</italic> expression could define the population of START cells, at least at P12-14. Our initial characterization of D1<sup>+</sup> and D2<sup>+</sup> MSNs showed some overlap in the functional characteristics of STAY cells in L2/3 S1 cortex and the striatum, but further research is needed to determine whether a conserved set of channels functionally define these cell types across multiple brain regions.</p>
<p>Molecular characterization of STAY and START cell types may provide additional insights into their function within normal brain circuits. In response to specific experiences, selective subsets of neurons, known as “engrams,” may become active to encode specific memories or behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). Alternatively, neurons that become active could initiate responses to specific stimuli, such as an increase in brain temperature. In this latter scenario, these neurons may be part of the brain’s homeostatic response to temperature increases, while STAY neurons may play a critical role in facilitating ongoing cognitive functions during a fever. Future research into the molecular characterization of these cell types could offer opportunities to target and modulate their activity in a brain region-specific manner, potentially advancing treatments for fever-associated seizures or epilepsies, such as Dravet Syndrome (a genetic epilepsy typically initiating in early infancy) and febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES).</p>

<p>All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals and the EC Council Directive of September 22, 2010 (2010/63/EU). All experiemnts were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) (Protocol # LIN-MA-1) and the Animal Care Committee of the Research Centre for Natural Sciences (RCNS) and by the National Food Chain Safety Office of Hungary (license number: PE/EA/1004-5/2021). Mice were housed under standard conditions with ad libitum access to food and water, under a 12-h light/dark cycle. The following mouse strains were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) or the Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center (MMRRC) and bred in onsite Colonies at the NIAAA or RCNS: C57BL/6J (JAX 000664), FVB/N mice(JAX 004828), Drd2- EGFP <bold>(</bold>MMRRC: 000230-UNC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gong et al., 2003</xref>); Drd1-tdTomato (JAX 016204) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ade et al., 2011</xref>).

<title>Body Temperature Measurements</title>
<p>All mice used for body temperature (T<sub>b</sub>) recordings were implanted with sterile IPTT-300 Implantable Programmable Temperature transponders (Bio Medic Data Systems, LLC) at 2 weeks of age. The injection site was pre-cleaned with a betadine solution, and the sterile transponders were injected subcutaneously using a pre-loaded 12-gauge syringe into animals anesthetized with 4-5% isoflurane. The injection site was on the left side, approximately 11 cm from the base of the hip, with the animal in the prone position. Post-implantation, the mice were able to move, eat, and drink autonomously, with no adverse phenotypes noted. T<sub>b</sub> recording commenced at least 5 days after injection. Prior to recording, mice were brought into the procedure room and allowed to habituate for 1 hour. T<sub>b</sub> was recorded every 5 minutes for 6 hours using an IPTT-300 Implantable Programmable Temperature reader (DAS-8027) in a 37L x 16W x 13H cm cage. T<sub>b</sub> was recorded in the presence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) or absence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>) of infrared light. Infrared light exposure was provided via a 250-W temperature-controlled infrared lamp (catalog #50320, Stoelting), set to 32.5-33.5 °C. The lamp was positioned ∼15 cm above the cage, and the ambient temperature was monitored every 5 minutes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Slice Preparation</title>
<p>Using standard methods, acute primary somatosensory cortex (S1) slices (350 µm thick) from P7-8, P12-14, or P20-23 mice were cut in the “across-row” plane, oriented 35° toward coronal from midsagittal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Antoine et al., 2019</xref>). Striatal slices (350 µm thick) were cut in the coronal plane at bregma (+1.3 mm to +0.5 mm) from P12-14 mice. The cutting solution contained (in mM): 85 NaCl, 75 sucrose, 25 D- (+)-glucose, 4 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 KCI, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 ascorbic acid, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Once cut, slices were transferred to a submerged-style holding chamber containing standard Ringer’s solution (in mM: 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCI, 1.3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26.2 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11 D-(+)-glucose and 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>) and then incubated at 32°C for 30 minutes. Both solutions were at neural pH (i.e., 7.3), 300 mOsm, and saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

<title><italic>In Vitro</italic> Physiology</title>
<p>Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were made from pyramidal neurons (PNs) visually identified via infrared DIC optics, or from D1<sup>+</sup> and D2<sup>+</sup> MSNs identified via the expression of the fluorescent proteins <italic>tdTomato</italic> and <italic>EGFP</italic>, respectively. Physiological verification for regular spiking was done in current clamp. Recordings were made using 3-6 MΩ micropipettes containing (in mM):116 K gluconate, 20 HEPES, 6 KCI, 2 NaCl, 0.5 EGTA, 4MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, 10 Na phosphocreatine, with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Where applicable, forsythoside B (50 µM, <italic>TRPV3</italic> blocker, Millipore Sigma Cat #: PHL83313) or RN1734 (10 µM, <italic>TRPV4 blocker</italic>, Tocris Bioscience Cat #: 3746/25) was added to the internal solution. Camphor (MedChem, Cat. No: HY-N0808) was added to the bath solution for experiments in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">figure 8</xref>.</p>
<p>Signals were low-pass filtered (2-6 kHz) and digitized (10-20 kHz). Perfusate temperature for all in vitro experiments was regulated by a PC-connected Peltier heater (SM-4600, Scientifica, UK) and temperature controller (Linlab2, Scientifica, UK), with a high-accuracy, low-noise temperature control system, containing both a built-in temperature sensor and bath sensor for accurate feedback. ACSF flow rates of ∼3 ml/min were used to facilitate efficient heating/cooling.</p>
<p>To determine the effect of temperature on an activated cortical network, layer 4-evoked spiking was quantified during perfusate temperature increases from 30°C to 36°C, and then to fever range (∼39°C) while recording membrane potential. The slicing plane facilitated clear identification of whisker barrel columns, and neuronal activity was evoked by stimulating the barrel center using a bipolar electrode (0.2 ms pulses) at a stimulation of 1.4 Eθ. Eθ is defined as the minimal intensity that evoked a consistent excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) during more than 3 of 5 consecutive sweeps with 10 s ISI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Antoine et al., 2019</xref>). Eθ was determined in voltage clamp for each recorded cell prior to recording PSPs and spiking in current clamp. A new brain slice was used for each recording. L4- evoked feedforward post synaptic potentials (PSPs) and spiking were recorded in single L2/3 PNs from a pre-stimulus baseline membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) of -50 mV. This V<sub>m</sub>, just below spike threshold, was selected to mimic <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions, as PNs <italic>in vivo</italic> can reside within this V<sub>m</sub> range during whisker exploration of objects or surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Yamashita et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, D1<sup>+</sup> and D2<sup>+</sup> MSNs in the dorsolateral striatum, which respond to whisker stimulation, can reach similar V<sub>m</sub> levels during whisking epochs or other sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Druart et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">de la Torre-Martinez et al., 2023</xref>). Evoked spikes were analyzed over a 150-ms interval, starting 2-3 ms post-stimulus, for 11 sweeps at 10 s inter-sweep interval (ISI). Spike threshold was defined as the membrane potential (<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>) at which the second derivative of <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> was &gt;5 SDs above the pre-stimulus period.</p>

<title>Animal Surgery and Electrophysiological Recordings</title>
<p>Experiments were done under general anesthesia where five mice (age, P24-26; body weight, 7-10 g; both genders) received an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Regular doses of the ketamine/xylazine cocktail were given intramuscularly to maintain the depth of anesthesia during the experimental sessions. Up until the thermal fever protocol started, the T<sub>b</sub> of the animals was kept at 36°C using a homeothermic heating pad connected to a temperature controller (Supertech, Pécs, Hungary). To measure the internal body temperature, a Type T thermocouple microprobe (MT-29/5; Physitemp Instruments, Clifton, NJ, USA) was placed in the rectum of the animal. The microprobe has a shaft diameter of 330 µm, a time constant of 0.025 second and 0.1°C accuracy.</p>
<p>To perform high-density extracellular electrophysiological recordings, mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA), then two circular craniotomies (∼1.5 mm in diameter) were made with a dental drill above the left and right barrel cortices. The craniotomies were centered at the following stereotaxic coordinates: anterior-posterior (AP): −1.0 mm; medial-lateral (ML): 3.5 mm (with respect to the bregma; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Paxinos and Franklin 2001</xref>). Two commercially available Neuropixels 1.0 silicon probes (imec, Leuven, Belgium; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jun et al., 2017</xref>) mounted on two motorized stereotaxic micromanipulators (Neurostar, Tubingen, Germany) were implanted into the brain, one into the left and the other into the right barrel cortex, to a depth of 1.5 mm. An insertion speed of 2 µm/s was used to decrease the mechanical trauma caused by the probe insertion (Fiáth et al. 2019).</p>
<p>In order for the probe tracks to be perpendicular to cortical layers, the probes were inserted at an angle of 20 degrees from vertical. The dura mater in the craniotomy was left intact, except when it was too thick and thus the silicon probe could not pierce through this layer (which was indicated by significant probe buckling; n = 3 insertions). In these cases a 36 gauge, slightly bent needle was used to carefully cut the dura above the targeted cortical area. After the probe reached its final insertion depth, to allow the brain tissue to settle, we waited at least 10 minutes before electrophysiological recording was started. Spiking activity of cortical neurons (action potential band, 300–10.000 Hz) was recorded on 384 channels (768 channels in total for the two probes), with a sampling rate of 30 kHz/channel and with a gain of 500 (yielding a resolution of 2.34 μV per bit). Data were acquired using the SpikeGLX open-source software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/">http://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>A common stainless steel wire inserted into the neck muscle of the animal served as the external reference and ground electrode. To avoid the dehydration of the cortex, the skull and the craniotomy was kept moist during the whole experiment using body temperature, sterile physiological saline solution and Gelaspon. Before starting the experimental protocol, manual whisker stimulation (by repetitively touching the whiskers of the animal with a cotton swab) was used to verify the recording position. In all cases (n = 10 probe insertions), we detected strong whisker-evoked neuronal activity.</p>

<title>Thermal Fever Protocol during Electrophysiological Recordings</title>
<p>First, we recorded cortical activity for 45 minutes at ∼36°C body temperature (“baseline” period), then the body temperature of the animal was elevated with the aid of the heating pad and a power bank with warming capability which was placed next to the mouse. The body temperature was increased from 36°C to 39°C in about 5 minutes (∼0.01°C/s). The elevated body temperature was maintained for 45 minutes (“thermal fever” period). Next, we turned off the heating until the T<sub>b</sub> reached physiological temperatures (36°C; ∼5 min; ∼0.01°C/s). Cortical activity was recorded for another 45 minutes at 36°C body temperature (“recovery” period). Continuous recordings with a total duration of 145 minutes were obtained for each mouse.</p>

<sec id="s4g">
<title>Spike Sorting and Data Analysis</title>
<p>To extract cortical single-unit activity, spike sorting was performed with Kilosort2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort">https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort</ext-link>; Pachitariu et al., 2016a, 2016b) using the default parameter set (available in the StandardConfig.m file). Channels containing activity acquired by recording sites located outside the cortex were removed before spike sorting (usually ∼130 channels/probe recorded from the barrel cortex). The list of single unit clusters generated by Kilosort2 was visually inspected to remove units considered as noise (e.g., units with abnormal spike waveform shapes) or multi-unit activity (e.g., clusters with a contaminated refractory period). Manual curation of the Kilosort2 results was done with the Phy Python library, which provides a graphical user interface for interactive visualization of high-density data and supplies operations for merging, splitting and marking of clusters (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy">https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Rossant et al., 2016</xref>). In this dataset, we aimed to keep only those single units which had at least 900 spikes (&gt;∼0.1 Hz firing rate), a clear refractory period, a consistent waveform shape and whose spikes were present throughout the 145-minute-long recording.</p>
<p>Following manual curation, based on their spike waveform duration, the selected single units (n = 633) were separated into putative inhibitory interneurons and excitatory principal cells (Barthó et al., 2004). The spike duration was calculated as the time difference between the trough and the subsequent waveform peak of the mean filtered (300 – 6000 Hz bandpassed) spike waveform. Durations of extracellularly recorded spikes showed a bimodal distribution (Hartigan’s dip test; p &lt; 0.001) characteristic of the neocortex with shorter durations corresponding to putative interneurons (narrow spikes) and longer durations to putative principal cells (wide spikes). Next, k-means clustering was used to separate the single units into these two groups, which resulted in 140 interneurons (spike duration &lt; 0.6 ms) and 493 principal cells (spike duration &gt; 0.6 ms), corresponding to a typical 22% - 78% (interneuron – principal) cell ratio. Finally, the firing rates of neurons were computed separately during the three distinguished periods (baseline, thermal fever and recovery). To decrease the effect of transient changes (e.g., tissue recovery during the baseline period or the short-term effect of heating during the thermal fever period), for each 45-minute-long period, we used only the last 25- minutes to calculate the mean firing rates of neurons.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were conducted using Prism 9.0 (GraphPad). For experiments, at least 3 mice from a minimum of 2 separate litters were used, with littermates typically included across the age groups P7-8, P12-14, and P20-23. Non-Gaussian data were either log-transformed for parametric testing or subjected to nonparametric tests, as specified in the results and figure legends. Significance was consistently reported at α = 0.05. Details on the statistical tests used are provided in the figure captions.</p>

<p>The paper by Chen et al describes the role of neuronal themo-TRPV3 channels in the firing of cortical neurons at a fever temperature range. The authors began by demonstrating that exposure to infrared light increasing ambient temperature causes body temperature to rise to a fever level above 38{degree sign}C. Subsequently, they showed that at the fever temperature of 39{degree sign}C, the spike threshold (ST) increased in both populations (P12-14 and P7-8) of cortical excitatory pyramidal neurons (PNs). However, the spike number only decreased in P7-8 PNs, while it remained stable in P12-14 PNs at 39 degrees centigrade. In addition, the fever temperature also reduced the late peak postsynaptic potential (PSP) in P12-14 PNs. The authors further characterized the firing properties of cortical P12-14 PNs, identifying two types: STAY PNs that retained spiking at 30{degree sign}C, 36{degree sign}C, and 39{degree sign}C, and STOP PNs that stopped spiking upon temperature change. They further extended their analysis and characterization to striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and found that STAY MSNs and PNs shared the same ST temperature sensitivity. Using small molecule tools, they further identified that themo-TRPV3 currents in cortical PNs increased in response to temperature elevation, but not TRPV4 currents. The authors concluded that during fever, neuronal firing stability is largely maintained by sensory STAY PNs and MSNs that express functional TRPV3 channels. Overall, this study is well designed and executed with substantial controls, some interesting findings, and quality of data. Here are some specific comments:</p>
<p>(1) Could the authors discuss, or is there any evidence of, changes in TRPV3 expression levels in the brain during the postnatal 1-4 week age range in mice?</p>
<p>(2) Are there any differential differences in TRPV3 expression patterns that could explain the different firing properties in response to fever temperature between the STAY- and STOP neurons?</p>
<p>(3) TRPV3 and TRPV4 can co-assemble to form heterotetrameric channels with distinct functional properties. Do STOP neurons exhibit any firing behaviors that could be attributed to the variable TRPV3/4 assembly ratio?</p>
<p>(4) In Figure 7, have the authors observed an increase of TRPV3 currents in MSNs in response to temperature elevation?</p>
<p>(5) Is there any evidence of a relationship between TRPV3 expression levels in D2+ MSNs and degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons?</p>
<p>(6) Does fever range temperature alter the expressions of other neuronal Kv channels known to regulate the firing threshold?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors study the excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in response to layer four stimulation at temperatures ranging from 30 to 39 Celsius in P7-8, P12-P14, and P22-P24 animals. They also measure brain temperature and spiking in vivo in response to externally applied heat. Some pyramidal neurons continue to fire action potentials in response to stimulation at 39 C and are called stay neurons. Stay neurons have unique properties aided by TRPV3 channel expression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use various techniques and assemble large amounts of data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) No hyperthermia-induced seizures were recorded in the study.</p>
<p>(2) Febrile seizures in humans are age-specific, extending from 6 months to 6 years. While translating to rodents is challenging, according to published literature (see Baram), rodents aged P11-16 experience seizures upon exposure to hyperthermia. The rationale for publishing data on P7-8 and P22-24 animals, which are outside this age window, must be clearly explained to address a potential weakness in the study.</p>
<p>(3) Authors evoked responses from layer 4 and recorded postsynaptic potentials, which then caused action potentials in layer 2/3 neurons in the current clamp. The post-synaptic potentials are exquisitely temperature-sensitive, as the authors demonstrate in Figures 3 B and 7D. Note markedly altered decay of synaptic potentials with rising temperature in these traces. The altered decays will likely change the activation and inactivation of voltage-gated ion channels, adjusting the action potential threshold.</p>
<p>(4) The data weakly supports the claim that the E-I balance is unchanged at higher temperatures. Synaptic transmission is exquisitely temperature-sensitive due to the many proteins and enzymes involved. A comprehensive analysis of spontaneous synaptic current amplitude, decay, and frequency is crucial to fully understand the effects of temperature on synaptic transmission.</p>
<p>(5) It is unclear how the temperature sensitivity of medium spiny neurons is relevant to febrile seizures. Furthermore, the most relevant neurons are hippocampal neurons since the best evidence from human and rodent studies is that febrile seizures involve the hippocampus.</p>
<p>(6) TRP3V3 data would be convincing if the knockout animals did not have febrile seizures.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This important study combines in vitro and in vivo recording to determine how the firing of cortical and striatal neurons changes during a fever range temperature rise (37-40 oC). The authors found that certain neurons will start, stop, or maintain firing during these body temperature changes. The authors further suggested that the TRPV3 channel plays a role in maintaining cortical activity during fever.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The topic of how the firing pattern of neurons changes during fever is unique and interesting. The authors carefully used in vitro electrophysiology assays to study this interesting topic.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) In vivo recording is a strength of this study. However, data from in vivo recording is only shown in Figures 5A,B. This reviewer suggests the authors further expand on the analysis of the in vivo Neuropixels recording. For example, to show single spike waveforms and raster plots to provide more information on the recording. The authors can also separate the recording based on brain regions (cortex vs striatum) using the depth of the probe as a landmark to study the specific firing of cortical neurons and striatal neurons. It is also possible to use published parameters to separate the recording based on spike waveform to identify regular principal neurons vs fast-spiking interneurons. Since the authors studied E/I balance in brain slices, it would be very interesting to see whether the &quot;E/I balance&quot; based on the firing of excitatory neurons vs fast-spiking interneurons might be changed or not in the in vivo condition.</p>
<p>(2) The author should propose a potential mechanism for how TRPV3 helps to maintain cortical activity during fever. Would calcium influx-mediated change of membrane potential be the possible reason? Making a summary figure to put all the findings into perspective and propose a possible mechanism would also be appreciated.</p>
<p>(3) The author studied P7-8, P12-14, and P20-26 mice. How do these ages correspond to the human ages? it would be nice to provide a comparison to help the reader understand the context better.</p>

<p>The paper by Chen et al describes the role of neuronal themo-TRPV3 channels in the firing of cortical neurons at a fever temperature range.

Using small molecule tools, they further identified that themo-TRPV3 currents in cortical PNs increased in response to temperature elevation, but not TRPV4 currents. The authors concluded that during fever, neuronal firing stability is largely maintained by sensory STAY PNs and MSNs that express functional TRPV3 channels. Overall, this study is well designed and executed with substantial controls, some interesting findings, and quality of data. Here are some specific comments:</p>
<p>(1) Could the authors discuss, or is there any evidence of, changes in TRPV3 expression levels in the brain during the postnatal 1-4 week age range in mice?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To our knowledge, no published studies have documented changes in <italic>TRPV3</italic> expression levels in the brain during the 1st to 4th postnatal weeks in mice. Research on <italic>TRPV3</italic> expression in the mouse brain has primarily involved RT-PCR analysis of RNA from dissociated tissue in adult mice (Jang et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2018), largely due to the scarcity of effective antibodies for brain tissue sections at the time of publication. Furthermore, the Allen Brain Atlas lacks data on <italic>TRPV3</italic> expression in the developing or postnatal brain. To address this gap, we plan to examine <italic>TRPV3</italic> expression at P7-8, P12-13, and P20-23 as part of our manuscript revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Are there any differential differences in TRPV3 expression patterns that could explain the different firing properties in response to fever temperature between the STAY- and STOP neurons?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an excellent question and one we plan to explore in the future by developing reporter mice or viral tools to monitor the activity of cells with endogenous <italic>TRPV3</italic> expression. To our knowledge, these tools do not currently exist. Creating them will be challenging, as it requires identifying promoters that accurately reflect endogenous <italic>TRPV3</italic> expression. We have not yet quantified <italic>TRPV3</italic> expression in STOP and STAY neurons; however, our analysis of evoked spiking activity at 30, 36, and 39°C suggests that <italic>TRPV3</italic> expression may mark a population of pyramidal neurons that tend to STAY spiking as temperatures increase. To investigate this further, we are considering patch-seq for <italic>TRPV3</italic> expression on recorded neurons. This is a complex experiment, as it requires recording activity at three different temperatures and subsequently collecting the cell contents. While success is not guaranteed, we are committed to attempting these experiments as part of our revisions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) TRPV3 and TRPV4 can co-assemble to form heterotetrameric channels with distinct functional properties. Do STOP neurons exhibit any firing behaviors that could be attributed to the variable TRPV3/4 assembly ratio?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There is some evidence that <italic>TRPV3</italic> and <italic>TRPV4</italic> proteins can physically associate in HEK293 cells and native skin tissues (Hu et al., 2022).  <italic>TRPV3</italic> and <italic>TRPV4</italic> are both expressed in the cortex (Kumar et al., 2018), but it remains unclear whether they are co-expressed and co-assembled to form heteromeric channels in cortical excitatory  pyramidal neurons.  Examination of the I-V curve from HEK cells co-expressing TRPV3/4 heteromeric channels shows enhanced current at negative membrane potentials (Hu et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Currently, we cannot characterize cells as STOP or STAY and measure <italic>TRPV3</italic> or <italic>TRPV4</italic> currents simultaneously, as this would require different experimental setups and internal solutions. Additionally, the protocol involves a sequence of recordings at 30, 36, and 39°C, followed by cooling back to 30°C and re-heating to each temperature. Cells undergoing such a protocol will likely not survive till the end.</p>
<p>In our recordings of <italic>TRPV3</italic> currents—which likely include both STOP and STAY cells—we do not observe a significant current at negative voltages, suggesting that <italic>TRPV3/4</italic> heteromeric channels may either be absent or underrepresented, at least at a 1:1 ratio. However, the possibility that <italic>TRPV3/4</italic> heteromeric channels could define the STOP cell population is intriguing and plausible.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 7, have the authors observed an increase of TRPV3 currents in MSNs in response to temperature elevation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have not recorded <italic>TRPV3</italic> currents in MSNs in response to elevated temperatures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Is there any evidence of a relationship between TRPV3 expression levels in D2+ MSNs and degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting question, though it falls outside our current research focus in the lab. A PubMed search yields no results connecting the terms <italic>TRPV3</italic>, <italic>MSNs</italic>, and <italic>degeneration</italic>. However, gain-of-function mutations in <italic>TRPV4</italic> channel activity have been implicated in motor neuron degeneration (Sullivan et al., 2024) and axon degeneration (Woolums et al., 2020). Similarly, <italic>TRPV1</italic> activation has been linked to developmental axon degeneration (Johnstone et al., 2019), while <italic>TRPV3</italic> blockade has shown neuroprotective effects in models of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice (Chen et al., 2022).</p>
<p>The link between TRPV activation and cell degeneration, however, may not be straightforward. For instance, <italic>TRPV1</italic> loss has been shown to accelerate stress-induced degradation of axonal transport from retinal ganglion cells to the superior colliculus and to cause degeneration of axons in the optic nerve (Ward et al., 2014). Meanwhile, <italic>TRPV1</italic> activation by capsaicin preserves the survival and function of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons in the MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease (Chung et al., 2017).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Does fever range temperature alter the expressions of other neuronal Kv channels known to regulate the firing threshold?</p>
</disp-quote>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors study the excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in response to layer four stimulation at temperatures ranging from 30 to 39 Celsius in P7-8, P12-P14, and P22-P24 animals. They also measure brain temperature and spiking in vivo in response to externally applied heat. Some pyramidal neurons continue to fire action potentials in response to stimulation at 39 C and are called stay neurons. Stay neurons have unique properties aided by TRPV3 channel expression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use various techniques and assemble large amounts of data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) No hyperthermia-induced seizures were recorded in the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The goal of this manuscript is to uncover the age-related physiological changes that enable the brain to retain function at fever temperatures. These changes may potentially explain why most children do not experience febrile seizures or why, in the rare cases when they do occur, the most prominent window of susceptibility is between 2-5 years of age (Shinnar and O’Dell, 2004), as this may coincide with the window during which these developmental changes are normally occurring. While it is possible that impairments in these mechanisms could result in febrile seizures, another possibility is that neural activity may fall below the level required to maintain normal function.</p>

<p>(2) Febrile seizures in humans are age-specific, extending from 6 months to 6 years. While translating to rodents is challenging, according to published literature (see Baram), rodents aged P11-16 experience seizures upon exposure to hyperthermia. The rationale for publishing data on P7-8 and P22-24 animals, which are outside this age window, must be clearly explained to address a potential weakness in the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This manuscript focuses on identifying the age-related physiological changes that enable the brain to retain function at fever temperatures. To this end, we examine two age periods flanking the putative window of susceptibility (P12-14), specifically an earlier timepoint (P7-8) and a later timepoint (P20-23). The inclusion of these time points also serves as a negative control, allowing us to determine whether the changes we observe in the proposed window of susceptibility are unique to this period. We believe that including these windows ensures a thorough and objective scientific approach.</p>

<p>(3) Authors evoked responses from layer 4 and recorded postsynaptic potentials, which then caused action potentials in layer 2/3 neurons in the current clamp. The post-synaptic potentials are exquisitely temperature-sensitive, as the authors demonstrate in Figures 3 B and 7D. Note markedly altered decay of synaptic potentials with rising temperature in these traces. The altered decays will likely change the activation and inactivation of voltage-gated ion channels, adjusting the action potential threshold.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 4B, we surmised that the temperature-induced reductions in inhibition and the subsequent loss of the late PSP primarily contribute to the altered decay of the synaptic potentials.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The data weakly supports the claim that the E-I balance is unchanged at higher temperatures. Synaptic transmission is exquisitely temperature-sensitive due to the many proteins and enzymes involved. A comprehensive analysis of spontaneous synaptic current amplitude, decay, and frequency is crucial to fully understand the effects of temperature on synaptic transmission.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide clarification. It was not stated, nor did we intend to imply, that in general, E-I balance is unchanged at higher temperatures. Please see the excerpt from the manuscript below. The statements specifically referred to observations made for experiments conducted during the P20-26 age range for cortical pyramidal neurons. We have a parallel line of investigation exploring the differential susceptibility of E-I balance based on age and temperature. Additionally, our measurements focus on evoked activity, rather than spontaneous activity, as these events are more likely linked to the physiological changes underlying behavior in the sensory cortex.</p>
<p>“As both excitatory and inhibitory PNs that stay spiking increase their firing rates (Figure 5B) and considering that some neurons within the network are inactive throughout or stop spiking, it is plausible that these events are calibrated such that despite temperature increases, the excitatory to inhibitory (E-I) balance within the circuit may remain relatively unchanged. Indeed, recordings of L4-evoked excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (respectively EPSCs and IPSCs) in wildtype L2/3 excitatory PNs in S1 cortex, where inhibition is largely mediated by the parvalbumin positive (PV) interneurons, showed that E-I balance (defined as E/E+I, the ratio of the excitatory current to the total current) remained unchanged as temperature increased from 36 to 39°C (Figure 5E).”</p>

<p>(5) It is unclear how the temperature sensitivity of medium spiny neurons is relevant to febrile seizures. Furthermore, the most relevant neurons are hippocampal neurons since the best evidence from human and rodent studies is that febrile seizures involve the hippocampus.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to clarify. Our goal was not to establish a link between medium spiny neuron (MSN) function and febrile seizures. The manuscript's focus is on identifying age-related physiological changes that enable supragranular cortical cells in the brain to retain function at fever temperatures. MSNs were selected for mechanistic comparison in this study because they represent a non-pyramidal, non-excitatory neuronal subtype, allowing us to assess whether the physiological changes observed in L2/3 excitatory pyramidal neurons are unique to these cells.</p>

<p>(6) TRP3V3 data would be convincing if the knockout animals did not have febrile seizures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Could you kindly provide the reference indicating that <italic>TRPV3 KO</italic> mice have seizures? Unfortunately, we were unable to locate this reference. It is important to distinguish febrile seizures, which occur within the range of physiological body temperatures (~ 38 to 40°C), from seizures resulting from heat stroke, a severe form of hyperthermia occuring when body temperature exceeds 40.0 °C. Mechanistically, these may represent different phenomena, as the latter is typically associated with widespread protein denaturation and cell death, whereas febrile seizures are usually non-lethal.  Additionally, <italic>TRPV3</italic> is located on chromosome 17p13.2, a region not currently associated with seizure susceptibility.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This important study combines in vitro and in vivo recording to determine how the firing of cortical and striatal neurons changes during a fever range temperature rise (37-40 oC). The authors found that certain neurons will start, stop, or maintain firing during these body temperature changes. The authors further suggested that the TRPV3 channel plays a role in maintaining cortical activity during fever.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The topic of how the firing pattern of neurons changes during fever is unique and interesting. The authors carefully used in vitro electrophysiology assays to study this interesting topic.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) In vivo recording is a strength of this study. However, data from in vivo recording is only shown in Figures 5A,B. This reviewer suggests the authors further expand on the analysis of the in vivo Neuropixels recording. For example, to show single spike waveforms and raster plots to provide more information on the recording. The authors can also separate the recording based on brain regions (cortex vs striatum) using the depth of the probe as a landmark to study the specific firing of cortical neurons and striatal neurons. It is also possible to use published parameters to separate the recording based on spike waveform to identify regular principal neurons vs fast-spiking interneurons. Since the authors studied E/I balance in brain slices, it would be very interesting to see whether the &quot;E/I balance&quot; based on the firing of excitatory neurons vs fast-spiking interneurons might be changed or not in the in vivo condition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As requested, in the revised manuscript, we will include examples of single spike waveforms and raster plots for the in vivo recordings. Please note that all recordings were conducted in the cortex, not the striatum. To clarify, we used published parameters to separate the recordings based on spike waveform, which allowed us to identify regular principal neurons and fast-spiking interneurons. The paragraph below from the methods section describes this procedure.</p>
<p>“ Following manual curation, based on their spike waveform duration, the selected single units (n= 633) were separated into putative inhibitory interneurons and excitatory principal cells (Barthóet al., 2004). The spike duration was calculated as the time difference between the trough and the subsequent waveform peak of the mean filtered (300 – 6000 Hz bandpassed) spike waveform. Durations of extracellularly recorded spikes showed a bimodal distribution (Hartigan’s dip test; p &lt; 0.001) characteristic of the neocortex with shorter durations corresponding to putative interneurons (narrow spikes) and longer durations to putative principal cells (wide spikes). Next, k-means clustering was used to separate the single units into these two groups, which resulted in 140 interneurons (spike duration &lt; 0.6 ms) and 493 principal cells (spike duration &gt; 0.6 ms), corresponding to a typical 22% - 78% (interneuron – principal) cell ratio”.</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic> patching to record extracellular and inhibitory responses at 36°C and then waiting 10 minutes to record again at 39°C would be an extremely challenging experiment. Due to the high difficulty and expected very low yield, these experiments will not be pursued for the revision studies.</p>

<p>(2) The author should propose a potential mechanism for how TRPV3 helps to maintain cortical activity during fever. Would calcium influx-mediated change of membrane potential be the possible reason? Making a summary figure to put all the findings into perspective and propose a possible mechanism would also be appreciated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your helpful suggestions. In response to your recommendation, we will include a summary figure detailing the hypothesis currently described in the discussion section of the manuscript. The excerpt from the discussion is included below.</p>
<p>“Although, <italic>TRPV3</italic> channels are cation-nonselective, they exhibit high permeability to Ca2+ (Ca²⁺ &gt; Na⁺ ≈ K⁺ ≈ Cs⁺) with permeability ratios (relative to Na+) of 12.1, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9 (Xu et al., 2002). Opening of <italic>TRPV3</italic> channels activates a nonselective cationic conductance and elevates membrane depolarization, which can increase the likelihood of generating action potentials. Indeed, our observations of a loss of the temperature-induced increases in the PSP with <italic>TRPV3</italic> blockade are consistent with a reduction in membrane depolarization. In S1 cortical circuits at P12-14, STAY PNs appear to rely on a temperature-dependent activity mechanism, where depolarization levels (mediated by higher excitatory input and lower inhibitory input) are scaled to match the cell’s ST. Thus, an inability to increase PSPs with temperature elevations prevents PNs from reaching ST, so they cease spiking.”</p>

<p>(3) The author studied P7-8, P12-14, and P20-26 mice. How do these ages correspond to the human ages? it would be nice to provide a comparison to help the reader understand the context better.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Ideally, the mouse-human age comparison would depend on the specific process being studied. Please note that these periods are described in the introduction of the manuscript. The relevant excerpt is included below. Let us know if you need any additional modifications to this description.</p>
<p>“Using wildtype mice across three postnatal developmental periods—postnatal day (P)7-8 (neonatal/early), P12-14 (infancy/mid), and P20-26 (juvenile/late)—we investigated the electrophysiological properties, <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, that enable excitatory pyramidal neurons (PNs) neurons in mouse primary somatosensory (S1) cortex to remain active during temperature increases from 30°C (standard in electrophysiology studies) to 36°C (physiological temperature), and then to 39°C (fever-range).”</p>
