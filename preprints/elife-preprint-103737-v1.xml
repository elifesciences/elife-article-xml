<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>Currently there is a lack of effective methods to accurately detect pancreatic cacer. In our study, we develop a liquid biopsy signature of EV miRNAs based on associated radiomics features of patientsâ tumors in order to provide new insights for the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Experimental Design</title>
<p>A total of eight datasets enrolled in this study, featuring clinical and imaging data from different benign pancreatic lesions and malignant pancreatic cancers as well as small RNAseq data from cargo of plasma extracellular vesicles of tumor patients. Radiomics Feature Extraction and different features analysis performed by limma packages. Feature selection was performed by Boruta algorithms and radiomics related signature model was build and validated by lasso regression algorithms. Radiomic signature related to low abundance EV miRNAs was analyzed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis. The diagnosis ability of above miRNA are validated by ten machine-learning algorithms. The shared target of candidate miRNAs were predicted and clustered followed by subsequently probing for predicting survival benefit of the patient, drug sensitivity of tumor cells and functional differences.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 88 significant radiologic features demonstrate differences between benign lesion and pancreatic cancer. Three radiomics factor related signature related a plasma EV-miRNAs triplet possessing high accuracy in diagnosis cancer from benign lesions. Moreover, clustering miRNA and there predicted molecular signaling partners in tumor tissue identified tow molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer. Cluster stratification separates low risk tumors in terms of severely prolonged overall survival time of patients, higher sensitivity to immune therapies. We also propose the potential of purposing selected targeted drugs to specifically targeting the molecular activation markers in high-risk tumor cluster.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our three radiogenomics related blood plasma extracellular vesicle microRNA signature is a useful liquid biopsy tool for early diagnosis and molecular subtyping of pancreatic cancer, which might treatment decision making.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Statement of translational relevance</title>
<p>The identification of a low-abundance microRNA signature in plasma-derived extracellular vesicles offers significant translational potential for the early diagnosis and subtyping of pancreatic cancer, particularly across diverse ethnic populations. This discovery could lead to the development of non-invasive liquid biopsies that improve early detection rates, a critical need for a cancer with notoriously poor prognosis due to late diagnosis. By incorporating this microRNA signature into clinical practice, oncologists may be able to detect pancreatic cancer at earlier, more treatable stages, enhancing patient survival rates. Additionally, the subtyping capability of this signature could guide personalized treatment strategies, allowing for more targeted therapies based on specific cancer subtypes. This could ultimately reduce the need for invasive diagnostic procedures and optimize treatment efficacy, reducing adverse effects and improving outcomes. The integration of radiogenomics and liquid biopsy technologies promises to be a powerful tool in the future of cancer medicine, particularly in underserved populations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal tumors having a poor prognosis and patients suffering from this disease show one of the lowest 5-year overall survival rate of all cancer patients with approximately 13%. One of the main reasons for this dismissal prognosis is the lack of a proper early detection possibility, resulting in late diagnosing often in advanced, metastatic stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The detection and diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, of which approximately 90% are classified as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), currently relies primarily on modalities of medical imaging, such as computer tomography, magnet resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and transabdominal ultrasonography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The most common biomarker considered for PDAC differential diagnosis is elevated blood abundancy of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), though these are only used as prognostic markers and not effective for screening or early diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Nowadays, new markers based on liquid biopsy such as microRNA are discerned and might pose as promising tools for early detection of PDAC. miRNA are non-coding RNAs that target genes and regulate their expression by inhibiting mRNA translation or enhancing their degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Currently, extracellular vesicles (EV) are gaining attention as disease specific marker since they carry the material of their secreting cells and are therefore considered to contain tumor-derived elements, showcasing their molecular fingerprint (Bamankar und Londhe 2023). It has been shown multiple times that miRNA derived from small EVs play a role in differentiation and metastasis of cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The rapidly developing field of data mining and analytical techniques provide new insights and make the discovery of relevant key players more feasible. Numerous miRNA have been described using co-expression network analysis that might be applicated as diagnostic or prognostic biomarker, for patient stratification or disease recurrence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Benefiting from interdisciplinary advances in artificial intelligence, the integration of machine learning and genomics has led to breakthroughs in the early diagnosis and classification of tumors. For example, we used machine learning algorithms to assist in the development of a three-serum miRNA signature that effectively provides early warning of premalignant pancreatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Another model, based on machine learning algorithms, focuses on the immune subtypes of triple-negative breast cancer, offering critical insights for identifying patients who may benefit from immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In the current study, we employed radiogenomics technology, another product of interdisciplinary collaboration between medicine and engineering. This novel approach integrates the quantification of image features from CT or MRI, which are then correlated with genomic signatures and allows for a non-invasive prediction of molecular characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Such as, claim to be able to predict the occurrence of p53 mutations using CT images by radiogenomic analysis and hence make a statement on the prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In the present study, we aim to develop a liquid biopsy signature of EV-derived miRNA based on the radiogenomic analysis of CT images derived from ethical diverse background and interrogating small RNAseq data of plasma-derived total EVs, in order to advance the diagnostic possibilities and the molecular subtyping of PDAC.</p>

<title>Data resources and pre analytics preparation</title>
<p>A total of four hospitals and four public datasets, comprising a total of eight datasets enrolled in this study, University hospital Magdeburg in Germany (UMMD), and Jiaxing Hospital Center, China (JHC), provided enhanced computed tomography (CT) images of 46 pancreatic benign lesion (PB) patients and 127 pancreatic cancer (PC) patients as training dataset. For test datasets, CT data resource from Wanan medical university hospital (WUH) with 27 PB patients and 72 PC patients. University hospital Dresden, Germany (DUH) center provide miRNA and mRNA seq data from total plasma extracellular vesicles (EV) of PDAC patients with associated clinical follow information, including 20 benign pancreatic disease patients and 63 pancreatic cancer patients. The four public serum miRNA sequence data containing pancreatic cancer (PC) and healthy control (HC) were GSE106817(2759 PC vs.115 HC), GSE113486(40 PC vs.100HC), GSE112264(50 PC vs.41 HC), GSE109319(24 PC vs. 21 HC). Before future analysis, we removed the low quality of images and the low quality of miRNA sequence samples, then we use Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method to match the begin and tumor patients from DUH to UMMD &amp; JHC according to age factor. Afterwards, we constructed a new matrix including CT images, EV miRNAs, mRNAs and patients clinical follow up information. The workflow is schematically depictured in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Ethical approval to conduct the study for UMMD and DUH after approval by the local Institutional Review Board/ethics committee (UMMD 46/22; 30/01 with amendment 43/14; DUH: EK76032013). Written informed consent from the patients was obtained pre-operatively with the disclosure of research purpose.</p>

<title>EV isolation and RNA sequencing</title>
<p>Details on the protocols for EV isolation including presentation of optical and molecular characteristics of isolated vesicles proofing high quality isolation performance have been described previously by our groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>EV isolation using ultracentrifugation: 500 Î¼l plasma samples were thawed and mixed with 500 Î¼l PBS. The diluted plasma samples were filtered with 0.2 Î¼m filter and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000Ã<italic>g</italic>, 2 h, 4 Â°C in a ultracentrifuge (Sorvall MX150 + micro-ultracentrifuge, Thermo Scientific, Darmstadt, Germany). The supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed once with ice-cold Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS, Gibco, Carlsbad, California, USA) and ultracentrifuged again at 100,000Ã<italic>g</italic>, 2 h, 4 Â°C. The resulting pellet was resuspended 100 Î¼l PBS and transferred to Vivaspin Â® 500 filtration (100,000 MWCO, Sartorius, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany) for centrifugation at 15,000Ã<italic>g</italic>, 45 min. The concentrated EVs were stored at â 20 Â°C until further use for EV characterization.</p>
<p>EV isolation using precipitation method: 550 Î¼l plasma samples were thawed and first centrifuged at 2000Ã<italic>g</italic> for 20 min. The supernatant was subjected to another round of centrifugation at 10,000Ã<italic>g</italic> for 20 min. After the second round of centrifugation, 500 Î¼l supernatant was mixed with 250 Î¼l PBS, vortexed and added with 150 Î¼l Exosome Precipitation Reagent. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and centrifuged at 10,000Ã<italic>g</italic> for 5 min. After removing the supernatant completely, the pellet was resuspended with 500 Âµl PBS and concentrated with Vivaspin Â® 500 filtration (100,000 MWCO, Sartorius, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany) by centrifugation at 15,000Ã<italic>g</italic>, 45 min. The resulting EVs were stored at â 20 Â°C until further use for EV characterization.</p>

<title>RNA sequencing</title>
<p>The eluted EV RNAs were first analyzed for their integrity and concentration using Agilent Fragment Analyzer 5200â¢ with DNF-472 High Sensitivity RNA Analysis Kit, 15 nt (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, United States). A range of 1 ngâ2 Î¼g RNA was used for complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis as a preparation for EV RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries with SMARTer smRNA-Seq Kit for Illumina (Takara Bio Inc, Mountain View, California, USA) and were sequenced on an Illumina sequencing platform (NextSeqÂ® 500/550 Mid Output Kit v2, San Diego, California, USA) with run configurations of single read, read 1:51 cycles, index 1:8 cycles, index 2:8 cycles and an average of 3.7 million reads per sample.</p>
<p>Raw reads were first converted from bcl to fastq format using bcl2fastq (v2.20.0.4.422) and subsequently filtered using FastQ Screen to remove potential contaminations by microorganisms or artefacts due to technical issues. The reads were mapped to a phase II reference genome of the 1000 Genomes Project.</p>

<title>Radiomics Feature Extraction and different features (DFs) analysis</title>
<p>We use 3DSlice soft (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.slicer.org">www.slicer.org</ext-link>) to mark pancreatic benign and pancreatic cancer in CT images as mask and use original figure as reference. Subsequently, we use python (Version 3.8) soft to extract radiomics feature, respectively. Afterwards, we use limma packages analysis to conduct different feature analysis to identify the significant features between benign and cancer. The p-value â¤ 0.05 was defined as statistical significant.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Feature selection and radiomics related signature model build</title>
<p>After obtain the DFs, to avoid multicollinearity of the data, we conduct the dimensionality reduction analysis by Boruta algorithms and Lasso regression (LR) model. First, the Boruta algorithms will calculate the importance of each feature and if importance more than shadow feature, it will be selected as important feature, and then, input above important feature into the LR model, the features were selected as significant if the model penalty coefficients were minimized. After selection by machine learning algorithms, we calculate the regression coefficient of each feature in LR model. After that, by combining the feature expression to build the signature model in order to predict the images status from large amount of imaging data. The model formula as listed below, multiplies the regression coefficients of the features with the corresponding feature expressions separately followed by summation of those. The model validation was test with applying WUH center CT dataset, whereas the area under curve (AUC) of Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to evaluated the predict ability of model.</p>

<title>Definition and identification of low abundance EV-derived miRNA transcripts</title>
<p>Low abundance miRNAs are defined as the EV miRNAs with the lowest 30% Counts Per Million (CPM) value across all samples. First, we calculate the CPM value for each miRNA across all samples using the edger function.

<title>Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) analysis to identify imaging feature related EV miRNAs</title>
<p>According to the radiomics signature, patients will be spilt into low and high-risk group. Low risk classification means images have high percentage of feature parameters from benign images while high risk more likely become cancer featuring images. To explore the correlation between above groups with EV miRNAs, we conduct the WGCNA analysis. The soft-thresholding power of WGCNA was automatically defined by the model, which was then assisting in calculating the expression correlation with a) a given miRNA to obtain gene significance (GS), and b) of module membership with miRNAs to obtain module membership (MM). Based on the cut-off criteria (|MM| &gt; 0.5 and |GS| &gt; 0.1), we obtain the significant miRNAs related to low and high risk images, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using multicenter radiomics of Asian and Western world patients, we identified 3 plasma total extracellular vesicle fraction microRNAs that demonstrated strong predictive performance and prognostic value, offering new insights for noninvasive early diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer. This study is the first to distinguish between benign lesions and pancreatic cancer by identifying novel and significant plasma extracellular vesicle microRNAs based on differential radiomics features. We focused on low-abundance microRNAs, which are often overlooked in routine RNA sequencing analyses. These 3 microRNA candidates were validated across multiple cohorts, achieving excellent predictive performance in both testing and external validation sets. Additionally, these microRNAs demonstrated prognostic value, potentially aiding in treatment selection.</p>
<p>Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal diseases, with insufficient early detection methods and limited treatment options<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. This study aimed to develop a liquid biopsy nucelaic acid diagnsotic test based in EV-derived microRNA using radiogenomic analysis to enhance diagnostic accuracy and molecular subtyping of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. By focusing on imaging features to distinguish benign lesions from pancreatic cancer, we identified underlying genetic factors contributing to these differences. Unlike previous studies on serum microRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, our research identified three microRNAs through radiomics that reflect tumor-specific changes rather than systemic variations. Additionally, our findings reveal relationships between imaging features and tumor biology, improving diagnostic accuracy and offering a more comprehensive tool for early detection and personalized disease management.</p>
<p>Although numerous studies have reported on microRNA sequencing results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, highly abundant microRNAs often mask the signals of many others that are present at very low abundance during routine analysis. Furthermore, if a microRNA is associated with tumor development, it is likely to be in low abundance during early detection and may even be undetectable in benign lesions. In our study, after identifying 12 microRNAs related to radiomic differences, we further defined three (hsa-miR-1260b, hsa-miR-151a-3p and hsa-miR-5695) of them as being of low abundance. These microRNAs showed significantly higher expression in pancreatic cancer blood than in non malignant cancer patientsâ plasma, with hsa-miR-1260b and hsa-miR-5695 undetectable in pancreatic cancer samples. The model based on these 3 microRNAs demonstrated strong performance in the training group (AUC, 0.978; sensitivity, 0.97; specificity, 0.99), testing group (AUC, 0.919; sensitivity, 0.96; specificity, 0.88), and external testing group (AUC, 0.897; sensitivity, 0.90; specificity, 0.89).</p>
<p>Previous studies on microRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for pancreatic cancer vs healthy controls report AUCs of 0.78-0.96 and sensitivities of 0.62-0.88<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, but many lack external validation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. One case-control study identified 2 diagnostic panels based on microRNA expression (index I: 4 microRNAs; AUC, 0.86; sensitivity, 0.85; specificity, 0.64; index II: 10 microRNAs; AUC, 0.93; sensitivity, 0.85; specificity, 0.85) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Our study achieved similar performance using only 3 microRNAs, making it more practical for clinical application.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, hitherto none of the three identified microRNAs have been reported in the context of diagnostic biomarkers in pancreatic cancer. Moreover, to our knowledge, hsa-miR-5695 only indirectly been linked to breast carcinogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and subtypes of metastatic prostate cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, while hsa-miR-1260b has been implicated in promoting tumorigenesis in lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, sarcoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and prostate cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in a screen of microRNAs that are differentially expressing in total plasma fraction of patients suffering from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) as compared to non-diseased controls, hsa-miR-1260b was identified as one of the top upregulated signals in plasma of IPMN cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Our work further enforces the potential of hsa-miR-1260b abundancy in plasma to detect onset of abnormal pancreas genesis. Exosomal hsa-miR-151a-3p has emerged as a potential novel biomarker for predicting bone metastasis in lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. A very recent report of results of multicenter trial in Asian participants also identified circulating 2â-O-methylated form of hsa-miR-151a-3p is upregulated in total fraction of plasma of PDAC patients compared to those derived from healthy donors or patients with chronic pancreatitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Focusing on EV fraction, our results verifies the potential of this newly discovered biomarker in pancreatic cancer blood diagnosis.</p>
<p>Pancreatic cancer currently has only two standard systemic treatments with limited efficacy, and the patient population responsive to immunotherapy and targeted therapy remains unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Therefore, we explored the prognostic value of these microRNAs, which allowed for patient stratification. Patients classified as C2 had better prognoses, with higher immune cell infiltration and more immune checkpoint expression, suggesting they may be suitable for immunotherapy after standard treatment. In contrast, patients classified as C1 had poorer prognoses, related to inhibited pathways such as DNA repair and apoptosis.</p>
<p>The findings suggest potential for developing kits for early detection and treatment stratification, and highlight these three candidates for further exploration. However, despite thorough matching of imaging, genomic, and clinical data, biases may still exist. Additionally, using the MCP-counter algorithm for blood samples is a limitation of our study, as it was originally designed for solid tissues, which may affect the accuracy of cell population quantification in the blood. Furthermore, when validating the three microRNAs in tissue, the sample size of paracancerous tissue was limited. Lastly, since our EV purification did not use measures to enrich for cancer cell derived EVs such as CD147 membrane presenting amplitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, we cannot exclude contamination of our miRNA data due to signals from non-cancer cell background, which might impact the cancer specificity of our proposed blood test. Moreover, our data is based on OMICS data acquisition. Real world application of our proposed test would benefit from proofing the predictability and sensitivity of the miRNAs by targeted methods, such as RT-qPCR or CRISPR/Cas diagnostics and in prospective, multicenter trial.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Shi et al, has utilized multiple imaging datasets and one set of samples for analyzing serum EV-miRNAs &amp; EV-RNAs to develop an EV miRNA signature associated with disease-relevant radiomics features for early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. CT imaging features (in two datasets (UMMD &amp; JHC and WUH) were derived from pancreatic benign disease patients vs pancreatic cancer cases), while circulating EV miRNAs were profiled from samples obtained from a different center (DUH). The EV RNA signature from external public datasets (GSE106817, GSE109319, GSE113486, GSE112264) were analyzed for differences in healthy controls vs pancreatic cancer cases. The miRNAs were also analyzed in the TCGA tissue miRNA data from normal adjacent tissue vs pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The concept of developing EV miRNA signatures associated with disease relevant radiomics features is a strength.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the overall concept of developing EV miRNA signature associated with radiomics features is interesting, the findings reported are not convincing for the reasons outlined below:</p>
<p>(1) Discrepant datasets for analyzing radiomic features with EV-miRNAs: It is not justified how CT images (UMMD &amp; JHC and WUH) and EV-miRNAs (DUH) on different subjects and centers/cohorts shown in Figures 1 &amp;2 were analyzed for association. It is stated that the samples were matched according to age but there is no information provided for the stages of pancreatic cancer and the kind of benign lesions analyzed in each instance.</p>
<p>(2) The study is focused on low-abundance miRNAs with no adequate explanation of the selection criteria for the miRNAs analyzed.</p>
<p>(3) While EV-miRNAs were profiled or sequenced (not well described in the Methods section) with two different EV isolation methods, the authors used four public datasets of serum circulating miRNAs to validate the findings. It would be better to show the expression of the three miRNAs in the additional dataset(s) of EV-miRNAs and compare the expressions of the three EV-miRNAs in pancreatic cancer with healthy and benign disease controls.</p>
<p>(4) It is not clear how the 12 EV-miRNAs in Figure 4C were identified.</p>
<p>(5) Box plots in Figures 4D-F and G-I of three miRNAs in serum and tissue should show all quantitative data points.</p>
<p>(6) What is the GBM model in Figure 5?</p>
<p>(7) What are the AUCs of individual EV-miRNAs integrated as a panel of three EV-miRNAs?</p>
<p>(8) The authors could have compared the performance of CA19-9 with that of the three EV-miRNAs.</p>
<p>(9) How was the diagnostic performance of the three EV-miRNAs in the two molecular subtypes identified in Figure 6&amp;7? Do the C1 &amp; C2 clusters correlate with the classical/basal subtypes, staging, and imaging features?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates a low abundance microRNA signature in extracellular vesicles to subtype pancreatic cancer and for early diagnosis. There are several major questions that need to be addressed. Numerous minor issues are also present.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors did a comprehensive job with numerous analyses of moderately sized cohorts to describe the clinical and translational significance of their miRNA signature.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are multiple weaknesses of this study that should be addressed:</p>
<p>(1) The description of the datasets in the Materials and Methods lacks details. What were the benign lesions from the various hospital datasets? What were the healthy controls from the public datasets? No pancreatic lesions? No pancreatic cancer? Any cancer history or other comorbid conditions? Please define these better.</p>
<p>(2) It is unclear how many of the controls and cases had both imaging for radiomics and blood for biomarkers.</p>
<p>(3) The authors should define the imaging methods and protocols used in more detail. For the CT scans, what slice thickness? Was a pancreatic protocol used? What phase of contrast is used (arterial, portal venous, non-contrast)? Any normalization or pre-processing?</p>
<p>(4) Who performed the segmentation of the lesions? An experienced pancreatic radiologist? A student? How did the investigators ensure that the definition of the lesions was performed correctly? Raidomics features are often sensitive to the segmentation definitions.</p>
<p>(5) Figure 1 is full of vague images that do not convey the study design well. Numbers from each of the datasets, a summary of what data was used for training and for validation, definitions of all of the abbreviations, references to the Roman numerals embedded within the figure, and better labeling of the various embedded graphs are needed. It is not clear whether the graphs are real results or just artwork to convey a concept. I suspect that they are just artwork, but this remains unclear.</p>
<p>(6) The DF selection process lacks important details. Please reference your methods with the Boruta and Lasso models. Please explain what machine learning algorithms were used. There is a reference in the &quot;Feature selection..&quot; section of &quot;the model formula listed below&quot; but I do not see a model formula below this paragraph.</p>
<p>(7) In Figure 2, more quantitative details are needed. How are patients dichotomized into non-obese and obese? What does alcohol/smoking mean? Is it simply no to both versus one or the other as yes? These two risk factors should be separated and pack years of smoking should be reported. The details of alcohol use should also be provided. Is it an alcohol abuse history? Any alcohol use, including social drinking? Similarly, &quot;diabetes&quot; needs to be better explained. Type I, type II, type 3c? P values should be shown to demonstrate any statistically significant differences in the proportions of the patients from one dataset to another.</p>
<p>(8) In the section &quot;Different expression radiomic features between pancreatic benign lesions and aggressive tumors&quot;, there is a reference to &quot;MUJH&quot; for the first time. What is this? There is also the first reference to &quot;aggressive tumors&quot; in the section. Do the authors just mean the cases? Otherwise there is no clear definition of &quot;aggressive&quot; (vs. indolent) pancreatic cancer. This terminology of tumor &quot;aggressiveness&quot; either needs to be removed or better defined.</p>
<p>(9) Figure 3 needs to have the specific radiomic features defined and how these features were calculated. Labeling them as just f1, f2, etc is not sufficient for another group to replicate the results independently.</p>
<p>(10) It is not clear what Figure 4A illustrates as regards model performance. What do the different colors represent, and what are the models used here? This is very confusing.</p>
<p>(11) Figure 5 shows results for many more model runs than the described 10, please explain what you are trying to convey with each row. What are &quot;Test A&quot; and &quot;Test B&quot;? There is no description in the manuscript of what these represent. In the figure caption, there is a reference to &quot;our center data&quot; which is not clear. Be more specific about what that data is.</p>
<p>(12) Figure 6 describes the subtypes identified in this study, but the authors do not show a multi-variable cox proportional hazards model to show that this subtype classification independently predicts DFS and OS when incorporating confounding variables. This is essential to show the subtypes are clinically relevant. In particular, the authors need to account for the stage of the patients, and receipt of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. If surgery was done, we need to know whether they had R1 or R0 resection. The details about the years in which patients were included is also important.</p>
<p>(13) How do these subtypes compare to other published subtypes?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors appear to be attempting to identify which patients with benign lesions will progress to cancer using a liquid biomarker. They used radiomics and EV miRNAs in order to assess this.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>It is a strength that there are multiple test datasets. Data is batch-corrected. A relatively large number of patients is included. Only 3 miRNAs are needed to obtain their sensitivity and specificity scores.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This manuscript is not clearly written, making interpretation of the quality and rigor of the data very difficult. There is no indication from the methods that the patients in their cohorts who are pancreatic cancer patients (from the CT images) had prior benign lesions, limiting the power of their analysis. The data regarding the cluster subtypes is very confusing. There is no discussion or comparison if these two clusters are just representing classical and basal subtypes (which have been well described).</p>
