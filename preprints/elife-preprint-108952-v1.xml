<title>Abstract</title><p>Normative models are increasingly used to characterize individual-level brain deviations in neuroimaging studies, but their performance depends heavily on the reference sample used for training or adaptation. In this study, we systematically investigated how sample size and covariate composition of the reference cohort influence model fit, deviation estimates, and clinical readouts in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Using a discovery dataset (OASIS-3, n = 1032), we trained models on healthy control (HC), subsamples ranging from 5 to 600 individuals, while varying age and sex distributions to simulate biases in reference populations. We further assessed the use of adaptive transfer learning by pre-training models on the UK Biobank (n = 42,747) and adapting them to the clinical dataset applying the same sub-sampling strategies. We evaluated model performance on a fixed HC test set and quantified deviation score errors, outlier detection, and classification accuracy in both the HC test set and the AD cohort. The findings were replicated in an external validation sample (AIBL, n = 463). Across all settings, model performance improved with increasing sample size, but demographic alignment of the covariates, particularly in age, was essential for reliable deviation estimates. Models trained directly within the dataset achieved stable fit with approximately 200 HCs, while adapted models reached comparable performance with as few as 50 individuals when pre-trained on large-scale data. These results show that robust individual-level modeling can be achieved using moderately sized but demographically matched cohorts, supporting broader application of normative modeling in ageing and neurodegeneration research.</p>

<p>Normative modeling is a statistical framework for quantifying individual deviations from typical brain structure or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Marquand et al., 2016</xref>). It estimates covariate-adjusted percentiles of a given measurement in a reference population. These percentiles serve as a basis for quantifying individual deviations from population norms, typically accounting for covariates such as age and sex. Unlike traditional case–control analyses that rely on group-level means, normative models generate subject-specific deviation scores that preserve inter-individual variability. This allows the characterization of brain atypicality at the individual level, without relying on the assumption that individuals within the same group share common patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Marquand et al., 2016</xref>; Rutherford, Fraza, et al., 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rutherford et al., 2023</xref>). Warped Bayesian Linear Regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fraza et al., 2021</xref>) is a widely used normative modeling approach that combines flexibility and scalability, making it particularly well-suited for large neuroimaging datasets. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Corrigan et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Holz et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Meijer et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rutherford et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Savage et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Verdi et al., 2024</xref>). Long-term, these models can be envisioned as interpretable and quantitative neuroradiology tools to support clinical decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bozek et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Goodkin et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Among clinical applications of normative models, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represents a particularly relevant use case. AD is the most common cause of dementia and remains challenging to characterize due to its marked heterogeneity in clinical presentation and neuroanatomical patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Duara &amp; Barker, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rajan et al., 2021</xref>). In clinical practice, structural imaging already plays a central role in diagnosis, and hippocampal volume is routinely evaluated in patients relative to expectations built from reference data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Vernooij et al., 2019</xref>). Normative modeling builds on this approach by enabling a more fine-grained characterization of neuroanatomical variability, supporting more precise and personalized assessments in AD. Recent applications to AD research had demonstrated its potential to reveal individualized patterns of cortical atrophy that correlate with cognitive performance and key biomarkers, including CSF Aβ₄₂ and phosphorylated tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Loreto et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Verdi et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">2024</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the performance of normative models depends critically on the reference population used to fit them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bethlehem et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bozek et al., 2023</xref>). The size of the training data, and the extent to which relevant covariates (e.g., age and sex) are adequately represented can substantially influence model fit and the accuracy of the resulting deviation scores. Large-scale samples have been recommended to accurately estimate outlying percentiles for clinical use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bozek et al., 2023</xref>). However, collecting sufficiently large neuroimaging datasets is particularly challenging, as it often requires multi-site data aggregation and extensive efforts to harmonize differences in acquisition protocols, scanner hardware. To address the challenge of limited sample sizes, studies often employ adaptive transfer learning strategies that allows to recalibrate pre-trained models on smaller samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bayer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gaiser et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kia et al., 2021</xref>). But transfer learning applications face a similar challenge. While it offers a pragmatic solution, its success ultimately depends on the quality and representativeness of the available adaptation sample used for re-calibration. Whether models are directly trained within cohorts or adapted from large-scale references, both strategies raise concerns about robustness of clinical interpretations, particularly when the available data are limited, as is commonly observed in neuroimaging studies. Beyond sample size, careful consideration of covariates is critical, especially in applications to AD. The disease typically emerges in older adulthood and is more commonly diagnosed in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ferretti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Riedel et al., 2016</xref>), making accurate modeling of age and sex covariates especially important in this context. Despite growing adoption of normative modeling, systematic evaluations of how performance is affected by the composition and size of the training or adaptation sample remain limited.</p>
<p>To address this gap, we conducted a systematic investigation of how reference sample size and covariate composition affect normative model performance and clinical readouts. Using a single-site dataset (OASIS-3), we varied the size of the healthy control (HC) reference cohort (from 5 to 600 individuals) and manipulated age and sex distributions to simulate biases in reference populations. We replicated the approach in a two-site cohort (AIBL) and further assessed whether models pre-trained on a large external dataset (UK Biobank; <italic>n</italic> = 42,747) could be effectively adapted through transfer learning (Rutherford, Kia, et al., 2022), using the same sub-sampling strategies for the adaptation set. Adapted models were then applied to the same fixed test set, allowing direct comparison between models trained within each cohort and UKB-adapted models across all sampling conditions. Models’ performances were evaluated using standard normative modeling evaluation metrics in an independent fixed HC test set. We assessed the error in deviation scores relative to those obtained using the full, theoretically optimal, reference sample in both the HC test set and the clinical sample diagnosed with AD. To assess clinical implications at the application level, we further quantified differences in outlier detection and classification performance when distinguishing AD from HC groups.</p>
<p>This work provides a systematic analysis of how reference sample characteristics influence model fit, deviation estimates, and their clinical interpretability, offering practical guidance for applying normative modeling in ageing and neurodegeneration research and for maximizing the value of existing, deeply phenotyped cohorts when assembling reference datasets.</p>

<p>We first evaluated how reference population characteristics influenced normative model accuracy. Using Warped Bayesian Linear Regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fraza et al., 2021</xref>), we trained normative models for 167 neuroanatomical regions of interest (ROI) using two independent datasets, OASIS-3 and AIBL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, see Supplementary Figures S17–S33 for the replication in AIBL). Training subsets ranged from 5 participants to the entire training cohort (n = 692), obtained by subsampling to reproduce realistic age- and sex-related skews. For each subsampling scenario, we generated 10 random draws and benchmarked their performance against the model trained on the full training sample.</p>

<caption><title>Methodology diagram for evaluating normative model estimation under different sampling scenarios.</title>
<p>A: Analyses were conducted on the OASIS-3 dataset, with replication in AIBL. Normative models were first fitted using the entire training set (i.e., 80% of HC from the cohort). For each sampling strategy (s), models were re-fitted on randomly drawn subsamples of the training set, with sample sizes (n) ranging from 5 to the maximum available (n = 692 for OASIS, n = 322) and repeated across 10 iterations per sample size. Representative sampling: subsamples preserved the original age distribution using 10 age bins with an equal number of individuals per bin, while also ensuring balanced sex distributions. Left-skewed sampling: overrepresented younger age ranges by applying a beta distribution (α=2, β=5), across 10 equally spaced bins. Right-skewed sampling: overrepresented older age ranges using a beta distribution (α=5, β=2). Each model was evaluated on a fixed test set composed of 20% of HC from the same cohort and all AD individuals. Example normative fits illustrate how identical test values are interpreted under different models: red dots represent values outside the 95% centile range (outliers), while orange dots fall within the normative range. B: In a parallel analysis, normative models were pre-trained on the UK Biobank dataset. Adaptive transfer learning was used to adapt these pre-trained models to the clinical cohorts. The same sub-sampling strategies and sample sizes described in panel A were used here to define the adaptation sets. Adapted models were then applied to the same fixed test set as in panel A, allowing direct comparison between within-cohort models and adapted UKB models across all sampling conditions. C: Each resulting model was evaluated using standard performance metrics to assess model fit. Z-score errors were additionally computed and compared to those obtained from the model fitted using the full training data. Clinical validation was then performed by analyzing outlier detection and predictive performance.</p></caption>

<label>2.1.</label><title>Model fit evaluation</title>
<p>First, to quantify training-set sample size effects, we trained normative models on HC subsamples with representative age distributions (mirroring the full training set age distribution) and balanced sex ratios. We evaluated these models on a fixed HC test set and benchmarked their performance against corresponding full training sample models (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Normative model fits were assessed using <italic>Mean Standardized Log Loss (MSLL), Standardized Mean Squared Error (SMSE), Explained Variance (EV), Pearson Correlation (Rho)</italic>, and <italic>Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Sample size demonstrated a strong influence on model fit for cortical thicknesses and subcortical volumes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Specifically, model performance improved with larger sample sizes, as reflected by reductions in <italic>MSLL</italic> (β = -0.496, p &lt; .001) and <italic>SMSE</italic> (β = -0.427, p &lt; .001) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>) and increases in <italic>EV</italic> (β = 0.499, p &lt; .001), <italic>Rho</italic> (Β = 0.527, p &lt; .001), and <italic>ICC</italic> (β = 0.728, p &lt; .001) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-E</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The standardized effect sizes (β values) allow for direct comparisons across metrics and sampling strategies. Performance improved consistently from n = 10 to the full training sample size (n = 692), with n = 5 showing unstable values and falling outside the overall trend. Rapid improvements were observed between n = 10 and 50, capturing∼70–80% of total gains across metrics. Gains continued more gradually between n = 50 and 200, accounting for most of the remaining improvements (∼15–25%). Beyond n = 200, all metrics reached ∼92–95% of their final values. After n = 300, changes became minimal, and metrics plateaued near 97–99% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Notably, ICC reaches excellent reliability from n = 50 across all lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Koo &amp; Li, 2016</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, to isolate the effect of age distribution, we compared models trained on HC subsamples with representative age distributions (as used above) to those trained using left-skewed (younger-biased) and right-skewed (older-biased) age distributions, while maintaining balanced sex ratios. All models used the same incremental sample sizes and were evaluated on the same fixed HC test set (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, C, and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Left-skewed sampling (i.e., oversampling of younger subjects) had the most pronounced adverse effect on model fit, with a marked increase in <italic>SMSE</italic> (β = 1.323, p &lt; .001), increase in <italic>MSLL</italic> (β = 0.219, p &lt; .001), decreases in <italic>EV</italic> (β = -0.927, p &lt; .001), <italic>Rho</italic> (β = -0.642, p &lt; .001), and in <italic>ICC</italic> (β = -0.300, p &lt; .001). Right-skewed sampling (i.e., oversampling of older subjects) had a smaller effect on model fits compared to left-skewed sampling. It increased <italic>SMSE</italic> (β = 0.585, p &lt; .001) and <italic>MSLL</italic> (β = 0.115, p &lt; .001) and decreased <italic>EV</italic> (β = -0.692, p &lt; .001) and <italic>Rho</italic> (β = -0.567, p &lt; .001). The effect on <italic>ICC</italic> was minimal (β = -0.024, p = .026).</p>
<p>Model fit generally improved with increasing sample size across all metrics and sampling strategies. Interaction effects, however, revealed that the rate of improvement varied depending on the sampling strategy. Under left-skewed sampling, SMSE improved substantially with larger sample sizes (interaction β = -0.636, p &lt; .001), suggesting a steeper recovery. Rho and ICC improved, but at slower rate of improvement than under representative sampling (interaction β = -0.112, p &lt; .001 and β = -0.032, p = 0.003). Right-skewed sampling showed uniform improvements across metrics, with interaction effects indicating modest gains in EV (β = 0.047, p &lt; .001), Rho (β = -0.034, p &lt; .001), and ICC (β = -0.048, p &lt; .001), and reductions in MSLL (β = -0.084, p &lt; .001) and SMSE (β = -0.139, p &lt; .001).</p>
<p>These results highlight that the effect of increasing sample size varies depending on the sampling strategy, with less consistent improvements observed under left-skewed conditions. All results for age-skewed samplings are summarized in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>Finally, to examine the effect of sex ratio imbalance, we trained models on HC subsamples with representative age distributions and varying sex ratios: balanced (1F:1M), 1F:10M, 1F:4M, 4F:1M, and 10F:1M, where <italic>F</italic> denotes females and <italic>M</italic> denotes males. As before, all models used the same incremental sample sizes and were evaluated on the fixed HC test set.</p>
<p>Sex distribution imbalances had a comparatively smaller effect on model fit than age distribution shifts (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Across metrics, the extent of deviation increased with the degree of imbalance.

<p>In summary, these findings demonstrate that representative sampling generally provided the best performance in terms of model fit across metrics on the test set, while skewed distributions introduced substantial model fit degradation. The left-skewed sampling particularly exacerbated errors, as shown by the larger effect sizes. Increasing the sample size improved fits in all configurations. Sex ratio imbalance had a statistically significant but limited effect on model fit, with only minor deviations observed across metrics. These findings underscore the dominant influence of age distribution and sample size in model fit. Individual effects of sample size for the different age and sex distributions are presented in supplementary material (Figures S1-3) and importantly we replicated these findings in an independent dataset (AIBL) (Figures S17-20, Tables S5-6).</p>

<p>Because the MSE quantifies the magnitude of errors but does not provide information about their direction, we additionally computed the MBE to assess whether errors reflected systematic over- or underestimation of deviation scores. Left-skewed sampling consistently resulted in negative <italic>MBE</italic> values, indicating overestimation of deviations, while right-skewed sampling produced positive MBE values, indicating underestimation, particularly at smaller sample sizes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>Cubic regression analyses on age revealed that, under the representative distribution, Z-score errors were lowest in mid-range ages and increased toward both extremes. Left-skewed sampling amplified errors in older individuals, with deviations persisting even at larger sample sizes (e.g., n = 100). In contrast, right-skewed sampling led to elevated errors in younger individuals, which progressively decreased with increasing sample size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>Age-related trends in MSE were exemplified in centile estimation maps for the Left-Hippocampus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), where left-skewed sampling led to higher centiles in older individuals (indicating overestimation), while right-skewed sampling produced lower centiles in younger individuals (indicating underestimation) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>Sex imbalances in the training set had a smaller but statistically significant effect on Z-score errors (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).

Errors did not statistically differ for the HC and AD groups (β = 0.021, p = .137).

<label>2.3.</label><title>Clinical validation</title>
<p>Clinical validity was evaluated for every sampling strategy and sample size using three metrics: (1) the proportion of subjects with atrophy outliers in each ROIs (Z &lt; –1.96); (2) the <italic>total outlier count</italic> (<italic>tOC</italic>) per subject, defined as the number of ROIs in which a subject’s deviation score exceeds the Z threshold; and (3) the <italic>ROC-AUC</italic> of an support vector classifiers (SVC) distinguishing HC versus AD based on deviation scores (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>In the model fitted using the full training set, the highest percentages of volume outliers in the AD group were observed in subcortical regions such as the left hippocampus (30.5%) and left amygdala (28.1%). Among cortical areas, the middle temporal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus showed also frequent deviations (e.g., 22.8% in the right middle temporal gyrus, 19.2 % in parahippocampal gyrus).</p>
<p>To illustrate how outlier estimation varies with training sample size, example iterations are shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>. At n = 25, outlier percentages were substantially lower than in the full sample model, for example, 8.4% in the left hippocampus (–22.1% compared to the full sample) and 0% in the left amygdala (–28.1%). At n = 50, estimates became closer to the full model in some regions (e.g., 24.0% in the left hippocampus, –6.5%), while others showed higher deviation rates (e.g., 41.3% in the left amygdala, +13.2%). Outlier estimates in the example at n = 75 closely matched those of the full model across many regions; for example, the left hippocampus showed 30.5% (−0.0%). At n = 100, values showed minor variability, with the left hippocampus slightly above the reference at 34.7% (+4.2%). This residual fluctuation across runs highlight some instability in outlier estimation even at higher sample sizes. Similar variability was observed in cortical areas. For instance, the percentage of outliers in the right middle temporal gyrus increased from 12.6% at n = 25 (–10.2%) to 18.0% at n = 100 (–4.8%), compared to 22.8% in the full model. In the right parahippocampal gyrus, values rose from 3.6% at n = 25 (–15.6%) to 18.0% at n = 100 (–1.2%), relative to 19.2% in the full model.</p>

<p>tOC analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref>-<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) showed consistently higher estimated outlier counts in AD compared to HC. Models trained on the full training set estimated an average of 14 outliers per individual in AD compared to 4 in HC. This group difference was confirmed by the statistical models (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref>-<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). which reported a significant main effect of diagnosis (β = 0.665, p &lt; .001), independent of sample size or sampling distributions.</p>
<p>No significant main effect of sample size was found in HC, as outlier counts quickly converged to full-model estimates. In AD, a significant interaction with sample size (β = 0.096, p &lt; .001) indicated that tOC was underestimated at small sample sizes and increased with larger sample sizes, with representative and right-skewed sampling converging to full-model estimates around n = 100 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>Left-skewed sampling strongly increased tOC (β = 0.461, p &lt; .001), an effect amplified in AD (interaction β = 0.721, p &lt; .001). Under this sampling strategy, tOC only slowly decreased with larger sample sizes (β = -0.323, p &lt; .001 for the interaction of sample size with left-skewed sampling; β = -0.290, p &lt; .001 for the three-way interaction with AD).</p>
<p>Sex-imbalanced samplings showed no significant main effects on tOC (all p &gt; .05). Several interactions with sample size were significant for unbalanced sex ratios (e.g., 4F1M β = - 0.012, p = .001; 1F10M β = 0.014, p &lt; .001), but these effects were very small compared to those observed for age distributions. The only interaction with AD reaching significance was under the extreme male-dominated condition (1F10M:AD β = -0.013, p = .012), indicating a slight moderation of tOC in AD group in that scenario.</p>
<p>Finally, the influence of training sample size and age distribution on classification performance was assessed by evaluating the ability to distinguish AD and HC groups based on deviation scores from the normative models (i.e. Z-scores). ROC-AUC increased when increasing sample size for all sampling strategies, reaching a performance comparable to the models trained with the full training sample size (AUC = 0.86) at around 15 samples, and stabilized from that point onwards (5C). This suggests that small training sets may already capture relevant group-level patterns.</p>
<p>Importantly, all findings from the clinical validation analyses were replicated in the independent AIBL dataset (Figures S22, Tables S7–S8).</p>

Cortical regions also showed discrepancies, such as the right middle temporal gyrus (17.4% adapted vs. 22.8% within-cohort, –5.4%) and the left parahippocampal gyrus (14.4% vs. 16.2%, –1.8%).</p>
<p>Adapted models, while converging faster to the full adaptation set model estimation compared to within-cohort trainings, still showed instability in outlier detection at small adaptation sample sizes. In the example iterations in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, at n = 25, the percentage of outliers was 7.2% in the left amygdala and 1.8% in the left hippocampus (–7.8 and –15.6%, respectively); at n = 50, values reached 19.2% and 9.6% (+4.2 and –7.8%).

<label>3.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we systematically examined how sample size and covariate distributions impact the fit and clinical utility of normative models to AD datasets. To ensure the robustness and generalizability, we leveraged a large-scale discovery sample (OASIS-3) and a replication sample (AIBL). Models were first fitted on 80% of the HC participants from the OASIS-3, representing the optimal scenario in which the largest available dataset is leveraged to maximize accuracy and reliability. These full-sample training models served as a benchmark against which we evaluated the impact of reduced sample sizes and covariate misalignment. We systematically sub-sampled the full training set to vary sample sizes and manipulate covariate distributions (i.e. age and sex) and then assessed their effects on model fit in the HC test set as well as on deviation scores and outlier detection in both the HC test set and the AD cohorts. Finally, we applied the same sampling and evaluation framework to an adaptive transfer learning setting. In which pre- trained UK Biobank models were adapted using the same clinical training subsets method previously used for direct training.</p>
<p>Across all analyses, increasing sample size yielded to more stable model fits and more consistent results. In contrast, misaligned covariate distributions, particularly with respect to age, introduced systematic distortions in model predictions and outlier detection. In the following sections, we provide a detailed analysis of how sample size and covariate distributions affected model evaluation and practical application.</p>
<p>Across all analyses, models trained on the full training set of available HC yielded the best overall fit, demonstrating superior performance when all data are utilized. While we acknowledge that this model does not represent an absolute ground truth, it served as a robust reference for evaluation how variations in sample size and covariate distribution affect model fit. Models trained directly on OASIS-3 achieved model fit comparable to UKB-pretrained models, indicating that training solely on the target cohort was sufficient for reliable estimation. The models fitted with full training set also provided a strong reference for biological plausibility and interpretability, producing results consistent with established AD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Igarashi, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Planche et al., 2022</xref>). Specifically, in the HC test set, full training set models performed as expected, with the average <italic>tOC</italic> per individual around 4 in both datasets, aligning with expectations given the defined threshold for outlier detection (bottom 2.5% among 167 ROIs). In contrast, individuals with AD exhibited elevated <italic>tOC</italic> values, averaging at 14 in OASIS-3 and 20 in AIBL. Importantly, regions surrounding the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala exhibited the highest outlier percentage, highlighting their well-established involvement in AD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Igarashi, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Subsampling analyses revealed that the largest improvements in model performance occurred up to approximately 50 subjects, at which point metrics such as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) reached excellent reliability and 60–90% of total performance gains were achieved. Beyond 200 subjects, performance began to plateau with diminishing returns up to 300 and with only marginal improvements up to 600 subjects.</p>
<p>Sample-size requirements depend strongly on the intended use of a normative model. In the present study we exemplified two applications commonly used in recent normative-modeling work: (1) outlier detection through regional deviation mapping across the brain and the tOC per individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhome et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Floris et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Loreto et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rutherford et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Verdi et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zabihi et al., 2020</xref>); (2) case-control classification to assess whether the relative population ranks were preserved. Subsampling of real data showed that approximately 100-200 well-characterized HC were sufficient to generate clinically robust deviation maps and <italic>tOC</italic> values, while adding additional participants primarily reduced residual variance at a high acquisition cost. For the classification task, performance in OASIS-3 was indistinguishable from the full model with only fifteen training samples.</p>
<p>Sample size had no significant etect on <italic>tOC</italic> in the HC group, likely due to the low number of deviations expected in healthy aging. In contrast, <italic>tOC</italic> estimates in the AD group stabilized with increasing sample size. This was particularly evident in regions such as the hippocampus and amygdala, where outlier detection was inconsistent at lower sample sizes despite their known vulnerability in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barnes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Qu et al., 2023</xref>). Previous work using simulated hippocampal-volume data in order to suggested that several thousand subjects are needed to stabilize the extreme lower percentiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bozek et al., 2023</xref>). In practice, achieving cohorts of that scale is hindered by high data acquisition costs, privacy constraints, and the logistical challenges of harmonizing data from multiple sites. Moreover, our clinical-validation tasks illustrated that much lower sample sizes saturates clinical readouts estimation. Our results therefore do not prescribe a universal threshold; rather, they provide a reference for the precision that can reasonably be expected from sample sizes commonly attainable in clinical studies. Roughly 200– 300 participants emerge as a pragmatic baseline for deviation mapping in ageing cohorts, while larger data sets are strongly recommended for accurate percentile screening. Notably, broader lifespan applications may require larger samples to ensure coverage across the full age range. This is further supported by our analysis of age-skewed distributions, which highlights the importance of aligning the training cohort with the target population.</p>
<p>Indeed, beyond sample size, skewed age distributions affected both models fit and the accuracy of deviation scores. Deviation scores were systematically overestimated in older individuals when models were trained on younger (left-skewed) samples and underestimated in younger individuals when trained on older (right-skewed) samples. These patterns align well with well-documented age-related brain changes, including cortical thinning and subcortical atrophy with increasing age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lemaitre et al., 2012</xref>). Left-skewed samplings inflated normative means, leading to more pronounced negative deviations in older individuals, whereas right-skewed samplings lowered references, underestimating deviations in the young. As also observed in the simulation study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bozek et al. (2023)</xref>, errors were most pronounced at the extremes of the age distribution, where data were sparse. Centile analyses confirmed that models performed reliably across well-sampled age ranges but produced unstable estimates at underrepresented ages, even under representative sampling. These edge effects persisted despite covariate alignment and were attenuated with larger sample sizes.</p>
<p>Our findings highlight the critical importance of age distribution in clinical applications. When the age range of the training data failed to align with that of the target population, deviation estimates became systematically biased, affecting both global outlier counts and regional detection patterns. This was most notably under the left-skewed sampling, where younger-biased training sets inflated deviation scores across both HC and AD groups, with pronounced effects in regions such as the hippocampus and amygdala. Importantly, these biases were not fully resolved until relatively large sample sizes were reached. While error under right-skewed sampling gradually diminished with increasing sample size, overestimation persisted even at large sample sizes in left-skewed distributions.</p>
<p>The left-skewed sampling had overall a greater effect than right-skewed sampling in both model evaluation and clinical validation, likely due to (1) the dataset’s original bias toward older individuals, making younger-skewed samples less representative, and (2) the older age structure of the AD population, which exacerbates mismatch when younger HC are used to calibrate models in the clinical population. Although we generated skewed distributions artificially, they mirror real-world imbalances frequently observed in neuroimaging studies, including in our own dataset, where recruitment constraints often result in age-biased cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bethlehem et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">LeWinn et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these findings underscore the need for careful covariate matching, when developing normative models for clinical application, not only in terms of sample size but also distributional structure. This is particularly important in disorders such as AD, where age is tightly linked to disease progression and anatomical change. Deviations from a representative age distribution can propagate errors that directly affect individual-level interpretation. However, recruiting very old healthy individuals is inherently challenging. With increasing age, clinical and biological heterogeneity also increases, due in part to the greater inter-individual variability in brain structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fjell &amp; Walhovd, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lemaitre et al., 2012</xref>), accumulation of comorbidities, and the difficulty of confidently excluding preclinical or undiagnosed conditions. Additionally, selective survival effects may introduce sampling biases, further complicating the construction of representative reference cohorts in the oldest age ranges.</p>
<p>Given the higher prevalence of AD in women and documented sex-related differences in brain anatomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ferretti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Küchenhoff et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Riedel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ruigrok et al., 2014</xref>), we examined whether imbalances in sex distribution influenced model fit or deviation scores. Overall, sex imbalances had minimal effects in both model evaluation and clinical validation. Model fit remained stable, and only small improvements in deviation scores accuracy were observed. Deviation score accuracy was higher for individuals whose sex was more represented in the training data, and the strength of this association increased with the degree of sex imbalance. While sex imbalances had little impact on global model performance, some interaction effects with diagnosis were significant in deviation scores and outlier detection, particularly under extreme sex ratios. However, these effects were small and inconsistent, indicating limited practical impact overall. This limited sensitivity suggests that sex-related anatomical variation may generalize more robustly than age-related changes, especially in ageing populations. Moreover, unlike age, which introduces continuous, nonlinear variability, sex is a discrete covariate, which makes it easier to model. These findings indicate that moderate sex imbalances are unlikely to affect overall model performance, although sex-matched training data may still be beneficial for improving individual-level assessments.</p>
<p>Our findings highlight the potential of adaptive transfer for efficient model fitting in clinical cohorts if large datasets are available. Normative models pre-trained on the external large-scale UKB dataset rapidly achieved performance levels comparable to models trained directly within the cohort, requiring substantially fewer individuals. Evaluation metrics plateaued around 50 participants for adapted models, whereas within-cohort models required approximately 200 to achieve similar fit. This suggests that pre-trained models can be effectively recalibrated with modest sample sizes, offering practical advantages in clinical or low-resource contexts where large datasets are often unavailable. Notably, this stabilization threshold of 50 participants was higher than the 25 participants reported by Gaiser et al. (2024), who used Hierarchical Bayesian Regression (HBR). HBR’s hierarchical structure allows information sharing across sites, which may facilitate convergence with fewer samples. In contrast, our study used Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR), a method that does not account for cross-site dependencies and may require more data to accommodate population heterogeneity. Nevertheless, BLR remains widely used in recent normative modeling applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhome et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Corrigan et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Holz et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Meijer et al., 2024</xref>; Rutherford, Kia, et al., 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Savage et al., 2024</xref>) because of its computational efficiency, ease of implementation, and flexibility. Another factor likely contributing to this difference in stabilization thresholds is the demographic composition of the studied populations. Gaiser et al. (2024) examined on a younger, developmentally homogeneous cohort (ages 6–17), whereas our sample spanned older adults (44–82 years), a range characterized by greater inter-individual variability in brain structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fjell &amp; Walhovd, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lemaitre et al., 2012</xref>). This increased heterogeneity may necessitate larger adaptation sets to achieve stable and reliable deviation estimates.</p>
<p>While evaluation metrics indicated convergence in overall model performance, differences remained in outlier detection between adapted and within-cohort models. In several regions commonly affected in AD, adapted models consistently identified fewer outliers, even at the largest adaptation sample size. These discrepancies suggest that, although adaptation effectively aligns prediction accuracy, subtle differences in the underlying normative distributions may persist and influence deviation-based measures. Furthermore, the age distribution of the adaptation set continued to influence both model fit and outlier detection, despite the pre-trained UKB model already covering the same age range extensively. In contrast, sex distribution had minimal influence on the adaptation outcomes.</p>
<p>Overall, these results support the use of adaptive transfer as a resource-efficient alternative to full retraining, particularly when pre-trained models are available for the targeted demographics.</p>
<p>Some limitations should be considered. This study relied on datasets in which adults of European ancestry were overrepresented. Although, the UK Biobank, which was used to pre-train the model, provided a robust reference distribution for the targeted populations of OASIS-3 and AIBL in this study, expanding reference datasets to include populations with more diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds would further improve representativeness and ensure broader applicability of normative models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Harnett et al., 2024</xref>). Moreover, we did not simultaneously manipulate age and sex distributions in the training and adaptation sets. Exploring these factors jointly would have required a substantially more complex experimental design and statistical modeling, as their interactions could introduce confounding effects that are difficult to disentangle within the current framework. Finally, our analysis was restricted to cortical thickness for cortical regions and volumes for subcortical structures. Thickness was preferred in the cortex as it is more sensitive to age-related cellular alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lemaitre et al., 2012</xref>), while volumetric measures were used for subcortical regions, where the absence of a clear laminar organization and current MRI resolution limit reliable thickness estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dima et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lemaitre et al., 2012</xref>). Future work could incorporate additional structural or microstructural metrics to enhance the characterization of brain changes and improve the applicability of normative models across conditions.</p>
<p>Collectively, our results indicate that the benefits of enlarging a reference cohort depend critically on how closely its demographic profile mirrors that of the clinical sample. Gains from additional participants plateau when age alignment is poor, whereas even moderate-sized cohorts perform well when demographic concordance is preserved. This nuance underscores the importance of balancing sample size with representativeness when assembling reference datasets for normative modeling in ageing and neurodegeneration research. Our findings provide practical guidelines for maximizing the value of moderately sized but deeply phenotyped datasets, thereby reducing costs and limiting the need for additional large-scale data collection without compromising accuracy.</p>

<title>MRI pre-processing and ROI extraction</title>
<p>All datasets underwent processing using FreeSurfer software, with quality control (QC) performed primarily after segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fischl, 2012</xref>). The standard FreeSurfer pipeline included intensity normalization, skull stripping, and segmentation of grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) surfaces, ultimately producing a tessellated representation of the GM/WM boundary. These surfaces were then corrected for topological errors and aligned to a spherical atlas based on individual cortical folding patterns. Cortical thickness was defined as the shortest distance between the vertices of the GM/WM boundary and the pial surface, and cortical thickness was measured for each individual using the Destrieux parcellation scheme, which included 74 regions per hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Destrieux et al., 2010</xref>). For a comprehensive overview of the pipeline and its documentation, refer to the official FreeSurfer website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>In this study, we focused on cortical thickness and on subcortical volumes. Cortical thickness was included as it is a sensitive biomarker of age-related atrophy, particularly in the parietal cortex, and provides valuable insights into neurodegeneration in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lemaitre et al., 2012</xref>; McGinnis et al., 2011). Cortical volumes, which account for both cortical folding and thickness, may be less sensitive to specific cellular changes such as neuronal, dendritic, and synaptic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lemaitre et al., 2012</xref>). Subcortical volumes were also considered, as AD is known to particularly affect the entorhinal cortex and surrounding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Qu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). These structures lack the laminar organization of the cortex, making thickness estimates unreliable, as a result, volumetric measures are typically used for subcortical regions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dima et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lemaitre et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>For labeling subcortical tissue classes, the volume-based stream was utilized. After affine registration to MNI305 space, initial volumetric labeling, and B1 bias field intensity correction, a high-dimensional nonlinear volumetric alignment to the MNI305 atlas was performed, with the volume labeled according to the ASEG atlas (Fischl et al., 2002). From this atlas, we retained 19 subcortical regions.</p>

<label>4.1.3.</label><title>Quality Control</title>
<p>QC procedures were implemented across all datasets. For the OASIS-3 and AIBL datasets, the QC process was performed internally by our research team (BHV and CE). We used the quality assessment tools bundled with FreeSurfer which included several automated QC measures, such as signal-to-noise ratio, topological defects, Euler number, and rotation parameters, to identify potential issues with MRI data. For each scan flagged by these measures, we conducted a thorough visual inspection. Scans with poor contrast, orientation, or significant artifacts were excluded. Consequently, 39 scans were excluded from the OASIS-3 dataset, while no exclusion was necessary for the AIBL dataset. For the UKB, QC was conducted as part of the original data release using a semi-automated pipeline. T1-weighted images were scored using an automated classifier, with manual review performed for cases close to the ‘bad data’ threshold. Data deemed seriously problematic were excluded. FreeSurfer outputs were also QC checked using the Qoala-T approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Klapwijk et al., 2019</xref>), supplemented by manual review, ensuring only high-quality data were used.

<sec id="s4e1">
<label>4.2.1.</label><title>Estimation of normative models</title>
<p>To capture individual deviations from typical ageing patterns, normative models were fitted independently within each dataset (OASIS-3 and AIBL) for each ROI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Each dataset was stratified by site, sex, and age (5-year bins), and split into an training set (80% of HC; n=691 for OASIS-3, n=322 for AIBL) and a test set (20% of HC plus all AD participants; n= 174 HC, n = 167 AD for OASIS-3, and n = 81 HC, n = 60 AD for AIBL) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>We employed Warped Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) with a B-spline basis expansion, using Python 3.9.16 and PCNtoolkit version 0.29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fraza et al., 2021</xref>). All procedures followed the recommendations for BLR models, as detailed in (Rutherford, Kia, et al., 2022). The covariates (age, sex, and a dummy-coded site variable) were incorporated into the model. Age and sex were modeled using a cubic B-spline basis with three evenly spaced knots, allowing for the creation of a smooth curve that can flexibly represent the changes in brain structure across different ages and sexes. The Sinh-Arcsinh function and the respective warped likelihood were used to handle non-Gaussian distributions in the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fraza et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jones &amp; Pewsey, 2009</xref>) and optimized the model by minimizing the negative log-likelihood using Powell’s conjugate direction method.</p>
<p>From normative models, deviation scores (Z-scores) were derived to quantify how much an individual’s measurement deviates from the predicted normative range. These scores were computed as the difference between the observed value and the model’s predicted conditional mean, scaled by the estimated variance. Unlike traditional Z-scores, which assume a fixed population variance, normative modeling Z-scores account for two sources of uncertainty commonly defined in machine learning: (1) aleatoric uncertainty (irreducible uncertainty), which captures true underlying variability across individuals that cannot be reduced with more data; and (2) epistemic uncertainty (reducible uncertainty), which reflects parameter uncertainty due to limited data and can be minimized as more data becomes available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fraza et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Marquand et al., 2016</xref>). By integrating these components, Z-scores provide a standardized measure of deviation, indicating whether an individual’s measurement falls within or outside the normative range and how atypical it is relative to the reference population.</p>

<label>4.3.</label><title>Subsampling</title>
<p>We first fitted models for each ROI using 80% of the HC participants from OASIS-3 or AIBL for the replication analysis. These models represent the optimal scenario, leveraging the maximum available data to achieve the highest accuracy and reliability. These models trained on the full sample then served as a reference benchmark for evaluating the impact of reduced sample sizes and covariate misalignment. To assess how systematic variations in (1) sample size and (2) covariate distributions influenced model fit performance, we applied a series of subsampling strategies to generate training sets with varying sizes and age or sex distributions.</p>
<p>For each subsampling condition, a set of individuals was selected to form the training set, which was then used to fit separate models for each ROI. This approach allowed us to systematically assess how variations in sample composition affected model fit across brain regions. Across all subsampling strategies, the test set remained identical (described in 2.2.1), ensuring comparability. All primary results are presented for the OASIS-3 dataset, with replication in the AIBL dataset detailed in the supplementary material.</p>
<sec id="s4f1">
<label>4.3.1.</label><title>Sample Size Variations</title>
<p>Subsamples were drawn in increments of 5 from size 5 to 200, and in increments of 50 beyond 200 up to 600. Finer steps at smaller sample sizes allowed closer track of changes in model performance at smaller sample sizes, while larger steps were applied beyond 200 to reduce computational demands, after convergence was expected. For each sample size, 10 random iterations were performed to estimate variability and reduce the influence of individual draws. For replication in AIBL, samples were drawn from 5 to 100 per site, due to more limited available data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f2">
<label>4.3.2.</label><title>Sub-sampling with diterent covariates distributions</title>
<p>We assessed the influence of age and sex distributions in the training set by using a representative age distribution with balanced sex ratios and then altering either age distribution (using skewed subsampling) or sex balance (using uneven ratios of females and males) while also systematically varying sample size as described above.</p>
<p>To generate subsamples that mimicked the original age distributions of the data, we partitioned the age distribution into 10 bins using a quantile discretizer, which ensured equal numbers of participants in each bin. An equal number of males and females (±1) was then randomly selected across bins. This approach, referred to as <italic>representative sampling</italic>, ensured that the subsampled training sets closely matched the original age distribution of the dataset while maintaining a balanced sex ratio.</p>
<p>To create training sets with skewed (non-representative) age distributions, we applied two strategies that preferentially selected either younger (left-skewed) or older (right-skewed) individuals. More specifically, the age distribution was divided into 10 equally spaced age bins, using a uniform discretizer (which divides the age range into equal-width intervals but does not ensure an equal number of participants per bin as in the representative subsampling). Samples were randomly drawn from these bins, and a beta distribution was applied to weight the probability of drawing samples from each bin. For the left-skewed sampling, we used parameters α=2 and β=5, increasing the likelihood of selecting younger samples. Conversely, for the right-skewed sampling, parameters α=5 and β=2 were used, concentrating more samples in the older age bins.</p>
<p>To examine the influence of sex imbalance, we adapted the representative age sampling strategy but altered the male-to-female ratio according to predefined levels (1:4; 1:10; 4:1, 10:1). This enables assessment how sex distribution imbalances affected model performance and clinical interpretation of deviations.</p>

<p>Subsequently, models trained on subsampled data were evaluated on the same fixed test set of participants, assessing model fit in the HC test set and Z-score errors in both HC and AD test sets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Performance of the subsampled models was then compared with that of the models trained on the full training set across three subsampling scenarios: 1) representative age distribution with balanced sex ratios, 2) skewed age subsampling with balanced sex ratios, and 3) representative age sampling with unbalanced sex ratios.</p>

Lower <italic>SMSE</italic> values indicate better predictive performance, as they signify smaller errors. <italic>EV</italic> measures the proportion of variance in the test data that is explained by the model. Higher values of EV indicate that the model accounts for a greater portion of the variability in the data, reflecting better model performance. <italic>Rho</italic> measures the linear correlation between the predicted and actual values.

<sec id="s4g2">
<label>4.4.2.</label><title>Evaluation of Z-scores estimations</title>
<p>Z-score errors were computed for each sampling strategy and sample size by comparing models trained on subsampled data to the ones trained on the full training set. We used <italic>MSE</italic> to summarize overall model accuracy of estimates by averaging the squared deviations across ROIs for each individual. <italic>MSE</italic> captures the overall magnitude of errors, penalizing larger deviations more strongly due to the squaring operation, which makes it well suited for assessing general model accuracy at the individual level. To reduce the influence of rare iterations producing atypical very large errors, outliers were excluded using a conservative interquartile range threshold (3×IQR) to exclude only extreme values while preserving most of the data. Age effects were evaluated using cubic regressions across the age range; sex effects were assessed by comparing <italic>MSEs</italic> between females and males under imbalanced sampling.</p>
<p>We additionally computed <italic>MBE</italic> to assess the direction of Z-score differences, indicating whether estimates tend to be systematically over- or underestimated.

<label>4.5.</label><title>Clinical validation</title>
<p>To evaluate clinical validity, we assessed whether deviation patterns aligned with known AD-related neurobiological evidence and whether they could reliably distinguish HC from AD. Specifically, we examined whether the most deviating regions (i.e., outliers) corresponded to established patterns of AD pathology (i.e., biological plausibility) and whether classification based on deviation scores could distinguish HC from AD. For both analyses, we compared the performance of the model fitted with the full training set with subsampled training sets models to determine whether deviation patterns and classification performance remained consistent across sampling strategies and sample sizes.</p>
<sec id="s4h1">
<label>4.5.1.</label><title>Outlier detection and biological plausibility</title>
<p>To assess biological plausibility, we computed the percentage of outliers per ROI in the test set to assess the consistency and group-specific patterns of deviations in HC and AD, across the model trained on the full set and those trained on each subsampled set. A data point was defined as an outlier if its deviation score was Z &lt; -1.96. This threshold, representing the bottom 2.5% of the normative range, has been commonly used to report extreme deviations in previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhome et al., 2024</xref>; F et al., 2024; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Verdi et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">2024</xref>). Only negative outliers are considered here, as AD is mainly characterized by diffuse, progressive atrophy of brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sabuncu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ten Kate et al., 2018</xref>). Using this framework, a properly fitted model is expected to show outlier distributions that align with known neuroanatomical patterns of AD, with regions commonly affected by the disease exhibiting higher outlier counts.</p>

<p>We evaluated classification performance to determine whether deviations from normative models (i.e., Z-scores) retained their clinical validity and preserved the relative ranking of individuals for each sampling configuration. Support Vector Classifiers (SVCs) were trained using the ROI-level deviation scores from the test set. Classification was performed using 10-fold cross-validation and the <italic>Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve</italic> (<italic>ROC-AUC</italic>) was computed for each fold. For each sampling configuration, <italic>ROC-AUC</italic> values were averaged across folds and iterations to obtain a robust measure of classification performance.</p>

<label>4.6.</label><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>We used linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) to evaluate the effects of sample size and subsampling strategy on model fit metrics (<italic>MSLL</italic>, <italic>EV</italic>, <italic>SMSE</italic>, <italic>Rho</italic>, and <italic>ICC</italic>) and deviation scores (<italic>MSE</italic> and <italic>tOC</italic>) (i.e., outcome). Subsampling strategies included age-skewed (left-skewed, right-skewed) and sex-imbalanced (1:4, 1:10, 4:1, 10:1 female-to-male ratios). The representative sampling strategy, which preserved the original age and sex distribution served as the reference.</p>
<p>For model fit, LMMs included sample size (n), sampling strategy, and their interaction as fixed effects, with a random intercept for ROI to account for variability across regions:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="672402v2_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The relationship between sample size and model performance is characterized by steep improvements at small n that gradually level off with larger samples (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). To capture this non-linear pattern and avoid overemphasizing differences at high n, we applied a logarithmic transformation to sample size. This transformation linearizes the effect, resulting in more appropriate estimates of the influence of n and its interactions with sampling strategies. Both performance metrics and sample size were standardized prior to modeling to facilitate comparability.</p>
<p>For deviation scores, LMMs additionally included group (HC or AD) and its interactions with sample size and sampling strategy as fixed effects, with a random intercept for individuals to account for subject-level variability. As before, sample size was log-transformed, and both outcomes and sample size were standardized prior to modeling:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="672402v2_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Again, the representative sampling strategy and HC group served as baseline levels for comparison. Fixed effects and interaction terms captured the influence of sample size, sampling strategy, and group on the outcomes.</p>
<p>To illustrate the effect of sampling strategies and sample size for specific brain regions, additional LMMs were computed independently for each ROI. These results are presented in the supplementary materials and were corrected using the false discovery rate (FDR) to account for multiple comparisons.</p>

<label>4.7.</label><title>Adaptive transfer learning</title>
<p>To evaluate whether models trained on large external datasets can generalize to clinical cohorts, we additionally compared our models trained within cohorts (i.e. OASIS-3 or AIBL) with models adapted from a large independent cohort using adaptive transfer learning. To motivate the need for model adaptation across cohorts, we first examined differences in mean cortical thickness between UKB and the clinical datasets. We compared mean cortical thickness and mean subcortical grey volumes for HC from the UKB, OASIS-3 and AIBL datasets. Diterences in mean cortical thickness across datasets were assessed using boxplots and bivariate density plots (mean cortical thickness vs. age). Separate linear regression models were fitted for each dataset, with mean cortical thickness as the dependent variable and age as the independent variable.</p>
<p>Adaptive transfer learning was applied to adjust the UKB-based normative models to the clinical cohorts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Models were pre-fitted using 80% of UKB HC, with 20% held out for internal evaluation. Adaptation sets and within-cohort training sets were sampled from the same training cohort and tested on the same evaluation set, ensuring direct comparability between models. This approach procedure assumes that biological effects, such as age-related trajectories, are shared across datasets, and only cohort-specific shifts require adjustment. The adaptation assumes that normative patterns learned from a large reference cohort remain valid across datasets, and that residual differences, such as scanner or cohort biases, can be captured through distributional adjustments at the mean level.</p>
<p>To evaluate the two modeling strategies, either directly trained on the target dataset (i.e. OASIS-3 or AIBL) or adapted from a pre-trained UKB model, we compared model fit using the same metrics as previously (<italic>MSLL</italic>, <italic>SMSE</italic>, <italic>EV</italic>, <italic>Rho</italic>, and <italic>ICC</italic>), assessed Z-score errors relative to the full adaptation model, and illustrated the percentage of outliers per brain region across sample sizes. To facilitate direct comparison, we also computed the difference in performance between the two approaches (direct training minus adapted) for each metric. Additionally, we replicated all analyses conducted in the direct training setting, including covariate skewing, and present the adapted versions in the Supplementary Materials.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Overall, this is a well-designed and carefully executed study that delivers clear and actionable guidance on the sample size and representative demographic requirements for robust normative modelling in neuroimaging. The central claims are convincingly supported.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study has multiple strengths. First, it offers a comprehensive and methodologically rigorous analysis of sample size and age distribution, supported by multiple complementary fit indices. Second, the learning-curve results are compelling and reproducible and will be of immediate utility to researchers planning normative modelling projects. Third, the study includes both replication in an independent dataset and an adaptive transfer analysis from UK Biobank, highlighting both the robustness of the results and the practical advantages of transfer learning for smaller clinical cohorts. Finally, the clinical validation ties the methodological work back to clinical application.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are two minor points for consideration:</p>
<p>(1) Calibration of percentile estimates could be shown for the main evaluation (similar to that done in Figure 4E). Because the clinical utility of normative models often hinges on identifying individuals outside the 5th or 95th percentiles, readers would benefit from visual overlays of model-derived percentile curves on the curves from the full training data and simple reporting of the proportion of healthy controls falling outside these bounds for the main analyses (i.e., 2.1. Model fit evaluation).</p>
<p>(2) The larger negative effect of left-skewed sampling likely reflects a mismatch between the younger training set and the older test set; accounting explicitly for this mismatch would make the conclusions more generalisable.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors test how sample size and demographic balance of reference cohorts affect the reliability of normative models in ageing and Alzheimer's disease. Using OASIS-3 and replicating in AIBL, they change age and sex distributions and number of samples and show that age alignment is more important than overall sample size. They also demonstrate that models adapted from a large dataset (UK Biobank) can achieve stable performance with fewer samples. The results suggest that moderately sized but demographically well-balanced cohorts can provide robust performance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is thorough and systematic, varying sample size, age, and sex distributions in a controlled way. Results are replicated in two independent datasets with relatively large sample sizes, thereby strengthening confidence in the findings. The analyses are clearly presented and use widely applied evaluation metrics. Clinical validation (outlier detection, classification) adds relevance beyond technical benchmarks. The comparison between within-cohort training and adaptation from a large dataset is valuable for real-world applications.</p>
<p>The work convincingly shows that age alignment is crucial and that adapted models can reach good performance with fewer samples. However, some dataset-specific patterns (noted above) should be acknowledged more directly, and the practical guidance could be sharper.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper uses a simple regression framework, which is understandable for scalability, but limits generalization to multi-site settings where a hierarchical approach could better account for site differences. This limitation is acknowledged; a brief sensitivity analysis (or a clearer discussion) would help readers weigh trade-offs. Other than that, there are some points that are not fully explained in the paper:</p>
<p>(1) The replication in AIBL does not fully match the OASIS results. In AIBL, left-skewed age sampling converges with other strategies as sample size grows, unlike in OASIS. This suggests that skew effects depend on where variability lies across the age span.</p>
<p>(2) Sex imbalance effects are difficult to interpret, since sex is included only as a fixed effect, and residual age differences may drive some errors.</p>
<p>(3) In Figure 3, performance drops around n≈300 across conditions. This consistent pattern raises the question of sensitivity to individual samples or sub-sampling strategy.</p>
<p>(4) The total outlier count (tOC) analysis is interesting but hard to generalize. For example, in AIBL, left-skew sometimes performs slightly better despite a weaker model fit. Clearer guidance on how to weigh model fit versus outlier detection would strengthen the practical message.</p>
<p>(5) The suggested plateau at n≈200 seems context-dependent. It may be better to frame sample size targets in relation to coverage across age bins rather than as an absolute number.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the editors and two reviewers for the assessment and the constructive feedback on our manuscript, “Toward Robust Neuroanatomical Normative Models: Influence of Sample Size and Covariates Distributions”. We appreciate the thorough reviews and believe the constructive suggestions will substantially strengthen the clarity and quality of our work. We plan to submit a revised version of the manuscript and a full point-by-point response addressing both the public reviews and the recommendations to the authors.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer 1.</bold></p>
<p>In revision, we plan to address the reviewer’s comments by: (i) strengthen the interpretation of model fit through reporting the proportion of healthy controls within and outside the extreme percentile bounds; (ii) adding age-resolved overlays of model-derived percentile curves compared to those from the full reference cohort for key sample sizes and regions; (iii) quantifying age-distribution alignment between train and test set; and (iv) summarizing model performance as a joint function of age-distribution alignment and sample size.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer 2.</bold></p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we will (i) expand the Discussion to more clearly outline the trade-offs between simple regression frameworks and hierarchical models for normative modeling (e.g., scalability, handling of multi-site variation, computational considerations), and discuss alternative approaches and harmonization as important directions for multi-site settings; (ii) contextualize OASIS-3 vs AIBL differences by quantifying train– test age-alignment across sampling strategies and emphasize that skewness should be interpreted relative to the target cohort’s alignment rather than absolute numbers. (iii) reassess sex-imbalance effects by reporting expected age distributions per condition and re-evaluate sex effects while controlling for age; (iv) investigate the apparent dip at n≈300 dip by increasing sub-sampling seeds, testing neighboring sample sizes, and using an alternative age-binning scheme to clarify the observed artifact; (v) clarify potential divergence between tOC separation and global fit under discrepancies in demographic distributions and relate tOC to age-alignment distance; (vi)  reframe the sample-size guidance in terms of distributional alignment rather than an absolute n.</p>
