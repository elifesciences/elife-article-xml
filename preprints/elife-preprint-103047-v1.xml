<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Understanding the genetic diversity and transmission dynamics of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, the causative agent of malaria, is crucial for effective control and elimination efforts. In some endemic regions, malaria is highly seasonal with no or little transmission during up to 8 months, yet little is known about how seasonality affects the parasite population genetics. Here we conducted a longitudinal study over 2.5 year on 1516 participants in the Upper River Region of The Gambia. With 425 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genetic barcodes genotyped from asymptomatic infections, we developed an identity by descent (IBD) based pipeline and validated its accuracy using 199 parasite genomes. Genetic relatedness between isolates revealed a highly recombinatorial genetic diversity, suggesting continuous recombination among parasites rather than the dominance of specific strains. However, isolates from the same household were six-fold more likely to be genetically related compared to those from other villages. Seasonal patterns influenced genetic relatedness, with a notable increase of parasite differentiation during high transmission. Yet chronic infections presented exceptions, including one individual who had a continuous infection by the same parasite genotype for at least 18 months. Our findings highlight the burden of asymptomatic chronic malaria carriers and the importance of characterising the parasite genetic population at the community-level. Most importantly, ‘reactive’ approaches for malaria elimination should not be limited to acute malaria cases but be broadened to households of asymptomatic carriers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Between 2015 and 2022, The Gambia achieved a more substantial reduction of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria prevalence than most other countries in Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Nevertheless, this reduction in malaria prevalence is not sufficient to meet the 75 % decrease milestone expected for 2025, implying that additional efforts are needed to achieve malaria elimination.</p>
<p>In regions characterised by seasonal transmission, malaria clinical cases peak towards the end of the wet season, a pattern mirrored in The Gambia’s transmission cycle. Its climate is characterised by a rainy season from late June to September, followed by a ∼8 month-long dry season, typically without rainfall. Malaria cases are almost exclusively reported from September to December (the high transmission season), while malaria is virtually absent for the remaining 8 months (the low transmission season) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Malaria in The Gambia is highly unequal, affecting mostly individuals with low income from rural areas in the eastern part of the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Little is known about how the low transmission season affects the parasite population at genetic level. Understanding how the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasite population adapts to these seasonal variations is critical for informing targeted malaria elimination strategies.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that imported cases play a minor role in maintaining malaria transmission, with the resurgence of malaria attributed to a persistent reservoir of asymptomatic chronic carriers that bridge two transmission seasons separate by several months of low to no transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Previous studies conducted between 2012 and 2016 in The Gambia and neighbouring Senegal demonstrated that a substantial proportion of asymptomatic individuals remained infected from the end of the high transmission season to the end of the low transmission season, underscoring the ability of these infections to establish chronicity over extended periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Importantly, asymptomatic infections may carry gametocytes capable of transmitting to mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>].</p>
<p>The complexity of infection (COI) is the number of distinct parasite genotypes within an infected individual. At the population level, the average COI correlates with transmission intensity, offering a practical approach to estimate prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, genetic relatedness analyses between parasites can shed light on fine-scale spatio-temporal transmission dynamics. Genetic relatedness is assessed through Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) or the cost-effective barcode genotyping, the latter able to identify a unique parasite strain with as few as 24 loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. From pairwise distances between such barcodes, it has been shown that relatedness tends to decrease with time and distance of the sampled infections both at the national level in The Gambia and at the local level in neighbouring Senegal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Although the parasite population genetic diversity has been well characterized from clinical infections isolated within a single high transmission season, the impact of the low transmission seasons on the long-term genetic diversity of the parasite populations is still poorly understood.</p>
<p>Identity-by-Descent (IBD) serves as a metric of genetic relatedness between parasites, incorporating recombination rate to provide insights into recent recombination events. While Fst-based studies are well adapted to characterize the haplotype diversity of populations of parasites across countries or over extended periods, IBD highlights recent recombination events between two parasites with varying levels of relatedness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Extensive genomic epidemiology studies to date focused on clinical cases, yet such symptomatic cases only represent a minority of all <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. The extent at which allelic diversity observed in clinical cases reflects the total parasite population remains unclear. Here, we genotyped <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates from a longitudinal study conducted over a 2.5-year period in four nearby villages in the Upper River Region of The Gambia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Through identity by descent (IBD) analysis of parasite genetic barcodes and genomes collected during the low and high transmission seasons, we aimed to elucidate the parasite genetic diversity at the community level.</p>

<title>Study design and participants</title>
<p>Starting in December 2014, we recruited all residents from two villages (Madina Samako and Njayel, identified respectively with the letters ‘K’ and ‘J’), with two additional villages (Sendebu and Karandaba, identified respectively with the letters ‘P’ and ‘N’) recruited from July 2016, all four villages being in the Upper River Region in The Gambia within 5 km of each other. Active case detection was conducted a total of 11 times over the 2-year period, with each sampling session occurring within a ten-day window. Symptomatic cases that occurred between September to December 2016 were also sampled. More information about the recruited participants can be found in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. In December 2016, a cohort of 42 asymptomatic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> carriers was recruited and sampled monthly for 6 months until May 2017, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Gambia Government/MRC Joint Ethics Committee (SCC 1476, SCC 1318, L2015.50) and by the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine Ethics Committee (Ref. 10982).</p>

<title>Sampling and molecular detection of parasites</title>
<p>Details on the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> detection is provided in previous works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Briefly, fingerprick blood samples were tested for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> by qPCR. From July 2016 onwards, individuals testing positive for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> were invited to provide an additional 5 to 8 mL venous blood sample that was leucodepleted with cellulose-based columns (MN2100ff) and frozen immediately. DNA was extracted with QIAgen Miniprep kit following manufacturer procedure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Genotyping and genome sequencing</title>
<p>A total of 522 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> DNA positive samples, 307 from fingerprick and 215 from venous blood, were processed for genotyping (442 samples) and whole genome sequencing (331 samples of which 251 were genotyped) as part of the SpotMalaria consortium. Genotyping was performed by mass-spectrometry based platform from Agena MassArray system. The output consisted of 101 bi-allelic SNPs located on the 14 chromosomes and concatenated into a ‘molecular barcode’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], plus six markers of resistance to antimalarials (<italic>aat1</italic> S528L, <italic>crt</italic> K76T, <italic>dhfr</italic> S108N, <italic>dhps</italic> A437G, <italic>kelch13</italic> C580Y and <italic>mdr1</italic> N86Y). Genetic barcode SNPs had been picked for their variable allele frequencies within the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Whole genome sequencing (Illumina) was performed after a Selective Whole Genome Amplification step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Paired end DNA sequence-reads (150 bp) were aligned to 3D7 reference genome version 3. Variants were called by a script from the MalariaGen consortium using GATK HaplotypeCaller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Two drug resistance markers, <italic>aat1</italic> S528L and <italic>kelch13</italic> C580Y were only available in sequencing data and absent from genotyping data. If distinct calls of drug resistance markers were obtained between genotyping and whole genome sequencing data (Figure S7), only the call of whole genome sequencing was considered for the rest of the analysis.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Parasite relatedness</title>
<p>To accurately assess the parasite genetic similarity between different sampled infections, we estimated pairwise mean posterior probabilities of Identity-By-Descent (IBD) between genomes or barcodes using hmmIBD, a hidden Markov model-based software relying on meiotic recombination events given a recombination rate of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> of 13.5 kb/cM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. The probability of two samples to be in IBD represents the expected shared fraction of their genomes. An IBD of more than 0.9 is considered identical, hence describing the same parasite genotype.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Multi-locus genotype barcode data analysis pipeline</title>
<p>To analyse whole genome data formatted in a VCF format, we developed the following pipeline to (Figure S1):
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Filter out genomic loci for which the QUAL is inferior to 10000, with more than 2 alleles identified in the population or that are located outside of the core genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>].</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Remove genomes comprising less than 4000 SNPs covered by at least 5 reads.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Estimate the proportion of polyclonal samples using the <italic>F</italic><sub>ws</sub> metric and heterozygous loci.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Format SNPs into a binary matrix as required by hmmIBD (mixed and unknown positions set to 0). SNP calls were considered mixed if the within-sample Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) was greater than 0.2. The MAF of 0.2 was chosen according to the good agreement between molecular barcodes and genomic barcodes (high number of mixed locus matches and low number of mixed locus mismatches) (Figure S2).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Use the paired IBD values obtained from hmmIBD and build a network of genome relatedness. To limit the number of false positive matches between genomes containing mostly population-level major alleles (in the case of high polyclonality for example), IBD values were considered unknown between pairs of genomes having less than 100 informative loci, i.e., 100 pairs of loci available in both genomes with each time one of them being the population-level minor allele.</p></list-item>
</list>
The second part of the pipeline imputes missing SNPs in the molecular barcode from the WGS data to build a ‘consensus barcode’. Then, it estimates the duration of infection by the same genotype (Figure S1):
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Build a ‘molecular barcode’ out of the initial 101 genotyped SNPs and a ‘genomic barcode’ out of the same 101 SNPs called from high-quality genomes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Remove 12 loci that are absent from all high-quality genomes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Estimate the within-sample Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) to use as a cutoff to call a genomic locus mixed when building barcodes out of genomic data. Genomic barcodes are built using different cutoffs of within-sample MAF and aligned against molecular barcodes from the same isolates. The cutoff of within-sample MAF of 0.2 showed a high number of mixed locus matches and low number of mixed locus mismatches, meaning that molecular barcodes and genomic barcodes were in good agreement (Figure S2). This cutoff was retained to build all genomic barcodes. Each pair of molecular and genomic barcodes obtained from the same isolates were aligned. For isolates sampled after May 2016, molecular barcodes are most of the time not matching genomic barcodes for 21 loci, suggesting that a change in the molecular genotyping protocol led to incorrect calling (Figure S3). As a result, these 21 loci were considered unknown for all the molecular barcodes obtained after May 2016.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Using the alignment between molecular and genomic barcodes from the same isolates, replace unknown and mismatched SNP of the molecular barcodes by the SNP of genomic barcodes. These improved molecular barcodes are referred to as ‘consensus barcodes’.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Remove consensus barcodes with fewer than 30 SNPs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Estimate the proportion of polyclonal samples using heterozygous loci (described in following section).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Format consensus barcodes into a binary matrix (mixed and unknown loci set to 0) and run hmmIBD.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Use the paired IBD values obtained from hmmIBD and build a network of barcode relatedness. To limit the number of false positive matches between barcodes containing mostly population-level major alleles (in the case of high polyclonality for example), IBD values were considered unknown between pairs of barcodes having less than 10 informative loci, i.e., 10 pairs of loci available in both barcodes with each time one of them being the population-level minor allele.</p></list-item>
</list>

<title>Complexity of infections</title>
<p>The clonality of each isolate was estimated from whole genome sequenced samples by the <italic>F</italic><sub>ws</sub> metric based on allelic frequencies from genomic data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Additionally, the complexity of infections was estimated by the proportion of heterozygous loci (polyclonal if the proportion is above 0.5 % of available sites) in both consensus barcodes and genomes using a within-sample MAF of 0.2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Genetic relatedness between groups of multi-locus genotype barcodes</title>
<p>All ‘consensus barcodes’, hereafter referred to as ‘barcodes’, available after December 2016 were excluded from the genetic relatedness analysis as they were obtained exclusively from the 42 individuals recruited in the monthly dry season cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Barcodes were grouped by their collection date (11 time points from December 2014 to December 2016), sampling location (households or villages) or collection date split by households. Within the same group, the genetic relatedness was estimated by the proportion of related barcodes (IBD ≥ 0.5) over all possible pairs of barcodes. When comparing different groups, the genetic relatedness was estimated by the proportion of related barcodes (IBD ≥ 0.5) over all pairs of barcodes of each group, excluding pairs involving barcodes from the same individual. We used a stringent criteria of filtering out pairs of households with less than 5 comparisons (1013/2829 removed pairs) and pairs of collection dates split by households with less than 5 comparisons (25/192 removed pairs). All pairs of villages (10 pairs) and all pairs of dates (66 pairs) contained at least 10 comparisons.</p>

<title>Combined barcode and whole genome analysis pipeline</title>
<p>Overall, 5322 fingerprick and 253 venous blood samples were collected from 1516 individuals aged 3 to 85 years in four nearby villages of the Upper River Region of The Gambia between December 2014 and May 2017, as detailed in previous studies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].

Whole parasite genomes were also successfully sequenced for 199 isolates. Through the concatenation of SNPs from barcode genotyping and whole genome sequencing, we obtained a high-quality ‘consensus’ barcode for 425 isolates comprising on average 59 SNPs (range 30 to 89 SNPs) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

<title>Complexity of infection is stable across seasons</title>
<p>The complexity of infection (COI), defined as the number of unique genotypes/genomes within an infected individual, serves as an indicator of parasite strain diversity within the population. We estimated COI using <italic>F</italic><sub>ws</sub> values from genomes and the proportion of heterozygous loci from genomes and barcodes. Across these metrics, the proportions of polygenotype isolates were estimated as 40 % using <italic>F</italic><sub>ws</sub> (79/199), 38 % using heterozygous loci of genomes (76/199) and 28 % using heterozygous loci of barcodes (120/425). As expected, the proportion of heterozygous loci in barcodes or genomes showed a strong negative correlation with <italic>F</italic><sub>ws</sub> values, indicating its efficacy as a predictor of COI (Figure S4). Although the proportion of polygenotype isolates fluctuated between timepoints, no discernible trend was observed between low and high transmission season, suggesting a relatively stable complexity of infections in the population throughout the 2.5-year study duration (Figure S5). At the individual level, we previously showed that the COI was stable in polyclonal infections during the dry season (Collins22).</p>

<title>High <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genetic diversity at the community-level</title>
<p>To determine the relatedness between isolates and compare malaria parasites from distinct geographical locations and distant times, Identity By Descent (IBD) was calculated pairwise. The reliability of consensus barcodes in identifying genetically related isolates was confirmed through a strong linear correlation between barcode-IBD and genome-IBD, particularly when both were above 0.5 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.77, p-value &lt; 10<sup>-15</sup>), with this threshold chosen to distinguish between related (IBD ≥ 0.5) and unrelated (IBD &lt; 0.5) samples for all 425 consensus barcodes (Figure S6).</p>
<p>To characterise the parasite population genetic diversity, only one barcode per continuous infection per individual was retained among barcodes sampled between December 2014 and December 2016, totalling 284 remaining barcodes. Among 34,325 pairwise comparisons of barcodes, only 443 (1.3 %) demonstrated relatedness with an IBD above 0.5, indicating extensive recombinatorial genetic diversity within the parasite population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Out of the 284 barcodes, 73 (26 %) were identical (IBD ≥ 0.9) to a barcode from another individual, while 213 (75 %) were related (IBD ≥ 0.5) to at least one other barcode (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Although clusters of genetically related barcodes may suggest a higher connection within villages (1.5 % of related barcodes) than between them (0.7 % of related barcodes), the average proportion of related isolates was not significantly different (Welch t-test value = 1.26, p-value = 0.29), indicating interconnectedness between villages.</p>

<title>Pattern of relatedness between infections is shaped by seasonality</title>
<p>To explore the spatio-temporal relationship between barcodes from distinct individuals, we took advantage of our frequent samplings at the community-level to calculate the percentage of related isolates across six temporal groups, ranging from 0 to 2 months apart between sample collections to 16 to 24 months apart (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Remarkably, at the temporal level, the average proportion of related barcodes within barcodes sampled less than two months apart is 4.7 %. This value is ten-fold higher than the proportion of related barcodes sampled more than 12 months apart equal to 0.29 % (Welch t-test value = 4.67, p value &lt; 10<sup>-4</sup>). This indicates that recombination between <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates breaks down IBD with time.</p>

Each box shows the 25-75% interquartile range of the percentage of related barcodes, with horizontal bar as the median. Groups of related barcodes were compared with Welch t-tests (*: p value &lt; 0.05, ****: p value &lt; 0.00005, ns: non-significant). (A) All pairs of isolates grouped together in the same time interval. (B) Pairs of isolates were grouped by their relative spatial distance.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="24311344v1_fig3.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Similarly, the pairwise barcode IBD was computed for spatial groups: pairs of barcodes from the same household, different households within the same village, and different households across villages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). At the spatial level, barcodes sampled less than 2 months apart and from the same household were six times more related than those sampled from different villages (average proportions of 0.095 and 0.015, Welch t-test value = 3.24, p value = 0.01). However, when barcodes were sampled more than two months apart, the correlation between genetic relatedness and sampling location gradually disappeared. Altogether, the overall large parasite recombinatorial genetic diversity combined with the increased proportion of related isolates within the same household, indicate a scenario in which the same infectious mosquito infected two or more individuals living together, or a direct transmission chain between two household members.</p>
<p>The impact of seasonality on the parasite recombinatorial genetic diversity was assessed by comparing the proportion of related barcodes (IBD ≥ 0.5) between groups of collection dates within or between transmission seasons. Barcodes sampled during the high transmission seasons from 2014, 2015 and 2016, as well as the low transmission seasons of 2015 and 2016, were grouped into intraseasonal pairs if they were collected during the same season or interseasonal pairs otherwise. This resulted in 5 groups for intraseasonal pairs and ten groups for interseasonal pairs, with the most distant groups (high 2014 and high 2016) being 4 seasons apart. Similarly to <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, pairs of collection dates close in time exhibited greater similarity than more distant collection dates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). This suggests a continuous recombination process among all parasites, rather than the transmission of one or more specific strains. To determine the specific time of the year the average genetic relatedness declines, the proportion of related barcodes was compared between pairs of sample collections from the same season or one season apart (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Parasites belonging to the ‘within high’, ‘within low’ and ‘transition high to low’ groups displayed similar genetic relatedness with average proportions of related barcodes of 0.026, 0.026 and 0.025, respectively. However, the ‘transition low to high’ group exhibited a 4-fold lower genetic relatedness, with an average proportion of related barcodes of 0.006, indicating that most of the parasite differentiation occurs during the transition from the low transmission season to the subsequent high transmission season. This corresponds to the increase in transmission rate at the onset of the high transmission season, with parasite genetic diversity being reshuffled after sexual reproduction in the mosquito. This increase in genetic diversity is not observed in the ‘transition high to low’ group, demonstrating a reduced transmission in the low transmission season.</p>

<title>Independence of seasonality and drug resistance markers prevalence</title>
<p>In The Gambia, drug resistant allele frequencies increased dramatically from the late 1980’s until the early 2000’s, then plateaued until 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. The rise in clinical malaria cases during the high transmission season implies usage of anti-malaria drugs, particularly among children aged between 0 and 5 years receiving the monthly Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention, from September to November. We investigated whether the prevalence of drug resistance alleles is influenced by malaria seasonality due to differential selective pressures applied between high (more pressure) and low (less pressure) transmission seasons. To determine the prevalence of resistant haplotypes over time, six drug resistance-related haplotypes were obtained by molecular genotyping and called from whole genome sequenced in genes <italic>aat1</italic>, <italic>crt</italic>, <italic>dhfr</italic>, <italic>dhps</italic>, <italic>kelch13</italic> and <italic>mdr1</italic>, leading to a merged total of 438 isolates with drug resistance-related haplotypes. Overall, 89 % of haplotypes called from both molecular genotyping and whole genome sequencing were identical (Figure S7).</p>
<p>As expected, the haplotype <italic>kelch13</italic> C580Y, related to artemisinin resistance, was absent. Overall, the proportion of isolates with resistant alleles was stable over time for each haplotype with 0.92 (95 % Wilson’s Confidence Interval: 0.87-0.95) for <italic>aat1</italic> S258L, 0.64 (95 % CI: 0.59-0.70) for <italic>crt</italic> K76T (chloroquine resistance), 0.93 (95 % CI: 0.90-0.95) for <italic>dhfr</italic> S108N (pyrimethamine resistance), 0.46 (95 % CI: 0.41-0.51) for <italic>dhps</italic> A437G (sulfadoxine resistance) and 0.12 (95 % CI: 0.09-0.17) for <italic>mdr1</italic> N86Y (multi-drug resistance) (Figure S8). In our dataset, no evidence of seasonality-related drug resistance fitness costs impacting population haplotype diversity was observed. Our data from 2015 to 2017 is very similar to the allele frequency levels from 2008, indicating a potential plateau in the cost-benefit of drug resistance alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>].</p>

<title><italic>P. falciparum</italic> chronic infections with persisting genotypes</title>
<p>To distinguish between ‘true’ chronic infections with the same parasite genotype from reinfections, we measured the minimal duration of infection using IBD values between barcodes obtained from the same individual sampled at different time points, which were not utilized for the spatio-temporal analysis of genetic relatedness. The beginning and end of an infection by the same parasite were attributed to the two most extreme time points separating two identical barcodes (IBD ≥ 0.9). Overall, 34 individuals (24 males and 13 females) were chronically infected with the same dominant <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genotype ranging from one month to one and a half years (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Gender and age did not significantly influence the duration of infection (Figure S9). Three individuals (25, 26 and 28) were infected with two distinct parasite strains, as shown by monthly barcodes alternating between the two strains (e.g. in individual 25, barcodes from Jan and Mar, and from Feb and Apr, are identical). Interestingly, in each case, the two strains were genetically related (IBD ≈ 0.5), likely indicating co-infection of sibling strains from the same brood. The change in proportion between the two strains over time could indicate intra-host competition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In anticipation of the pre-elimination phase of malaria, our study aimed to develop robust methods for estimating the complexity of infections (COI) and constructing genetic relatedness networks of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites. Leveraging both barcodes and genomes offers complementary advantages: barcode genotyping provides cost-effective access to genetic information from numerous blood isolates, while whole genomes yields quantitative data on thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), facilitating comprehensive analyses of parasite diversity, with the added potential to extend analyses to newly discovered haplotypes unidentified at the time of sequencing. Combining both data types validates base calling from barcode genotyping and guides method applicability across the limited positions available in barcodes.</p>
<p>The stable COI over time reflects a constant transmission intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Such stable transmission in this area of The Gambia, reported already elsewhere, contrasts with the overall decrease of malaria transmission across the country, highlighting the heterogeneity malaria within The Gambia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding local malaria dynamics amidst broader regional trends.</p>
<p>With Identity by Descent (IBD) we evaluated parasite relatedness between genomes and between barcodes. Although using more SNPs (e.g. more than 200 SNPs) is ideal to reach an accurate relatedness, <italic>in silico</italic> data suggests that the accuracy is only marginally improved with 96 SNPs or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, we showed that for IBD values above 0.5, the correlation between genome- and barcode-IBD was very strong. Finally, the qualitative aspect of our approach, with isolates either related (IBD ≥ 0.5) or unrelated (IBD &lt; 0.5) enables to compensate for the lower accuracy of barcode-IBD.</p>
<p>Overall, 26 % of unique parasite strains were found in two or more individuals and around 28 % of isolates were polyclonal according to the proportion of heterozygous loci of barcodes. This seemingly contrasts with findings from Thiès, in neighbouring Senegal, where parasite haplotype diversity is low, the proportion of shared genetic types between isolates is 35 %, with less than 10% of polyclonal infections, suggesting self-mating transmission and low outcrossing levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. However, the key difference of our approach was the active detection of asymptomatic infections, as opposed to the large number of studies sequencing parasites collected from clinical cases. Our results argue for active case detection as a necessary step to comprehensively characterise the parasite genetic diversity.</p>
<p>One limitation of genetic epidemiology studies such as this one, is the necessity to exclude IBD values obtained between isolates with high level of polyclonality and thus not enough informative loci. One important remaining challenge is to incorporate highly polyclonal infections in the network of genetic relatedness of parasites, while the proportion of complex infections tends to increase with malaria transmission intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Achieving this goal is difficult as it requires whole genome sequencing followed by a deconvolution tool such as DEploid, with the caveat that the different strains are not too related or too rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>].</p>
<p>A follow-up study carried out in rural villages of eastern Gambia between 2012 and 2016 reported that roughly half of asymptomatic infected individuals at the end of the wet season were still infected at the end of the dry season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. We previously reported a similar rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. We showed that parasites collected during the dry season share significantly more genetic similarity with those from the previous wet season than those from the next wet season. Compared to parasites sampled 2 months apart, parasites sampled more than one year apart had very low level of similarity, implying that the whole population had been replaced in just one year. A study conducted in Colombia (with a 10-fold lower malaria prevalence than in The Gambia) showed that the same level of decreasing genetic similarity was reached in about 9 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>].</p>
<p>Most infections were sub-microscopic, which is typically observed when prevalence falls below 20 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. These low-density infections that may persist for months are typically asymptomatic unless the host immune system is compromised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. In this study, the infection with the longest duration was in an asymptomatic individual aged between 5 and 9 years in which it persisted as the same parasite strain for one and a half year. School-age children contribute the most the malaria reservoir through their higher carriage of asymptomatic infections and their ability to effectively infect mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>].</p>
<p>In the late 20th century, when the malaria burden in The Gambia was much higher, clinical cases from the same household were more likely to be caused by the same mosquito bite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. More recently, Ngwa et al. showed that parasite genetic similarity during the 2013 transmission season was inversely correlated with each spatial and temporal distances in The Gambia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. We also found that parasites sampled in neighbouring households are more genetically similar but only when sampled less than three months apart. Similarly, two other studies observed parasite strains with varying levels of spatio-temporal propagation in Thiès, Senegal, suggesting that some parasites are more actively transmitted than others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. These results add evidence that anti-malarial strategies should target all members of a household with an infected individual. Such “reactive” strategies include treatment of a malaria case and all its household members (without testing) or testing all household members and treating if necessary. The impact of reactive strategies on malaria transmission is at best very limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Based on the sheer size of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asymptomatic reservoir, with parasitaemias typically below microscopy or RDT detection level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], it is not surprising that targeting clinical cases and their immediate families is not sufficient to break the transmission. For a malaria elimination campaign, based on our insights into parasite genetic diversity and transmission dynamics in The Gambia at the community level, we argue for mass detection with a highly sensitive method such as qPCR, followed by treatment of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> positive cases and all their household members.</p>

WGS locus were considered mixed if the within sample MAF was above 0.2 (Figure S2). Overall, locus match between the two methods when the genotyping was done before May 2016 while 21 genotyped loci show a consistent mismatch with WGS locus for all samples genotyped after May 2016. As such, these genotyped loci are incorrect calls resulting from an unknown issue during the genotyping procedure. To increase the number of available locus from barcodes, all unknown and incorrectly genotyped locus were replaced by WGS locus, resulting in a ‘consensus barcodes’.</p>

<p>Among the 364 pairs of samples with a barcode-IBD above 0.5, 314 were indeed related (genome-IBD above 0.5) while 50 were actually not related (genome-IBD below 0.5), although 24 showed genome-IBD value between 0.4 to 0.5. To minimise the proportion of pairs of samples falsely related or unrelated, the 50 pairs of isolates (14 % of 364 related pairs) with a barcode-IBD above 0.5 and a genome-IBD below 0.5 were considered unrelated, and conversely, the 57 pairs of isolates (0.3 % of 18627 unrelated pairs) with a barcode-IBD below 0.5 and a genome-IBD above 0.5 were considered related. Additionally, the genome-IBD was used to classify barcodes as related or unrelated when the barcode-IBD was not available (707 pairs).</p>
<p><bold>Figure S7: Agreement between pairs of haplotypes obtained both by molecular genotyping (‘barcodes’) and from Whole Genome Sequence calling (‘genomes’).</bold> Six drug resistance markers were screened, <italic>aat1</italic> (PF3D7_0629500) S528L, <italic>crt</italic> (PF3D7_0709000) K76T, <italic>dhfr</italic> (PF3D7_0417200) S108N, <italic>dhps</italic> (PF3D7_0810800) A437G, <italic>kelch13</italic> (PF3D7_1343700) C580Y and <italic>mdr1</italic> (PF3D7_0523000) N86Y. Drug resistance haplotypes were obtained in 428 barcodes (1261 haplotypes) and 200 genomes (1006 haplotypes) for a merged total of 438 isolates (1722 haplotypes). The vast majority (89 %) of the 545 pairs of haplotypes obtained with the two methods are identical, which is an evidence that both methods are accurate. While there are multiple partial matches (one haplotype is mixed according to a method and either sensitive or resistant by the other) with mixed haplotypes called from genomes, no partial match with mixed haplotypes called from barcodes were found, showing that whole genome sequencing is more sensitive than molecular genotyping.</p>
<p><bold>Figure S8: Prevalence of 5 drug resistance-related haplotypes for each time point with at least 10 observations over the study time period.</bold> The 5 variants induce non-synonymous changes in <italic>aat1</italic> (S528L), <italic>crt</italic> (K76T), <italic>dhfr</italic> (S108N), <italic>dhps</italic> (A437G) and <italic>mdr1</italic> (N86Y) which are known to reduce the susceptibility to multiple antimalarials. The prevalence of the kelch13 C580Y mutation was null and not shown here. There was no consistent change in allele frequency associated with transmission season. Furthermore, the proportions of all variants remained stable between the start and end of the study period. Error bars represent the 95 % Wilson’s confidence intervals.</p>
<p><bold>Figure S9: Durations of infection by the same parasite strain, grouped by host age and coloured by gender.</bold> The number of short (less than 3 months) and long infections (more than 3 months) were compared between genders (female versus male) and age groups (‘5-15 years old’ versus ‘older than 15 years’). No significant difference of the duration of infection was found between genders, which had very similar percentages of short infections with 38 % and 48 % of infections for female and male respectively (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.30, p-value &gt; 0.5). Although long infections were more common in the ‘5-15 years old’ age group (71 % of all infections) compared to the ‘older than 15 years age’ group (45 % of all infections), this was not statistically significant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.34, p-value &lt; 0.13), potentially due to relatively small sample size.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript titled &quot;Household clustering and seasonal genetic variation of Plasmodium falciparum at the community-level in The Gambia&quot; presents a valuable genetic spatio-temporal analysis of malaria-infected individuals from four villages in The Gambia, covering the period between December 2014 and May 2017. The majority of samples were analyzed using a SNP barcode with the Spotmalaria panel, with a subset validated through WGS. Identity-by-descent (IBD) was calculated as a measure of genetic relatedness and spatio-temporal patterns of the proportion of highly related infections were investigated. Related clusters were detected at the household level, but only within a short time period.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study offers a valuable dataset, particularly due to its longitudinal design and the inclusion of asymptomatic cases. The laboratory analysis using the Spotmalaria platform combined and supplemented with WGS is solid, and the authors show a linear correlation between the IBD values determined with both methods, although other studies have reported that at least 200 SNPs are required for IBD analysis. Data-analysis pipelines were created for (1) variant filtering for WGS and subsequent IBD analysis, and (2) creating a consensus barcode from the spot malaria panel and WGS data and subsequent SNP filtering and IBD analysis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Further refining the data could enhance its impact on both the scientific community and malaria control efforts in The Gambia.</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript would benefit from improved clarity and better explanation of results to help readers follow more easily. Despite familiarity with genotyping, WGS, and IBD analysis, I found myself needing to reread sections. While the figures are generally clear and well-presented, the text could be more digestible. The aims and objectives need clearer articulation, especially regarding the rationale for using both SNP barcode and WGS (is it to validate the approach with the barcode, or is it to have less missing data?). In several analyses, the purpose is not immediately obvious and could be clarified.</p>
<p>(2) Some key results are only mentioned briefly in the text without corresponding figures or tables in the main manuscript, referring only to supplementary figures, which are usually meant for additional detail, but not main results. For example, data on drug resistance markers should be included in a table or figure in the main manuscript.</p>
<p>(3) The study uses samples from 2 different studies. While these are conducted in the same villages, their study design is not the same, which should be addressed in the interpretation and discussion of the results. Between Dec 2014 and Sept 2016, sampling was conducted only in 2 villages and at less frequent intervals than between Oct 2016 to May 2017. The authors should assess how this might have impacted their temporal analysis and conclusions drawn. In addition, it should be clarified why and for exactly in which analysis the samples from Dec 2016 - May 2017 were excluded as this is a large proportion of your samples.</p>
<p>(4) Based on which criteria were samples selected for WGS? Did the spatiotemporal spread of the WGS samples match the rest of the genotyped samples? I.e. were random samples selected from all times and places, or was it samples from specific times/places selected for WGS?</p>
<p>(5) The manuscript would benefit from additional detail in the methods section.</p>
<p>(6) Since the authors only do the genotype replacement and build consensus barcode for 199 samples, there is a bias between the samples with consensus barcode and those with only the genotyping barcode. How did this impact the analysis?</p>
<p>(7) The linear correlation between IBD-values of barcode vs genome is clear. However, since you do not use absolute values of IBD, but a classification of related (&gt;=0.5 IBD) vs. unrelated (&lt;0.5), it would be good to assess the agreement of this classification between the 2 barcodes. In Figure S6 there seem to be quite some samples that would be classified as unrelated by the consensus barcode, while they have IBD&gt;0.5 in the Genome-IBD; in other words, the barcode seems to be underestimating relatedness.</p>
<p>
a. How sensitive is this correlation to the nr of SNPs in the barcode?</p>
<p>(8) With the sole focus on IBD, a measure of genetic relatedness, some of the conclusions from the results are speculative.</p>
<p>
a. Why not include other measures such as genetic diversity, which relates to allele frequency analysis at the population level (using, for example, nucleotide diversity)? IBD and the proportion of highly related pairs are not a measure of genetic diversity. Please revise the manuscript and figures accordingly.</p>
<p>
b. Additionally, define what you mean by &quot;recombinatorial genetic diversity&quot; and explain how it relates to IBD and individual-level relatedness.</p>
<p>
c. Recombination is one potential factor contributing to the loss of relatedness over time. There are several other factors that could contribute, such as mobility/gene flow, or study-specific limitations such as low numbers of samples in the low transmission season and many months apart from the high transmission samples.</p>
<p>
d. By including other measures such as linkage disequilibrium you could further support the statements related to recombination driving the loss of relatedness.</p>
<p>(9) While the authors conclude there is no seasonal pattern in the drug-resistant markers, one can observe a big fluctuation in the dhps haplotypes, which go down from 75% to 20% and then up and down again later. The authors should investigate this in more detail, as dhps is related to SP resistance, which could be important for seasonal malaria chemoprofylaxis, especially since the mutations in dhfr seem near-fixed in the population, indicating high levels of SP resistance at some of the time points.</p>
<p>(10) I recommend that raw data from genotyping and WGS should be deposited in a public repository.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Malaria transmission in the Gambia is highly seasonal, whereby periods of intense transmission at the beginning of the rainy season are interspersed by long periods of low to no transmission. This raises several questions about how this transmission pattern impacts the spatiotemporal distribution of circulating parasite strains. Knowledge of these dynamics may allow the identification of key units for targeted control strategies, the evaluation of the effect of selection/drift on parasite phenotypes (e.g., the emergence or loss of drug resistance genotypes), and analyze, through the parasites' genetic nature, the duration of chronic infections persisting during the dry season. Using a combination of barcodes and whole genome analysis, the authors try to answer these questions by making clever use of the different recombination rates, as measured through the proportion of genomes with identity-by-descent (IBD), to investigate the spatiotemporal relatedness of parasite strains at different spatial (i.e., individual, household, village, and region) and temporal (i.e., high, low, and the corresponding the transitions) levels. The authors show that a large fraction of infections are polygenomic and stable over time, resulting in high recombinational diversity (Figure 2). Since the number of recombination events is expected to increase with time or with the number of mosquito bites, IBD allows them to investigate the connectivity between spatial levels and to measure the fraction of effective recombinational events over time. The authors demonstrate the epidemiological connectivity between villages by showing the presence of related genotypes, a higher probability of finding similar genotypes within the same household, and how parasite-relatedness gradually disappears over time (Figure 3). Moreover, they show that transmission intensity increases during the transition from dry to wet seasons (Figure 4). If there is no drug selection during the dry season and if resistance incurs a fitness cost it is possible that alleles associated with drug resistance may change in frequency. The authors looked at the frequencies of six drug-resistance haplotypes (aat1, crt, dhfr, dhps, kelch13, and mdr1), and found no evidence of changes in allele frequencies associated with seasonality. They also find chronic infections lasting from one month to one and a half years with no dependence on age or gender.</p>
<p>The use of genomic information and IBD analytic tools provides the Control Program with important metrics for malaria control policies, for example, identifying target populations for malaria control and evaluation of malaria control programs.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>The authors use a combination of high-quality barcodes (425 barcodes representing 101 bi-allelic SNPs) and 199 high-quality genome sequences to infer the fraction of the genome with shared Identity by Descent (IBD) (i.e. a metric of recombination rate) over several time points covering two years. The barcode and whole genome sequence combination allows full use of a large dataset, and to confidently infer the relatedness of parasite isolates at various spatiotemporal scales.</p>

<p>This study aimed to investigate the impact of seasonality on the malaria parasite population genetic. To achieve this, the researchers conducted a longitudinal study in a region characterized by seasonal malaria transmission. Over a 2.5-year period, blood samples were collected from 1,516 participants residing in four villages in the Upper River Region of The Gambia and tested the samples for malaria parasite positivity. The parasites from the positive samples were genotyped using a genetic barcode and/or whole genome sequencing, followed by a genetic relatedness analysis.</p>
<p>The study identified three key findings:</p>
<p>(1) The parasite population continuously recombines, with no single genotype dominating, in contrast to viral populations;</p>
<p>(2) The relatedness of parasites is influenced by both spatial and temporal distances; and</p>
<p>(3) The lowest genetic relatedness among parasites occurs during the transition from low to high transmission seasons. The authors suggest that this latter finding reflects the increased recombination associated with sexual reproduction in mosquitoes.</p>
<p>The results section is well-structured, and the figures are clear and self-explanatory. The methods are adequately described, providing a solid foundation for the findings. While there are no unexpected results, it is reassuring to see the anticipated outcomes supported by actual data. The conclusions are generally well-supported; however, the discussion on the burden of asymptomatic infections falls outside the scope of the data, as no specific analysis was conducted on this aspect and was not stated as part of the aims of the study. Nonetheless, the recommendation to target asymptomatic infections is logical and relevant.</p>
