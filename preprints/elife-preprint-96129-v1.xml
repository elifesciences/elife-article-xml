<abstract>
<p>The coordinated motion of animal groups through fluids is thought to reduce the cost of locomotion to individuals in the group. However, the connection between the spatial patterns observed in collectively moving animals and the energetic benefits at each position within the group remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we study the spontaneous emergence of cohesive formations in groups of fish, modeled as flapping foils, all heading in the same direction. We show in pairwise formations and with increasing group size that (1) in side-by-side arrangements, the reciprocal nature of flow coupling results in an equal distribution of energy requirements among all members, with reduction in cost of locomotion for swimmers flapping inphase but an increase in cost for swimmers flapping antiphase, and (2) in inline arrangements, flow coupling is non-reciprocal for all flapping phase, with energetic savings in favor of trailing swimmers, but only up to a finite number of swimmers, beyond which school cohesion and energetic benefits are lost at once. We explain these findings mechanistically and we provide efficient diagnostic tools for identifying locations in the wake of single (and multiple) swimmers that offer opportunities for hydrodynamic benefits to aspiring followers. Our results imply a connection between the resources generated by flow physics and social traits that influence greedy and cooperative group behavior.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Flow interactions are thought to allow flying and swimming animals to derive energetic benefits when moving in groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. However, direct assessment of such benefits is challenging, chiefly because animal groups do not generally conform to regular patterns – individuals in these groups dynamically change their position relative to their neighbors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Also, because direct energetic measurements in moving animals, flying or swimming, are notoriously difficult and often unreliable as proxy for hydrodynamic energy savings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. These difficulties hinder a direct mapping from the spatial pattern of the group to the energetic benefits or costs incurred at each position within the group.</p>
<p>An understanding of how the spatial arrangement of individuals within a group influences their cost of locomotion can provide insights into the evolution of social structures, resource allocation, and overall fitness of each individual in cooperative activities such as foraging, mating, and evasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. It could also guide the design of bio-inspired engineering systems and algorithms that steer groups of entities, such as swarms of autonomous robotic vehicles, underwater or in flight, that collaborate to achieve a desired task while minimizing energy consumption and improving the overall system efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>].</p>
<p>To understand the potential energetic benefits of group movement, various direct and indirect approaches have been employed. Li <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] associated energy savings in pairs of flapping robotic swimmers with a linear relationship between their flapping phase lag and relative distance. Based on this, a strategy, called <italic>Vortex Phase Matching</italic>, was extrapolated for how fish should behave to maximize hydrodynamic benefits: a follower fish should match its tailbeat phase with the local vorticity created by a leader fish. Pairs of freely swimming fish seemed to follow this linear phase-distance relationship even with impaired vision and lateral line sensing, that is, in the absence of sensory cues about their relative position and neighbor-generated flows. Interestingly, the same linear phase-distance relationship was uncovered independently in flapping hydrofoils and accredited solely to flow interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. It is therefore unclear whether vortex phase matching is an active strategy, mediated by sensing and feedback control, that fish employ to minimize energy expenditure, or if it arises passively through flow interactions between flapping swimmers. Importantly, active or passive, it is unclear if this strategy scales to groups larger than two.</p>
<p>In an effort to directly gauge the energetic benefits of schooling, metabolic energetic measurements were recently performed in solitary and groups of eight fish, and impressive energetic savings were attributed to schooling compared to solitary swimming when the fish were challenged to swim at high speeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Lamentably, the study made no mention of the spatial patterns assumed by these physically-thwarted individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. In an independent previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], changes in spatial patterns and tailbeat frequencies were reported in similar experiments, albeit with no energetic measurements. Specifically, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] showed that, when challenged to sustain higher swimming speeds, the fish in a group rearranged themselves in a side-by-side pattern as the speed increased, presumably to save energy.</p>
<p>Taking together the results of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], are we to conclude that side-by-side formations are more energetically beneficial than, say, inline or diagonal formations? The answer is not simple! The metabolic measurements of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] in a school of eight fish report that side-by-side formations, though beneficial, produce the least energetic savings compared to diagonal formations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. In an experimental study of a single fish interacting with a robotic flapping foil, the freely-swimming fish positioned itself in an inline formation in the wake of the flapping foil, supporting the hypothesis that swimming in the wake of one another is an advantageous strategy to save energy in a school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Why then the fish in the experiments of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] self-organized in a side-by-side formation when challenged to swim at higher swimming speeds?</p>
<p>The answer is not simple because ample hydrodynamic mechanisms for energy savings in fish schools have been stipulated for each possible configuration – side-by-side, inline and diagonal (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]) – but no assessment is provided of the relative advantage of these configurations. For example, side-by-side formations, where fish mirror each other by flapping antiphase, are thought to create a wall-like effect that reduces swimming cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. A fish swimming in the wake between two leading fish encounters a reduced oncoming velocity, leading to reduced drag and thrust production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Inline formations, where fish swim in tandem, are thought to provide benefits to both leader and follower, by an added mass push from follower to leader [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]and a reduced pressure on the follower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. All of these mechanisms can in principle be exploited by schooling fish as they dynamically change their relative spacing in the group. But are these mechanisms equally advantageous? Or is there a hierarchy of hydrodynamic benefits depending on the relative position within the school? The literature offers no comparative analysis of the energetic savings afforded by each of these configurations.</p>

</fig>
<p>The study of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] is arguably the closest to addressing this question, but, to map the energetic benefits for pair-wise configurations, the authors employed statistical averages in a school of eight fish, thus inevitably combining the various hydrodynamic mechanisms at play and cross-polluting the estimated benefits of each configuration. A cleaner analysis in pairs of flapping foils shows that these relative positions – side-by-side, inline, and diagonal – all emerge spontaneously and stably due to flow interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], but provides no method for estimating the energetic requirements of these formations, let alone comparing them energetically. Even vortex phase matching makes no distinction between side-by-side, inline, or diagonal pairs of fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. It simply postulates that an unknown amount of energetic benefit is acquired when the linear phase-distance relationship is satisfied. Thus, to date, despite the widespread notion that group movement saves energy, a direct comparison of the energetic savings afforded by different spatial formations remains lacking. Importantly, it is unknown whether and how the postulated benefits scale with increasing group size.</p>
<p>Here, to circumvent the challenges of addressing these questions in biological systems, we formulate computational models that capture the salient hydrodynamic features of single and pairs of swimming fish. Namely, we represent each fish as a freely-swimming hydrofoil undergoing pitching oscillations about its leading edge. A single flapping hydrofoil shares many hydrodynamic aspects with its biological counterpart, including an alternating, long-lived pattern of vorticity in its wake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. These similarities have been demonstrated repeatedly, within biologically relevant ranges of flapping parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], for different geometries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], material properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], and flapping kinematics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. In this study, we show, based on our own simulations and by conducting a thorough literature survey, that flow interactions, with no sensing and feedback control, lead to emergent formations that preserve the linear phase-distance relationship uncovered independently in live and robotic fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] and in flapping hydrofoils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. This relationship is preserved irrespective of geometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], material properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>], and flapping kinematics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. The universality of this relationship serves as strong validation of our models and anchors our subsequent exploration of the opportunities for hydrodynamic benefits available in a given flow field.</p>
<p>Importantly, we go beyond two swimmers to investigate flow interactions in larger groups and find that inline formations <italic>differentially</italic> distribute hydrodynamic savings to members within the school, favoring trailing swimmers, but only up to a certain school size, while side-by-side formations <italic>equally</italic> distribute hydrodynamic savings and scale to arbitrary number of swimmers without loss of cohesion. Our findings provide a direct mapping from the school’s spatial pattern to the energetic savings experienced by its members; inversely, our methods allow us to identify beneficial positions in the flow field created by single or multiple swimmers in terms of energetic savings and overall school cohesion. Importantly, our results raise an interesting hypothesis that the dynamic repositioning of members within a fish school could be driven by greed and competition to occupy hydrodynamically advantageous positions and open up opportunities for analyzing and comparing the role flow physics in the evolution of cooperative versus greedy behavior in animal groups.</p>

<title>Mathematical models of flow-coupled flapping swimmers</title>
<p>Inspired by the experiments of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], we study self-organization in the context of flapping swimmers, coupled passively via the fluid medium, with no mechanisms for visual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>], flow sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>], or feedback control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). The swimmers are rigid, of finite body length <italic>L</italic> and mass per unit depth <italic>m</italic>, and undergo pitching oscillations of identical amplitude <italic>A</italic> and frequency <italic>f</italic> in the (<italic>x, y</italic>)-plane of motion, such that the pitching angle for swimmer <italic>j</italic> is given by <italic>θ<sub>j</sub></italic> = <italic>A</italic> sin(2<italic>πft</italic> + <italic>ϕ<sub>j</sub></italic>), <italic>j</italic> = 1, 2<italic>,…, N</italic>, where <italic>N</italic> is the total number of swimmers. In pairwise interaction, we set <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0 and <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>2</sub> = <italic>ϕ</italic>, with <italic>ϕ</italic> being the phase lag between the oscillating pair. We fixed the lateral distance <italic>ℓ</italic> between the swimmers to lie in the range <italic>ℓ</italic> [<italic>L, L</italic>], and allowed the swimmers to move freely in the <italic>x</italic>-direction in an unbounded two-dimensional fluid domain of density <italic>ρ</italic> and viscosity <italic>µ</italic>. Hereafter, all parameters are scaled using the body length <italic>L</italic> as the characteristic length scale, flapping period <italic>T</italic> = 1<italic>/f</italic> as the characteristic time scale, and <italic>ρL</italic><sup>2</sup> as the characteristic mass per unit depth. Accordingly, velocities are scaled by <italic>Lf</italic>, forces by <italic>ρf</italic> <sup>2</sup><italic>L</italic><sup>3</sup>, moments by <italic>ρf</italic> <sup>2</sup><italic>L</italic><sup>4</sup>, and power by <italic>ρf</italic> <sup>3</sup><italic>L</italic><sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>The equations governing the free motion <italic>x<sub>j</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>) of swimmer <italic>j</italic> are given by Newton’s second law (here, the downstream direction is positive),
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="580536v1_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The hydrodynamic forces on swimmer <italic>j</italic> are decomposed into a pressure force <italic>F<sub>j</sub></italic> acting in the direction normal to the swimmer and a viscous drag force <italic>D<sub>j</sub></italic> acting tangentially to the swimmer. These forces depend on the fluid motion, which, in turn, depends on the time history of the states of the swimmers.</p>
<p>To maintain their pitching motions, swimmers exert an active moment <italic>M</italic><sub>a</sub> about the leading edge, whose value is obtained from the balance of angular momentum. The hydrodynamic power <italic>P</italic> expended by a flapping swimmer is given by <italic>P</italic> = <italic>M</italic><sub>a</sub><italic>θ</italic>.</p>
<p>To compute the hydrodynamic forces and swimmers motion, we used two fluid models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S.1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S.2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S.3</xref>). First, we employed a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver of the Navier-Stokes equations tailored to resolving fluid-structure interactions (FSI) based on an adaptive mesh implementation of the immersed boundary method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. Then, we solved the same FSI problem, in the limit of thin swimmers, using the more computationally-efficient inviscid vortex sheet (VS) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. To emulate the effect of viscosity in the VS model, we allowed shed vorticity to decay after a dissipation time <italic>τ</italic><sub>diss</sub>; larger <italic>τ</italic><sub>diss</sub> correlates with larger Reynolds number Re in the Navier-Stokes model; see SI for a brief overview of the numerical implementation and validation of both methods.</p>

<title>Flow coupling leads to stable emergent formations</title>
<p>We found, in both CFD and VS models, that pairs of swimmers self-organize into relative equilibria at a streamwise separation distance <italic>d</italic> that is constant on average, and swim together as a single formation at an average free-swimming speed <italic>U</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).

<p>Inline formations at <italic>ℓ</italic> = 0 arise when the follower positions itself, depending on its initial distance from the leader, at one of many inline equilibria, each with its own basin of attraction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). These inline equilibria occur at average spacing <italic>d</italic> that is approximately an integer multiple of <italic>UT</italic>, consistent with previous experimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>] and numerical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>] findings.</p>
<p>When offsetting the swimmers laterally at <italic>ℓ</italic> = 0 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), the leader-follower equilibria that arise at <italic>ℓ</italic> = 0 shift slightly but persist, giving rise to diagonal leader-follower equilibria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Importantly, at a lateral offset <italic>ℓ</italic>, inphase swimmers (<italic>ϕ</italic> = 0) that are initially placed side-by-side reach a relative equilibrium where they travel together at a close, but non-zero, average spacing <italic>d L</italic>. That is, a perfect side-by-side configuration of inphase flapping swimmers is unstable but the more commonly-observed configuration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] where the two swimmers are slightly shifted relative to each other is stable. This configuration is fundamentally distinct in terms of cost of transport from the mirror-symmetric side-by-side configuration that arises when flapping antiphase at <italic>ϕ</italic> = <italic>π</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3A</xref>). Both side-by-side equilibria were observed experimentally in heaving hydrofoils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], albeit with no assessment of the associated hydrodynamic power and cost of transport.</p>

<p>We next examined the effect of varying the phase <italic>ϕ</italic> on the emergent traveling formations. Starting from initial conditions so as to settle on the first equilibrium <italic>d/UT</italic> 1 when <italic>ϕ</italic> = 0, and increasing <italic>ϕ</italic>, we found, in both CFD and VS simulations, that the spacing <italic>d/UT</italic> at equilibrium increased with increasing <italic>ϕ</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). This increase is linear, as evident when plotting <italic>d/UT</italic> as a function of <italic>ϕ</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Indeed, in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, we plotted the emergent average separation distance <italic>d/UT</italic> as a function of <italic>ϕ</italic> for various values of <italic>ℓ</italic>. Except for the antiphase side-by-side formation, the linear phase-distance relationship <italic>ϕ/</italic>2<italic>π d/UT</italic> persisted for <italic>ℓ</italic> = 0.</p>
<p>The key observation, that pairs of flapping swimmers passively self-organize into equilibrium formations, is independent of both scale and fluid model. In our CFD simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S.1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S.3</xref>), we tested a range of Reynolds number Re = <italic>ρUL/µ</italic> from 200 to 2000, which covers the entire range of existing CFD simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>], where Re <italic>O</italic>(10<sup>2</sup>), and experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>], where Re <italic>O</italic>(10<sup>3</sup>). In our VS simulations, we varied <italic>τ</italic><sub>diss</sub> from 2.45<italic>T</italic> to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figs. S.2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S.3</xref>). Note that the separation distance <italic>d</italic> is scale-specific and increases with Re; at low Re, a compact inline formation is reached where the two swimmers “tailgate” each other, as observed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. However, the scaled separation distance <italic>d/UT</italic> remains nearly constant for all Re and <italic>τ</italic><sub>diss</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S.3</xref>).</p>
<p>The fact that these equilibria emerge in time-forward simulations is indicative of stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. A more quantitative measure of linear stability can be obtained numerically by perturbing each equilibrium, either by applying a small impulsive or step force after steady state is reached [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] or by directly applying a small perturbation to the relative equilibrium distance between the two swimmers and examining the time evolution of <italic>d</italic> and <italic>F</italic> to quantify variations in hydrodynamic force <italic>δF</italic> as a function of signed variations in distance <italic>δd</italic> from the equilibrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. In either case, we found that the force-displacement response to small perturbations at each equilibrium exhibited the basic features of a linear spring-mass system, where <italic>δF/δd</italic> is negative, indicating that the hydrodynamic force acts locally as a restoring spring force that causes the initial perturbation to decay and that stabilizes the two swimmers together at their equilibrium relative position. Larger values of <italic>δF/δd</italic> imply faster linear convergence to the stable equilibrium and thus stronger cohesion of the pairwise formation. Results of this quantitative stability analysis are discussed in subsequent sections.</p>

<title>Emergent formations save energy compared to solitary swimming</title>
<p>We evaluated the hydrodynamic advantages associated with these emergent formations by computing the hydro-dynamic power <italic>P</italic><sub>single</sub> of a solitary swimmer and <italic>P<sub>j</sub></italic> of swimmer <italic>j</italic> in a formation of <italic>N</italic> swimmers. We calculated the cost of transport COT<italic><sub>j</sub></italic> = <italic>P<sub>j</sub>/mU</italic>, of swimmer <italic>j</italic> and the change in COT compared to solitary swimming ΔCOT<sub>j</sub> = (COT<sub>single</sub> − COT<sub>j</sub>)<italic>/</italic>COT<sub>single</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We also calculated the average change in cost of transport <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="580536v1_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for each formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). In all cases, except for the antiphase side-by-side formation, in both CFD and VS simulations, the swimmers traveling in equilibrium formations save power and cost of transport compared to solitary swimming. The savings are larger at tighter lateral spacing <italic>ℓ</italic>.</p>
<p>For inline and diagonal formations, these hydrodynamic benefits are granted entirely to the follower, whose hydrodynamic savings can be as high as 60% compared to solitary swimming (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Intuitively, because in 2D flows, vortex-induced forces decay with the inverse of the square of the distance from the vortex location, flow coupling between the two inline or diagonal swimmers is non-reciprocal; the follower positioned in or close to the leader’s wake interacts more strongly with that wake than the leader interaction with the follower’s wake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1A</xref>, B and S.4A, B).</p>
<p>In side-by-side formations, by symmetry, flow coupling between the two swimmers is reciprocal, or nearly reciprocal in inphase flapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S.4C, D</xref>). Thus, hydrodynamics benefits or costs are expected to be distributed equally between the two swimmers. Indeed, for inphase flapping, the hydrodynamic benefits are shared equally between both swimmers. For antiphase flapping the cost is also shared equally (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>The biased distribution of benefits in favor of the follower in inline and diagonal formations could be a contributing factor to the dynamic nature of fish schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. The egalitarian distribution of benefits in the inphase side-by-side formation could explain the abundance of this pairwise configuration in natural fish populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and why groups of fish favor this configuration when challenged to swim at higher speeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>

<title>Linear phase-distance relationship in emergent formations is universal</title>
<p>To probe the universality of the linear phase-distance relationship, we compiled, in addition to our CFD and VS results, a set of experimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] and numerical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>] data from the literature (Table S.1 and Suppl. Excel Table). Data including CFD simulations of deformable flapping flags (☆) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], (□) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] and flexible airfoil with low aspect ratio (▷) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>], physical experiments with heaving (○) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] and pitching (▽) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>] rigid hydrofoils, fish-foil interactions (∗) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], and fish-fish interactions (△) measured in pairs of both intact and visually- and/or lateral line-impaired live fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] are superimposed on <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>. All data collapsed onto the linear phase-distance relationship <italic>ϕ/</italic>2<italic>π d/UT</italic>, with the largest variability exhibited by live fish with close streamwise distance, where the interaction between fish bodies may play a role. The side-by-side inphase formations trivially satisfy this linearity because <italic>d/UT ϕ/</italic>2<italic>π</italic> = 0, but the side-by-side antiphase formations don’t satisfy; in the latter, <italic>d/UT</italic> = 0 while <italic>ϕ/</italic>2<italic>π</italic> = 1.</p>
<p>These findings strongly indicate that flow-coupled flapping swimmers passively organize into stable traveling equilibrium formations with linear phase-distance relationship. This relationship is independent of the geometric layout (inline versus laterally-offset swimmers), flapping kinematics (heaving versus pitching), material properties (rigid versus flexible), tank geometry (rotational versus translational), fidelity of the fluid model (CFD versus VS versus particle model), and system (biological versus robotic, 2D versus 3D). Observations that are robust across such a broad range of systems are expected to have common physical and mechanistic roots that transcend the particular set-up or system realization.</p>
<p>Importantly, this universal relationship indicates that flow physics passively positions a swimmer at locations <italic>d</italic> where the swimmer’s flapping phase <italic>ϕ</italic> matches the local phase of the wake <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>wake</sub> = 2<italic>πd/UT</italic>, such that the effective phase <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>eff</sub> = <italic>ϕ ϕ</italic><sub>wake</sub> is zero. Because the quantity <italic>UT</italic> is nearly equal to the wavelength of the wake of a solitary swimmer, <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>wake</sub> = 2<italic>πd/UT</italic> is practically equal to the phase of a solitary leader. These observations have two major implications. First, they are consistent with the vortex phase matching introduced in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] as a strategy by which fish maximize hydrodynamic benefits. However, they proffer that vortex phase matching is an outcome of passive flow interactions among flapping swimmers, and not necessarily an active strategy implemented by fish via sensing and feedback mechanisms. blueSecond, they led us to hypothesize that emergent side-by-side formations can be predicted from symmetry arguments, while emergent inline and diagonal formations can be predicted entirely from kinematic considerations of the leader’s wake without considering two-way flow coupling between the two swimmers, as discussed next.</p>

<title>Leader’s wake unveils opportunities for stable emergent formations</title>
<p>To challenge our hypothesis that the leader’s wake contains information about the emergent pairwise equilibria, we examined the wake of a solitary swimmer in CFD and VS simulations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, B</xref>), and treated the potential second swimmer as a particle located at a point (<italic>x<sub>o</sub>, y<sub>o</sub></italic>) and undergoing prescribed oscillations <italic>y</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = <italic>y<sub>o</sub></italic> + <italic>A</italic> sin(2<italic>πft ϕ</italic>), with velocity vector <bold>v</bold>(<italic>x<sub>o</sub>, y<sub>o</sub>, ϕ, t</italic>) = 2<italic>πAf</italic> cos(2<italic>πft</italic> + <italic>ϕ</italic>)<bold>e</bold><italic><sub>y</sub></italic>, where <bold>e</bold><italic><sub>y</sub></italic> is a unit vector in the transverse <italic>y</italic>-direction. The wake is thus blind to the existence of the second swimmer. This model differs from the minimal particle model used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>], which treats both swimmers as particles with minimal ‘wakes’ and considered two-way coupling between them. In our analysis, the leader and its wake can be described to any desired degree of fidelity of the fluid model, including using experimentally constructed flows when available.</p>

<p>Inspired by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>] and following [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>], we defined a <italic>flow agreement parameter</italic> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="580536v1_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>t</italic> is chosen after steady state is reached, that describes how well the oscillatory motion <bold>v</bold>(<italic>x<sub>o</sub>, y<sub>o</sub>, t</italic>) of a potential second swimmer matches the local fluid velocity <bold>u</bold>(<italic>x<sub>o</sub>, y<sub>o</sub>, t</italic>) generated by the main solitary swimmer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. We normalized <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="580536v1_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Positive (negative) values of V indicate that the flow at (<italic>x, y</italic>) is favorable (unfavorable) to the follower’s flapping motion.</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A and B</xref>, we show V as a field over the physical space (<italic>x, y</italic>) for <italic>ϕ</italic> = 0. Blue regions indicate where the local flow favors the follower’s flapping motion. In both CFD and VS simulations, the locations with the maximum flow agreement parameter closely coincide with the stable equilibria (black circles) obtained from solving pairwise interactions. These findings suggest a simple rule for identifying the locations of stable equilibria in pairs of swimmers: they correspond to locations (<italic>x<sub>o</sub>, y<sub>o</sub></italic>)<italic><sup>∗</sup></italic> of maximum flow agreement V(<italic>x<sub>o</sub>, y<sub>o</sub>, ϕ</italic>) between the follower’s flapping motion and the wake of a solitary swimmer. Importantly, these findings underscore that hydrodynamic coupling in pairs of flapping swimmers is primarily <italic>non-reciprocal</italic> – captured solely by consideration of the effects of the leader’s wake on the follower. This non-reciprocity allows one, in principle, to efficiently and quickly identify opportunities for hydrodynamic benefits in any wake, without the need to perform costly two-way coupled simulations and experiments.</p>
<p>To verify this proposition, we show in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, as a function of phase <italic>ϕ</italic>, the streamwise locations of the local maxima of V(<italic>x<sub>o</sub>, y<sub>o</sub>, ϕ</italic>) computed based on the CFD and VS models, and scaled by <italic>UT</italic>, where <italic>U</italic> is the speed of the solitary swimmer. We superimpose onto these results the equilibrium configurations obtained from pairwise interactions in the context of the CFD (<inline-graphic mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="580536v1_img2.tif" mimetype="image"/>), VS (■), and time-delay particle (<inline-graphic mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="580536v1_img1.tif" mimetype="image"/>) models, where we modified the latter to account for non-zero lateral offset <italic>ℓ</italic> (SI, Sec. S.3 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S.5</xref>). Predictions of the equilibrium configurations based on maximal flow agreement parameter agree remarkably well with actual equilibria based on pairwise interactions, and they all follow the universal linear phase-distance relationship shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The wake of a solitary leader contains additional information that allows us to evaluate the relative power savings of a potential follower and relative stability of the pairwise formation directly from the leader’s wake, without accounting for pairwise interactions. Assessment of the relative power savings follows directly from the maximal value of the flow agreement parameter: larger values imply more power savings and reduced cost of transport. To verify this, we calculated the maximal V in the wake of the solitary swimmer, where we expect the follower to position itself in pairwise interactions. In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, we plotted these V values as a function of lateral distance <italic>ℓ</italic> for <italic>ϕ</italic> = 0. We superimposed the power savings Δ<italic>P</italic> based on pairwise interactions of inphase swimmers using the CFD and VS simulations and normalized all quantities by the maximal value of the corresponding model to highlight variations in these quantities as opposed to absolute values. Power savings are almost constant for <italic>ℓ &lt;</italic> 0.25<italic>L</italic>, but decrease sharply as <italic>ℓ</italic> increases. This trend is consistent across all models, with the most pronounced drop in the CFD-based simulations because the corresponding velocity field <bold>u</bold> decays more sharply when moving laterally away from the swimmer.</p>
<p>To assess the cohesion of the pairwise formation from the wake of the solitary leader, we estimated the thrust force acting on the virtual follower based on the fact that the thrust magnitude scales with the square of the swimmer’s lateral velocity relative to the surrounding fluid’s velocity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]. We defined the thrust parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="580536v1_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. We normalized <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="580536v1_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. At the locations of the maxima of V(<italic>x<sub>o</sub>, y<sub>o</sub>, ϕ</italic>), a negative slope <italic>∂</italic>T<italic>/∂d</italic> of the thrust parameter is an indicator of linear stability or cohesion of the potential pairwise equilibria; that is, pairwise formations are expected to be stable if a small perturbation in distance about the maximum V-locations is accompanied by an opposite, restorative change in T. Indeed, in both CFD and VS wakes, <italic>∂</italic>T<italic>/∂d</italic> at the maximum V-locations is negative (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, we plotted <italic>∂</italic>T<italic>/∂d</italic> as a function of lateral distance <italic>ℓ</italic> for <italic>ϕ</italic> = 0. We superimposed the magnitude of the eigenvalues <italic>δF/δd</italic> obtained from the linear stability analysis of pairwise interactions in inphase swimmers using the VS and time-delay particle models. As in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, all quantities are normalized by the maximal value of the corresponding model to highlight variations in these quantities as opposed to absolute values. Also, as in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, all models produce consistent results: pairwise cohesion is strongest for <italic>ℓ &lt;</italic> 0.25<italic>L</italic>, but weakens sharply as <italic>ℓ</italic> increases, with the most pronounced drop in the CFD-based simulations.</p>
<p>These findings show that, in the emergent inline and diagonal formations of flow-coupled flapping swimmers, the dominant dynamics is non-reciprocal; that is, the leader affects the follower, but the follower has a negligible (potentially higher-order) effects on the leader. Our diagnostics tools (flow agreement and thrust parameters) are agnostic to how the flow field is constructed (CFD vs VS simulations), and can be equally applicable to experimental data. That is, the approach we developed here could be applied broadly to analyze, predict, and test opportunities for schooling and hydrodynamic benefits in live and robotic fish when measurements of the flow field are available.</p>

<title>Parametric analysis over the entire space of phase lags and lateral offsets</title>
<p>Having demonstrated consistency in the emergence of flow-mediated equilibria in both CFD and VS simulations, we next exploited the computational efficiency of the VS model to systematically investigate emergent pairwise formations over the entire space of phase lag <italic>ϕ</italic> [0, 2<italic>π</italic>) and lateral offset <italic>ℓ</italic> [<italic>L, L</italic>], excluding side-by-side antiphase formations.</p>
<p>Equilibrium configurations are dense over the entire range of parameters: for any combination of phase lag <italic>ϕ</italic> and lateral offset <italic>ℓ</italic>, there exists an emergent equilibrium configuration where the pair of swimmers travel together at a separation distance <italic>d/UT</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Perturbing one or both parameters, beyond the limits of linear stability, causes the swimmers to stably and smoothly transition to another equilibrium at different spacing <italic>d/UT</italic>. Importantly, increasing the phase lag <italic>ϕ</italic> shifts the equilibrium positions in the streamwise direction such that <italic>d/UT</italic> depends linearly on <italic>ϕ</italic>, but the effect of lateral distance for <italic>ℓ L</italic> is nonlinear and nearly negligible for small <italic>ℓ</italic>: increasing the lateral offset <italic>ℓ</italic> by an entire bodylength <italic>L</italic> changes the pairwise distance <italic>d/UT</italic> by about 15%.

<p>To assess the hydrodynamic advantages of these emergent formations, we calculated the average change in hydrodynamic power per swimmer.

Power savings vary depending on phase lag <italic>ϕ</italic> and lateral distance <italic>ℓ</italic>: for the entire range of <italic>ϕ</italic> from 0 to 2<italic>π</italic>, the school consistently achieves over 20% power reduction, as long as the lateral offset is <italic>ℓ</italic> 0.25<italic>L</italic>.

<p>A calculation of the linear stability of each equilibrium in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> shows that these emergent formations are linearly stable (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), and the degree of stability is largely insensitive to phase lag, with strongest cohesion achieved at lateral offset <italic>ℓ</italic> 0.25<italic>L</italic>.

<p>We asked if loss of cohesion is dependent on the number of inline swimmers. To address this question, we gradually increased the number of swimmers from two to six (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S.6</xref>). We found that in a school of three inline swimmers, flow interactions led to a stable emergent formation with hydrodynamic benefits similar to those experienced by the three swimmers in each subgroup of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A and C</xref>. When computing the motion of four inline swimmers (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>), we found that the leading three swimmers maintained cohesion, at hydrodynamic benefits similar to a formation of three, but swimmer 4 separated and lagged behind, receiving no advantage in terms of power savings because it split from the formation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figs. 8D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S.6</xref>). In a group of five, the last two swimmers split and formed their own subgroup. That is, in all examples, swimmer 4 consistently lost hydrodynamic advantage and served as local leader of the trailing subgroup. These observations are consistent with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] and demonstrate that flow interactions alone are insufficient to maintain inline formations as the group size increases.</p>

<p>We next explored the robustness of the side-by-side pattern to larger number of swimmers starting from side-by-side initial conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B</xref>). The swimmers reached stable side-by-side formations reminiscent of the configurations observed experimentally when fish were challenged to swim at higher swimming speeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. The swimmers in this configuration saved power compared to solitary swimming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7C</xref>): swimmers gained equally in terms of hydrodynamic advantage (up to 55% power saving for the middle swimmers in a school of six), except the two edge swimmers which benefited less. We tested these results by gradually increasing the number of swimmers from two to six (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S.7</xref>). The robustness and overall trend of power saving among group members is robust to the total number of swimmers in these side-by-side formations.</p>

<title>Mechanisms leading to loss of cohesion in larger inline formations</title>
<p>To understand why three swimmers form a stable inline formation but four don’t, we extended the analysis in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> to analyze the wake created behind two-swimmer (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>) and three-swimmer (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>) groups. Specifically, we computed pairwise interactions in a two-swimmer school and considered the combined wake of both swimmers after they had settled onto an equilibrium state. Similarly, we computed the behavior of a three-swimmer school and analyzed the combined wake at steady state. Compared to the single leader wake in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, in the wake of a two-swimmer school, positive flow agreement in the (blue) region is enlarged and enhanced, corresponding to swimmer 3 receiving the largest power savings. On the other hand, behind three inline swimmers, the region of positive flow agreement is weakened and shrunk, indicating weaker potential for energy saving by a fourth swimmer.</p>

</fig>
<p>Importantly, in the wake of the pairwise formation, the downstream jet is modest at the location of maximum V, where swimmer 3 is expected to position itself for hydrodynamic benefit, thus allowing swimmer 3 to reach this position and stay in formation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9E</xref>). Also, at this location, the wake has a substantial transverse velocity <bold>u e</bold><italic><sub>y</sub></italic> (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9G</xref>), which aids thrust production at a diminished cost. In contrast, three inline swimmers generate a much stronger downstream jet at the location of maximum V where swimmer 4 is expected to position itself (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9F</xref>). This jet prevents swimmer 4 from stably staying in formation, and the transverse flow velocity <bold>u e</bold><italic><sub>y</sub></italic> is nearly zero for the entire flapping period (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9H</xref>) indicating little opportunity for exploiting the flow generated by the three upstream swimmers for thrust generation. This limitation is fundamental; it results from the flow physics that govern the wake generated by the upstream swimmers. There is not much that a trailing swimmer can do to extract hydrodynamic benefits from an oncoming flow field that does not offer any.</p>

<title>Critical size of inline formations beyond which cohesion is lost</title>
<p>We sought to understand what determines the critical group size, here three, beyond which inline formations lose cohesion and split into subgroups. Because we have established that the flow agreement parameter V plays an important role in predicting emergent formations, we first examined V in the wake of a pair of flapping swimmers in CFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S.1</xref>) and VS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S.2</xref>) simulations. These results show that at lower Re and smaller dissipation time <italic>τ</italic><sub>diss</sub>, the flow agreement parameter V decays rapidly downstream of the flapping swimmers, thus diminishing the opportunities for downstream swimmers to passively stay in cohesive formation and achieve hydrodynamic benefits. We thus hypothesized that the number of swimmers that passively maintain a cohesive inline formation is not a universal property of the flow physics, but depends on the flow regime.</p>
<p>We tested this hypothesis in VS simulations with increasing number of swimmers and increasing <italic>τ</italic><sub>diss</sub>. As we increased <italic>τ</italic><sub>diss</sub>, the number of swimmers that stayed in cohesive inline formation increased (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B,C</xref>). These findings confirm that this aspect of schooling – the maximal number of swimmers that passively maintain a cohesive inline formation – is indeed scale dependent. Interestingly, an analysis of the power savings in these formations shows that, although swimmers 4 and 5 stay in formation at increased <italic>τ</italic><sub>diss</sub>, swimmer 3 always receives the most hydrodynamic benefit (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We analyzed how passive flow interactions mediate self-organization in groups of flapping swimmers, all heading in the same direction. Our approach relied on a hierarchy of fluid-structure interaction models and aimed to distill which aspects of self-organization are universal and those which are scale-dependent.</p>
<p>We found that a pair of flapping swimmers self-organize into inline, diagonal, or side-by-side formations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). The emergent formation depends on the swimmers’ flapping phase and initial conditions. In fact, the distinction between these types of formation is somewhat arbitrary because, as phase varies, the emergent equilibria are dense over the space of lateral offset and separation distance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). These findings are consistent with experimental observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], but go beyond these observations to quantify the hydrodynamic benefits to each member in these formations. Two side-by-side swimmers flapping inphase share the hydrodynamic benefits nearly equally, whereas contrary to common misconception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], to flap antiphase, both swimmers need to exert extra effort compared to solitary swimming. In leader-follower formations, whether inline or diagonal, hydrodynamic benefits are bestowed entirely on the follower (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, we showed that the wake of a solitary leader contains information that unveils opportunities for the emergence of stable and energetically-favorable formations in pairs of swimmers. Equilibrium locations, and trends in power savings and school cohesion, can all be predicted entirely from kinematic considerations of the leader’s wake with no consideration of the two-way coupling between the two swimmers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). These results are important because they highlight the non-reciprocal or asymmetric nature of flow coupling in leader-follower configuratoins, inline or diagonal, of flapping swimmers at finite Re and open new avenues for future studies of non-reciprocal flow-coupled oscillators. This is in contrast to classic mechanical and biological oscillators, such as Huygens pendula or viscosity-dominant oscillators, where the coupling between oscillators is reciprocal; see, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>].</p>
<p>Our analysis has practical importance in that it provides efficient diagnostics and predictive tools that are equally applicable to computational models and experimental data and could, therefore, be applied broadly to analyze, predict, and test opportunities for schooling and hydrodynamic benefits in live and robotic fish when flow measurements are available.</p>
<p>Case in point, we used these diagnostic tools to explain the mechanisms leading to scattering in larger groups of inline swimmers and to predict when the wake of a leading group of swimmers offers no opportunities for a follower to benefit from passive hydrodynamics (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). At an increasing number of flow-coupled swimmers, side-by-side formations remain robust, but inline formations become unstable beyond a critical number of swimmers (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). The critical number depends on the fluid properties and can be predicted by analyzing the wake of the leading group of swimmers. Future work will focus on testing these findings experimentally and in CFD simulations with increasing number of swimmers, together with accounting for body deformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>], lateral dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], and varying flapping amplitude and frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>We next reflect on the distribution of hydrodynamic benefits among group members, its dependence on the spatial pattern of the emergent formation, and the implications that these observations have on biological schools of fish. Field and laboratory experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] have shown that actual fish schools do not generally conform to highly regularized patterns, and schooling fish dynamically change their position in the school. Neighboring fish vary from side-by-side to inline and diagonal configurations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Importantly, in laboratory experiments that challenged groups of fish to sustain high swimming speeds, the fish rearranged themselves in a side-by-side pattern as the speed increased, much like the pattern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B</xref>, presumably to save energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. These empirical observations, together with our findings that side-by-side formations provide the fairest distribution of efforts among school members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B and C</xref>), offer intriguing interpretations of the results in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]: when the fish are not challenged by a strong background current to sustain high swimming speeds, they position themselves as they please spatially, without much consideration to equal sharing of hydrodynamic benefits. But when challenged to swim at much higher speeds than their average swimming speed, fish are forced to cooperate.</p>
<p>To take this notion a step further, our results hint at a connection between flow physics and what is traditionally thought of as social traits: greed versus cooperation. We posit that there is a connection between the resources that arise from flow physics – in the form of energetic content of the wake of other swimmers – and greedy versus cooperative group behavior. In cohesive inline formations, the leader is always disadvantaged and hydrodynamic benefits are accorded entirely to trailing swimmers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C</xref>). Importantly, flows generated by these inline formations present serious impediments for additional swimmers to join the line downstream (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Thus, we could call these formations greedy, leaving no resources in the environment for trailing swimmers. This thought, together with our interpretation of the observations in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] that cooperation to achieve an egalitarian distribution of hydrodynamic benefits is forced, not innate, raise an interesting hypothesis. The dynamic repositioning of members within the school could be driven by greed and competition to occupy hydrodynamically advantageous positions, much like in peloton of racing cyclists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]. On a behavioral time scale, these ideas, besides their relevance to schooling fish, open up opportunities for analyzing and comparing the collective flow physics in cooperative versus greedy behavior in animal groups from formations of swimming ducklings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>] and flying birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>] to peloton of racing cyclists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]. From an evolutionary perspective, it is particularly exciting to explore the thought that flow physics could have acted as a selective pressure in the evolution of social traits such as cooperation and greed in aquatic animal groups.</p>

<title>CFD model</title>
<p>In our CFD simulations, a swimmer is modeled as a symmetric 2D Joukowsky airfoil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>]. The chord length of the airfoil is the characteristic length <italic>L</italic>, and the maximum thickness is 0.12<italic>L</italic>. The airfoil undergoes pitching motion around its leading edge. Fluid-structure interactions are governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations,
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="580536v1_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <bold>u</bold>(<bold>x</bold><italic>, t</italic>) and <italic>p</italic>(<bold>x</bold><italic>, t</italic>) are the velocity and pressure field, respectively. We solved for these fields numerically using immersed boundary method (IBM) that handles the two way coupled fluid structure interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>].</p>
<p>The immersed boundary formulation involves an Eulerian descriptions of the flow field and a Lagrangian description of the immersed swimmers, modeled as Joukowsky airfoils. The boundary condition is mapped to a body force exerted on the fluid. The Lagrangian and Eulerian variables are correlated by the Dirac delta function, which is smoothed during discretization. Here, we used the implementation developed by the group of Professor Boyce Griffith, IBAMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>], which has long been used to solve problems such as blood flow in heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>], water entry/exit problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>], fish’s swimming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>], insect’s flight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>], flexible propulsors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>], self propulsion of pitching/heaving airfoil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>], and fish schooling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>]. This implementation is based on an adaptive mesh, which enables us to accurately simulate self propulsion and reach steady state in a large computational domain with a reasonable computational cost.</p>
<p>The computational domain is a rectangle of dimensions 80<italic>L</italic> 20<italic>L</italic>, with periodic boundary conditions on the computational domain and no-slip boundary condition on the surface of airfoils. The initial location of the first swimmer is 12<italic>L</italic> away from the right boundary in streamwise direction. The initial distance between the two swimmers <italic>d</italic>(<italic>t</italic> = 0) ranges from 1.5<italic>L</italic> to 4<italic>L</italic> to ensure we access different equilibria the emerge in these pairwise formations. The coarsest Eulerian mesh is a uniform 500 125 Cartesian grid. The computational domain close to the airfoils and their wake are refined. There are 3 layers of refinement mesh, and the refinement ratio for each layer is 4. The simulation timestep is adaptive, with the maximum timestep Δ<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> = 2.5 10<italic><sup>−</sup></italic><sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>The hydrodynamic forces <italic>F<sub>x</sub></italic>, <italic>F<sub>y</sub></italic> and moment <italic>M</italic> acting on each swimmer are calculated by the integrating, over the surface of that swimmer, the traction force <bold><italic>σ</italic> n</bold> and moment <bold>x</bold> (<bold><italic>σ</italic> n</bold>), where <bold><italic>σ</italic></bold> = <italic>p</italic><bold>I</bold> +<italic>µ</italic>(<bold>u</bold> + <bold>u</bold><italic><sup>T</sup></italic>) is the fluid stress tensor, <bold>x</bold> denotes positions on the surface of that swimmer and <bold>n</bold> the unit normal to that airfoil into the fluid. The hydrodynamic forces and moment are used to solve the equations of motion (1) for each swimmer and obtain the active moment <italic>M<sub>a</sub></italic> in (7) needed to evaluate the hydrodynamic power in (8) that is expended by each swimmer.</p>

<title>Vortex sheet (VS) model</title>
<p>In the vortex sheet model, each swimmer is modeled as a rigid plate of length <italic>L</italic>, and it is approximated by a bound vortex sheet, denoted by <italic>l<sub>b</sub></italic>, whose strength ensures that no fluid flows through the rigid plate, and the separated shear layer is approximated by a free regularized vortex sheet <italic>l<sub>w</sub></italic> at the trailing edge of the swimmer. The total shed circulation Γ in the vortex sheet is determined so as to satisfy the Kutta condition at the trailing edge, which is given in terms of the tangential velocity components above and below the bound sheet and ensures that the pressure jump across the sheet vanishes at the trailing edge. To express th<sub>√</sub>e<underline>se</underline> concepts mathematically, it is convenient to introduce the complex notation, such that <italic>z</italic> = <italic>x</italic> + i<italic>y</italic>, where i = −1. For more details on the vortex sheet model and our implementation of it, we refer the readers to appendix A of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>], as well as to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>].</p>

<title>Time-delay particle model</title>
<p>We supplemented these CFD and VS models by studying pairwise interactions in the context of the minimal particle model used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. This particle model was designed for inline swimmers. Here, we modify it slightly to account for lateral offset <italic>ℓ</italic> between the swimmers as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig S.5</xref>. In a nutshell, the model assumes that the leader leaves behind a vertical wake speed equal to the leader’s flapping speed at the tail. The speed of the ‘wake’ that is left behind decays exponentially in time, as an approximation for viscous dissipation. Details of the model can be found in the Supplementary Information of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>In this model, each swimmer is a particle of mass per unit depth <italic>m</italic> undergoing vertical oscillations such that <italic>y</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>a</italic> sin(2<italic>πft</italic>) and <italic>y</italic> = <italic>a</italic> sin(2<italic>πft ϕ</italic>), where <italic>a</italic> = <italic>L</italic> sin <italic>A</italic> is the tailbeat amplitude of the pitching airfoil.

<title>Data collection from published literature</title>
<p>To probe the relationship between the scaled separation distance <italic>d/UT</italic> in pairs of swimmers and their flapping phase lag <italic>ϕ</italic>, we collected data from published literature on pairs of interacting swimmers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]; see Table S.1 and the Supplemental Excel Sheet.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study seeks to establish accurate computational models to explore the role of hydrodynamic interactions on energy savings and spatial patterns in fish schools. Specifically, the authors consider a system of (one degree-of-freedom) flapping airfoils that passively position themselves with respect to the streamwise direction, while oscillating at the same frequency and amplitude, with a given phase lag and at a constant cross-stream distance. By parametrically varying the phase lag and the cross-stream distance, they systematically explore the stability and energy costs of emergent configurations. Computational findings are leveraged to distill insights into universal relationships and clarify the role of the wake of the leading foil.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The use of multiple computational models (computational fluid dynamics, CFD, for full Navier-Stokes equations and computationally efficient inviscid vortex sheet, VS, model) offers an extra degree of reliability of the observed findings and backing to the use of simplified models for future research in more complex settings.</p>
<p>(2) The systematic assessment of the stability and energy savings in multiple configurations of pairs and larger ensembles of flapping foils is an important addition to the literature.</p>
<p>(3) The discovery of a linear phase-distance relationship in the formation attained by pairs of flapping foils is a significant contribution, which helps compare different experimental observations in the literature.</p>
<p>(4) The observation of a critical size effect for in-line formations of larger, above which cohesion and energetic benefits are lost at once, is a new discovery in the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The extent to which observations on one-degree-of-freedom flapping foils could translate to real fish schools is presently unclear so some of the conclusions on live fish schools are likely to be overstated and would benefit from some more biological framing.</p>
<p>(2) The analysis of non-reciprocal coupling is not as novel as the rest of the study and potentially not as convincing due to the chosen linear metric of interaction (that is, the flow agreement).</p>
<p>Overall, this is a rigorous effort on a critical topic: findings of the research can offer important insight into the hydrodynamics of fish schooling, stimulating interdisciplinary research at the interface of computational fluid mechanics and biology.</p>

<p>The document &quot;Mapping spatial patterns to energetic benefits in groups of flow-coupled swimmers&quot; by Heydari et al. uses several types of simulations and models to address aspects of stability of position and power consumption in few-body groups of pitching foils. I think the work has the potential to be a valuable and timely contribution to an important subject area. The supporting evidence is largely quite convincing, though some details could raise questions, and there is room for improvement in the presentation. My recommendations are focused on clarifying the presentation and perhaps spurring the authors to assess additional aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Why do the authors choose to set the swimmers free only in the propulsion direction? I can understand constraining all the positions/orientations for investigating the resulting forces and power, and I can also understand the value of allowing the bodies to be fully free in x, y, and their orientation angle to see if possible configurations spontaneously emerge from the flow interactions. But why constrain some degrees of freedom and not others? What's the motivation, and what's the relevance to animals, which are fully free?</p>
<p>(2) The model description in Eq. (1) and the surrounding text is confusing. Aren't the authors computing forces via CFD or the VS method and then simply driving the propulsive dynamics according to the net horizontal force? It seems then irrelevant to decompose things into thrust and drag, and it seems irrelevant to claim that the thrust comes from pressure and the drag from viscous effects. The latter claim may in fact be incorrect since the body has a shape and the normal and tangential components of the surface stress along the body may be complex.</p>
<p>(3) The parameter taudiss in the VS simulations takes on unusual values such as 2.45T, making it seem like this value is somehow very special, and perhaps 2.44 or 2.46 would lead to significantly different results. If the value is special, the authors should discuss and assess it. Otherwise, I recommend picking a round value, like 2 or 3, which would avoid distraction.</p>
<p>(4) Some of the COT plots/information were difficult to interpret because the correspondence of beneficial with the mathematical sign was changing. For example, DeltaCOT as introduced on p. 5 is such that negative indicates bad energetics as compared to a solo swimmer. But elsewhere, lower or more negative COT is good in terms of savings. Given the many plots, large amounts of data, and many quantities being assessed, the paper needs a highly uniform presentation to aid the reader.</p>
<p>(5) I didn't understand the value of the &quot;flow agreement parameter,&quot; and I didn't understand the authors' interpretation of its significance. Firstly, it would help if this and all other quantities were given explicit definitions as complete equations (including normalization). As I understand it, the quantity indicates the match of the flow velocity at some location with the flapping velocity of a &quot;ghost swimmer&quot; at that location. This does not seem to be exactly relevant to the equilibrium locations. In particular, if the match were perfect, then the swimmer would generate no relative flow and thus no thrust, meaning such a location could not be an equilibrium. So, some degree of mismatch seems necessary. I believe such a mismatch is indeed present, but the plots such as those in Figure 4 may disguise the effect. The color bar is saturated to the point of essentially being three tones (blue, white, red), so we cannot see that the observed equilibria are likely between the max and min values of this parameter.</p>
<p>(6) More generally, and related to the above, I am favorable towards the authors' attempts to find approximate flow metrics that could be used to predict the equilibrium positions and their stability, but I think the reasoning needs to be more solid. It seems the authors are seeking a parameter that can indicate equilibrium and another that can indicate stability. Can they clearly lay out the motivation behind any proposed metrics, and clearly present complete equations for their definitions? Further, is there a related power metric that can be appropriately defined and which proves to be useful?</p>
<p>(7) Why do the authors not carry out CFD simulations on the larger groups? Some explanations should be given, or some corresponding CFD simulations should be carried out. It would be interesting if CFD simulations were done and included, especially for the in-line case of many swimmers. This is because the results seem to be quite nuanced and dependent on many-body effects beyond nearest-neighbor interactions. It would certainly be comforting to see something similar happen in CFD.</p>
<p>(8) Related to the above, the authors should discuss seemingly significant differences in their results for long in-line formations as compared to the CFD work of Peng et al. [48]. That work showed apparently stable groups for numbers of swimmers quite larger than that studied here. Why such a qualitatively different result, and how should we interpret these differences regarding the more general issue of the stability of tandem groups?</p>
<p>(9) The authors seem to have all the tools needed to address the general question about how dynamically stable configurations relate to those that are energetically optimal. Are stable solutions optimal, or not? This would seem to have very important implications for animal groups, and the work addresses closely related topics but seems to miss the opportunity to give a definitive answer to this big question.</p>
<p>(10) Time-delay particle model: This model seems to construct a simplified wake flow. But does the constructed flow satisfy basic properties that we demand of any flow, such as being divergence-free? If not, then the formulation may be troublesome.</p>
