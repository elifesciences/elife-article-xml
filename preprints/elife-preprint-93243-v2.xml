<title>Abstract</title><p>Antibiotic tolerance in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> leads to less effective bacterial killing, poor treatment responses and resistant emergence. Therefore, we investigated the rifampicin tolerance of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates, with or without pre-existing isoniazid-resistance. We determined the <italic>in-vitro</italic> rifampicin survival fraction by minimum duration of killing assay in isoniazid susceptible (IS, n=119) and resistant (IR, n=84) <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates. Then we correlated the rifampicin tolerance with bacterial growth, rifampicin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and isoniazid-resistant mutations. The longitudinal IR isolates collected from patients were analyzed for changes in rifampicin tolerance and associated emergence of genetic variants. The median duration of rifampicin exposure reducing the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> surviving fraction by 90% (minimum duration of killing-MDK90) increased from 1.23 (95%CI 1.11; 1.37) and 1.31 (95%CI 1.14; 1.48) to 2.55 (95%CI 2.04; 2.97) and 1.98 (95%CI 1.69; 2.56) days, for IS and IR respectively, during 15 to 60 days of incubation. This indicated the presence of fast and slow growing tolerant sub-populations. A range of 6 log<sub>10</sub>-fold survival fraction enabled classification of tolerance as low, medium or high and revealed IR association with increased tolerance with faster growth (OR=2.68 for low vs. medium, OR=4.42 for low vs. high, <italic>P</italic>-trend=0.0003). The high tolerance in IR isolates was specific to those collected during rifampicin treatment in patients and associated with bacterial genetic microvariants. Furthermore, the high rifampicin tolerant IR isolates have survival potential similar to multi-drug resistant isolates. These findings suggest that IR tuberculosis needs to be evaluated for high rifampicin tolerance to improve treatment regimen and prevent the risk of MDR-TB emergence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> causes around 10 million cases of tuberculosis (TB) each year and 1.5 million deaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Challenges to successful TB treatment include bacterial evolution and diversification under host stresses and antibiotics, leading to differential antibiotic susceptibility even among genetically-susceptible <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Based on killing dynamics, the differential susceptibility can be classified into two phenomena, 1) antibiotic tolerance observed as reduced rate of killing of the entire bacterial population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, and 2) antibiotic persistence observed as reduced rate of killing of sub-populations compared to more susceptible bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Clinically susceptible isolates exposed to host stresses and antibiotic selection can exhibit increased antibiotic tolerance and persistence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, as seen by the emergence of mutations increasing tolerance or persistence among clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Recent studies have also implicated the antibiotic tolerance in clinical isolates as a risk factor for hard-to treat infections and tolerance can also contribute to the emergence of resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and relapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Emergence of rifampicin tolerance or persistence, a key drug in TB treatment is a major concern considering the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR, resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin) tuberculosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Several mechanisms lead to rifampicin tolerance, heteroresistance or persistence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. These include efflux pump overexpression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, mistranslation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, overexpression of rifampicin target <italic>rpoB</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, cell size heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> and the redox heterogeneity in bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Rifampicin treatment can also result in differentially detectable sub-populations of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, which can grow only in liquid medium as compared to solid medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, in determining risk of post-treatment relapse, it is important to consider, alongside tolerance range, the degree of growth heterogeneity within tolerant subpopulations.</p>
<p>Apart from rifampicin susceptibility variation, another concern in standard TB treatment is the emergence of isoniazid resistance (IR). There is globally around 10% prevalence of IR among clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. IR is difficult to rapidly diagnose during drug susceptibility testing, and is associated with worse treatment outcomes compared to isoniazid-susceptible (IS) <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Importantly, IR is also associated with subsequent emergence of rifampicin resistance leading to MDR TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Despite its potential importance for the TB treatment, the distribution of rifampicin tolerance among clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates is unknown, and routine clinical microbiology diagnosis does not include any assays for tolerance. The growth fitness of rifampicin tolerant subpopulations, and the association of pre-existing IR with rifampicin tolerance is completely unknown.</p>
<p>To address this knowledge gap, we developed a most-probable number (MPN) based minimum duration of killing (MDK) assay to determine the rifampicin tolerance among clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates in a medium-throughput manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. In the current study, we investigated the rifampicin tolerance in a large set of IS (n=119) and IR (n=84) clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates and its correlation with bacterial growth rate, rifampicin MICs, IR-mutations and the rifampicin treatment selection in patients.</p>

<title>Study design</title>
<p>We investigated rifampicin tolerance and its association with isoniazid susceptibility among 242 clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates. We treated susceptible isolates with rifampicin (2Âµg/mL), a concentration several times higher than their MICs (supplementary table 1) and also close to the serum rifampicin concentration observed in patient during oral dose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, and at 0, 2 and 5 days determined fractional survival following 15, 30 and 60 days of culture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A</xref>). Higher survival fractions indicate higher rifampicin tolerance, and differences in survival fraction determined between 15 and 60 days of incubation indicated greater growth heterogeneity in rifampicin tolerant sub-populations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1B</xref>). 23 of the isolates grew poorly in the absence of antibiotic, and a further 10 had low initial MPN, making accurate determination of survival fractions difficult (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1 A</xref>), and these 33 isolates were removed from further analysis. Of the remaining 209 isolates, 119 IS, 84 IR and 6 resistant to both rifampicin and isoniazid, MDR. The MDR isolates were controls and comparators as isolates with a known high degree of rifampicin tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Distribution of Rifampicin tolerance in IS and IR isolates</title>
<p>We analyzed the rifampicin survival fraction and the kill curve for IS and IR <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates, at 0, 2 and 5 days of rifampicin treatment followed by 15 and 60 days of incubation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). We did not further analyse 30 days incubation result, as it was similar to 60 days incubation (supplementary figure 1). Following 5 days of rifampicin treatment, the average survival fraction reduced by 90-99% of the starting bacterial population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). We calculated the time required for 90% survival fraction reduction (MDK<sub>90</sub>) for each isolate by determine the different length of X-axis (Days post rifampicin treatment) corresponding to 90% decline in survival fraction in Y-axis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>, supplementary figure 2). Of note, the average time required for 90% survival fraction reduction (MDK<sub>90</sub>) was 1.23 (95%CI (Confidence interval) 1.11; 1.37) and 1.31 (95%CI 1.14; 1.48) days for IS and IR respectively when survivors were incubated for 15 days, but rose to 2.55 (95%CI 2.04; 2.97) and 1.98 (95%CI 1.69; 2.56) days for 60 days for IS and IR isolates respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). This shift in the MDK<sub>90</sub> indicated the presence of growth heterogeneity within the tolerant subpopulation â with both fast and slow-growing bacteria within tolerant subpopulations. For most of the isolates MDK<sub>90</sub> time could be calculated but other parameters of tolerance and persistence such as MDK<sub>99</sub> (at 15 day=81% (170/209), 60 day=41% (86/209)) and MDK<sub>99.99</sub> (at 15 day=11% (22/209), 60 day=8% (17/209)) could be calculated for only a fraction of 209 isolates and the rest were beyond the assay limits (supplementary figure 2). Intriguingly, we observed a significant difference in rifampicin tolerance between IS and IR isolates at 5 days of treatmentâ but only in the 15 days post recovery. The difference had disappeared by 60 days (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). Therefore, we decided to consider survival fractions with 15 and 60 days recovery for further analysis, the earliest and latest time points for determining the fast- and slowly-growing rifampicin tolerant subpopulations.</p>

<title>Isoniazid resistance is associated with fast-growing rifampicin tolerant subpopulations</title>
<p>To further group rifampicin tolerance level, and correlate it with growth fitness and isoniazid susceptibility, we compared the distribution of survival fraction at 15 and 60 days recovery following 2 and 5 days of rifampicin treatment in IS (n=119) and IR (n=84) isolates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3A</xref>, supplementary figure 3). There was no significant difference in rifampicin tolerance between IS and IR isolates at 2 days of treatment (supplementary figure 3). At 5 days of rifampicin treatment and both early (15 days) and late (60 days) recovery time points, IS and IR isolates showed a broad distribution of fractional survivalâspanning 1 million-times difference in rifampicin susceptibility (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3 A</xref>). At the 15 days recovery period, IR was significantly associated with higher survival to rifampicin treatment as compared to IS isolates (P=0.017, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3A</xref>), whereas at 60 days, fractional survival increased in both groups with no difference according to isoniazid susceptibility (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3A</xref>). These results suggest that the difference between IS and IR rifampicin tolerant subpopulations is within their fast-growing tolerant bacilli only.</p>

<p>To further refine distribution of rifampicin tolerance between isolates, first we combined the rifampicin survival fraction distribution of both IS and IR isolates, then the fractional rifampicin survival was parsed as low, medium or high as defined by falling within the 25<sup>th</sup>, 75<sup>th</sup> and 100<sup>th</sup> percentiles of survival fractions following rifampicin treatment and either 15 or 60 days recovery (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3B</xref>). As expected, there was substantially lower tolerance to rifampicin in low and medium groups compared with MDR isolates. Surprisingly, tolerance to rifampicin between non-rifampicin resistant âhighâ tolerance strains and MDR strains was not significantly different (P=0.78, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3B</xref>), and these high tolerant strains were characterized in both IS and IR isolates. This suggests that within the IR, high tolerant subgroup, antibiotic susceptibility (to both rifampicin and isoniazid) may be similar to <italic>bona fide</italic> MDR strains.</p>
<p>Analyzing rifampicin tolerance subgroups between IS and IR strains, at the early, 15 day recovery time-point, the majority (79%, 26/33) of âlowâ rifampicin tolerant strains were isoniazid susceptible. By contrast, IR isolates were over-represented in the âmediumâ and âhighâ tolerant subgroups (OR of 2.7 and 4.4 respectivelyâ<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). These associations disappeared with longer (60 day) recovery post antibiotic treatment, confirming that IR isolates harbored fast-growing, high-level rifampicin-tolerant bacilli compared with IS isolates (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Association between rifampicin tolerance and relative growth in absence of antibiotics, rifampicin MICs, isoniazid resistant mutations of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates</title>

Prior studies showed that slow growth rate and non-replicating persistence were correlated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, therefore we wished to investigate the association between growth rates in the absence of antibiotic treatment, rifampicin MIC distribution, isoniazid-resistant mutations and rifampicin tolerance distribution in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates.</p>
<p>For correlating relative growth in absence of antibiotics, we removed 19 outliers which deviated from normal distribution (supplementary figure 4 with 19 outliers), Intriguingly, slower growth before rifampicin treatment did not have significant correlation with higher growth fitness in rifampicin survival fraction at 15 days incubation in IS isolates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4A</xref> regression coefficient â0.21, 95%CI [-0.44, 0.007], <italic>P</italic>=0.058). By contrast, correlation of slower growth with lower growth fitness in the long recovery period was observed in both IS and IR isolates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4B</xref>, regression coefficient for IS=0.38 [0.15, 0.61], <italic>P</italic>=0.0014, and IR=0.38 [0.12, 0.64], <italic>P</italic>=0.0041). Comparing IS and IR isolates, IR isolates had slower growth in the absence of antibiotics (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4C</xref>, P&lt;0.0001).

<p>We next investigated the association between isoniazid-resistant mutations in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates and rifampicin tolerance distribution.

Due to low number of isolates with inhA and fabG1 mutations, it was not possible to identify the difference in rifampicin tolerance distribution between the isolates with different isoniazid-resistant mutations. Nevertheless, we observed wide distribution of rifampicin tolerance in isoniazid-resistant isolates with katG_S315X mutation itself (supplementary figure 6), indicating the role of other genetic or epi-genetic determinants influencing rifampicin tolerance.</p>

<title>Higher rifampicin tolerance and growth fitness is associated with IR isolates from intensive phase of treatment with rifampicin</title>
<p>The IS isolates were collected only at baseline before treatment, whereas the IR isolates in our study were collected longitudinally from patients at different stages of treatment. Both patients with IS and IR isolates received the standard 8 months treatment regimen according to the Vietnamese National TB Program during the study period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, this included initial two months with four antibiotics (streptomycin or ethambutol, with rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide) followed by 6 months with isoniazid and ethambutol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The antibiotic treatment may select different <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genetic microvariants in the patients and lead to differences in rifampicin tolerance between longitudinal isolates. Therefore, we analyzed the rifampicin tolerance distribution in the IR isolates in three sub-groups, before treatment (IR-BL), initial two months of intensive phase of treatment with rifampicin in the regimen (IR-IP), continuous phase and relapse lacking rifampicin and any other antibiotics treatment selection respectively (IR-CP) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).

<p>To verify this finding, we grouped individual patients (n = 18) based on changes in rifampicin tolerance between their initial and subsequent IR isolates collected before treatment (0 month), during treatment (1 to 8 months) and post-treatment (12 to 24 months) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). We observed three kinds of changes in rifampicin tolerance between the isolates collected from same patient, 1. decrease (one or more subsequent isolates with lower rifampicin tolerance as compared to the initial isolate), 2. unchanged (initial and subsequent isolates with similar level of rifampicin tolerance) and 3. Increase (one or more subsequent isolates with higher rifampicin tolerance as compared to the initial isolate) for 5 days or rifampicin treatment and 15 and 60 days recovery time (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) and analyzed the difference in non-synonymous SNPs between the isolates from the same patients associated with differences in rifampicin tolerance (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, supplementary table 2). The SNPs difference between the longitudinally collected <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates from same patient were 0-3 except in one case (SNPs=11), indicating de-novo emergence or selection of genetic microvariants within the patient (supplementary table 2). Next, we analyzed the non-synonymous SNPs associated with the changes in rifampicin tolerance both at 15 and 60 days incubation. This included both genetic variants emerging as more than 90% of WGS reads and less-than 90% threshold used as a cut-off for calling SNPs. Several genes Rv0792c, Rv1266c, Rv1696, Rv1758, Rv1997, Rv2043c, Rv2329c, Rv2394, Rv2398c, Rv2400c, Rv2488c, Rv2545, Rv2689c, Rv3138, Rv3680 and Rv3758c previously reported to be associated with persistence, tolerance and survival within host had non-synonymous SNPs associated with changes in rifampicin tolerance (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, supplementary table 3 with references).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We investigated rifampicin tolerance in a large number of clinical isolates of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Overall clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates showed higher levels of rifampicin tolerance than lab isolates as the average survival fraction post-rifampicin treatment decreased only by 90 to 99% over 5 days. We found that levels of rifampicin tolerance are widely distributed among isolates, with some genetically susceptible strains having similar susceptibility to rifampicin-mediated killing as <italic>bona fide</italic> rifampicin-resistant isolates, at least during the 5 days rifampicin exposure of our assay condition. Furthermore, IR isolates were more likely to harbor fast-growing subpopulations with high levels of rifampicin tolerance.</p>
<p>Heterogeneity in regrowth following stress has been linked to a tradeoff between growth fitness and survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, and it is likely that in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> such diversification in growth rates among rifampicin-tolerant subpopulations represents such a balance between growth and persistence under antibiotic stress.</p>
<p>We also observed a variation in growth rate in the absence of antibiotic therapy. On average, IR isolates were slower growing than IS isolates, which likely represents a fitness cost due to isoniazid-resistance-causing mutations and strain genetic background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. As expected, IS isolates, with slower growth in the absence of drug had a weak association with high levels of rifampicin tolerance at the 15 day time point<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (representing rapidly growing recovered cells), whereas both IS and IR isolates with slower growth in the absence of drug were significantly associated with lesser rifampicin survival fraction levels at 60 daysâ representing slow growing rifampicin tolerant bacilli. These data suggest that slower growth (in absence of drug) in both isoniazid susceptible and resistant isolates, perhaps due to fitness cost of mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, may be associated with more persister-like tolerant subpopulations.</p>
<p>By contrast, the association between rifampicin MIC and rifampicin tolerance showed a contrasting trend with isoniazid susceptibility. IS isolates showed decreased tolerance with increase in rifampicin MIC, but IR isolates did not show this association. This may indicate higher growth fitness of IR with rifampicin tolerance. Another important finding from our study is the emergence of higher rifampicin tolerance and growth fitness in longitudinal IR isolates under rifampicin treatment selection. This further supports the findings that multiple genetic microvariants may co-exist in patient and rapidly change their proportion under selection from host stresses and antibiotic treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. We also observed non-synonymous mutations in multiple genes, associated with persistence and host survival enriched with changes in rifampicin tolerance between the longitudinal isolates (supplementary table 3 with references). However, lack of convergent SNPs in the samples may be due to the relatively small sample size, interaction between SNPs and strain background or indication of a larger set of tolerance-related genes that independently affect bacterial growth and antibiotic tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our study also reveals novel aspects of rifampicin tolerance associated with isoniazid susceptibility. Rifampicin treatment itself led to the selection of IR <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genetic microvariants with high rifampicin tolerance and increased growth fitness in patients. The precise mechanisms underlying these phenotypes will require further investigation, but it is intriguing to note that different <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> lineages have varying liabilities for development of isoniazid resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, suggesting that clinical isolates may evolve diverse paths towards phenotypic drug resistance that impact fundamental bacterial physiology and tolerance to other antibiotics.</p>
<p>The wide range of observed rifampicin tolerance, spanning many orders of magnitude confirms findings of experimentally evolved drug tolerance to the laboratory isolate <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-H37Rv<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and extends our prior findings from a smaller-scale pilot study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Given that almost all rifampicin resistance is via mutations in <italic>rpoB</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, our findings suggest that first-line molecular testing for rifampicin susceptibility, which is replacing phenotypic drug susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, may not fully capture response to therapy. It needs to be further validated if these strains that are âhyper-tolerantâ to rifampicin are risk factors for poor clinical outcomes in IR-TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Given the association of IR with the emergence of rifampicin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, our findings suggest a plausible mechanism by which isoniazid resistance, via rifampicin tolerance, acts as a âstepping stoneâ to rifampicin resistance. The association between IR and rifampicin tolerance only held for fast-growing recovered bacteria. Given the observation that âgrowingâ rifampicin tolerant bacteria are over-represented after initiation of drug therapy in humans due to the specific regulation of <italic>rpoB</italic> in mycobacteria in response to rifampicin exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, this may represent a divergence between growing and non-replicating persister forms of antibiotic tolerance. A better understanding of which forms of tolerance contribute to clinically relevant response to therapy will be critical for tailoring individualized regimens for TB or improving treatment regimen for IR-TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our study has some limitations. We only assayed rifampicin tolerance under one standard axenic culture condition. It is known that antibiotic tolerance phenotypes vary considerably according to culture conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, with some phenotypes only emerging <italic>in vitro</italic> with specialized media, e.g. containing odd-chained fatty acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Secondly, contributors to antibiotic tolerance can be genetic, epigenetic or transient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and there is considerable epistasis between genetic variation and antibiotic susceptibility. Our assay will not be able to capture drivers of tolerance that have been lost in the collection, banking, freezing and reviving of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates. Finally, the isolates were from a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, and during the study period the old 8-month TB treatment regimen lacked rifampicin in the continuation phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>This study also reveals interesting aspects like fast and slow growing sub-populations and possible variation in lag-time distribution among clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates. There can also be different mechanisms of tolerance and persistence among <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates, detailed investigations are required to further understand these aspects and its clinical relevance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study identifies a significant association between isoniazid-resistance and rifampicin tolerance in clinical isolates of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Our findings have implications for the requirement to consider heterogeneity in bacterial responses to antibiotics and emergence of antibiotic tolerant bacterial genetic microvariants in determining optimal tuberculosis treatment regimens.</p>

<p>Most-probable number-based rifampicin killing assay was done for the clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates as per the published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates, after single sub-culture from archive, were inoculated in 7H9T medium (Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with 0.2% glycerol, 10% OADC and 0.05% Tween-80) and incubated at 37<sup>0</sup>C until exponential phase with OD<sub>600</sub> range of 0.4-0.6 is reached.

<p>Wilcoxon rank-sum test (stat_compare_means function, ggpubr package) was used to test the null hypothesis that the IS and IR groups have the same continuous distribution, as it is a non-parametric test that does not require a strong assumption about the normality of the distribution of the variable. Chi-Square test (odds ratio function, epitools package) was used to determine if there is a significant relationship between IR and rifampicin tolerance. Cochran Armitage test (CochranArmitageTest function, DescTools package) was performed to test for trend in IR proportion across the levels of rifampicin tolerance. Linear regression (lm function, stats package) was used to evaluate the correlation between rifampicin survival fraction and relative growth.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses and graphs were plotted using R, version 4Â·0Â·1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> and p-values of â¤0Â·05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>MDK<sub>90</sub>, <sub>99</sub> and <sub>99.99</sub> calculation</title>
<p>In addition to MDK90 calculated by linear mixed effect model, we also determined the MDK values at 90, 99 and 99.99% reduction in survival fractions for all the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates by the following method. The log<sub>10</sub> MPN values at Day0, Day 2, and Day 5 were used to calculate the respective MDK time for 90%, 99%, and 99.99% reduction in fraction of survival. The calculation of MDK time for individual isolate was based on modelling kill curve as two similar triangles and using the basic proportionality theorem as shown in the flow chart (Supplementary figure 7) to determine the different length of X-axis (Days post rifampicin treatment) corresponding to decline in survival fraction in Y-axis for each MDK time (MDK<sub>90</sub>, <sub>99</sub> and <sub>99.99</sub>).</p>
<p>For example, in case of MDK90, Y0 (MPN number at day 0), Y2 ((MPN number at day 2), and Y5 ((MPN number at day 5).</p>
<p>First condition tested is, if 90% reduction in survival fraction happened before or at day 2 by checking if log<sub>10</sub> MPN number at day 2 is less than or equal to 90% reduction as compared to Y0. If the condition is true then the MDK is calculated as x-axis length DF in the two similar triangles modelled in A (triangles ACB and AFD) and corresponding formula for X given below. If the first condition is false then two similar triangles are modelled as in B (triangles ABC and DEC) and X is calculated as 5 â EC. Similarly, for MDK<sub>99</sub> and MDK<sub>99.99</sub> time are calculated by applying the condition for 99% and 99.99% reduction in survival fraction.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study demonstrates that there is significant variation in the susceptibility of isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates to killing by rifampicin, in some cases at the same tolerance levels as bona fide resistant strains. The evidence provided is <bold>solid</bold>, with no clear genetic marker for increased tolerance, suggesting that there may be multiple routes to achieving this phenotype. The work will be of interest to infectious disease researchers.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study entitled &quot;Rifampicin tolerance and growth fitness among isoniazid-resistant clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates: an in-vitro longitudinal study&quot; by Vijay et al. provides valuable insights into the association of rifampicin tolerance and growth fitness with isoniazid resistance among clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. Antibiotic tolerance in M. tuberculosis is an important topic since it contributes to the lengthy and complicated treatment required to cure tuberculosis disease and may portend the emergence of antibiotic resistance. The authors found that rifampicin tolerance was correlated with bacterial growth, rifampicin minimum inhibitory concentrations, and isoniazid-resistance mutations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The large number of clinical isolates evaluated and their longitudinal nature during treatment for TB (including exposure to rifampin) are strengths of the study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some of the methodologies are not well explained or justified and the association of antibiotic tolerance with growth rate is not a novel finding. In addition, the molecular mechanisms underlying rifampicin tolerance only in rapidly growing isoniazid-resistant isolates have not been elucidated and the potential implications of these findings for clinical management are not immediately apparent.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comments, we have modified the method section and figure 1 to clarify the method as suggested by the reviewer.</p>
<p>Although we agree that previous studies have shown the association of slow growth rate with antibiotic tolerance, ours is the most comprehensive assessment of rifampicin tolerance among clinical isolates, to our knowledge. In particular, we show that the degree of tolerance in clinical isolates can vary over several orders of magnitude: which had not been previously documented or appreciated. Furthermore, the association of high tolerance among IR isolates is a new finding, and given the potential for tolerance to increase risk of de novo drug resistance, our study suggests that IR isolates with high rifampicin tolerance may present a risk for development of MDR-TB.</p>
<p>In addition, we have also analysed the longitudinal isolates and the genetic variants emerging in them associated with increase in rifampicin tolerance. This analysis reveals possible multiple pathways to increase in rifampicin tolerance among clinical M. tuberculosis isolates. Possible clinical implication includes associating high rifampicin tolerance and isoniazid resistance as a risk factor for tuberculosis treatment failure. This study helps to develop further clinical studies to evaluate the role of rifampicin tolerance in IR isolates and treatment outcome. We have focused on these aspects in the discussion of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Vijay and colleagues addresses a clinically important, and often overlooked aspect of Tb treatment. Detecting for variations in the level of antibiotic tolerance amongst otherwise antibiotic-susceptible isolates is difficult to routinely screen for, and consequently not performed. The authors, present a convincing argument that indeed, there is significant variation in the susceptibility of isoniazid-resistant strains to killing by rifampicin, in some cases at the same tolerance levels as bona fide resistant strains. On the whole, the study is easy to follow and the results are justified. This work should be of interest to the wider TB community at both a clinical and basic level.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript is long, repetitive in places, and the figures could use some amending to improve clarity (this could be a me-specific issue as they look ok on my screen, yet the colour is poor when printed).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comments, we have modified the revised manuscript as per the reviewer suggestions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would have been great to have seen some correlation between increased rifampicin tolerance and treatment outcome, although I'm not sure if this data is available to the researchers. I agree with the researchers the use of a single media condition is a limitation. However, this is true of a lot of studies. Rifampicin tolerance and treatment outcome analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that correlation between rifampicin tolerance and treatment outcome is important. This needs to be performed in future studies with better design to correlate rifampicin tolerance with treatment progression or outcome data.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have initiated studies to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the devolvement of multi-drug resistance in clinical Mtb strains. They demonstrate the association of isoniazid-resistant isolates by rifampicin treatment supporting the idea that selection of MDR is a microenvironment phenomenon and involves a group of isolates.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The methods used in this study are robust and the results support the authors' claims to a major extent.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript needs a thorough vetting of the language. At present, the language makes it very difficult to comprehend the methodology and results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comments, we have revised the manuscript as per the reviewerâs suggestions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) Methods: The authors attempt to differentiate between &quot;fast&quot;- and &quot;slow&quot;-growing bacteria in order to determine if the growth rate is associated with rifampicin tolerance. This is accomplished by assessing growth on solid agar at 15 and 60 days post-incubation, respectively. However, mycobacterial growth rate is not a binary phenomenon but rather a continuous variable. Moreover, it is not clear why 15 and 60 days were selected. Also, instead of a &quot;slow growth&quot; phenotype, the 60-day time point might simply reflect a longer lag phase. Were the plates examined at any interval time points? It would be interesting to know whether colony growth was delayed overall in the populations observed only at 60 days, or simply if the appearance of microcolonies visible to the naked eye was delayed (with normal growth afterwards).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comments, we want to clarify that we have not used agar plates but most-probable number method to determine the survival fraction post antibiotic treatment. We have clarified this in the revised manuscript and revised figure 1. The MPN method is a binary measure (growth/ no growth) and therefore cannot differentiate between long lag time and other mechanisms. In our original analysis, we included an intermediate time point of 30 days, but these data (included as supp fig. 1) cannot address the issue of lag phase directly. Since the 30-day time point did not add to the overall analysis and interpretation, we had not included them in the original submission.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Methods/Results/Discussion: Some important clinical information is missing-how were the patients treated who had IR isolates? Did they receive the standard regimen for DS TB or was another drug substituted for isoniazid? Exposure to different drugs could affect the rifampicin-tolerant populations during the intensive phase (Figure 5).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment, we have included the information regarding the treatment regimen in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Were there differences in microbiological (sputum culture conversion rate at 8 weeks or time to culture negativity) or clinical outcomes based on isoniazid susceptibility? Perhaps more importantly, were there differences in microbiological/clinical outcomes based on the proportion of bacterial subpopulations with rifampicin tolerance for a particular isolate? There should be more discussion on the potential clinical implications of the study's findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that correlation between rifampicin tolerance and treatment progression or outcome is important. This needs to be performed in future studies with better design to correlate rifampicin tolerance with treatment progression or outcome data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Results (Figure 3A): Although an interesting finding, the increased rifampicin tolerance observed only in the &quot;rapidly&quot; growing populations of isoniazid-resistant isolates (IR) vs. isoniazid-susceptible (IS) isolates is not explained. In contrast, equally, increased rifampicin tolerance is seen in the &quot;slowly&quot; growing populations of both IR and IS isolates. It would be interesting to know if these slowly growing populations show specific tolerance to rifampicin or if, as expected, slow growth confers tolerance to a range of different bactericidal antibiotics.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. we agree these will be interesting to investigate in a future study but are outside the scope of the current study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Results (Figure 3B): The basis for the classification into tertiles is not clear and appears somewhat arbitrary-does this represent the survival of a particular isolate following rifampicin exposure relative to the other isolates based on isoniazid susceptibility (IS or IR) or the % growth relative to other populations for the same isolate? Figure 3B is missing a y-axis label. Is it a log10 MPN ratio?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this, we want to clarify that for the classification into tertiles, first we pooled both group of isolates isoniazid susceptible (IS) and isoniazid resistant (IR) into a single population. Subsequently, we categorized this unified population into three distinct groups: low, medium, and high, based on their survival fraction following rifampicin treatment. Consequently, the 'low,' 'medium,' and 'high' tertiles represent the survival of each isolate following rifampicin exposure relative to the total number of isolates  combing both IS and IR isolates.</p>
<p>For clarity, we provide a breakdown of the criteria for each tertile:</p>
<p>+Low tertile: Consists of isolates with the lowest survival fraction (bottom 25%).</p>
<p>+Medium tertile: Encompasses isolates with survival fractions that fall between the bottom 25% and the top 25%.</p>
<p>+High tertile: Comprises isolates with the highest survival fractions (top 25%). This we have modified in the revised manuscript to clarify.</p>
<p>We have also modified the Figure 3B to correct the y-axis label.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Results (lines 185-186): For correlating relative growth in the absence of antibiotics, 19 clinical isolates &quot;outliers&quot; were removed without explanation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added explanation for the âoutliersâ which were removed earlier due to deviation from normal distribution, we have also provided the supplementary figure 3 which includes these outliers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Results (lines 203-211): The authors attempted to investigate a potential association between the mechanism of M. tuberculosis isoniazid resistance and the degree of rifampicin tolerance. However, the vast majority of IR clinical isolates (n=71) had a katG_S315X mutation and only 8 isolates had alternative mutations (inhA_I21T and fabG1_C-15X). Given the wide range of rifampicin tolerance observed within these isoniazid-resistant isolates, they concluded that other genetic or epigenetic determinants must be playing a role. WGS of longitudinally collected isolates from the same patients during TB treatment yielded non-synonymous SNPs in a list of genes previously reported to be associated with persistence, tolerance, and mycobacterial survival. However, precise mechanisms (including, e.g., expression of efflux pumps) are not investigated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for summarising the findings. Yes, we agree that investigating the precise mechanism of rifampicin tolerance is beyond the scope of the current work.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>The abstract is long and repetitive. It needs reworking and shortening to improve clarity and highlight the main takeaway message.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thanks the reviewer for the suggestions and have modified this in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The introduction is interesting and contains relevant information. However, it is long and takes a while to get to the point of the study. It needs re-writing to emphasise key prior results and the purpose of this study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thanks the reviewer for the suggestions and we have modified this in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Results:</p>
<p>As the study relies predominately on the use of MPN, I think a simple schematic of how the experiment is performed would be informative. Could this be added to Figure 1?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the figure 1 in the manuscript to include the schematic representation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Some of the differences in MKD90, whilst they may be significant, are small so it would at least provide context as to the relevance of these differences. This may also alleviate my confusion as to how the authors can measure the time required to achieve MDK90 as 1.23-1.31 days when the first time point that is taken is day 2 (the data in Figure 2). They have FigS6 but this is small and hard to follow.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, we have modified this in the revised manuscript and figureS6.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 2:</p>
<p>Would be helpful to have -1 on the Y axis.</p>
<p>The grey dots don't print very well (Might be my printer)</p>

<p>We have modified this in the revised manuscript, figure 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 142: The authors note a difference in RIF tolerance at day 15 that disappeared by day 60. I assume they are referring to the day 5 timepoint although this isn't clear as written.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, it is referring to the day 5 time point and we have clarified this in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The section starting at line 148 (fig 3) is interesting, but it is difficult to read and follow what the difference is between this data and the prior data in Figure 2. It also wasn't until about line 165 that the purpose became clear. Overall the conclusions are sound and interesting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified this in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 154: What are the early and late time recovery time points?</p>
<p>Is Figure 3A the same data as Figure 2?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have clarified this in the revised manuscript, the figure 3A is the same data as Figure 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I found Figure 6 hard to follow. I'm not sure how better to present this data, but it should be improved. Some further clarification in the text would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. We have added more explanation in the text to clarify figure 6.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<p>The conclusions are sound, based on the data presented. The clinical relevance is highlighted, yet appropriately phrased to not be too far-reaching.</p>
<p>Again, I think the conclusions could be condensed considerably. It is repetitive in places, which distills the main outcomes of this otherwise interesting and important study. The authors appropriately highlight some of the limitations of their study.</p>

<p>The manuscript &quot;Rifampicin tolerance and growth fitness among isoniazid-resistant clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates: an in-vitro longitudinal study&quot; by Srinivasan et.al., details the identification/ development of isoniazid-resistant strains in clinical isolates following testament with rifampicin. This is an important aspect of understanding MDR development in TB strains. the results are promising and gel well with the hypothesis. However, the manuscript requires a thorough language modification. While the overall idea is clear the methodology does not come out clearly.</p>

<p>(1) It is not clear whether rifampicin treatments were given for 2 and 5 days before kill curves or for 15 and 60 days? The methodology needs to be phased clearly. Why was this time interval of 15 days and 60 days taken? is there a rationale for this?</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions, we have modified the method and figure 1 to clarify this in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(2) A concentration of 2ug/ml was used for in vitro culture in this study. While the authors themselves indicate that this is well above the MIC, this might represent a non- natural dose and hence may force the evolution of strains. What will be the scenario in the natural course of antibiotic treatment (dose at MIC or less than MIC)?</p>

<p>We have observed that till 5 days there is no significant resistant emergence but after 5 days only resistance emerges, therefore we avoided determining the survival fraction after resistance emergence, the kill curve represents mostly tolerant sub population. ADD: Pharmacokinetic studies of rifampicin dosing suggest that peak concentrations of &gt;2-32 Âµg/mL are typical for standard doses of the drug, therefore we believe the chosen concentration of 2 Âµg/mL to be physiologically relevant.</p>

<p>(3) As described in line 155, the survival spanned a broad distribution, across a million times in difference. This is rather surprising that 5 days of rifampicin treatment would lead to such a spread in resistance patterns. Did the authors study the different populations to understand this phenomenon? This is important given the scale of resistance developed in this short time.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We want to clarify that the broad range of survival fraction reflect the difference in tolerant sub-populations but not resistant sub-population to rifampicin as they are determined post rifampicin treatment in rifampicin free media, this has been clarified in the revised figure 1.</p>

<p>Overall, the manuscript is a detailed study with new insights into the development of multi-drug resistance by Mtb. A thorough vetting for language is essential for a greater impact of the study.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer and have attempted to improve the clarity of the language to increase the potential impact of our findings.</p>
