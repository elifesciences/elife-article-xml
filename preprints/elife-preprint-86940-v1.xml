<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The hippocampus executes imperative functions from declarative memory to adaptive behaviors associated with cognition and emotion. However, the mechanisms of how morphogenesis and functions along the hippocampal dorsoventral axis are differentiated and integrated are still largely unclear. Here, we show that <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>-TFII</italic> genes are distinctively expressed in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, respectively. The loss of <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> results in ectopic CA1/CA3 domains in the ventral hippocampus. The deficiency of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> leads to the failed specification of dorsal CA1, among which there are place cells. The deletion of both <italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes causes almost agenesis of the hippocampus with abnormalities of trisynaptic circuit and adult neurogenesis. Moreover, <italic>COUP-TFI</italic>/<italic>-TFII</italic> may cooperate to guarantee appropriate morphogenesis and function of the hippocampus by regulating the <italic>Lhx5-Lhx2</italic> axis. Our findings revealed a novel mechanism that <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> converge to govern the differentiation and integration of distinct characteristics of the hippocampus in mice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Memory, including declarative and nondeclarative memory, unifies our mental world to ensure the quality of life for people of all ages, from newborns to elderly individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eichenbaum &amp; Cohen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kandel, Dudai, &amp; Mayford, 2014</xref>). The pioneering studies of Milner and her colleagues revealed that the hippocampus is required for declarative memory but not nondeclarative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Penfield &amp; Milner, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scoville &amp; Milner, 1957</xref>). The discovery of activity-dependent long-term potentiation and place cells provides the neurophysiological basis of hippocampal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bliss &amp; Lomo, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">O’Keefe &amp; Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>). The rodent hippocampus can be divided into the dorsal and ventral domains, corresponding to the posterior and anterior hippocampus in humans, respectively. In recent decades, numerous studies have supported the Moser theory that the hippocampus is a heterogeneous structure with distinct characteristics of gene expression, connectivity, and functions along its dorsoventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bast, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fanselow &amp; Dong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Moser &amp; Moser, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Strange, Witter, Lein, &amp; Moser, 2014</xref>). The dorsal hippocampus, which connects and shares similar gene expression with the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fanselow &amp; Dong, 2010</xref>), serves the “cold” cognitive function associated with declarative memory and spatial navigation. The ventral hippocampus, which connects and generates similar gene expression with the amygdala and hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cenquizca &amp; Swanson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kishi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pitkanen, Pikkarainen, Nurminen, &amp; Ylinen, 2000</xref>), corresponds to the “hot” affective states related to emotion and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fanselow &amp; Dong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tyng, Amin, Saad, &amp; Malik, 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, to date, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the morphogenesis, connectivity, and functions along the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus are differentiated and integrated are largely unknown.</p>
<p>The hippocampus, a medial temporal lobe structure in the adult rodent forebrain, originates from the medial pallium (MP) in the medial line of the early dorsal telencephalon. The cortical hem (CH), which is located ventrally to the MP, functions as an organizer for hippocampal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hebert &amp; Fishell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schuurmans &amp; Guillemot, 2002</xref>). It has been demonstrated that both extrinsic signals, such as <italic>Wnts</italic> and <italic>Bmps</italic>, and intrinsic factors, including <italic>Emx1, Emx2, Lef1, Lhx2</italic>, and <italic>Lhx5</italic>, are involved in the regulation of early morphogenesis of the hippocampus. As the earliest <italic>Wnt</italic> gene to be exclusively expressed in the cortical hem, <italic>Wnt3a</italic> is required for the genesis of the hippocampus (S. M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee, Tole, Grove, &amp; McMahon, 2000</xref>); in addition, <italic>Lef1</italic> is downstream of Wnt signaling, and the hippocampus is completely absent in <italic>Lef1-neo/neo</italic> null mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Galceran, Miyashita-Lin, Devaney, Rubenstein, &amp; Grosschedl, 2000</xref>). Wnt signaling is essential for early development of the hippocampus. <italic>Emx1</italic> and <italic>Emx2</italic> are mouse homologs of <italic>Drosophila empty spiracles</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Simeone et al., 1992</xref>). Interestingly, the dorsal hippocampus is smaller in an <italic>Emx1</italic> null mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yoshida et al., 1997</xref>), while <italic>Emx2</italic> is required for the growth of the hippocampus but not for the specification of hippocampal lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tole, Goudreau, Assimacopoulos, &amp; Grove, 2000</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Lhx5</italic>, which encodes a LIM homeobox transcription factor and is specifically expressed in the hippocampal primordium, is necessary for the formation of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhao et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>Lhx2</italic>, encoding another LIM homeobox transcription factor, is required for the development of both the hippocampus and neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mangale et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Monuki, Porter, &amp; Walsh, 2001</xref>). Intriguingly, deficiency of either <italic>Lhx5</italic> or <italic>Lhx2</italic> results in agenesis of the hippocampus, and more particularly, these genes inhibit each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hebert &amp; Fishell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mangale et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Roy, Gonzalez-Gomez, Pierani, Meyer, &amp; Tole, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhao et al., 1999</xref>), indicating that the <italic>Lhx5</italic> and <italic>Lhx2</italic> genes may generate an essential regulatory axis to ensure the appropriate hippocampal development. Nevertheless, whether there are other intrinsic genes that participate in the regulation of morphogenesis and function of the hippocampus has not been fully elucidated.</p>
<p><italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes, including <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> (also known as <italic>NR2F1</italic>) and <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> (also known as <italic>NR2F2</italic>), encode two transcription factor proteins belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yang, Feng, &amp; Tang, 2017</xref>). Mutations of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> are highly related to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), such as intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bertacchi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bosch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Contesse, Ayrault, Mantegazza, Studer, &amp; Deschaux, 2019</xref>), and mutations of the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene are associated with congenital heart defects (CHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">High et al., 2016</xref>). By using animal models, our studies and others have demonstrated that <italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes participate in the regulation of the development of the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). The <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> plays an essential role in the differentiation of cortical excitatory projection neurons and inhibitory interneurons, the development of the dorsal hippocampus, and cortical arealization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Armentano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Flore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lodato et al., 2011</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhou et al., 1999</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zhou, Tsai, &amp; Tsai, 2001</xref>). <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> plays a vital role in the development of the amygdala, hypothalamus, and cerebellum (S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kim, Takamoto, Yan, Tsai, &amp; Tsai, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tang, Rubenstein, Tsai, &amp; Tsai, 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, whether and how <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and/or <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> genes regulate the differentiation and integration of hippocampal morphogenesis, connectivity, and function is still largely unclear.</p>
<p>Here, our data show that <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and -<italic>TFII</italic> genes are differentially expressed along the dorsoventral axis of the adult hippocampus. The loss of <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> results in ectopic CA1 and CA3 domains in the ventral hippocampus. In addition, the deficiency of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> leads to not only dysplasia of the dorsal hippocampus but also failed specification and differentiation of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neuron lineage. Furthermore, the deletion of both genes in the <italic>RXCre</italic>/+; <italic>COUP-TFI</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup>; <italic>COUP-TFII</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup> double mutant mouse causes almost agenesis of the hippocampus, accompanied by compromised specification of the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) domains. The components of the trisynaptic circuit are abnormal in the corresponding single-gene or double-gene mutant model. Moreover, <italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes may cooperate to guarantee the appropriate morphogenesis and function of the hippocampus by regulating the <italic>Lhx5-Lhx2</italic> axis.</p>

<title>Differential expression profiles of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>-TFII</italic> genes along the dorsoventral axis in the developing and adult hippocampus</title>
<p>To investigate the functions of the <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> genes in the hippocampus, immunofluorescence staining was first performed to examine their expression in adult wild-type mice at postnatal month 1 (1M). In both the coronal and sagittal sections, COUP-TFI exhibited a septal/dorsal high-temporal/ventral low expression pattern along the hippocampus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Aa, d, c, f, g, j, m, i, l</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">o</xref>), and its expression is highest in the dorsal CA1 region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Aa, d, c, f, j</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">l</xref>), where place cells are mainly located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">O’Keefe &amp; Conway, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">O’Keefe &amp; Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>), and the dorsal DG, where there are adult neural stem cells (NSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gould &amp; Cameron, 1996</xref>). However, the expression of COUP-TFII was high in the temporal/ventral hippocampus but was barely detected in the septal/dorsal part of the hippocampus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Ab, c, e, f, h, i, k, l, n</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">o</xref>). The dorsal-high COUP-TFI and ventral-high COUP-TFII expression profiles were further verified in the adult hippocampi by western blotting assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Ap, q</xref>). Interestingly, COUP-TFI and -TFII generated complementary expression patterns in the hippocampal primordium with COUP-TFI in the dorsal MP and COUP-TFII in the ventral CH at embryonic days 12.5 (E12.5) and 14.5 (E14.5) (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Aa-f</xref>). Additionally, septal/dorsal-high COUP-TFI and temporal/ventral-high COUP-TFII expression patterns were observed at postnatal day 0 (P0) (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Ag-l</xref>). The data above revealed that the differential expression patterns of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>-TFII</italic> genes were generated and maintained along the dorsoventral axis in the early hippocampal primordium, the developing and adult hippocampus, indicating that they could play distinct roles in the mediation of the morphogenesis and functions of the hippocampus.</p>

<p>Next, to investigate the roles of <italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes in the hippocampus, an <italic>RXCre</italic> mouse was used to excise the expression of the <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and/or <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> genes in the hippocampal regions. The deletion efficiency of <italic>RXCre</italic> recombinase was verified by immunofluorescence assays. Compared with control mice, either <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> or <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> could be excised in the adult hippocampus of corresponding single-gene mutants at 1M (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Ba-i</xref>). In addition, compared with control mice, both the <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>-TFII</italic> genes were almost completely deleted in the hippocampal primordium at E14.5 in mutant mice (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Bj-o</xref>). All the data above show that <italic>RXCre</italic> recombinase could efficiently excise <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and/or <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> in the early developing and adult hippocampus.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>The <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene is required for the appropriate morphogenesis of the ventral hippocampus but not of the dorsal hippocampus</title>
<p>Given that the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene is highly and specifically expressed in the adult ventral hippocampus and the CH of the hippocampal primordium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we asked whether the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene is required for the appropriate morphogenesis of the hippocampus, particularly the ventral hippocampus. To answer this question, we conducted Nissl staining with samples from the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> single-gene (<italic>RXCre/+</italic>; <italic>COUP-TFII</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup> or <italic>RXCre/+</italic>; <italic>CII</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup>) knockout mouse model. In coronal sections, compared with the control at 1M, the septal hippocampus was normal; unexpectedly, an ectopic CA-like region was observed medially in the temporal hippocampus in the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> mutant, where there was the prospected posterior part of the medial amygdaloid nucleus (MeP), indicated by the star (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Ba-f</xref>). The presence of the ectopic CA-like region in the ventral but not dorsal hippocampus of the mutant was further confirmed at the prospected MeP and prospected amygdalohippocampal area (AHi) in sagittal sections, as indicated by the star (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Bg-l</xref>). Furthermore, immunofluorescence assays were performed to verify whether specific lineages of the hippocampus were altered with sagittal sections, in which the subregions of both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus were well displayed and distinguished. Ctip2 is a marker for CA1 pyramidal neurons and DG granule neurons, and HuB is a marker for CA3 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sugiyama, Osumi, &amp; Katsuyama, 2014</xref>). The dorsal hippocampus appeared normal in both the control and mutant mice at 1M (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Ca-l</xref>). Nonetheless, compared with the observations in control mice, an ectopic HuB-positive CA3 pyramidal neuron lineage, indicated by the star, and a duplicated Ctip2-positive CA1 pyramidal neuron lineage, indicated by the arrowhead, were observed in the ventral hippocampal area in the mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Ca-f, m-r</xref>), revealing that there were ectopic CA1 and CA3 lineages in the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>Consistent with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Leid et al., 2004</xref>), the expression of Ctip2 was detected in the amygdala including the AHi and posteromedial cortical amygdaloid nucleus (PMCo); in addition, Ctip2 was also highly expressed in the dorsal part of the MeP (MePD) in the control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Cb, n</xref>).</p>
<p>Intriguingly, compared with the controls at 1M, there were ectopic CA domains in the mutant ventral hippocampus with the expense of the Ctip2 positive AHi and MePD amygdaloid nuclei (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Ce, q</xref>), indicated by the arrows. Clearly, all the data above suggested that the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene is necessary to ensure the appropriate morphogenesis of the ventral hippocampus.</p>
<p>At early embryonic stages, <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> was preferentially expressed in the CH (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1— figure supplement 1Ab,e</xref>), the organizer of the hippocampus, and at the adult stage, <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> was also highly expressed in some amygdala nuclei such as the AHi and medial amygdaloid nucleus, which are adjacent to the ventral/temporal hippocampus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Ae,h,n</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tang et al., 2012</xref>). We would like to investigate the correlation of the CH and/or amygdala anlage with the duplicated ventral hippocampal domains in the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> mutant in detail in our future study. The observations above suggest that <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> is not only specifically expressed in the ventral hippocampus but is also required for morphogenesis and probably the function of the ventral hippocampus. Since the ventral hippocampus participates in the regulation of emotion and stress, mutations in the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene lead to CHDs, and the formation of the ventral hippocampus is disrupted in <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> adult mutant mice, we wondered whether CHD patients with <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> mutations also exhibit symptoms associated with psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia.</p>

Then, we asked whether the loss of the <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> gene caused abnormal specification and differentiation of hippocampal lineages. Compared with the control mice, <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> mutant mice had fewer HuB-positive CA3 pyramidal neurons, as indicated by the star; intriguingly, Ctip2-positive CA1 pyramidal neurons failed to be detected, as indicated by the arrowhead, with Ctip2-positive DG granule neurons unaltered in the dorsal hippocampus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2Ba-l</xref>). The loss of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neuron identity in mutant mice was further confirmed by Wfs1, another dorsal CA1 pyramidal neuron-specific marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Takeda et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2Ca-r</xref>).

To answer this question, immunofluorescence staining was conducted first.

To make our findings more consistent with previous studies, we further conducted experiments with the <italic>Emx1Cre</italic> model. Afterward, to investigate the fine structure of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons, Golgi staining was performed. Compared with those of control mice, the numbers of secondary dendrites and branch points of both the apical and basal dendrites were significantly reduced in the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons of mutant mice at 3M (<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2— figure supplement 1Ba-e</xref>). Then, the dorsal hippocampus-related spatial learning and memory behavior test, the Morris water maze, was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Vorhees &amp; Williams, 2006</xref>).

<title>The <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>-TFII</italic> genes coordinate to ensure the genesis of the hippocampus</title>
<p>Given that the loss of either <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> or <italic>-TFII</italic> leads to dysplasia of the dorsal or ventral hippocampus, respectively, we asked whether these genes compensate for each other to regulate the morphogenesis of the hippocampus.

Nonetheless, the reason for the lethality of the double-mutant mice is still unknown. Nissl staining data showed that compared with that of control mice, the septal hippocampus was severely shrunken, as indicated by the star, and the temporal hippocampus was barely observed in the double-mutant mouse brains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3Aa-h</xref>). Unexpectedly, an ectopic nucleus was observed in the region of the prospected temporal hippocampus, indicated by the arrowhead, in the double-mutant mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3Ag, h</xref>). In addition, compared with those of controls, the regions with HuB-positive CA3 pyramidal neurons and Ctip2-positive or Prox1-positive DG granule neurons were diminished in the double mutants; in particular, Ctip2-positive dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons could not be detected in the double mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3Ba-l</xref>).

To answer this question, the components of the trisynaptic circuit were characterized in the ventral hippocampus of <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> mutants, the dorsal hippocampus of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> mutants, and the septal hippocampus of double mutants. Calretinin is a marker of mossy cells, Calbindin is a marker of mossy fibers, and SMI312 is a marker of Schafer collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Flore et al., 2017</xref>). Compared with those of controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Aa, b, e, f, i</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">j</xref>), the numbers of Calretinin-positive mossy cells were reduced, Calbindin-positive mossy fibers were longer but thinner, and SMI312-positive Schafer collaterals were thinner and discontinued in the ventral hippocampus of <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> mutants at 1M (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Ac, d, g, h, k</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">l</xref>). In addition, similar to the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Flore et al., 2017</xref>), the numbers of Calretinin-positive mossy cells were decreased, Calbindin-positive mossy fibers were shorter and thinner, and SMI312-positive Schafer collaterals were barely detected in the dorsal hippocampus of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Ac, d, g, h, k</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">l</xref>), compared with those of controls at 1M (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Ba, b, e, f, i</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">j</xref>).

<title>The expression of several essential regulatory genes associated with early hippocampal development was abnormal in double mutants</title>
<p>Given that the hippocampus was almost completely diminished in double mutants, we asked how <italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes participated in the regulation of the early morphogenesis of the hippocampus.

<p>Next, we asked whether neural precursor cells (NPCs), intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs), or newborn neurons were affected in the early development of the hippocampus in double-mutant mice. Sox2 is a marker for NPCs, Tbr2 is a marker for IPCs, and NeuroD1 is a marker for newborn neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Yu, Marchetto, &amp; Gage, 2014</xref>).

Furthermore, the deficiency of both <italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes caused atrophy of almost the entire hippocampus, accompanied by compromised generation of the CA1, CA3, and DG identities. In addition, the dorsal trisynaptic components, ventral trisynaptic components, or entire trisynaptic components were abolished in the corresponding <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> gene mutant, <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene mutant, or <italic>COUP-TFI</italic>/<italic>-TFII</italic> double-gene mutant mice.

<title><italic>COUP-TFII</italic> governs the distinct characteristics of the ventral hippocampus</title>
<p>Sixty years ago, the pioneering work of Milner and her colleagues discovered the essential role of the hippocampus in declarative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Penfield &amp; Milner, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scoville &amp; Milner, 1957</xref>). Recently, accumulating evidence has supported the Moser theory that the hippocampus is a heterogeneous structure with distinct characteristics of gene expression, connectivity, and function along its dorsoventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bast, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fanselow &amp; Dong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Moser &amp; Moser, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Strange et al., 2014</xref>). The dorsal hippocampus marked in blue, in which gene expression is similar to the neocortex, serves the “cold” cognitive function associated with declarative memory and spatial navigation, and the ventral hippocampus marked in red, in which gene expression is close to the hypothalamus and amygdala, corresponds to the “hot” affective states related to emotion and anxiety (<xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The ventral hippocampus generates direct connectivity with the amygdala, hypothalamus, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cenquizca &amp; Swanson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hoover &amp; Vertes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kishi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pitkanen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Roberts et al., 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, thus far, the molecular and cellular mechanism of how the morphogenesis, connectivity, and function of the ventral hippocampus is achieved has been largely unclear.</p>
<p><italic>COUP-TFII</italic>, a nuclear receptor gene associated with heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">High et al., 2016</xref>), was highly and exclusively expressed in the ventral hippocampus in adult mice and was expressed ventrally in the CH of the hippocampal primordium in mouse embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1— figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Ea</xref>), indicating that the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene may participate in the regulation of the development and function of the ventral hippocampus. First, deficiency of the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene led to the duplication of the CA1 and CA3 domains of the ventral hippocampus but not the dorsal hippocampus, which was confirmed both morphologically and molecularly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Second, the formation of the trisynaptic circuit was specifically abolished in the ventral hippocampus of <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), indicating that the intrahippocampal circuit, information transfer, and function of the ventral hippocampus could be compromised. Third, the ventral hippocampus generates neural circuits with the mPFC, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and hypothalamus, which are associated with anxiety/behavioral inhibition, fear processing, pleasure/reward seeking, and the neuroendocrine system, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anacker &amp; Hen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baik, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bryant &amp; Barker, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cenquizca &amp; Swanson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Herman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kishi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">O’Leary &amp; Cryan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pitkanen et al., 2000</xref>). These ventral hippocampal projections may be important for processing information related to emotion and anxiety. Intriguingly, our previous studies revealed that <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> is required for the development of the hypothalamus, amygdala, and olfactory bulb (S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tang et al., 2012</xref>; X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), all of which generate functional neural circuits with the ventral hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fanselow &amp; Dong, 2010</xref>). Particularly, both the hypothalamus and amygdala are also diminished in <italic>RXCre/+</italic>; <italic>COUP-TFII</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup> mutant mice (S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tang et al., 2012</xref>), indicating that their interconnectivities with the ventral hippocampus are abnormal. Thus, all the findings above suggest that <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> is a novel and essential intrinsic regulator that controls the morphogenesis, connectivity, and function of the ventral hippocampus.</p>
<p>Given that mutations of <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> are highly associated with CHDs and are required for the distinct characteristics of the ventral hippocampus, we wondered whether CHD patients carrying mutations of <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> also display symptoms of psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia, related to the ventral hippocampus. In our future study, we would like to generate hippocampus-specific or hippocampal subdomain-specific conditional knockout models to dissect distinct roles of the <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> gene in the hippocampus, particularly in the ventral hippocampus, in detail.</p>

<title>The <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> gene is required for the specification and differentiation of dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons</title>
<p>The expression of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic>, another orphan nuclear receptor gene associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bertacchi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bosch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Contesse et al., 2019</xref>), is high in the dorsal MP of the hippocampal primordium and is higher in the dorsal hippocampus than in the ventral hippocampus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Ea</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Flore et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with previous observations in <italic>Emx1Cre/+</italic>; <italic>COUP-TFI</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Flore et al., 2017</xref>), the dorsal hippocampus but not the ventral hippocampus was specifically shrunken in <italic>RXCre/+; COUP-TFI</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> is expressed at the highest level in dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), indicating that the <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> gene may play a role in the specification and differentiation of dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons. As expected, the expression of Ctip2 and Wfs1, two markers for dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons, could not be detected in the prospected dorsal CA1 domain in <italic>RXCre/+</italic>; <italic>COUP-TFI</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup> mutant mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>); furthermore, <italic>Emx1Cre/+</italic>; <italic>COUP-TFI</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup> mutant mice partially phenocopied the compromised development of the dorsal CA1 lineage (<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). It seems that the spatiotemporal activity of RXCre recombinase is better or broader than that of the Emx1Cre recombinase during the critical period of the specification of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neuron identity. In addition, the Golgi staining assay revealed that the development of the dendrites of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons was abnormal (<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2— figure supplement 1</xref>). All the observations above indicate that the <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> gene is not only necessary for the morphogenesis of the dorsal hippocampus but is also required for the specification and differentiation of the dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons, among which there are place cells. The identification of place cells fifty years ago was one of the most important breakthroughs to understand the memory and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">O’Keefe &amp; Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>). Except for spatial information, place cells in the dorsal CA1 may also encode nonspatial representations, such as time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Eichenbaum, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lisman et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, 95% of patients carrying <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> mutations are associated with ID. Here, our observations support the notion that the <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> gene is a novel intrinsic regulator that specifies the dorsal CA1 pyramidal cell identity, which will benefit the understanding of both neurophysiological functions of the hippocampus and the etiology of NDD including ID and ASD.</p>

<title><italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>-TFII</italic> cooperate to ensure the appropriate morphogenesis of the hippocampus by regulating the <italic>Lhx5</italic>-<italic>Lhx2</italic> axis in mice</title>
<p>In wild-type mice, <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>-TFII</italic> genes generated complementary expression profiles in the embryonic hippocampal primordium with <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> in the dorsal MP, marked in green; <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> in the ventral CH, marked in red (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Ea</xref>, <xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>); and in the adult hippocampus with high-COUP-TFI expression in the dorsal, marked in green; and high-COUP-TFII expression in the ventral, marked in red (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Ea</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). These findings indicated that <italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes may coordinate to regulate hippocampal development. Indeed, as discussed above, the loss of either <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> or <italic>-TFII</italic> only leads to dysplasia of the dorsal hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Flore et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2— figure supplement 1</xref>) or ventral hippocampus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), respectively; intriguingly, while both genes are efficiently excised by <italic>RXCre</italic> in the hippocampal primordium (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1— figure supplement 1</xref>), more severely shrunken hippocampi developed in the adult double knockout mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The dosage-dependent severity of hippocampal abnormalities suggested that two nuclear receptor genes, <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>-TFII</italic> could cooperate with each other to execute an imperative and intrinsic function in the development of the hippocampus. It is known that both extrinsic signals and intrinsic factors participate in the regulation of the early development of the hippocampus. Notably, mutations of <italic>Wnt3a</italic> and <italic>Lef1</italic> eliminate the entire hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Galceran et al., 2000</xref>; S. M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee et al., 2000</xref>). Given that the expression of <italic>Axin2, Lef1</italic> and <italic>Tcf4</italic>, three Wnt-responsive transcription factor genes, was not altered in the <italic>COUP-TF</italic> double mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), it is unlikely that abnormal Wnt signaling is the cause of the compromised hippocampus. <italic>Lhx5</italic> is specifically expressed in the hippocampal primordium and is required for the morphogenesis of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhao et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>Lhx2</italic> is necessary for hippocampal development by repressing cortical hem fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mangale et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Monuki et al., 2001</xref>). Agenesis of the hippocampus is observed in either <italic>Lhx5</italic> or <italic>Lhx2</italic> null mutant mice, and these genes particularly repress each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hebert &amp; Fishell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mangale et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Roy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhao et al., 1999</xref>), indicating that the proper expression levels of <italic>Lhx5</italic> and <italic>Lhx2</italic> genes are imperative to maintain the appropriate development of the hippocampus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Eb</xref>). The transcriptional expression of <italic>Lhx5</italic> but not <italic>Lhx2</italic> was reduced in <italic>COUP-TF</italic> double-mutant mice at E11.5, and three days later, decreased expression of the Lhx5 protein and enhanced expression of the Lhx2 protein were detected in the hippocampal primordium of double-mutant mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref>). In addition, consistent with the observations in the <italic>Lhx5</italic> null mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Miquelajáuregui et al., 2010</xref>), the generation of Sox2-positive hippocampal NPCs was not affected, but the development of Tbr2-positive IPCs and NeuroD1-positive newborn neurons was abnormal in <italic>COUP-TF</italic> double-mutant mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, our findings reveal a novel intrinsic regulatory mechanism that <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and <italic>COUP-TFII</italic>, two disease-associated nuclear receptor genes, may cooperate with each other to ensure proper hippocampal morphogenesis by regulating the <italic>Lhx5-Lhx2</italic> axis. Intriguingly, compared with the adult <italic>Emx1Cre/+</italic>; <italic>COUP-TFI</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup> mutant mice, the hippocampus was much smaller in the adult <italic>Emx1Cre/+</italic>; <italic>COUP-TFI</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup>; <italic>COUP-TFII</italic><sup><italic>F/F</italic></sup> double-gene mutant mice; nevertheless, both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus were readily detected in double-gene mutants with <italic>Emx1Cre</italic> (our unpublished observations). In addition, the discrepancy between the shrunken dorsal hippocampus associated with the loss of <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and the duplicated CA domains of the ventral hippocampus associated with the deficiency of <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> suggested that the regulatory network related to <italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes during the early morphogenesis of the hippocampus could be much more complicated than suspected and should be investigated in our future study.</p>

<title><italic>COUP-TF</italic> genes are imperative for the formation of the trisynaptic circuit</title>
<p>The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) are interconnected through various neural circuits to mediate the flow of the information associated with declarative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Basu &amp; Siegelbaum, 2015</xref>). Both direct and indirect glutamatergic circuits are involved in the relay of information from the EC to the hippocampal CA1, and the trisynaptic pathway is the most well-characterized indirect circuit. The EC sends sensory signals from association cortices via the perforant path to the DG, then the DG granule cells send excitatory mossy fiber projections to CA3 pyramidal neurons, and CA3 pyramidal neurons project to CA1 via the Schaffer collaterals (H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lee, GoodSmith, &amp; Knierim, 2020</xref>). Consistent with the high expression of COUP-TFI in the dorsal hippocampus and COUP-TFII in the ventral hippocampus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), the dorsal trisynaptic circuit is specifically damaged in <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> mutants, as is the ventral trisynaptic circuit in <italic>COUP-TFII</italic> mutant mice. Moreover, the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit was almost completely absent in the double mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, and our unpublished observations). The information transfer associated with the trisynaptic circuits should be abolished particularly in the dorsal and/or the ventral hippocampus in the above corresponding genetic mouse models. Interestingly, <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> is also required to specify the medial EC cell fate (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the impaired formation and function of trisynaptic circuits could be caused by the abnormal development of CA1, CA3, DG or EC lineages. Nonetheless, given that newborn granule neurons are continuously generated in the adult DG to integrate into the existing neural circuits essential for declarative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Toda, Parylak, Linker, &amp; Gage, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tuncdemir, Lacefield, &amp; Hen, 2019</xref>) and that hippocampal adult neurogenesis was severely compromised in the <italic>COUP-TF</italic> double mutant (<xref rid="fig3S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we could not exclude the possibility that impaired adult neurogenesis may also contribute to the malformation and impaired function of the trisynaptic pathway in double mutants.</p>
<p>The hippocampus is heterogeneous along its dorsoventral axis, and either the dorsal or ventral hippocampus generates unique and distinguishable characteristics of gene expression and connectivity, which enable the hippocampus to execute an integrative function from the encoding and retrieval of certain declarative memory to adaptive behaviors. Lesions of the dorsal hippocampus, which are essential for the cognitive process of learning and memory, lead to amnesia and ID; while damage to the ventral hippocampus, which is imperative for emotion and affection, is highly associated with psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Our findings in this study reveal novel intrinsic mechanisms by which two nuclear receptor genes, <italic>COUP-TFI</italic> and -<italic>TFII</italic>, which are associated with NDD or CHD, converge to govern the differentiation and integration of the hippocampus along the dorsoventral axis morphologically and functionally. Furthermore, our present study provides novel genetic model systems to investigate the crosstalk among the hippocampal complex in gene expression, morphogenesis, cell fate specification and differentiation, connectivity, functions of learning/memory and emotion/anxiety, adaptive behaviors, and the etiology of neurological diseases. Nevertheless, many enigmas, such as whether and how the abnormalities of either the dorsal or ventral hippocampus affect the characteristics of the other, remain unsolved. In addition to the excitatory lineages and circuits, interneurons and inhibitory circuits play vital roles in maintaining the plasticity and functions of the hippocampus. We also wonder whether and how defects in interneurons and inhibitory circuits could contribute to the compromised morphogenesis, connectivity, and functions of the hippocampus and the etiology of psychiatric and neurological conditions including ID, ASD, depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.</p>

<p>By recording the time spent by the mice swimming in the water tank and finding the escape platform hidden underwater, and the swimming trajectory, the Morris water maze test can objectively reflect the spatial learning and memory ability of the mice. We poured tap water into the water maze tank and added an appropriate amount of milky white food dye that was mixed well. The height of the liquid level was about 1 cm higher than the escape platform, and the water temperature was kept at about 25±1°C. At the same time, four markers of different shapes were pasted on the four directions of the inner wall above the water tank to distinguish different directions. The Morris water maze test was divided into the training phase and the probe trial phase. The training phase lasted for 6 days, 4 times a day, and the interval between each training was about 30 minutes. During training, the mice were placed into the tank from the entry points of four different quadrants facing the inner wall, and their latency was recorded from the time from entering the water to finding a hidden underwater platform and standing on it. After the mouse found the platform, let it stay on the platform for 10 seconds before removing it. If the mouse failed to discover the platform 60 seconds after entering the water, it was guided to find the platform and stayed for 10 seconds. Each mouse was placed into the water tank from four water entry points and recorded as one training session. The probe trial was carried out on the seventh day and the underwater platform was removed. Each experimental mouse was put into the water tank at the same water entry point, and allowed to move for 60 seconds.

A student’s t-test was used to compare the means of the relative mRNA levels between the control group and mutant group.

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>The number of specified immunofluorescent marker-positive cells was assessed by Image J Cell Counter in full image fields. Three brain sections per mouse were counted for each index. GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad) was used to perform statistical analysis. The data analysis used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Dunnett’s or Tukey’s post hoc tests, and student’s unpaired t-test. The data were expressed as the mean ± SEM. The data obtained from at least three independent replicates were used for statistical analysis. P&lt; 0.05 was considered the significant statistical difference.</p>

<p>This paper demonstrates <bold>valuable</bold> evidence for genetic redundancy of the COUPTF transcription factors in hippocampal development by creating conditional compound knockouts in combination. Authors aim to demonstrate specific and complementary roles of the two COUPTF homologues. The paper uses <bold>convincing</bold> methods that includes both anatomic and behavioral studies for the roles of these factors. However, the strength of evidence was <bold>incomplete</bold>, due to the use of a Cre line that was not adequately described, and lack of concordance with expression domains of the COUPTF factors with the published literature dampened enthusiasm. This concern is expressed by reviewers in the interpretation of some of the finding that may require additional experiments in the future.</p>

<p>The hippocampus is a structure in the cerebral cortex known to be compartmentalised into regions with different functions. Dorsal hippocampus is involved in cognitive functions such as declarative memory and spatial navigation and interconnects chiefly with the neocortex. Ventral hippocampus interconnects with limbic structures such as amygdala and hypothalamus and is involved in affective states and anxiety. What specifies this functional regionalisation during development is not well understood. The present study focuses on the role of transcription factors COUPTFI and COUPTFII, confirming a previously observed dorsal to ventral gradient of expression of COUPTFI in both embryonic and adult mouse hippocampus, and reporting that expression of COUPTFII is strongest in ventral hippocampus. The aim of the authors was then to probe the role of these transcription factors with the use of conditional knockout of one or both factors using RxCre+ mice (sometimes Emx1Cre+ for comparison). As predicted, COUPTFI insufficiency resulted in failure of the CA1 subregion of the dorsal hippocampus to develop properly (with concomitant loss of performance in a spatial memory task) COUPTFII knockdown had even more marked effects upon the ventral hippocampus with ectopic CA1/CA3 domains forming, while a double knockout lead to a drastic reduction in size of the hippocampus with subsequent effects upon the appearance of hippocampal synaptic circuitry and the capacity for adult neurogenesis (a feature of rodent hippocampus). In order to help explain the role of COUPTFI/II a role in regulating expression of two transcription factors LHX2 and LHX5, known to be crucial to hippocampal development, was tested by examining gene and protein expression. Changes in LHX2 and LHX5 was observed and a role for COUPTFI/II in regulating expression of these genes was postulated.</p>
<p>I believe the authors have largely achieved their aims and the results mostly support the conclusions, but, as discussed further below, there are some weaknesses in the data and some areas that could be expanded upon and improved. The methods are mostly appropriate. The use of the transgenic mice and the application of histological methods, especially tyramide amplified immunohistochemistry, is exemplary. However, I'm not sure a wide enough range of tests to explore the phenotype of the transgenic mice was employed to back the conclusions drawn by the authors. The introduction and discussion are nicely written and explain the general concepts and conclusions well. The work makes an important contribution to our understanding of brain development in general and hippocampal development in particular.</p>
<p>Turning to more specific comments, I must first point out that specification of the ventral hippocampus by expression of COUPTFII is not an entirely original finding, as it was suggested for the developing human hippocampus following immunohistochemical experiments illustrating COUPTFII expression to be confined to the ventral hippocampal structures of the medial temporal cortex (doi: 10.1093/cercor/bhx185). Of course, this study, unlike the present study, was restricted to fetal cortex, not adult, and also reported expression of COUP-TFI throughout dorsal and ventral hippocampal structures but without observing any dorsal to ventral gradient, however I feel its contribution to the field has been overlooked by the present study, and should be incorporated into the introduction and/or discussion.</p>
<p>More information about Rx-cre mice would be informative and could help explain the different phenotype observed when EMX1-cre mice were used to conditionally knock down COUPTFI/II expression.</p>
<p>The demonstration of antagonistic gradients of COUP-TFI and -TFII across the hippocampus is more convincing in the immunohistochemical preparations than in the western blots. The qualitative data presented in Fig.1p does not convincingly represent the quantitative data presented in Fig.1q. There seem to be multiple bands for COUP-TFII and I wonder exactly how quantifying this was approached?</p>
<p>Behavioural testing is limited to one test of dorsal hippocampus function. other tests for non-spatial memory, e.g. novel object recognition, or ventral hippocampus function, e.g. step through passive avoidance, might have lead to some interesting discriminations between the various knock down animals (see doi: 10.3389/fnagi.2018.00091).</p>
<p>Abnormalities in the trisynaptic circuit. No studies of actual synapses, either physiological or morphological, were carried out. I wonder to what extent these immunohistochemical studies just further reflect the abnormalities in hippocampal morphology presented earlier in the manuscript without specifically telling us about synaptic circuits? Although the immunohistochemical preparations are beautiful, they are inadequate on their own in telling us much about what sort of synaptic circuitry exists in the transgenic animals.</p>
<p>LHX2/LHX5 interaction. The immunohistochemical study, which shows clear differences in LHX5 and LHX2 protein expression at E14.5 in double knockdown mice is more convincing than the qPCR study at E11.5, which show surprisingly small differences in mRNA expression. Could the authors expand upon whether this is due to stage of development, or differences between mRNA and protein expression? Why hasn't both mRNA and protein expression data at both time points been presented?</p>

<p>The authors Yang et al., examine the role of NR2F1/COUPTFI and NR2F2/COUPTF2 genes in hippocampus (HP) development, using two Cre lines, RxCre, and Emx1Cre. They report that loss of COUPTFI leads to a defective specification of dorsal CA1; loss of COUPTF2 leads to defects in the morphogenesis of the ventral HP with some ectopic CA field domains; loss of both results in a greatly shrunken hippocampus.</p>
<p>While the phenotypes are indeed interesting and important to examine carefully, there are major lacunae in (A) the authors' interpretation of the literature that sets up the problem (B) the data itself and the experimental design (C) the interpretation of the data. These are detailed below.</p>
<p>[A] Interpretation of the literature</p>
<p>
A1: The author's interpretation of the Lhx5 mutant phenotype (line 74-76) missed the fact that the hem appears to be missing or greatly reduced (Zhao et al., 1999; Figure 4D,I; Miquelajáuregui et al., 2010 Figure 5). If the hem is deficient, shrinkage/ agenesis of hippocampus is not surprising. It is incorrect to conclude that Lhx5 has a role in the hippocampal primordium, not only because of the above, but also because Lhx5 expression has been well characterized to be limited to the early hem and CR cells, but is not known to be expressed in the hippocampal primordium. The immunohistochemistry data in Figure 5B showing Lhx5 presence in the vz of the hippocampal and neocortical primordium is perplexing and not what other studies in the literature show for this gene. This is a major point because &quot;regulation of the Lhx2-Lhx5 axis&quot; is one of the main conclusions of the study.</p>
<p>A2: The Lhx2&lt;-&gt;Lhx5 inhibition is pitched as a mechanism, but there's no evidence in the literature for this nor in this study. Lines 78-79 &quot;Intriguingly, deficiency of either Lhx5 or Lhx2 results in agenesis of the hippocampus, and more particularly, these genes inhibit each other&quot; are an incorrect interpretation of the literature. The &quot;agenesis&quot; of the hippocampus in the Lhx5 mutant (Zhao et al., 1999) is likely to be because the hem is deficient (point A1 above). The Lhx2 mutant lacks a hippocampus (and neocortex) because the entire dorsal telencephalon has transformed into hem and antihem (Mangale et al., 2008). To cite this as &quot;agenesis of the hippocampus&quot; as originally described by Porter et al (1997) misinterprets a complex stepwise process that was elucidated subsequently in the literature.</p>
<p>Finally, it has not been shown that Lhx2 and Lhx5 inhibit each other- the literature cited does not contain this information. The phenotype reported by the authors may actually have a basis in the effect of loss of COUPTFI/ II on the hem, and a rostro-caudal variation in this effect (or in the timing of action of the Cre lines used) may explain the phenotype.</p>
<p>Problems in the experimental design:</p>

B1: What is the expression domain and timing of RxCre? If it has a dorso-ventral bias in the early embryo, it could explain the regional difference in the COUPTF phenotypes. The authors must show the domain of Cre activation using an Ai9 reporter at E10.5-E11.5 and also at later embryonic stages to be able to interpret whether the shrunken hippocampal phenotype in the single and double mutants is a due to a defect in induction (from the hem), specification (in the early hippocampal primordium), or growth and maintenance (at later embryonic/ postnatal stages). A related point is whether COUPTFI expressed in the hem at E10.5-E11.5, since the earliest age shown is E14.5 which does show expression in the hem; likewise COUPTFII is shown to be expressed in the hem at E12.5. Emx1Cre acts in the hem and therefore the phenotypes could be partially explained by a deficit in the hem itself. Where RxCre acts is not shown and nor is it cited and the logic of shifting between RxCre and Emx1Cre is not clear. A comparison of the expression domains of these lines at relevant early and late embryonic ages is important.</p>

Line 187: &quot;We would like to investigate the correlation of the CH and/or amygdala anlage with the duplicated ventral hippocampal domains in the COUP-TFII mutant in detail in our future study.&quot;</p>
<p>
This is inadequate, the effect of the mutation on the cortical hem may be central to the hippocampal phenotype and therefore is central to this study. Ectopic CA fields arising in unexpected places is a finding that needs an explanation, this is not a mere morphogenesis issue as implied in line 190.</p>
<p>B3: Questionable immunofluoresence data: Figure 5B panel h shows that Lhx2 expression extends into the region of the hem at E14.5, suggesting that the hem may in fact not have been specified in the first place. However, the choroid plexus appears to be LHX2 positive in the same image, which it isn't supposed to be, and this calls into question the quality and specificity of the immunofluoresence data. LHX5 staining in Figure 5B panel has been mentioned in point A1- it does not reflect the known expression pattern of this gene (Allen Brain atlas, Zhao et al., 2009). SOX2 also shouldn't be seen in the choroid plexus.</p>
<p>[C] Interpretation of the data</p>
<p>
C1: In the COUPTFII mutant, the ectopic presence of HuB+ve cells is intriguing, however it is a stretch to conclude that these cells are born at the expense of CTIP2+ve cells (line 179) without experiments that examine this point.</p>
<p>C2: Line 251: &quot;Unexpectedly, an ectopic nucleus was observed in the region of the prospected temporal hippocampus, indicated by the arrowhead, in the double-mutant mice (Figure 3Ag, h)&quot;</p>
<p>
These data are unclear and difficult to appreciate.</p>
<p>C3: The hippocampus is shrunken in the double mutants but the underlying cause has not been examined from the perspective of early cell cycle exit or cell death. How does the reduction of Tbr2+ and NeuroD1+ cells speak to the hippocampal defect? (Figure 5)</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Yang et al. showed that two nuclear receptor genes, COUP-TFI and -TFII, displayed distinct expression patterns and functions during the development of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. The phenotypes in the presented single and double conditional knockout mice are striking and intriguing, which expands our knowledge of hippocampus development, especially the ventral part. Nevertheless, the manuscript is a bit descriptive without in-depth molecular mechanisms.</p>
<p>My major concerns as follows:</p>
<p>1. Quantification and statistical analysis to support their conclusions are almost absent throughout the whole manuscript, especially in relation to the numbers of DG, CA1, and CA3 neurons.</p>
<p>
2. Only TFI conditional knockout mice, not TFII knockout mice, were used to test for behavioral abnormalities. It is important to determine whether the abnormal ventral hippocampus in TFII loss leads to any psychiatric illness.</p>
<p>
3. Behavior defects were only tested on TFI conditional knockout mice but not on TFII knockout mice. TFII loss predominantly affects the ventral hippocampus which is involved in psychiatric disorders, and this should be tested.</p>
