<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Relevance-based selectivity and high energy cost are two distinct features of long-term memory (LTM) formation that warrant its default inhibition. Spaced repetition of learning is a highly conserved cognitive mechanism that can lift this inhibition. Here, we questioned how the spacing effect integrates experience selection and energy efficiency at the cellular and molecular levels. We showed in Drosophila that spaced training triggers LTM formation by extending over several hours an increased mitochondrial metabolic activity in neurons of the associative memory center, the mushroom bodies (MBs). We found that this effect is mediated by PKCδ, a member of the so-called ‘novel PKC’ family of enzymes, which uncovers the critical function of PKCδ in neurons as a regulator of mitochondrial metabolism for LTM. Additionally, PKCδ activation and translocation to mitochondria result from LTM-specific dopamine signaling on MB neurons. By bridging experience-dependent neuronal circuit activity with metabolic modulation of memory-encoding neurons, PKCδ signaling binds the cognitive and metabolic constraints underlying LTM formation into a unified gating mechanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Long-term memory (LTM) is a fundamental cognitive process that allows organisms to efficiently retain and retrieve information over extended (and sometimes lifelong) periods of time. Since the long-term retention of fortuitous or poorly relevant associations can drive maladaptive behavior, the triage of learning experiences and routing to LTM has to be tightly gatekept. As a result of this cognitive constraint, brains have evolved mechanisms for the default inhibition of LTM formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Scheunemann et al., 2018</xref>). Under certain circumstances, LTM inhibition is lifted in a process known as LTM gating. Defective gating in either direction is expected to cause memorization deficits or (on the contrary) hypermnesia, with both conditions leading to a severe deterioration in the quality of life. It is therefore crucial to decipher the underlying mechanisms behind this precisely regulated process. One of the most conserved conditions known to potently lift the default inhibition of LTM formation is the spaced repetition of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Shaughnessy, 1977</xref>), which has been reported in a number of species from <italic>Aplysia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sutton et al., 2002</xref>), <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nishijima and Maruyama, 2017</xref>) and Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Tully et al., 1994</xref>) to mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Glas et al., 2021</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Shaughnessy, 1977</xref>). This phenomenon is called the spacing effect, in contrast with intensive learning (or cramming), in which massed presentation of information leads to the formation of a less persistent form of consolidated memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Shaughnessy, 1977</xref>). Studies in animal models, in particular in fruit flies using an associative aversive olfactory paradigm, demonstrated that LTM formation following spaced training exerts a significant energetic burden on organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mery and Kawecki, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Padamsey and Rochefort, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Plaçais and Preat, 2013</xref>). Following the paired delivery of an odorant with electric shocks, flies show learned avoidance of this odorant for a couple hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Quinn et al., 1974</xref>). Whereas spaced repetition of odor/shock pairing allows sustained retention (up to one week) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bouzaiane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Heisenberg, 2003</xref>), massed training results in the rapid decline (1-2 days) of the formed memory, which provides a powerful, experimentally tractable way to model the spacing effect versus cramming. Strikingly, in the hours following spaced training in fruit flies, their sucrose intake is observed to increase by over twofold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>), which does not occur after massed training. In addition, spaced, but not massed, training decreases the survival duration of flies under conditions of limited resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Plaçais and Preat, 2013</xref>). These observations reveal a major impact of LTM formation on the energy balance of the whole organism, with this metabolic constraint being an additional incentive for the default inhibition of LTM formation. Interestingly, the recent finding that cellular energy fluxes are involved in the control of LTM formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>) suggests that both cognitive and metabolic constraints linked with LTM formation may be merged in a unitary, cost-effective gating process. Indeed, we previously showed that the upregulation of mitochondrial metabolic activity in neurons of the mushroom bodies (MB), the insect brain’s memory center, in the first hours following spaced training is critical to initiating LTM formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>). This upregulation of mitochondrial metabolism depends on post-learning dopamine signaling from a specific pair of MB-afferent neurons, called MP1 neurons (or PPL1-γ1pedc neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aso et al., 2014</xref>)), which show sustained calcium rhythmic activity in the same time windows encompassing the first hours after spaced training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Plaçais et al., 2012</xref>). MP1 activates MB mitochondrial activity via the DAMB receptor (also named Dop1R2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>). The putative interdependence of cognitive and metabolic constraints, two sides of the same coin, therefore calls for the identification of the neuronal molecular gatekeeper at the core of the spacing effect, linking neuronal network activity and mitochondrial energy metabolism.</p>
<p>The G-protein-coupled receptor DAMB preferentially engages with Gq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cassar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Himmelreich et al., 2017</xref>), which signals via the second messengers DAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mizuno and Itoh, 2009</xref>) and calcium, two canonical activators of the broad family of PKC enzymes. One particular PKC isoform, PKCδ, that belongs to the ‘novel’ PKC class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Duquesnes et al., 2011</xref>) exclusively regulated by DAG but not calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Duquesnes et al., 2011</xref>), shows unique properties that make it a candidate of particular interest. In non-neuronal mammalian cells, it was shown that PKCδ can translocate to mitochondria upon its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wu-zhang et al., 2012</xref>), where it specifically localizes to the intermembrane space. There, PKCδ is able to activate oxidative metabolism by targeting the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Acin-Perez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim and Hammerling, 2020</xref>), which catalyzes the first step of pyruvate metabolism for oxidative phosphorylation. Despite this evidence, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of PKCδ translocation to mitochondria upon activation, and how it interfaces with extracellular signals, remains poorly understood. Although PKCδ expression is commonly used to identify specific neurons in the mammalian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dilly et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Haubensak et al., 2010</xref>; Wang et al., 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Williford et al., 2023</xref>), the functional role of PKCδ in brain tissues has remained thus far largely unexplored. Nonetheless, the putative ability of PKCδ to act as the interface between Gq-mediated activation and metabolic activity control prompted us to study this kinase as the missing piece in the puzzle of LTM gating that could bridge dopaminergic activation and neuronal mitochondrial metabolism.</p>
<p>We first uncovered that PKCδ activation is required in MB neurons for LTM formation through behavior experiments involving targeted genetic inhibition of PKCδ and <italic>in vivo</italic> functional brain imaging using a specific sensor of PKCδ activity, δCKAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kajimoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wu-zhang et al., 2012</xref>), which we introduced in Drosophila. We further showed that PKCδ is a downstream effector of DAMB and that its translocation to the mitochondria is triggered upon LTM formation by MP1/DAMB signaling. Employing <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of cellular pyruvate consumption, we showed that PKCδ intervenes in LTM formation through its metabolic role as a mitochondrial activator, by releasing the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex inhibition. We therefore revealed that a major effect of spaced training is to mobilize the DAMB/PKCδ signaling cascade in order to perpetuate for several hours a neuronal metabolic enhancement that only transiently occurs after a single learning session. Overall, our data establish PKCδ as an essential activator of neuronal pyruvate mitochondrial metabolism that mediates the spacing effect on memory consolidation.</p>

<title>PKCδ is required in MB neurons for LTM formation</title>
<p>To investigate the role of PKCδ in memory, we downregulated PKCδ expression at the adult stage in the MB neurons (see schematic in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and assessed memory formed using different protocols of aversive olfactory conditioning. These different protocols include the single association between an odor and shocks (1x conditioning), which elicits a short-lived memory that will rapidly decay after a few hours; 5 spaced cycles of conditioning with 15 min of rest intervals (5x spaced), which induces LTM; and 5 massed presentations without pauses (5x massed), which leads to the formation of a less robust, cramming-like type of memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bouzaiane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Heisenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Tully et al., 1994</xref>). To spatially and temporally restrict PKCδ RNAi expression, we took advantage of the VT30559-Gal4 MB driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>) combined with the ubiquitously expressed thermosensitive Gal4 inhibitor tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">McGuire et al., 2003</xref>). This system allows inducing RNAi expression in the MBs of adult flies, by transferring them at 30°C two days before conditioning. This protocol successfully decreased the whole-head PKCδ mRNA level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), thereby revealing PKCδ expression in MB neurons. When PKCδ was knocked down in adult MB neurons, flies subjected to 5x spaced conditioning presented LTM impairment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). When flies of the same genotype were kept at 18°C prior to conditioning, i.e. without induction of RNAi expression, LTM was normal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, the sensitivity to shocks and odors was normal in induced flies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1s1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We then investigated if other types of aversive memory were also affected by PKCδ knockdown in adult MB neurons. No defect was detected when memory was measured 24 h after 5x massed conditioning (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), and memory was not affected when tested 3 h after single-cycle training (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). All of these results were replicated with a second non-overlapping RNAi against PKCδ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A</xref>), which downregulates PKCδ expression with similar efficiency (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1B</xref>). Altogether, these series of experiments demonstrate that PKCδ is specifically required for LTM in adult MB neurons, fulfilling the first condition for a molecular effector of the spacing effect.</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematic representation of Drosophila MB. The MB includes ∼2,000 intrinsic neurons per brain hemisphere. Their cell bodies are located in the dorsal posterior part of the brain. MB neurons each send a single neurite into the neuropil, which first traverses the calyx, a dendritic region where MB neurons receive olfactory input from projections neurons, and then extends into a long axonal branch. The bundled axons of MB neurons form a fascicle called the peduncle, which traverses the brain to the anterior part, where axons branch to form horizontal and vertical lobes according to three major branching patterns – α/β, α’/β’ and γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aso et al., 2014</xref>) – that define as many neuronal categories. The MB lobes receive input from dopaminergic neurons (the DANs), which signal stimuli of positive and negative valences in a region-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). During associative learning, dopamine release on coincidentally odorant-activated MB output synapses modulates the synaptic drive to the network of MB output neurons, which bias subsequent odor-driven behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Heisenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hige, 2018</xref>). Aversive LTM induced by spaced training is more specifically encoded within the α/β neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pascual and Préat, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Séjourné et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yu et al., 2006</xref>), and we previously showed that LTM retrieval involves the depression of an attraction-mediated pathway efferent from the MB vertical lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bouzaiane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Séjourné et al., 2011</xref>). However, according to another recent study, LTM retrieval mobilizes in parallel another MB output circuit efferent from the medial lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jacob and Waddell, 2020</xref>). <bold>(B)</bold> Expression of PKCδ RNAi in adult MB neurons induced a significant reduction in the mRNA level of PKCδ measured by RT-qPCR in fly heads. Relative Quantification (RQ) was performed, indicating the foldchange of mRNA levels relative to the control genotype (n=11, t<sub>20</sub>=2,826, p=0.0104). <bold>(C)</bold> PKCδ knockdown in adult MB neurons impaired memory after 5x spaced conditioning (n=17-25, F<sub>2,58</sub>=12.59, p&lt;0.0001). Without the induction of PKCδ RNAi expression, memory formed after 5x spaced conditioning was normal (n=15-17, F<sub>2,45</sub>=0.4100, p=0.6661). Memory formed after 5x massed training (n=13-14, F<sub>2,37</sub>=0.6511, p=0.5273) and 1x training (n=18, F<sub>2,51</sub>=0.8135, p=0.4490) was normal in flies knocked down for PKCδ in adult MB neurons. <bold>(D)</bold> The cyto-δCKAR sensor was expressed in adult MB neurons and visualized in the CFP and YFP channels. Cytosolic PKCδ activity levels are recorded within the vertical lobes of the MBs (indicated with dashed line). Scale bar=50 µm. In naïve flies, application of 250 µM of PDBu (black arrow), a pharmacological activator of PKCδ, resulted in the increase of the cyto-δCKAR response, reaching a plateau, as compared to the DMSO control (n=6, t<sub>10</sub>=5.658, p=0.0002). Quantification of the mean cyto-δCKAR response was performed 280 s after PDBu application on a time window of 560 s (black line). <bold>(E)</bold> In naïve flies, application of 250 µM of PDBu (black arrow) resulted in an increase in the cyto-δCKAR response that is abolished when PKCδ is knocked down in adult MB neurons (n=5-6, t<sub>9</sub>=4.182, p=0.0024). Quantification of the mean cyto-δCKAR response was performed 280 s after PDBu application on a time window of 560 s (black line). <bold>(F)</bold> To compare post-conditioning cytosolic PKCδ activities (between 30 min and 1 h 30 min post-conditioning, in yellow on the imaging time frame), cyto-δCKAR traces were normalized to the plateau value reached after addition of PDBu (saturation of the sensor), thus the activity level of cytosolic PKCδ is estimated as the cyto-δCKAR signal value before PDBu application. Cytosolic PKCδ activity is increased in the vertical lobes after 5x spaced associative paired conditioning as compared to a non-associative spaced conditioning (unpaired) protocol (n=9-10, t<sub>17</sub>=3.178, p=0.0055). Quantification of the mean post-training PKCδ activity was performed on a time window of 120 s before PDBu application (black line). <bold>(G)</bold> After 5x massed paired conditioning, cytosolic PKCδ activity was not changed as compared to 5x massed unpaired conditioning (n=8, t<sub>14</sub>=0.3282, p=0.7476). <bold>(H)</bold> Similarly, after 1x paired conditioning, cytosolic PKCδ activity was not changed as compared to 1x unpaired conditioning (n=8, t<sub>14</sub>=0.004121, p=0.9968). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM with dots as individual values, and were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with post hoc testing by the Tukey pairwise comparisons test (C) or by unpaired two-sided t-test (B, D-H). Asterisks refer to the least significant P-value of post hoc comparison between the genotype of interest and the genotypic controls (C), or to the P-value of the unpaired t-test comparison (B, D-H) using the following nomenclature: *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ns: not significant, p&gt;0.05.

<p>Next, we investigated whether PKCδ was activated in MB neurons following spaced training. We took advantage of the existence of a genetically encoded FRET-based fluorescent reporter of PKCδ-specific activity, δCKAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kajimoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wu-zhang et al., 2012</xref>), and generated Drosophila lines carrying this sensor under UAS control. Expression of the δCKAR sensor in the adult MB neurons was achieved using the tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>;VT30559-Gal4 driver as for the behavior experiments. To assess the efficacy of the δCKAR sensor in Drosophila neurons, we first used two-photon <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging in the MB vertical lobes of naïve flies to monitor the response of the δCKAR sensor to pharmacological activation of PKCδ, using PDBu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wu-zhang et al., 2012</xref>). PDBu application induced a robust response of the sensor as compared to solvent alone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Because PDBu can activate other PKCs than PKCδ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alzamora et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wu-zhang et al., 2012</xref>), we ascertained the specificity of this response by performing the same experiment in flies expressing PKCδ RNAi in the MB at the adult stage, where PDBu failed to elicit a δCKAR response as compared to flies that do not carry PKCδ RNAi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Notably, the order of magnitude of the maximum δCKAR response (2-3%) is consistent with what was previously measured <italic>in cellulo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wu-zhang et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Having established the responsiveness and the specificity of the δCKAR sensor, we sought to use this tool to measure the PKCδ activity level after conditioning in the MB vertical lobes, which are privileged sites of LTM encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pascual and Préat, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Séjourné et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yu et al., 2006</xref>). To compare post-conditioning PKCδ activity between different protocols, δCKAR traces were normalized to the plateau value reached after saturation of the sensor by addition of PDBu, so that the activity level of PKCδ in each individual fly could be estimated as a δCKAR signal value before PDBu application (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Measurements were performed in a time window of 30 min to 1 h 30 min after the end of training, when increased mitochondrial metabolism in MB vertical lobes after 5x spaced was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rabah et al., 2022</xref>). Using this procedure, we observed that the PKCδ activity level was increased following spaced training, as compared to control flies that were submitted to a non-associative unpaired spaced protocol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Importantly, the PKC substrate-uncompetitive inhibitor Bis IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wu-zhang et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1C</xref>) was still able to induce a decrease in PKCδ activity after spaced training (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1D</xref>), ruling out the alternative hypothesis that lack of a PDBu-induced δCKAR response following spaced training might stem from an inhibition of PKCδ expression or a decrease of its activity below the detection threshold of the δCKAR sensor. Therefore, we conclude from our results that 5x spaced conditioning actually induced a marked enhancement of PKCδ activity in MB neurons. In addition, neither massed nor 1x training elicited such an increase in PKCδ activity levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G-H</xref>), which supports the specific effect of spaced conditioning on PKCδ activation and is consistent with the outcome of our behavioral experiments.</p>
<p>The specific requirement of PKCδ in LTM formation prompted us to investigate whether it was more particularly required in α/β neurons of the MB, one of the three anatomical categories of MB neurons and a subpopulation known to be pivotal in LTM encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pascual and Préat, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Séjourné et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yu et al., 2006</xref>). We therefore restricted PKCδ RNAi expression to the α/β neurons exclusively at the adult stage, by means of the tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>;c739-Gal4 inducible driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Turrel et al., 2018</xref>). This strongly impaired LTM performance after spaced training (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). When RNAi expression was not induced, LTM was normal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Naïve odor and shock avoidance were unaffected by PKCδ knockdown in adult α/β neurons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1s1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Neither 3-h memory after 1x training (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) nor memory after massed training were impaired (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1A</xref>). Hence, we show that PKCδ is more specifically required in α/β neurons for LTM formation. We then investigated PKCδ activity after spaced conditioning more specifically in α/β MB neurons using the δCKAR sensor. Consistent with the requirement of PKCδ specifically for LTM in the α/β neurons, we observed an increase in PKCδ post-training activity after spaced conditioning (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), an activation that was not elicited by a single-cycle of training (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>PKCδ regulates mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism for LTM</title>
<p>We have shown that PKCδ activation occurs after spaced training concomitantly to the increased mitochondrial metabolic activity that is known to be critical for the initiation of LTM formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>). As PKCδ can modulate mitochondrial metabolism in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Acin-Perez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim and Hammerling, 2020</xref>), we wondered whether PKCδ activation in neurons was involved in this process. To address this question, we first asked whether pharmacological PKCδ activation using PDBu in a naïve context could be sufficient to upregulate the mitochondrial pyruvate flux in MB neurons. To this end, we used <italic>in vivo</italic> two-photon imaging of the genetically encoded pyruvate sensor Pyronic (San Martín et al., 2014) expressed in all MB neurons. We employed a previously characterized protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>) to obtain a dynamic measurement of the pyruvate flux to mitochondria, by measuring the slope of pyruvate accumulation following the injection of sodium azide, a potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex IV) (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1A</xref>). In the brains of naïve flies, activation of PKCδ through PDBu application resulted in an upregulated pyruvate flux to the mitochondria of the MB vertical lobes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1B</xref>). This upregulation did not occur when PKCδ was knocked down in adult MB neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that the increased pyruvate consumption relies on PKCδ activation by PDBu. These results reveal that in naïve flies, PKCδ activation is sufficient to increase the pyruvate flux to mitochondria in MB neurons.</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> The pyruvate sensor Pyronic was expressed in adult MB neurons and the pyruvate FRET signal was quantified in the vertical lobes. In naïve control flies (tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>; VT30559, UAS-Pyronic), PDBu pretreatment (250 µM, 3 min) elicited a faster pyruvate accumulation following sodium azide application (5 mM, black arrows) as compared to flies pretreated with the DMSO solvent alone (left panel, slope measurement n=10-11, t<sub>19</sub>=2.311, p=0.0322). This PDBu pretreatment induced increase in pyruvate accumulation is abolished when PKCδ is knocked down in MB neurons as compared to DMSO pretreatment (right panel, slope measurement n=9-14, t<sub>21</sub>=0.6734, p=0.5080). Notably, the plateaus of the pyruvate accumulation kinetics are lower when PDBu is injected onto the brains as compared to the DMSO controls. Indeed, PDBu injection is followed by a slight increase in the measured Pyronic ratio that is not sensitive to PKCδ knockdown, indicating a PDBu indirect effect independent of PKCδ on pyruvate neuronal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1B</xref>). <bold>(B)</bold> In control flies (tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>; VT30559, UAS-Pyronic), spaced training elicited a faster pyruvate accumulation in axons of MB neurons after sodium azide application (5 mM; black arrow) as compared to non-associative unpaired training (left panel, slope measurement n=10, t<sub>18</sub>=6.751, p&lt;0.0001). PKCδ knockdown in adult MB neurons (tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>;VT30559, UAS-Pyronic, UAS-PKCδ RNAi) impaired the spaced training induced increase in pyruvate accumulation in axons of MB neurons following sodium azide application (right panel, slope measurement n=10, t<sub>18</sub>=0.3794, p=0.7089). As for <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, imaging was performed between 30 min and 1 h 30 min post-conditioning, represented in yellow on the imaging time frame. <bold>(C)</bold> Left panel: schema of the regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. In mitochondria, PDHC catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). PDH can be inactivated through phosphorylation by PDK. In contrast, PDP can activate a phosphorylated PDH. In our model, PKCδ regulates PDH activity via PDK inhibition. Right panel: after 5x spaced conditioning, flies coexpressing the PDK and PKCδ RNAi in the α/β MB neurons at the adult stage (tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>;c739&gt;UAS-PKCδ RNAi, UAS-PDK RNAi) exhibited normal memory formation as compared to genotypic controls (tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>;c739/+ and +/UAS-PKCδ RNAi, UAS-PDK RNAi). Flies solely expressing the PKCδ RNAi in α/β neurons at the adult stage (tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>; c739&gt;UAS-PKCδ RNAi) exhibited the reported LTM defect, whereas flies that were only knocked down for PDK in adult α/β neurons (tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>;c739&gt;UAS-PDK RNAi) formed normal memory (n=12, F<sub>4,55</sub>=4.746, p=0.0023).

<p>We then investigated whether PKCδ mediates metabolic upregulation after spaced training. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>), we observed an increased pyruvate flux in MB vertical lobes following spaced conditioning (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) during the same time frame as for PKCδ activation. Remarkably, this effect was abolished by PKCδ knockdown in adult MB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that a critical role of PKCδ in LTM formation is to upregulate mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism for LTM gating.</p>
<p>Next, we examined how PKCδ could regulate mitochondrial pyruvate consumption. We previously showed that the upregulation of the pyruvate flux critical for LTM formation is directly related to the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>). PDH activity is regulated by its level of phosphorylation: the PDH kinase (PDK) inhibits PDH, whereas PDH phosphatase (PDP) activates it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lavington et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, in non-neuronal cells, PKCδ has been described as an inhibitor of PDK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Acin-Perez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim and Hammerling, 2020</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that a similar mechanism – i.e. PDK inhibition resulting in PDH activation – may occur in neurons in the context of LTM formation. To test this hypothesis, we reasoned that genetic inhibition of PDK may alleviate the LTM defect elicited by PKCδ knockdown (as described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Indeed, we observed that coexpression of PDK and PKCδ RNAis in adult α/β MB neurons did not induce a memory impairment, whereas expression of the PKCδ RNAi alone induced an LTM defect as expected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, inhibiting PDK is sufficient to fully rescue the memory defect induced by loss of PKCδ, showing that upregulating pyruvate flux is the critical function of PKCδ in LTM formation.</p>

<title>MP1 neurons activate PKCδ in the mitochondria of MB neurons via DAMB signaling</title>
<p>As detailed in the introduction, the metabolic upregulation induced by spaced training has been shown to be triggered by early post-learning activity of MP1 dopamine neurons, through the Gq-coupled DAMB receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore asked if MP1 neuronal dopamine signaling through the DAMB receptor could activate PKCδ and induce its mitochondrial translocation, which would be detected as an increase in PKCδ activity specifically at the level of the mitochondria. For this, we expressed a mitochondria-addressed δCKAR sensor, mito-δCKAR (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1</xref>), in MB neurons, and monitored PKCδ activity while artificially activating MP1 neurons in naïve flies using dTrpA1, a heat-sensitive cation channel that allows to induce neuronal firing through acute temperature increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Plaçais et al., 2012</xref>). At the level of the peduncle, where MP1 neurons project on to the α/β MB neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aso et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), flies subjected to the activation of MP1 neurons showed an increased PKCδ mitochondrial activity as compared to flies that received a similar thermal treatment but did not express dTrpA1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Strikingly, in flies that were additionally knocked down for the DAMB receptor in the MBs, MP1 neuron activation failed to increase PKCδ mitochondrial activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, we found that PKCδ mitochondrial activity could also be increased in the vertical lobes of the MB in response to MP1 activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Altogether, these data show that DAMB signaling from MP1 neurons triggers increased PKCδ mitochondrial activity, reflecting its translocation to mitochondria in MB neurons.</p>

<title>Spaced training prolongs learning-induced metabolic enhancement</title>
<p>The results obtained thus far uncover a DAMB/PKCδ cascade that mediates an increase in pyruvate consumption by MB neuronal mitochondria. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rabah et al., 2022</xref>), single-cycle training also induces a metabolic upregulation of similar magnitude, typically observed 1-2 h after training. However, we observed that the metabolic enhancement induced by single-cycle training (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) faded away rapidly, as it was no longer detectable 3 hours after 1x training (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Moreover, the metabolic upregulation occurring after 1x training was not dependent on DAMB signaling (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), nor did it require PKCδ activity in MB neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), contrary to what was observed after spaced training (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref> for DAMB and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> for PKCδ). This led us to hypothesize that the role of this DAMB/PKCδ cascade after spaced training is to extend the duration of the metabolic enhancement in MB neurons. Indeed, measurements performed 3-4 hours as well as 8-9 hours after the last cycle of spaced training (i.e. respectively 5-6 hours and 10-11 hours after the end of the first training cycles) revealed that increased metabolic activity was still occurring (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E-F</xref>). In contrast, measurements performed 24 hours after spaced training showed that the metabolic enhancement had stopped by that time point (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Altogether, our results demonstrate that spaced training specifically recruits dopamine/DAMB/PKCδ signaling to perpetuate the metabolic activation in MB neurons, which is critical for initiating LTM formation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Schema of the energy-based gating of LTM, illustrating the role of PKCδ downstream of the DAMB signaling cascade.</title>
<p>After 1x training, the pyruvate flux to the mitochondria in the vertical lobes of MB neurons is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Rabah et al., 2022</xref>). This increased energy state is not maintained but is progressively turned off, and after 3 h, the MBs are back to their basal energy state. Upon spaced training, in addition to the mechanism occurring after 1x training, the enhanced oscillatory activity of MP1 neurons activates DAMB signaling in the efferent α/β MB neurons. The DAMB receptor preferentially couples with Gq and the produced DAG activates PKCδ, which results in its translocation to mitochondria. There, PKCδ can activate the PDH, by releasing the inhibition exerted by PDK. The enhanced PDH activity promotes an increase in mitochondrial pyruvate flux, and this enhanced energy state gates memory consolidation, thereby enabling LTM formation. After 3 and even 8 hours, the lasting effect of PKCδ on mitochondrial metabolism maintains the high energy state of the MBs needed to support LTM formation.</p></caption>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we unveiled a detailed molecular mechanism underlying the spacing effect on memory consolidation. We established that PKCδ, a known regulator of mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism in several peripheral tissues, is a critical player in LTM formation in α/β MB neurons, while being dispensable for less stable forms of aversive memory. Additionally, we imported in Drosophila a genetically-encoded FRET sensor for PKCδ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kajimoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wu-zhang et al., 2012</xref>), which allowed observing the PKCδ activity level <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, we reported a specific activation and mitochondrial translocation of PKCδ following spaced training, but not 1x or massed training. We established that specific dopaminergic neurons (MP1 neurons), which are required early after spaced training for LTM formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">2012</xref>), activate PKCδ translocation to mitochondria, through a specific Gq-coupled dopamine receptor, DAMB. Consistent with the role of this dopamine signaling that we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>), we showed here that activated PKCδ persistently upregulates pyruvate metabolism, thereby allowing LTM formation. Altogether, our data demonstrate that PKCδ, acting as an activator of mitochondrial metabolism, is a neuronal gatekeeper of LTM formation. More generally, our findings provide a detailed mechanistic description of how dopamine signaling orchestrates memory consolidation through sustained modulation of neuronal energy fluxes, thereby resolving within a single gating mechanism the cognitive and metabolic constraints linked to LTM formation.</p>
<p>Although PKCs have been widely implicated in learning and memory in a large variety of model organisms (Van Der Zee and Douma, 1997), the precise contribution of PKCδ in memory formation and consolidation in mammals remains largely unknown. Nevertheless, PKCδ is highly expressed in brain regions associated with learning, and more specifically aversive learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zafiri and Duvarci, 2022</xref>). In particular, it is found in the CA3 layer of the hippocampus, as well as in a specific region of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) called CE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Haubensak et al., 2010</xref>) <italic>(see also</italic> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mouse.brain-map.org">http://mouse.brain-map.org</ext-link><italic>)</italic>. There, PKCδ marks about 50% of CEl GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Haubensak et al., 2010</xref>). Strikingly, it was shown that CeA is implicated in learning and consolidation of Pavlovian fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Steinberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wilensky et al., 2006</xref>), and more specifically that PKCδ+ neurons of the CeA projecting to the substantia innominata (SI) bidirectionally modulate negative reinforcement learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cui et al., 2017</xref>). However, no link between the function of PKCδ itself and memory consolidation or metabolism has been established yet, as the PKCδ-expressing feature of these neurons was only used as a means to genetically target them in the aforementioned studies. Our work thus sketches a possibly conserved role of neuronal PKCδ in the context of memory formation and consolidation in mammals, which nevertheless remains to be investigated. A possible role of PKCδ in plasticity mechanisms in mice was substantiated by the recent observation, in CA1 pyramidal neurons from mice organotypic slices, that stimulation-induced DAG production downstream of NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Colgan et al., 2018</xref>) can activate PKCδ in spines for local plasticity, and, at a longer timescale, its translocation to the nucleus for plasticity-induced transcription upon LTP formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Colgan et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>How is post-learning dopamine signaling coupled with PKCδ activation? DAMB is a dopamine receptor that has the ability to activate Gq with great efficiency and dopamine sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Himmelreich et al., 2017</xref>), which results in the production of DAG, a canonical activator of the majority of PKC enzymes. Once activated by DAG, the local hydrophobic patch generated by DAG fixation is thought to guide PKCs to various membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hurley and Grobler, 1997</xref>), and notably to mitochondria in the case of PKCδ where it localizes to the intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Acin-Perez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim and Hammerling, 2020</xref>). In addition, PKCδ is specific among PKCs in that it does not require activation loop phosphorylation for catalytic competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Duquesnes et al., 2011</xref>). This direct link between DAG and PKCδ (and the absence of any requirement for PKCδ phosphorylation) may explain its physiological role as an efficient relay between extracellular cues sensed by receptors and intracellular metabolism at the level of the mitochondria. DAMB/Gq can also activate calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cassar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Himmelreich et al., 2017</xref>), the other canonical second-messenger pathway downstream of Gq. Since increases in mitochondrial calcium flux are another way to enhance PDH complex activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Denton et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Glancy and Balaban, 2012</xref>), one cannot exclude that mitochondrial calcium signaling may also play a role in the gating mechanism for LTM formation.</p>
<p>Gq/PKC signaling has also been shown to play a major role in memory in rodents. Mutation in the phosphosite of TrkB that binds phospholipase C (PLC) to produce DAG and activate PKC signaling impaired expression and maintenance of synaptic long-term potentiation in the hippocampus, and overall reduced learning in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gruart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Minichiello et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, the Gq-DAG mechanism of PKCδ activation for memory consolidation could be conserved in mammals. While DAMB has no direct homology with mammalian dopaminergic receptors (instead belonging to an “invertebrate type” class of receptors as demonstrated by sequence comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mustard et al., 2005</xref>)), it should be noted that several mammalian dopamine receptors are also known to mobilize Gq signaling, such as the D1-D2 and the D5-D2 dopamine receptor heteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">So et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Young and Thomas, 2014</xref>). D1-like receptor can also directly engage with Gq/11 and therefore PLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rashid et al., 2007</xref>). In mammals, this non-canonical D1-like receptor/Gq coupling was notably found in the hippocampus and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ming et al., 2006</xref>), two brain areas that are enriched in PKCδ+ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Haubensak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zafiri and Duvarci, 2022</xref>). Anatomical studies demonstrate that both D1 and D2 receptors are expressed in the CeA, a region of the brain enriched in PKCδ+ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zafiri and Duvarci, 2022</xref>). Periaqueductal gray/dorsal raphe (PAG/DR) afferent dopaminergic neurons exhibit phasic activation in response to an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) and to a conditioned stimulus (CS) associated with the aversive US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Groessl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zafiri and Duvarci, 2022</xref>), which could preferentially activate the D1 receptor-expressing CeA neurons during aversive learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zafiri and Duvarci, 2022</xref>). It would be of particular interest to explore the involvement of PKCδ neurons in this process, and to study whether PKCδ could be mobilized downstream of D1/Gq signaling in the context of aversive memory in mammals. Aside from dopaminergic receptors, a wide variety of memory-relevant receptors have been reported to activate Gq signaling, with adrenergic receptors being the most commonly cited kind. In physiological conditions, α-adrenergic receptors are considered to be the principal activators of Gq signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Duquesnes et al., 2011</xref>). β-adrenoreceptor subtypes are expressed in the hippocampus and amygdala; these regions receive noradrenergic afferences from the locus coeruleus, which plays a critical role in regulating behavioral memory in rodents, and are key for the processing of memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sara, 2009</xref>), and more specifically for their consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sara, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Souza-Braga et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we propose a model in which a state of high energy consumption in MB neuron axons necessary for LTM gating is prolonged by PKCδ, which boosts the PDH complex activity in MB mitochondria. Such a role is consistent with previous descriptions in non-neuronal mammalian cells. It is indeed known that PKCδ can regulate the PDH complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Acin-Perez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim and Hammerling, 2020</xref>): activation of PKCδ leads to the phosphorylation of a putative PDK phosphatase, thereby enhancing its activity and promoting dephosphorylation of PDK, which inhibits it and thereby releases the inhibition it exerts on the PDH complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Acin-Perez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim and Hammerling, 2020</xref>). As PDK knockdown rescued the LTM defect induced by PKCδ knockdown in our study, we propose that PKCδ boosts the PDH complex activity via this mechanism of PDK-Pase activation, resulting in PDK inhibition in MB neuronal mitochondria. This lasting effect of PKCδ on mitochondrial metabolism thus maintains the pyruvate flux upregulated in MB vertical lobe mitochondria, which unlocks memory consolidation to form LTM.</p>
<p>While our work uncovers a molecular switch controlling the metabolic upregulation of the MB neurons, the role for this enhanced pyruvate flux to mitochondria has not yet been unveiled. Several hypotheses could be considered, which are not mutually exclusive. First, increased pyruvate incorporation into the TCA cycle could lead to acceleration of oxidative phosphorylation and subsequent enhanced ATP production, in support of sustained neuronal activity or of the substantial energy cost of <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis on which LTM formation depends at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Davis and Squire, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Helmstetter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jarome and Helmstetter, 2014</xref>). Second, acceleration of the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation can also be accompanied by increased ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Rosato et al., 2014</xref>), both of which are increasingly recognized as neuronal signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sinenko et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Third, acceleration of the TCA cycle alone, decoupled from oxidative phosphorylation, could produce acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter used by MB neurons, and/or acyl groups that are crucial for subsequent epigenetic modifications. This non-canonical TCA cycle has recently been reported in a model of mammalian stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arnold et al., 2022</xref>). Finally, TCA cycle intermediates could be used for amino acid synthesis to fulfill the need for <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis, which is a hallmark of LTM.</p>
<p>Our study extends to the context of memory formation in neurons the beneficial role of PKCδ in the modulation of mitochondrial metabolism, whereas it was first extensively described in the mouse embryonic fibroblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Acin-Perez et al., 2010</xref>). There, PKCδ serves as an indispensable supervisor of mitochondrial energy production: by sensing the cytochrome c redox state as a proxy of the respiratory chain workload, it adjusts mitochondrial metabolism within safe margins (that can be overpassed when fuel flux surpasses the capacity of the electron-transport chain, causing detrimental ROS release) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Acin-Perez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim and Hammerling, 2020</xref>). Strikingly, PKCδ was also widely described as detrimental to cells in pathological conditions, with a well-characterized role in cardiac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Inagaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zaja et al., 2014</xref>) and neuronal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bright et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dave et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Phan et al., 2002</xref>) cell death upon ischemic incidents. In this model, PKCδ takes part in apoptotic events through a caspase-induced signaling cascade in mitochondria, notably via cleavage by caspase-3 at the PKCδ caspase-dependent cleavage site, which releases a 40 kDa active fragment. Furthermore, transient episodes of ischemia can also activate PKCδ through ROS-dependent mechanisms, leading to its phosphorylation and subsequent activation. PKCδ can then bind and phosphorylate Drp1, a major mitochondrial fission protein, thereby increasing its activity. This mechanism was described in cardiomyocytes during anoxia-reoxygenation injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zaja et al., 2014</xref>), and in neurons under oxidative stress <italic>in cellulo</italic>, as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> in the context of hypertension-induced encephalopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Qi et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, PKCδ has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Du et al., 2018</xref>) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kaul et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). However, a number of these studies should be considered carefully, as some of their results are based on PKCδ inhibition by rottlerin, which has been found to be an inappropriate and ineffective PKCδ pharmacological inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Soltoff, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, various pieces of evidence show increased expression of PKCδ in AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Du et al., 2018</xref>), pointing towards the fact that PKCδ inhibition plays an important protective role in brain aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Conboy et al., 2009</xref>), ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bright et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dave et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Phan et al., 2002</xref>), and neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Du et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kaul et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, it is now emerging that PKCδ is functionally ambivalent: while its role in metabolism regulation maintains essential physiological functions such as LTM gating in the brain as demonstrated in this study, stress conditions unveil negative effects mediated by this kinase that derail the system equilibrium. The interplay between the two modes of activation of PKCδ by DAG and oxidative stress is probably at the heart of its contrasting duality. Expanding upon our work, it could be of particular interest to explore whether competition between PKCδ activation via these two modes, DAG and oxidative stress, occurs upon aging and/or pathology.</p>

<p><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> flies were maintained on standard cornmeal-yeast-agar medium. Stocks were kept at 18°C and 60% humidity under a 12-hour light:12-hour dark cycle. Genetic crosses were performed at 18°C for behavior experiments or at 23°C for imaging experiments (except when indicated otherwise). Both male and female flies were used for behavior experiments. Female flies were used for imaging experiments due to their larger size. Flies from the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center (VDRC) collection were outcrossed for 5 generations to a reference strain carrying the w<sup>1118</sup> mutation in an otherwise Canton Special (Canton S) genetic background. Since TRiP RNAi transgenes do not carry a mini-white marker but are labeled with a y<sup>+</sup> marker, flies from the TRiP RNAi collection were outcrossed to a y<sup>1</sup>w<sup>67c23</sup> strain in an otherwise Canton S background. The Canton S strain was used as the wild type strain.</p>
<p>To target MB neurons, the VT30559-Gal4 line was used in combination with the thermosensitive TARGET system tubulin-Gal80<sup>ts</sup> to generate the tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>;VT30559-Gal4 inducible driver line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>), so as to temporally control the expression of the desired transgene. Gal4 activity was released by transferring 0-to 2-day-old adult flies to 30°C for 2-3 days. Likewise, the c739-Gal4 line was used to specifically target α/β neurons, and the tubulin-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>;c739-Gal4 construct line previously generated in the laboratory and described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Turrel et al., 2018</xref> allowed temporal control of the Gal4 activity. As described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Silva et al., 2022</xref>, the tubulin-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>;elav-Gal4 system was used for time-controlled pan-neuronal knockdown. To target MP1 neurons independently of the Gal4 system, the 30E11-LexA driver was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>). The tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>; VT30559-Gal4, UAS-Pyronic line was previously generated in our research group and described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>. The UAS-cyto-δCKAR and UAS-mito-δCKAR lines were generated for this study (see ‘Generation of transgenic flies’ section below). The following genetic constructs were generated in this study by combining the appropriate UAS-RNAi line (listed in the key resources table) and FRET sensor transgenes: i) UAS-cyto-δCKAR;UAS-PKCδ<sup>RNAi</sup> <sup>JF01991</sup>, ii) UAS-mito-δCKAR;UAS-DAMB<sup>RNAi</sup> <sup>KK110947</sup>, iii) UAS-mito-δCKAR;UAS-DAMB<sup>RNAi</sup> <sup>KK110947</sup>;LexAop-dTrpA1, and iv) UAS-PDK<sup>RNAi</sup> <sup>KK106641</sup>; UAS-PKCδ<sup>RNAi</sup> <sup>JF02991</sup>.

<sec id="s7a">
<title>Aversive olfactory conditioning and memory test</title>
<p>The behavioral experiments, including sample sizes, were conducted similarly to previous studies from our research group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Scheunemann et al., 2018</xref>). For all experiments, training and testing were performed in a sound- and odor-proof room at 25°C and 80% humidity. Experimental flies (male and female) were transferred to fresh bottles containing standard medium on the day before conditioning for the non-induced condition. For the induced condition, flies were transferred 2 days before the experiment at 30.5°C to allow RNAi expression.</p>
<sec id="s7a1">
<title>Conditioning</title>
<p>Flies were conditioned by exposure to one odor paired with electric shocks and subsequent exposure to a second odor in the absence of shock. A barrel-type machine was used for simultaneous automated conditioning of six groups of 40–50 flies each. Throughout the conditioning protocol, each barrel was attached to a constant air flow at 2 L.min<sup>-1</sup>. The odorants 3-octanol (odor O) and 4-methylcyclohexanol (odor M), diluted in paraffin oil at 0.360 and 0.325 mM respectively, were alternately used as conditioned stimuli (CS). For a single cycle of associative training, flies were first exposed to an odorant (the CS+) for 1 min while 12 pulses of 5 s-long, 60 V electric shocks were delivered; flies were then exposed 45 s later to a second odorant without shocks (the CS–) for 1 min. Here, the groups of flies were subjected to one of the following olfactory conditioning protocols: 1 cycle training (1x), five consecutive associative training cycles (5x massed training), or five associative cycles spaced by 15-min inter-trial intervals (5x spaced conditioning). Non-associative control protocols (unpaired protocols) were also employed for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging experiments. During unpaired conditionings, the odor and shock stimuli were delivered separately in time, with shocks occurring 3 min before the first odorant. After training and until memory testing, flies were kept on regular food at 25°C (for 3 h-memory test) or at 18°C (for 24 h memory test).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s7a2">
<title>Memory test</title>
<p>The memory test was performed either 3 h after 1x conditioning or 24 h after 5x conditioning in a T-maze apparatus comprising a central elevator to transfer the flies to the center of the maze arms. During the test, flies were exposed simultaneously to both odors (the same concentration as during conditioning) in the T-maze. After 1 min of odorant exposure in the dark, flies were trapped in either T-maze arm, retrieved and counted. A memory score was calculated as the number of flies avoiding the conditioned odor minus the number of flies preferring the conditioned odor, divided by the total number of flies. A single memory score value is the average of two scores obtained from two groups of genotypically identical flies conditioned in two reciprocal experiments, using either odorant (3-octanol or 4-methylcyclohexanol) as the CS+. The indicated ‘n’ is the number of independent memory score values for each genotype.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s7a3">
<title>Odor perception test</title>
<p>The olfactory acuity of flies was tested after conditioning with the CS+, since electric shocks modify their olfactory perceptions. Flies were then immediately tested in a T-maze, where they had to choose between the CS– or its solvent (paraffin oil). Odor concentrations used in this assay were the same as for the memory assays. At these concentrations, both odorants are innately repulsive. The odor-interlaced side was alternated for successively tested groups. After 1 minute, flies were counted, and naïve odor avoidance was calculated as for the memory test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s7a4">
<title>Electric shock perception test</title>
<p>During the test, flies must choose between two barrels: one delivering the electric shocks, and one that is neutral. The compartment where the electric shocks are delivered was alternated between two consecutive groups. After 1 minute, flies were counted, and shock avoidance was calculated as for the memory test.</p>
<sec id="s7a4a">
<title>In vivo imaging</title>
<p>Crosses for imaging experiments were raised at 23°C and fly progeny were induced for three days at 30.5°C to drive sufficient expression of the probe (and the desired RNAi) for use in imaging, except for MP1 activation experiments involving the thermosensitive LexAop-dTrpA1 transgene in which flies were always kept at 18°C. As in all previous imaging work from our laboratory, all <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging was performed on female flies, which are preferred since their larger size facilitates surgery. Naïve (not trained) or conditioned flies (1x, 5x spaced or 5x massed and their corresponding unpaired controls) were gently handled by aspiration without anesthesia and glued on their dorsal side to a plastic coverslip coated with a thin transparent plastic sheet. The coverslip was then placed on a recording chamber. Surgery was performed to obtain an imaging window on the fly head by removing the cuticle, trachea and fat bodies, thereby exposing the underlying MB neurons. During the procedure, the head capsule is bathed in a drop of artificial hemolymph: NaCl 130 mM (Sigma cat. # S9625), KCl 5 mM (Sigma cat. # P3911), MgCl2 2 mM (Sigma cat. # M9272), CaCl2 2 mM (Sigma cat. # C3881), D-trehalose 5 mM (Sigma cat. # 9531), sucrose 30 mM (Sigma cat. # S9378), and HEPES hemisodium salt 5 mM (Sigma cat. # H7637). At the end of the procedure, any remaining solution was absorbed and a fresh 90-µL droplet was applied on the preparation. When performed on flies that underwent olfactory conditioning, the imaging experiments were performed within the time period after conditioning indicated on each figure panel.</p>

<title>FRET δCKAR imaging</title>
<p>Imaging was performed using a SP8 DIVE Leica 2-photon microscope equipped with a 25x, 1.0 NA water immersion objective. Two-photon excitation of CFP was achieved using an Insight X3 Spectra Physics laser tuned to 840 nm. 512x250 images were acquired at the rate of one image every two seconds, with two z plans imaged in parallel (vertical lobes and peduncle). Typically, the images comprised the structures of both brain hemispheres, although only one hemisphere was visible in some preparations. Two spectrally tunable hybrid detectors were adjusted to detect 440-490 nm CFP emission and 510-550 nm YFP emission. Two minutes after the beginning of image acquisition, 10 µL of a 2.5 mM phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu, Tocris cat. # 4153) solution (25 mM PDBu stock solution in DMSO dissolved at 1/10 in artificial hemolymph) were injected into the 90 µL-droplet bathing the fly’s brain, bringing PDBu to a final concentration of 250 µM (DMSO: 1/100). In control experiments, PDBu injection was replaced by the injection of DMSO alone (final concentration: 1/100). To inhibit PKCδ, two minutes after the beginning of image acquisition, 10 µL of a 50 µM bisindolylmaleimide IV (Bis IV, Sigma cat. # B3306) solution (500 µM stock solution in DMSO dissolved at 1/10 in artificial hemolymph), bringing Bis IV to a final concentration of 5 µM. In control experiments, Bis IV injection was replaced by the injection of DMSO alone (final concentration: 1/100). Drug application during the recording could give rise to artifactual perturbation of the signal at the time of injection, with variability from one experiment to another. In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, a section of the presented traces corresponding to the 15 seconds following the injection was smoothed using a running average procedure (with a time window of 30 s) to remove injection artefacts that were especially large in this initial series of experiments. The injection technique was subsequently improved so that no smoothing was applied on any of the other presented experiments (including in particular <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, which reports a similar phenomenon as <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>For image analysis, regions of interest (ROI) were delimited by hand around each visible vertical lobe or peduncle region, and the average intensity of both CFP and YFP channels over each ROI were calculated over time after background subtraction; the background was evaluated as the mean intensity over a region of interest placed in a nonfluorescent part of the brain. The δCKAR sensor was designed so that FRET from CFP to YFP decreases when PKCδ phosphorylating activity increases. The inverse FRET ratio, ΔR (CFP/YFP), was computed to obtain a signal that positively correlates with PKCδ phosphorylating activity. To measure the δCKAR response (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1C-D</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), the ΔR ratio was normalized by a baseline value calculated over the 2 min preceding drug injection (PDBu or Bis IV). To measure PKCδ post-training activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-H</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-C</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), the ΔR ratio was normalized by a plateau value calculated from 6 min 40 s to the end of the recording, and the controls were normalized to 1.</p>
<p>For the MP1 activation experiments in which PKCδ response activity was assayed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), flies were prepared as previously reported and placed on a custom-made device equipped with a Peltier cell to allow precise control of the temperature under the microscope. Flies were recorded for 2 min at 18°C to establish a baseline and then received thermal treatment for MP1 activation, consisting of three consecutive periods of 2 min at 30°C followed by 2 min at 18°C. The recording was continued for 10 min after the last activation period. To measure PKCδ response activity, the ΔR was normalized by the baseline value calculated over the 2 min preceding thermal treatment, and the controls were normalized to 1.</p>

<title>FRET imaging of pyruvate flux</title>
<p>Two-photon imaging was performed using a Leica TCS-SP5 upright microscope equipped with a 25x, 0.95 NA water immersion objective. Two-photon excitation was achieved using a Mai Tai DeepSee laser tuned to 825 nm. The frame rate was two images per second. 512x150 images were acquired at a rate of two images per second. The emission channels for mTFP and Venus were the same as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gervasi et al., 2010</xref>. Measurements of pyruvate consumption were performed according to a previously well-characterized protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>). After 1 min of baseline acquisition, 10 μL of a 50 mM sodium azide solution (Sigma cat. #71289; prepared in the same artificial hemolymph solution) were injected into the 90 μL-droplet bathing the fly’s brain, bringing sodium azide to a final concentration of 5 mM. In experiments involving pretreatment of the brains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), 250 µM of PDBu or 1/100 DMSO (final concentrations) were injected into the hemolymph droplet 3 minutes prior to sodium azide injection. Image analysis was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>). ROI were delimited by hand around each visible MB vertical lobe, and the average intensity of the mTFP and Venus channels over each ROI was calculated over time after background subtraction. The Pyronic sensor was designed so that FRET from mTFP to Venus decreases when the pyruvate concentration increases. To obtain a signal that positively correlates with pyruvate concentration, the inverse FRET ratio was computed as mTFP intensity divided by Venus intensity. This ratio was normalized by a baseline value calculated over the 1 min preceding drug injection. The slope was calculated between 10 and 70% of the plateau. The indicated ‘n’ is the number of animals that were assayed in each condition.</p>

<title>RT-qPCR analyses</title>
<p>To assess the efficiency of the PKCδ RNAi used in this study, female flies carrying the tubulin-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>;elav-Gal4 pan-neuronal inducible driver were either crossed with UAS-PKCδ RNAi JF02991 or UAS-PKCδ KK109117 males, or with CS males for controls (please note that crosses of these RNAi lines with the constitutive elav-Gal4 driver were lethal for the progeny). To assess PKCδ presence in the MB neurons, female flies carrying the tubulin-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>;VT30559-Gal4 MB neuron driver were either crossed with UAS-PKCδ RNAi JF02991 males, or with CS males for controls. Fly progeny were raised at 23°C throughout their development. Newly hatched flies were transferred to fresh food vials at 30.5°C for 4 days of induction before RNA extraction, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Silva et al., 2022</xref>). RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen), RNA MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen), oligo(dT)20 primers and the SuperScript III First-Strand kit (Thermo Fisher Invitrogen). Amplification was performed using a LightCycler 480 (Roche) and the SYBR Green I Master mix (Roche). Specific primers used for PKCδ cDNA and the refence α-Tub84B (Tub, CG1913) cDNA are specified in the key resources table. The level of PKCδ cDNA was compared against the level of the α-Tub84B reference cDNA. Each reaction was performed in triplicate. The specificity and size of amplification products were assessed by melting curve analyses. Expression relative to the reference was presented as the foldchange compared to the calibrator (relative quantification RQ = 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup>, where Ct is the cycle threshold).</p>

<title>Generation of transgenic flies</title>
<p>To generate the UAS-cyto-δCKAR line, the pcDNA3-deltaCKAR plasmid (Addgene #31526) was digested by HindIII and XbaI. The resulting fragment was purified by electrophoresis and cloned into a pJFRC-MUH plasmid (Addgene #26213) in the XbaI/NotI subcloning site. The resulting construct was verified by restriction analysis and sequenced by PCR. This subcloning was outsourced to RDBiotech (France). The UAS-mito-δCKAR line was generated using the plasmid mito-δCKAR generated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wu-zhang et al., 2012</xref> by subcloning the mito-δCKAR fragment (HindIII/XbaI) into the pJFRC-MUH plasmid.

<caption><title>Control experiments for behavior analysis and δCKAR imaging experiments.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> Behavior analysis with a second PKCδ RNAi: 24-h memory after 5x spaced conditioning was also specifically impaired after induction of the PKCδ RNAi expression in adult MB (n=14-18, F<sub>2,45</sub>=6.764, p=0.027), and it was not impacted without induction (n=11-15, F<sub>2,37</sub>=0.6226, p=0.5421). No memory defect was found after 5x massed training (n=16, F<sub>2,45</sub>=0.8968, p=0.4151) or 1x training (n=17-18, F<sub>2,48</sub>=0.6592, p=0.5219) in flies knocked down for PKCδ in adult MB. <bold>(B)</bold> Pan-neuronal expression of either PKCδ RNAi at the adult stage significantly reduced PKCδ mRNA levels. Relative Quantification (RQ) was performed, indicating the foldchange of mRNA levels relative to the control genotype (n=5-6, F<sub>2,13</sub>=11.85, p=0.0012). <bold>(C)</bold> In naïve flies, application of 5 µM of Bis IV (black arrow), a PKC inhibitor, resulted in a decrease in the cyto-δCKAR response, and this response was abolished when PKCδ was knocked down (n=5-6, t<sub>9</sub>=3.007, p=0.0148). Quantification of the mean cyto-δCKAR response was performed 20 s after Bis IV application on a time window of 250 s (black line). <bold>(D)</bold> After 5x spaced training, Bis IV injection also decreased the cyto-δCKAR response as compared to the DMSO control (n=6, t<sub>10</sub>=4.825, p=0.0007). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM with dots as individual values, and were analyzed either by one-way ANOVA with post hoc testing by the Tukey pairwise comparisons test (A-B), or by an unpaired two-sided t-test (C-D). Asterisks refer to the least significant P-value of post hoc comparison between the genotype of interest and the genotypic controls (A-B) or to the P-value of the unpaired t-test comparison (C-D) using the following nomenclature: *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ns: not significant, p&gt;0.05.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Additional information on pyruvate flux measurement using the Pyronic sensor.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> Schema representing the measure of the mitochondrial pyruvate flux using the pyruvate FRET sensor Pyronic. Here, mitochondrial respiration is blocked by sodium azide at the beginning of the recording, thereby stopping pyruvate mitochondrial uptake. The expected kinetic of pyruvate accumulation following the azide treatment is represented in grey, showing that pyruvate accumulates from the arrest of its mitochondrial uptake until saturation of the sensor. The rate of pyruvate accumulation (i.e. the slope of the measured kinetic, measured between 10 and 70% of the plateau) reflects the rate at which pyruvate was consumed by mitochondria for energy production before their blockade. <bold>(B)</bold> Complete recording of pyruvate imaging data shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>. In control flies (tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>;VT30559, UAS-Pyronic), PDBu injection is followed by a progressive increase in the measured Pyronic ratio (black line) as compared to DMSO injection (n=11, t<sub>20</sub>=5.437, p&lt;0.0001). This effect is not sensitive to PKCδ knockdown (tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>;VT30559, UAS-Pyronic, UAS-PKCδ RNAi flies, n=9-14, t<sub>21</sub>=3.542, p=0.0019). As PDBu is known to activate other PKCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wu-zhang et al., 2012</xref>), this observation likely reflects a PDBu off-target effect independent of PKCδ on pyruvate neuronal levels. This effect explains why, when normalized just before azide injection (as in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), the pyruvate accumulation plateaus appear lower when PDBu is injected onto the brains as compared to the DMSO controls. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM with dots as individual values, and were analyzed by unpaired two-sided t-test. Asterisks refer to the P-value of the unpaired t-test comparison using the following nomenclature: **p&lt;0.01, ****p&lt;0.0001.</p></caption>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Comparison of fluorescence sub localization in the soma of MB neurons in flies expressing either cyto-δCKAR, mito-δCKAR or mito-DsRed (DsRed is addressed to mitochondria using the COX8 targeting sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lutas et al., 2012</xref>)) under the control of the VT30559 driver. Mito-δCKAR punctate signal, similar to what is observed for mito-DsRed signal, indicates mitochondrial localization of the probe, in contrast to the diffuse signal observed with cyto-δCKAR. This comparison was done in the soma area because it is the only MB region where the density of mitochondria allows their discrimination by conventional microscopy. Images were acquired by 2-photon microscopy, cyto-and mito-δCKAR sensors were visualized through the YFP channel, and the mito-DsRed signal was acquired by 750 nm excitation and 580-610 nm detection.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This is a detailed description of the role of PKCδ in Drosophila learning and memory. The work is based on a previous study (Placais et al. 2017) that has already shown that for the establishment of long-term memory, the repetitive activity of MP1 dopaminergic neurons via the dopamine receptor DAMB is essential to increase mitochondrial energy flux in the mushroom body.</p>
<p>In this paper, the role of PKCδ is now introduced. PKCδ is a molecular link between the dopaminergic system and the mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism of mushroom body Kenyon cells. For this purpose, the authors establish a genetically encoded FRET-based fluorescent reporter of PKCδ-specific activity, δCKAR.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This is a thorough study of the long-term memory of Drosophila. The work is based on the extensive, high-quality experience of the senior authors. This is particularly evident in the convincing use of behavioral assays and imaging techniques to differentiate and explore various memory phases in Drosophila. The study also establishes a new reporter to measure the activity of PKCδ - the focus of this study - in behaving animals. The authors also elucidate how recurrent spaced training sessions initiate a molecular gating mechanism, linking a dopaminergic punishment signal with the regulation of mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism. This advancement will enable a more precise molecular distinction of various memory phases and a deeper comprehension of their formation in the future.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Apart from a few minor technical issues, such as the not entirely convincing visualisation of the localisation of a PKCδ reporter in the mitochondria, there are no major weaknesses. Likewise, the scientific classification of the results seems appropriate, although a somewhat more extensive discussion in relation to Drosophila would have been desirable.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>
This study deepens the former authors' investigations of the mechanisms involved in gating the long-term consolidation of an associative memory (LTM) in Drosophila melanogaster. After having previously found that LTM consolidation 1. costs energy (Plaçais and Préat, Science 2013) provided through pyruvate metabolism (Plaçais et al., Nature Comm 2017) and 2. is gated by the increased tonic activity in a type of dopaminergic neurons ('MP1 neurons') following only training protocol relevant for LTM, i.e. interspaced in time (Plaçais et al., Nature Neuro 2012), they here dig into the intra-cell signalling triggered by dopamine input and eventually responsible for the increased mitochondria activity in Kenyon Cells. They identify a particular PKC, PKCδ, as a major molecular interface in this process and describe its translocation to mitochondria to promote pyruvate metabolism, specifically after spaced training.</p>
<p>Methodological approach</p>
<p>
To that end, they use RNA interference against the isozyme PKCδ, in a time-controlled way and in the whole Kenyon cell populations or in the subpopulation forming the α/β lobe. This knock-down decreased the total PKCδ mRNA level in the brain by ca. 30%, and is enough to observe decreased in flies performances for LTM consolidation. Using Pyronic, a sensor for pyruvate for in vivo imaging, and pharmacological disruption of mitochondrial function, the authors then show that PKCδ knock-down prevents a high level of pyruvate from accumulating in the Kenyon cells at the time of LTM consolidation, pointing towards a role of PKCδ in promoting pyruvate metabolism. They further identify the PDH kinase PDK as a likely target for PKCδ since knocking down both PKCδ and PDK led to normal LTM performances, likely counterbalancing PKCδ knock-down alone.</p>
<p>To understand the timeline of PKCδ activation and to visualise its mitochondrial translocation in a subpart of Mushroom body lobes they imported in fruitfly the genetically-encoded FRET reporters of PKCδ, δCKAR, and mitochondria-δCKAR (Kajimoto et al 2010). They show that PKCδ is activated to the sensor's saturation only after spaced training, and not other types of training that are 'irrelevant' for LTM. Further, adding thermogenetic activation of dopaminergic neurons and RNA interference against Gq-coupled dopamine receptor to FRET imaging, they identify that a dopamine-triggered cascade is sufficient for the elevated PKCδ-activation.</p>
<p>Strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p>
The authors use a combination of new fluorescent sensors and behavioral, imaging, and pharmacological protocols they already established to successfully identify the molecular players that bridge the requirement for spaced training/dopaminergic neurons MP1 oscillatory activity and the increased metabolic activity observed during long-term memory consolidation.</p>
<p>The study is dense in new exciting findings and each methodological step is carefully designed. Almost all possible experiments one could think of to make this link have been done in this study, with a few exceptions that do not prevent the essential conclusions from being drawn.</p>
<p>The discussion is well conducted, with interesting parallels with mammals, where the possibility that this process takes place as well is yet unknown.</p>
<p>Impact</p>
<p>
Their findings should interest a large audience:</p>
<p>
They discover and investigate a new function for PKCδ in regulating memory processes in neurons in conjunction with other physiological functions, making this molecule a potentially valid target for neuropathological conditions. They also provide new tools in drosophila to measure PKCδ activation in cells. They identify the major players for lifting the energetic limitations preventing the formation of a long-term memory.</p>
