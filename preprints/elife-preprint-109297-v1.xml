<abstract><p>Mating in insects commonly induces an alteration in behavior and physiology in the female that ensures optimal offspring. This is referred to as a post-mating response (PMR). The induction of a PMR requires not only male-derived factors transferred with semen during copulation, such as sex peptide (SP) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but also intrinsic female signaling components. The latter signaling remains poorly understood in most insects, including the brown planthopper (BPH) <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic>, a devastating rice pest. In BPHs the PMR comprises a reduced receptivity to re-mating and increased oviposition. Here, we demonstrate that the neuropeptide corazonin (CRZ) and its receptor (CrzR) are critical for the PMR in female BPHs. Peptide injection and knockdown of CRZ expression by RNAi or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis demonstrate that distensible CRZ signaling suppresses mating receptivity in virgin <italic>N. lugens</italic> females and mediates a reduction in re-mating frequency and increased ovulation. The <italic>CrzR</italic> is highly expressed in the female reproductive tract, and <italic>CrzR</italic>-knockdown phenocopies <italic>Crz</italic> diminishment. Importantly, female <italic>CRZ/CrzR</italic> signaling is indispensable for male seminal fluid factors (e.g. maccessin) to induce the PMR. With disrupted <italic>CrzR</italic> signaling, seminal fluid or maccessin injection fails to reduce female receptivity. Notably, CRZ is not produced in male accessory gland (MAG) and thus not transferred during copulation. However, male <italic>Crz</italic> knockout impairs the PMR in mated females and combining male and female <italic>Crz</italic> knockouts nearly abolished the PMR, demonstrating that CRZ is essential for PMR generation. Transcriptomics of the MAG indicates that <italic>Crz</italic> knockout affects the expression of numerous seminal fluid protein genes. Finally, we found that also in female <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, disrupted <italic>Crz</italic> signaling resulted in increased re-mating and reduced oviposition, while CRZ injection suppressed virgin receptivity and increased oviposition. In summary, our study reveals that endogenous female CRZ signaling and male-derived signals cooperate to regulate post-mating transitions in BPHs and <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Reproductive behavior is critical for population sustenance and survival of species, and is influenced by a complex array of internal conditions, environmental factors, and social interactions. In insects, males typically initiate mating through courtship, while females determine acceptance by integrating external sensory stimuli with their internal state. Consequently, female reproductive activity is modulated by multiple signaling pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In insects, successful copulation commonly induces profound physiological and behavioral changes in the females <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Following their first mating, insect females typically reject further courtship attempts and initiate oviposition. This distinct shift in behavior and physiology is referred to as a post-mating response (PMR) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. A PMR has been documented across diverse insect taxa, including <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti</italic> and the brown planthopper (BPH), <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Induction of a PMR commonly requires the transfer of specific seminal fluid components during copulation. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, seminal fluid peptides, including sex peptide (SP) and DUP99B produced in male accessory glands (MAG), enter the female reproductive tract, bind to specific receptors on sensory neurons, and activate signaling pathways that drive post-mating behavior and physiology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Additional factors such as Acp26Ab and ovulin (Acp26Aa) are also transferred with the seminal fluid and modulate female reproductive physiology in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Notably, it has been shown that the PMR-inducing substances, produced in the MAG of various insects, are highly species-specific and not even conserved across related taxonomic groups <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While MAG-derived sex peptide (SP) and its receptor (SPR) are key regulators of the female post-mating response (PMR) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, additional signaling pathways intrinsic to females also modulate this process. Interneurons within abdominal neuromeres of the ventral nerve cord (VNC) promote receptivity to males by signaling via myoinhibitory peptide (MIP) to brain circuits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the neuropeptide diuretic hormone 44 (DH44) modulates female sexual receptivity through a sex-specific brain circuit; mating suppresses DH44 signaling, thereby reducing receptivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. During sexual maturation, leucokinin (LK)-expressing neurons (ABLKs) in the abdominal ganglion, downstream of SP-activated circuitry, suppress female receptivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. In addition to changes in receptivity, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PMR includes a shift in diet preference toward yeast consumption. This altered feeding behavior is mediated by specific peptidergic neurons (ALKs) in the brain through LK signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Although the mechanisms and neuronal pathways underlying the post-mating response (PMR) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are well characterized <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, this process remains poorly understood in most non-model insects. A prominent example is the brown planthopper (BPH), <italic>N. lugens</italic> (Hemiptera). As a monophagous rice pest, the BPH exhibits robust reproductive capacity and remarkable environmental adaptability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. It has also developed high resistance to diverse chemical pesticides <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Consequently, elucidating reproductive physiology and behavior in BPHs is crucial for developing novel control strategies.</p>
<p>In BPHs, the recently identified MAG-derived peptide maccessin (macc) is transferred during copulation and triggers a PMR in females, although its receptor remains unknown <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Notably, the same study demonstrated that a second peptide, ion transport-like peptide 1 (ITPL-1), also modulates the PMR. Whereas macc is male-specific, ITPL-1 is produced both in the MAG and endogenously in females, where it reduces female receptivity to courting males <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Given its endogenous female expression, ITPL-1 likely functions as an intrinsic signaling component in the PMR of BPHs, analogous to the role of myoinhibitory peptide (MIP) and DH44 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> females <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we explored the role of another neuropeptide, corazonin (CRZ), in the reproductive behavior of BPHs. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> males, CRZ is released from interneurons of the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and acts on serotonergic projection neurons to regulate ejaculation and copulation duration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Additionally, CRZ release in males during mating mitigates mating-induced heart rate acceleration, to promote physiological recovery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. CRZ furthermore influences post-mating dietary preference in males <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, the role of CRZ signaling in female reproduction remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we examined the role of CRZ in female reproduction, including the PMR, in BPH and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that CRZ induces a post-mating switch in receptivity in females of both BPH and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Notably, CRZ injection in virgin females diminishes receptivity to courting males, while <italic>Crz</italic> knockdown or knockout in mated females renders them receptive to further mating. Importantly, CRZ is not produced in the MAG, and thus not transferred from males, but acts as an endogenously produced peptide in females. Furthermore, we detected strong expression of the CRZ receptor (<italic>CrzR</italic>) in the female reproductive tract of BPHs. We demonstrated that both CRISPR-Cas9-mediated <italic>CrzR</italic> knockout and RNAi-mediated <italic>CrzR</italic> knockdown disrupt the PMR, phenocopying <italic>Crz</italic> knockdown. Critically, we could show that the level of receptivity to mating in virgin females, whether by MAG extract (with seminal fluid proteins) injection or macc injection, is strictly dependent on presence of the <italic>CrzR</italic> receptor. Importantly, manipulations of CRZ signaling in female <italic>Drosophila</italic> yield similar effects on receptivity and oviposition. Interestingly, we find that knockdown or knockout of <italic>Crz</italic> in male <italic>N. lugens</italic> does not affect male copulation behavior, but <italic>Crz</italic> deficient males do not induce a full PMR in mated females. Notably, knockout of <italic>Crz</italic> in both male and female partners results in an almost complete abolishment of the PMR. Since CRZ is not produced in the MAG we performed a transcriptomic analysis of the MAG in <italic>Crz</italic> mutants to screen for other candidate CRZ-regulated genes affecting the PMR. We found altered expression of a large number of genes, containing seminal protein genes, but no change in the genes encoding <italic>macc</italic> and <italic>ITPL-1</italic>, suggesting presence of other MAG factors, yet to be identified. In summary, our findings strengthen the notion that the female PMR requires not only transfer of male-derived factors, but also endogenous female neuropeptide signaling components.</p>

<title>CRZ signaling reduces receptivity to courting males and stimulates oviposition in <italic>N. lugens</italic> females</title>
<p>While numerous studies have established roles of the neuropeptide CRZ in regulating aspects of male reproduction across diverse insect species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, research addressing its potential functions in female reproduction remains conspicuously lacking.</p>
<p>This study investigates the role of CRZ in female reproduction, starting with the brown planthopper (BPH), <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic>, a major agricultural pest. Initially, the <italic>Crz</italic> gene (GenBank accession: AB817247.1) was cloned based on transcriptome data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. The deduced mature CRZ sequence in BPH, pQTFQYSRGWTNamide, is identical to that reported for most studied insect species (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with other known CRZ precursors, the BPH precursor encodes a single CRZ peptide starting at the first amino acid of the propeptide (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref> and B). A comparison of the organization of selected CRZ precursor genes is shown in <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>. Genomic analysis revealed that the CRZ precursor is encoded by two exons separated by a single intron (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>). The mature CRZ peptide and a scrambled control peptide (sCRZ) were synthesized for pharmacological experiments.</p>
<p>First, we investigated the role of CRZ signaling in the reproductive behavior and PMR of female BPHs. The PMR in BPHs, is characterized by reduced receptivity to courting males, including display of rejection behaviors, and increased oviposition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. This response is partially induced by the male-derived peptide maccessin (macc), transferred during copulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. We found that injection of CRZ significantly reduced receptivity of virgin female BPHs to courting males (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and B). Furthermore, virgin females injected with CRZ actively rejected courting males, exhibiting a distinct rejection behavior characterized by ovipositor extrusion and kicking or fleeing. This behavior was not observed in control females injected with sCRZ (<xref rid="supp1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 - Supplementary Video 1</xref>). Notably, the CRZ-induced mating refusal behavior in virgin females was no longer observed 24 hours after injection (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2A</xref>). While injection of CRZ peptide did not stimulate egg production in virgin BPHs (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2B</xref>), it significantly promoted oviposition in mated females (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>To further investigate CRZ action, we performed RNA interference (RNAi) by injecting double-stranded <italic>Crz</italic> RNA (<italic>dsNlcrz</italic>) into female BPHs, which efficiently reduced <italic>Crz</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>Crz</italic> resulted in increased receptivity with 10% of the mated females mating again, and significantly reduced oviposition to approximately 60% of control levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and F). In contrast, <italic>Crz</italic> knockdown had no effect on the receptivity of virgin females (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>Since RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>Crz</italic> in female BPHs left a residual level of gene expression (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2</xref>), we generated two <italic>Crz</italic> deletion alleles, Δ<italic>Crz<sup>1</sup></italic> and Δ<italic>Crz<sup>2</sup></italic>, using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G-G</xref>’) to achieve a complete ablation. Both alleles harbor deletions eliminating the mature CRZ peptide coding sequence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>’’). Sanger sequencing confirmed that the deletions compromised essential triplet codons within the <italic>Crz</italic> open reading frame (<xref rid="fig1s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 4</xref>), thereby efficiently disrupting CRZ peptide expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>’’ and H). Immunohistochemical analysis further validated the mutants, revealing a complete absence of anti-CRZ immunolabeling in homozygous Δ<italic>Crz<sup>1</sup></italic> and Δ<italic>Crz<sup>2</sup></italic>females (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Homozygous Δ<italic>Crz<sup>1</sup></italic> and Δ<italic>Crz<sup>2</sup></italic> virgin females are fully viable and fertile. They exhibit a courtship vigor similar to controls and their initial mating success rate with wild-type males exceeds 60% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I and J</xref>). However, 25% of the mated mutant females were receptive to further mating (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>), and oviposition was significantly reduced to approximately 50% of the wild-type levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that diminished CRZ signaling severely perturbs the PMR in female BPHs, seen as increased post-mating receptivity and reduced egg-laying. Importantly, the <italic>Crz</italic> deletion abolished the onset of typical post-mating rejection behavior. We, thus, conclude that endogenous CRZ signaling is important for the induction of a PMR in female BPHs.</p>

<p>A previous study reported CRZ expression in four male-specific interneurons within the abdominal ganglia of <italic>Drosophila</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. To determine whether CRZ exhibits sexually dimorphic expression in BPHs, we performed immunolabeling using an anti-CRZ antiserum. This labeled four pairs of neurons in the protocerebrum of the brain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D and E</xref>) and one pair of neurons in the subesophageal ganglion in both males and females (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D and E</xref>). Since CRZ immunolabeled neurons in brains of most, if not all, insects studied include three or more pairs of lateral neurosecretory cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, we suggest that CRZ signaling regulating the PMR may be hormonal (at least in part). Importantly, no CRZ-immunopositive neurons were detected in the abdominal ganglia of either sex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D and E</xref>), and thus there is no evidence for sex-specific expression of CRZ neurons in BPHs. This is in contrast to <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where we confirmed, as previously reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, the presence of CRZ-immunolabeled neurons specifically in the abdominal ganglia of males (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>To exclude that CRZ acts as a seminal fluid peptide transferred to females during copulation, similar to sex peptide (SP) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and macc in BPHs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, we specifically examined CRZ expression in reproductive tissues of both sexes. However, we observed no CRZ immunolabeling in the male reproductive organs (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1B1 - B3</xref>) or female reproductive organs (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1B4</xref> – B6). This aligns with our transcriptional <italic>Crz</italic> data shown above (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Crz</italic> mRNA and CRZ protein were absent from transcriptomic and proteomic datasets of the male accessory glands (MAGs) in BPHs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.

These structures are the primary sites for long-term sperm storage. Specificity was validated by absence of signal in sense-probe controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D3 - D4’</xref>). This enrichment in sperm storage organs suggests that CRZ signaling may modulate post-mating physiology in part by regulating the mobilization of stored sperm and seminal fluid.</p>
<p>Notably, while CrzR is highly expressed in the female reproductive tract, we acknowledge that RT-PCR and qPCR analyses also detected low but detectable CrzR expression in other tissues, including the CNS and fat body (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-C</xref>). Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that <italic>CrzR</italic> in the brain (e.g., by modulating neural circuits governing reproductive behavior) or fat body (e.g., by affecting post-mating metabolism and nutrient/energy allocation) may also contribute to the PMR. These non-reproductive tract sites of CrzR expression warrant further investigation to fully delineate the systemic roles of CRZ/CrzR signaling in female PMR regulation.</p>

<p>Since the male mating success rate in some cases was affected by CRZ, we made sure that the female PMR defects do not stem from incomplete male mating: all females included in our PMR analyses were mated with males that had completed full, successful copulation (i.e., completed all mating steps, including seminal fluid transfer, as verified by behavioral observation and subsequent validation of sperm presence in female reproductive tracts). Strikingly, even with fully successful mating, females mated with CRZ-injected males displayed a severely impaired PMR: nearly 30% of these females re-mated within the test window (vs. 0% of females mated with sCRZ-injected controls) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), and their oviposition was significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Although CRZ injection did not quantitatively change the total protein content of the MAG (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1C</xref>), we hypothesize that it alters the composition of seminal fluid proteins, consistent with findings in the oriental fruit moth <italic>Grapholita molesta</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> and thereby reducing the ability to induce a robust female PMR. In male BPHs, RNAi-mediated knockdown of the <italic>Crz</italic> transcript (via dsNlCrz injection) had no significant effect on key male reproductive behavior: mating success rate (proportion of males that complete copulation), courtship rate (proportion of males exhibiting courtship behaviors such as following or wing display), and copulation duration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and E, <xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref> and D). However, females mated with <italic>dsNlCrz</italic>-injected males exhibited a defective PMR: about 10% remated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>) and laid approximately 60% fewer eggs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Consistent with the RNAi results, males carrying <italic>Crz</italic> mutant alleles (Δ<italic>Crz<sup>1</sup> or</italic> Δ<italic>Crz<sup>2</sup></italic>) also failed to elicit a full PMR in mated females, despite displaying normal courtship behavior and mating success (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref> and F). Specifically, ∼25% of the females mated with <italic>Crz</italic> mutant males accepted re-mating (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G and H</xref>), and their egg production was halved compared to females mated with wild-type males (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, when <italic>Crz</italic> mutant males were crossed with <italic>Crz</italic> mutant females, the PMR defects were dramatically exacerbated: the re-mating rate of females surged to nearly 50%, and egg production plummeted by ∼75% relative to wild-type male-female pairs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref> - L). This near-complete ablation of the PMR underscores that intact CRZ signaling in both sexes is indispensable for triggering a robust PMR in female BPHs.</p>

<title>CRZ signaling in male BPHs alters seminal fluid composition</title>
<p>The observation that manipulating <italic>Crz</italic> (via knockdown or mutation) in male BPHs affects the female PMR is particularly intriguing, prompting us to investigate the underlying mechanism. Since we had ruled out production of CRZ in the male reproductive system, including the male accessory gland (MAG), we set out to test whether males with impaired CRZ signaling exhibit defects in basic reproductive performance (e.g., mating success, sperm production/transfer).</p>
<p>To eliminate confounding effects of abnormal sperm production or transfer, we first assessed some key parameters: spermathecal size in females mated to wild-type (WT) or Δ<italic>Crz<sup>1</sup></italic> males showed no significant differences (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), and sperm counts in the testes of unmated Δ<italic>Crz<sup>1</sup></italic> males (vs. WT) and in the spermathecae of females mated to Δ<italic>Crz<sup>1</sup></italic> males (vs. WT) were comparable (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). These data confirm intact sperm production and transfer, pointing to potential alterations in seminal fluid composition as the driver of female PMR defects. This led us to focus on the protein production in the MAG, encouraged by prior work in the oriental fruit moth (<italic>G. molesta</italic>) where it was shown that CRZ signaling modulates biosynthetic activity in the MAG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>To approach this, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on MAGs from WT and Δ<italic>Crz<sup>1</sup></italic> males.

<p>Consistent with transcriptional dysregulation, the total protein content of Δ<italic>Crz<sup>1</sup></italic> male MAGs was significantly lower than that of WT MAGs, as quantified by the Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) assay (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study unveils a novel function of CRZ in an endogenous female signaling pathway that modulates the post-mating reproductive behavior and physiology (collectively PMR) in BPHs. It is, thus, the first report linking CRZ to a PMR in insects. In contrast to SP and DUP99B in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, HP-1 in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and maccessin (macc) recently identified in BPHs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, CRZ is not produced in the MAG, and thus not transferred from males during copulation. Instead, it is acting as an endogenous peptide derived from neuroendocrine cells in the female brain. Moreover, this CRZ-mediated endogenous modulation in females is seen also in <italic>Drosophila.</italic> When <italic>Crz</italic> is knocked down or knocked out in flies, mated females likewise exhibit an altered PMR.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found that in BPH males, endogenous CRZ acts on the MAG to affect biosynthesis of seminal fluid proteins (SFP), similar to another insect, the lepidopteran <italic>Grapholita molesta</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. That study revealed that silencing the <italic>Crz</italic> gene results in a downregulation of multiple genes in the MAG, including several serine-type endopeptidases, however, the authors did not analyze the effect on the female PMR. Our experiments demonstrate that with impaired CRZ signaling in males the seminal fluid appears to lack some component(s) necessary for inducing a PMR since females mated by <italic>Crz</italic> knockdown males display a reduced PMR. Our gene expression data reveals that neither <italic>macc</italic> nor <italic>ITP-L1</italic> are among the MAG genes affected by <italic>Crz</italic> knockout. These are encoding peptides that are known to induce a partial PMR in female BPHs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Our results therefore suggest that there are additional PMR-inducing factors produced by the MAG of BPHs and that these are regulated by CRZ. Further work is required to identify these factors, but from the present data we can conclude that in BPHs, CRZ signaling influences the female PMR both by action in males and females, but in distinct ways. Similar to our CRZ findings here, a possible dual role of ITPL-1 was also seen in BPHs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. This peptide is produced in the MAG, but also in tissues of female BPHs, and knockdown in males results in a reduced PMR in females <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Focusing on the endogenous CRZ signaling in female BPHs, our main findings using mutants and RNAi of both <italic>Crz</italic> and <italic>CrzR</italic>, demonstrate that CRZ signaling decreases the female responsiveness to courting males, especially in already mated females. Also, oviposition in mated BPHs is increased by CRZ signaling. CRZ immunolabeling revealed a small set of neurons in the brain and subesophageal ganglion and no CRZ was detected in reproductive organs. Thus, the likely source of CRZ affecting the PMR is the CRZ-producing neuroendocrine cells in the brain. In insects studied so far (including other hemipterans), there are at least three pairs of CRZ expressing lateral neurosecretory cells with axon terminations in the corpora cardiaca <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, suggesting that in BPHs and <italic>Drosophila</italic> hormonal CRZ may contribute to the modulation of the PMR. However local CRZ signaling in brain circuits cannot be excluded since the CRZ neurons arborize extensively within the brain.</p>
<p>We found that the CRZ receptor, <italic>CrzR</italic>, is predominantly expressed in the female reproductive tract in BPHs, more specifically in the lower tract including the spermatheca and pouched gland, which are sites of sperm and seminal fluid storage. Thus, in BPHs, CRZ may act to regulate the release of stored sperm and seminal fluid in the female. This regulation would also gate the flow of male-derived factors that induce and maintain the PMR, such as macc and ITPL-1. As mentioned, we cannot exclude additional action of CRZ in neuronal circuits in the CNS that regulate female sexual arousal and reproductive behavior, since our PCR data indicate expression of the <italic>CrzR</italic> also in the CNS. Additionally, the fat body of BPHs, express <italic>CrzR</italic>, similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, possibly suggesting a role of CRZ in post-mating metabolism.</p>
<p>The brain CRZ neurons of BPHs are likely to be activated by sensory signals from the female reproductive tract upon copulation and hence release CRZ into the circulation (and maybe within the brain). In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> sensory neurons in the reproductive tract are activated by SP (via the SP receptor), and signal via a chain of ascending axons of the VNC to sex-specific neurons in the brain to induce the PMR switch in behavior and physiology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Thus, in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> these sex-specific circuits may also activate the CRZ neurons. Possibly similar sensory and sex-specific neurons exist in BPHs and respond either to mechanical stimuli or factors in the seminal fluid leading to activation of CRZ neurons and other brain neurons that regulate the PMR.</p>
<p>The female PMR is complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and not only receptivity and oviposition are affected, but also feeding, metabolism, sleep patterns and aggression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. In BPHs only the receptivity (and associated rejection behavior) and oviposition have been analyzed in any detail. We found that the MAG-derived peptides transferred with the semen, macc and ITPL-1, only affected the receptivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, whereas we show here that CRZ affects also oviposition. Thus, we have identified three different peptides CRZ, macc and ITPL-1 that all influence the PMR in different ways, suggesting complex regulatory mechanisms also in BPHs.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that CRZ is an evolutionarily conserved neuropeptide that has been found in most, but not all, insect species and it displays a wide array of functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. The CRZ function varies across different insect species, but a common role seems to be in regulation of stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Other functions are for example: in the American cockroach, CRZ accelerates the heart rate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, in locusts, it triggers the formation of pigments that darken the body color in gregarious insects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, in the moth <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, CRZ affects developmental speed and reduces the rate of silk spinning behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>; in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, CRZ regulates molting motor behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> and growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>; in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRZ regulates stress responses, food intake and metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, and protein food preference <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, as well as sperm ejection and mating duration in males <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>; and in social ants, it regulates the social hierarchy and inhibits egg-laying in the queen <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Finally, a recent study found that CRZ mediates a diapause-induced suppression of reproduction in female bean bugs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. To all these functions can now be added the role of CRZ in reproductive behavior and physiology of BPHs, especially in the female PMR of BPHs and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, we also found a role of CRZ signaling in regulating the production of seminal fluid proteins in the MAG. Finally, building on the role of CRZ in metabolism in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, it is possible that CRZ also regulates post-mating metabolism in female BPHs. Thus, there may be a link between CRZ and the altered feeding and metabolism commonly seen in mated female insects.</p>

<title>Mating and receptivity</title>
<p>All BPHs were raised in incubator<underline>s</underline> with a 16 h:8 h dark:light cycle. Unmated female and male BPHs were collected within 12 hours of emergence. For RNAi or neuropeptide injection treatment, the protocol is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>. The mating behavior (or female receptivity behavior) test in this study usually conducted the first mating between 3 and 5 days after emergence. The mating experiment was completed in a plastic tube (2.5cm in diameter and 10cm in height). Fresh rice seedlings of appropriate length were placed in each tube, and then a female and male BPHs were added. The mating conditions and other reproductive behavior parameters during this period were observed in a constant temperature room at 25℃ for 30min, and the males were taken out after 30 min. For the experiment requiring a second mating, females successfully mated for the first time were retained. After 48 hours, wild-type males were put in for the re-mating test. The males in all secondary mating experiments were wild type. The monitoring time for each mating behavior was 30 minutes; the receptivity rate refers to the proportion of successful matings of female individuals within the 30-minute measurement period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5b2">
<title>Egg laying</title>
<p>After completing the first mating, the male is sucked out and a sufficient number of rice seedlings are added to the tube, and the female is retained to lay eggs in the tube. After 72 hours, the spawning female is transferred out of the tube. After the eggs have matured, about 4-5 days later, we used tweezers to gently manipulate the rice seedlings and counted the number of fertilized eggs produced by the females. Note that 4 to 5 days after the egg is produced, the successfully fertilized egg will display red eye-spots. (Oviposition assay protocol: For quantitative assessment of post-mating responses, egg-laying activity was monitored over a 72-hour observation window following verified initial copulation. To eliminate confounding effects from sequential mating trials, experimental subjects undergoing oviposition measurement were permanently excluded from subsequent re-mating evaluations.)</p>
<p>To determine the oviposition profile of females injected with CRZ peptide. virgin female or mated female BPHs that had emerged 3-5 days earlier were transferred into plastic tubes with sufficient amount of rice seedlings 6h after recovery from CRZ injection, and the BPHs were taken out 24 hours later, using tweezers to gently dissect the rice seedlings the number of fertilized eggs produced by the females were counted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5b3">
<title>Courtship rate</title>
<p>During the mating assessment, an unmated (virgin) female and an unmated male BPH was placed in a plastic tube containing rice seedlings. The occurence of courtship behavior in the male individuals was recorded, which included a series of courtship actions such as following, wing display, licking, and attempting to mate. The proportion of individuals displaying courtship behavior among all experimental individuals is defined as the courtship rate.</p>

<sec id="s5b4">
<title>Copulation duration</title>
<p>During the mating assessment, an unmated (virgin) female and an unmated male BPH were placed in a plastic tube containing rice seedlings. Timing begins when mating behavior is observed between the female and male, and stops immediately after completed copulation. The duration from the start of the mating behavior to its conclusion is defined as the mating duration.</p>

<title>Behavior assays of Drosophila melanogaster</title>
<p>Mating and re-mating : During the receptivity assessment, all experimental fruit flies were virgin flies that emerged within 12 hours in a 20°C incubator in a 12 h:12 h dark:light cycle. After collection, they were kept at 25°C incubator in a 12 h:12 h dark:light cycle for 4 days before behavioral testing. Receptivity behavior measurement : a perforated plate was placed on top of a non-perforated plate. Male fruit flies were briefly anesthetized on ice and gently transferred into the holes of the perforated plate, with one male per hole. Once the male transfer was completed, a plastic film was gently placed over the perforated plate, followed by covering it with another perforated plate. Then, the virgin female fruit fly, also anesthetized on ice, was placed in each hole. After the transfer was completed, a non-perforated plate was placed on top. This setup was then transferred to a 25°C incubator to acclimate for 30 minutes. The plastic film separating the male and female flies was quickly removed, and video recording began for 30 minutes. The recorded videos were analyzed to calculate the acceptance rate of the females. Successful mating females were collected and individually transferred into plastic tubes containing sufficient artificial food for fruit flies to lay eggs. After 24 hours of laying eggs, the female flies were transferred to a new finger-shaped tube with ample artificial feed for another 24 hours of laying. After 48 hours, these egg-laying females were subjected to a secondary mating assessment with wild-type, unmated males, using the same method as described above, to evaluate the acceptance rate during the second mating process. Additionally, the number of eggs laid by each female during the 48 hours was recorded.</p>
<p>Egg laying for mated females : First, collect virgin female fruit flies that eclosion within 12 hours at 20°C incubator in a 12 h:12 h dark:light cycle and then keep them in a 25°C incubator in a 12 h:12 h dark:light cycle for 4 days. After that, unmated males of the wild type and virgin females were mixed 1:1.5 times. 24 hours after full mating, female flies were lightly anesthetized with ice and transferred to plastic vials containing enough artificial fruit fly food for them to lay eggs for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the flies were transferred again to a new bottle full of artificial food for another 24 hours of egg laying. The number of eggs in each vial is calculated under a microscope, and the total number of eggs in the two vials of each female fruit fly represents the egg-laying capacity of that individual.</p>

<title>Developmental duration statistics</title>
<p>Nymphs of BPHs that hatched synchronously from distinct genotypes were collected and reared in plastic cups containing fresh rice seedlings; the seedlings were replaced regularly to maintain optimal conditions. From the day the nymphs reached the fifth instar, cups were inspected daily for adult emergence, and the number of newly emerged adults was recorded. After all surviving individuals had completed eclosion, the total nymph-to-adult developmental duration was calculated.</p>

<title>BPHs survival rate statistics</title>
<p>For neuropeptide injection: After 4-day emergence, virgin BPHs were injected with CRZ neuropeptide or scrambled CRZ, and after 6 hours of recovery, these insects were placed into a plastic tube with sufficient quantity of rice seedlings. Survival was monitored every 24 hours until all specimens were dead.</p>
<p>For mutant: Wild-type and mutant BPHs adults that eclosed on the same day were individually confined in plastic tubes, each supplied with ample fresh rice seedlings and water renewed regularly to ensure optimal living and nutritional conditions. The number of surviving individuals of each genotype was recorded every 24 h until all had died, and survival curves were generated from these data.</p>

<title>Neuropeptide synthesis and injection</title>
<p>Corazonin (CRZ) and scrambled CRZ (sCRZ) were synthesized by Genscript Co. Ltd (Nanjing, China). Peptide masses were confirmed by Mass spectrometry and the amount of peptide was quantified by amino acid analysis. The amino acid sequences of the peptides used in this study are: <italic>N. lugens</italic> corazonin: <underline>pQ</underline>TFQYSRGWNamide; scrambled corazonin: <underline>pQ</underline>SRYTTFGQWTNamide. On the fourth day after adult emergence, virgin female BPHs were injected with different concentrations of synthetic CRZ peptide and control scrambled peptide. The scrambled peptide control was used to monitor for potential non-specific effects on behavior due to the process of injection. Each mg peptide was dissolved in 100 μl DMSO solution (Acmec, #D54264), and then diluted to 1.5 mM, 0.15 mM, 0.015 mM and 0.0015 mM with 1×PBS as solvent. The BPHs were anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub> for about 30 seconds and placed abdomen up on 2% agarose (Solarbia, #A8201) plate and 50 nl neuropeptide solution injected into each female, 30 nl neuropeptide solution injected into each male.

<p>In this work, Zhang et al, through a series of well-designed experiments, present a comprehensive study exploring the roles of the neuropeptide Corazonin (CRZ) and its receptor in controlling the female post-mating response (PMR) in the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugen and Drosophila melanogaster. Through a series of behavioural assays, micro-injections, gene knockdowns, Crispr/Cas gene editing, and immunostaining, the authors show that both CRZ and CrzR play a vital role in the female post-mating response, with impaired expression of either leading to quicker female remating and reduced ovulation in BPH. Notably, the authors find that this signaling is entirely endogenous in BPH females, with immunostaining of male accessory glands (MAGs) showing no evidence of CRZ expression. Further, the authors demonstrate that while CRZ is not expressed in the MAGs, BPH males with Crz knocked out show transcriptional dysregulation of several seminal fluid proteins and functionally link this dysregulation to an impaired PMR in BPH. In relation, the authors also find that in CrzR mutants, the injection of neither MAG extracts nor maccessin peptide triggered the PMR in BPH females. Finally, the authors extend this study to D. melanogaster, albeit on a more limited scale, and show that CRZ plays a vital role in maintaining PMR in D. melanogaster females with impaired CRZ signaling, once again leading to quicker female remating and reduced ovulation. The authors must be commended for their expansive set of complementary experiments. The manuscript is also generally well written. Given the seemingly conserved nature of CRZ, this work is a significant addition to the literature, opening several avenues for testing the molecular and neurobiological mechanisms in which CRZ triggers the PMR.</p>
<p>However, there are some broad concerns/comments I had with this manuscript. The authors provide clear evidence that CRZ signaling plays a major role in the PMR of D. melanogaster, however, they provide no evidence that CRZ signaling is endogenous, as they did not check for expression in the MAGs of D. melanogaster males. Additionally, while the authors show that manipulating Crz in males leads to dysregulated seminal fluid expression and impaired PMR in BPH, the authors also find that CRZ injection in males in and of itself impairs PMR in BPH. The authors do not really address what this seemingly contradictory result could mean. While a lot of the figures have replicate numbers, the authors do not factor in replicate as an effect into their models, which they ideally should do.</p>
<p>Finally, while the discussion is generally well-written, it lacks a broader conclusion about the wider implications of this study and what future work building on this could look like.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The work presented by Zhang and coauthors in this manuscript presents the study of the neuropeptide corazonin in modulating the post-mating response of the brown planthopper, with further validation in Drosophila melanogaster. To obtain their results, the authors used several different techniques that orthogonally demonstrate the involvement of corazonin signalling in regulating the female post-mating response in these species.</p>
<p>They first injected synthetic corazonin peptide into female brown planthoppers, showing altered mating receptivity in virgin females and a higher number of eggs laid after mating. The role of corazonin in controlling these post-mating traits has been further validated by knocking down the expression of the corazonin gene by RNA interference and through CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis of the gene. Further proof of the importance of corazonin signalling in regulating the female post-mating response has been achieved by knocking down the expression or mutagenizing the gene coding for the corazonin receptor.</p>
<p>Similar results have been obtained in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting that corazonin signalling is involved in controlling the female post-mating response in multiple insect species.</p>
<p>
Notably, the authors also show that corazonin controls gene expression in the male accessory glands and that disruption of this pathway in males compromises their ability to elicit normal post-mating responses in their mates.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study of the signalling pathways controlling the female post-mating response in insects other than Drosophila is scarce, and this limits the ability of biologists to draw conclusions about the evolution of the post-mating response in female insects. This is particularly relevant in the context of understanding how sexual conflict might work at the molecular and genetic levels, and how, ultimately, speciation might occur at this level. Furthermore, the study of the post-mating response could have practical implications, as it can lead to the development of control techniques, such as sterilization agents.</p>
<p>The study, therefore, expands the knowledge of one of the signalling pathways that control the female post-mating response, the corazonin neuropeptide. This pathway is involved in controlling the post-mating response in both Nilaparvata lugens (the brown planthopper) and Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting its involvement in multiple insect species.</p>
<p>The study uses multiple molecular approaches to convincingly demonstrate that corazonin controls the female post-mating response.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The data supporting the main claims of the manuscript are solid and convincing. The statistical analysis of some of the data might be improved, particularly by tailoring the analysis to the type of data that has been collected.</p>
<p>In the case of the corazonin effect in females, all the data are coherent; in the case of CRISPR-Cas9-induced mutagenesis, the analysis of the behavioural trait in heterozygotes might have helped in understanding the haplosufficiency of the gene and would have further proved the authors' point.</p>
<p>Less consistency was achieved in males (Figure 5): the authors show that injection of CRZ and RNAi of crz, or mutant crz, has the same effect on male fitness. However, the CRZ injection should activate the pathway, and crz RNAi and mutant crz should inhibit the pathway, yet they have the same effect. A comment about this discrepancy would have improved the clarity of the manuscript, pointing to new points that need to be clarified and opening new scientific discussion.</p>
