<title>Abstract</title><p>Most animals possess functionally distinct population of taste cells, expressing receptors that are tuned to compounds of different valence. This organizational feature allows for discrimination between chemicals associated with different taste modalities and facilitates sensing of foods contaminated with toxic chemicals. In the fruit fly <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, primary sensory neurons express taste receptors that are tuned to distinct chemicals, thereby activating neural ensembles that elicit either feeding or avoidance behavior. Members of a family of ligand gated receptor channels, the Gustatory receptors (Gr), play a central role in these behaviors. In general, closely related, evolutionarily conserved Gr proteins are co-expressed in the same type of taste neurons, tuned to chemically related compounds and therefore triggering the same behavioral response. Here, we report that members of the Gr28 subfamily are expressed in largely non-overlapping sets of taste neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, detect chemicals of different valence and trigger opposing feeding behaviors. We determined the intrinsic properties of <italic>Gr28</italic> neurons by expressing the mammalian Vanilloid Receptor (VR1), which is activated by capsaicin, a chemical to which wild type <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae do not respond. When VR1 is expressed in <italic>Gr28a</italic> neurons, larvae become attracted to capsaicin, whereas expression of VR1 in <italic>Gr28bc</italic> neurons triggers avoidance to capsaicin. Thus, the <italic>Gr28</italic> proteins, which have been evolutionarily conserved over the last 65 million years in insects, represent the first taste receptor subfamily in which specific members mediate behavior with opposite valence. We also identified denatonium benzoate, a synthetic bitter compound that shares structural similarities with natural bitter chemicals, as a ligand for a receptor complex containing a Gr28bc or Gr28ba receptor subunit. Alphafold structure prediction, combined with the limited sequence conservation in the putative binding pockets of various Gr28 proteins, creates a theoretical framework for targeted <italic>in vivo</italic> structure function studies to precisely map residues critical for ligand recognition.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Meaningful animal behavior is established through cooperative engagement of multiple sensory systems. In many insects, the chemosensory system plays a central role in such integration processes. The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has served as the primary insect model system for elucidating the molecular basis and neural circuitry of both olfaction and taste, by virtue of the vast genetic resources, amenability to both neurophysiological recording and live imaging, and simple yet powerful behavioral assays, allowing investigators to link genes to chemosensory behavior and neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Montell, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The gustatory system in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is characterized by several insect specific features with regard to anatomy and the molecular nature of taste receptors. For example, taste cells are primary sensory neurons, with dendritic projections that express taste receptors, while long axons project that convey taste information directly to the brain. In adult flies, these neurons, referred to as Gustatory Receptor Neurons (GRNs) are distributed across several appendages, such as labial palps, legs and presumably the antennae. Additionally, some GRNs reside internally, arranged in cell clusters along the pharynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Joseph and Carlson, 2015</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amrein, 2016</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Scott, 2018</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae have numerous structures located both on the head surface as well as internally along the larval pharynx, that assess chemical compounds prior and during ingestion, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Apostolopoulou et al., 2015</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rist and Thum, 2017</xref>). Like most insects, <italic>Drosophila</italic> employs taste receptors encoded by two major gene families, the <italic>Gustatory receptor</italic> (<italic>Gr</italic>) and the <italic>Ionotropic Receptor</italic> (<italic>IR</italic>) genes, to sense all chemicals, such as appetitive food compounds, noxious and toxic chemicals as well as pheromones. Both Gr and IR based receptors are thought of form complexes composed of several different subunits, partial composition of which is known for only a few Gr-based taste receptors for sugars and bitt er compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kwon et al., 2007</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jiao et al., 2008</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shim et al., 2015</xref>)(Gonzales et al., unpublished), as well as gaseous carbon dioxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jones et al., 2007</xref>) and even fewer IR-based fatty acid and carboxylic acid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahn et al., 2017</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Tauber et al., 2017</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen and Amrein, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, at least some GRNs express members of both families, although no evidence for receptor complexes consisting of both IR and Gr subunits has been reported to date.</p>
<p>The <italic>Gr</italic> genes represent the largest taste receptor gene family in insects. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, it comprises 60 genes predicted to encode 68 proteins, expression of which has been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ling et al., 2014</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Choi et al., 2016</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rist and Thum, 2017</xref>). Several <italic>Gr</italic> genes have been functionally characterized in adult flies using genetic mutations, combined with either electrophysiological recordings, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging studies and behavioral analyses (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Montell, 2021</xref>) but only a few have been studied in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mishra et al., 2013</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Apostolopoulou et al., 2016</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Choi et al., 2016</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). The <italic>Gr28</italic> gene subfamily is of particular interest for a number of reasons: First, it is one of the most conserved <italic>Gr</italic> subfamily, homologs of which can be found across all insect families and even more distant arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eyun et al., 2017</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Suzuki et al., 2018</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fujii et al., 2023</xref>). Second, the <italic>Gr28</italic> genes are expressed not only in the gustatory system, but in many other organs, especially the central nervous system (CNS) and non-chemosensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), suggesting that they have functions beyond gustation and are important to sense chemical signals unrelated to food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Thorne and Amrein, 2008</xref>). Notably, evidence for such roles has been reported before any direct link to gustatory perception was discovered. Ni and colleagues showed that <italic>Gr28bd</italic> is essential for high temperature avoidance in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ni et al., 2013</xref>), while Xiang and collaborators found that <italic>Gr28</italic> mutant larvae were deficient in UV light avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>). Third, the only gustatory function for any <italic>Gr28</italic> gene in larvae thus far is sensing of ribonucleosides and RNA in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>), which was recently established as a novel appetitive taste quality common to a broad range of dipteran insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fujii et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we present a functional characterization of the <italic>Gr28</italic> genes and the respective GRNs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. Four of the six <italic>Gr28</italic> genes (<italic>Gr28a</italic>, <italic>Gr28ba, Gr28bc</italic> and <italic>Gr28be</italic>) are expressed in the larval taste system, subdivided into two, functionally distinct neuronal ensembles. The first such ensemble is defined by expression of <italic>Gr28bc</italic> and comprises four neurons, two of which also express <italic>Gr28ba</italic>, <italic>Gr28bc</italic>, <italic>Gr28be</italic> and the bitter core receptor gene <italic>Gr66a</italic>, while the other two neurons express only <italic>Gr28bc</italic>, <italic>Gr28a</italic> and <italic>Gr66a</italic>. The second ensemble is characterized by 12 GRNs that express <italic>Gr28a</italic>, including the pair of GRNs expressing the <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes. When the mammalian Vanilloid Receptor 1 (VR1) was expressed under the control of specific GAL4 drivers, we found that <italic>Gr28a</italic> and <italic>Gr28bc</italic> neurons mediate opposing taste behavior in the presence of capsaicin, the ligand for VR1. Specifically, <italic>Gr28a:VR1</italic> larvae show strong attraction for capsaicin, while <italic>Gr28bc:VR1</italic> larvae show strong avoidance of capsaicin. Furthermore, inactivation experiments reveal that the <italic>Gr28bc</italic> GRNs are necessary to sense bitter compounds, specifically denatonium, quinine, lobeline, and caffeine. However, <italic>Gr28</italic> mutant larvae fail to avoid only denatonium, but none of the other bitter compounds, a phenotype rescued by expression of <italic>Gr28bc</italic> or <italic>Gr28ba</italic>. Thus, to our knowledge, the related <italic>Gr28</italic> genes represent the first subfamily where members mediate functionally opposing taste behaviors.</p>

<title>Expression of the <italic>Gr28</italic> genes in the larval taste organs</title>
<p>The peripheral chemosensory system of the larvae is subdivided into bilaterally symmetrical, ‘external’ and ‘internal’ taste organs (Stocker, 2008). The three external organs reside near the tip of the head and organized as paired ganglia, the <underline>D</underline>orsal, <underline>T</underline>erminal and <underline>V</underline>entral <underline>O</underline>rgan <underline>G</underline>anglia (<underline>DOG</underline>s, <underline>TOG</underline>s and <underline>VOG</underline>s) that house the GRN cell bodies, each neuron projecting a dendrite to the sensory organ structures (DO, TO and VO) at the head surface, while carrying information via their axons to the subesophageal zone (SEZ) in the brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The DOG harbors 21 olfactory neurons and 18 presumptive taste neurons. For clarity, numbers below refer to neurons on one side of the bilaterally symmetrical structures of all organs, thus the total neuron number in a larva is double that number. The presumptive GRNs located in the DOG fall into two distinct groups, based on their dendritic projections: 11 presumptive GRNs, four of which were shown to express <italic>Gr</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Apostolopoulou et al., 2015</xref>), extend dendritic projections to the base of the DO, while 7 neurons project dendrites to the TO (the dorsolateral group, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>). The TOG contains 30 neurons, all sending dendrites to the TO (the distal group). The internal taste structures, referred to as the dorsal/ventral pharyngeal sense organ (DPS/VPS, 33 neurons), and the posterior pharyngeal sense organs (PPS, 6 neurons) are located along the pharynx and sense chemicals as they pass towards the digestive system. We note that not all these neurons are confirmed GRNs, either by function or expression of <italic>Gr</italic> or <italic>IR</italic> genes, albeit based on their location and anatomy, most are thought to be GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Stewart et al., 2015</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rist and Thum, 2017</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Our initial expression analysis revealed that four of the six <italic>Gr28</italic> genes (<italic>Gr28a</italic>, <italic>Gr28ba</italic>, <italic>Gr28bc</italic> and <italic>Gr28be</italic>) are expressed in larval taste organs, in addition to cells in the gut, the brain and non-chemosensory cells of the larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>). To further delineate the putative chemosensory roles of these genes, we performed a more detailed co-expression analysis between <italic>Gr28</italic> genes and with respect to the bitter receptor gene <italic>Gr66a</italic>, using the bimodal expression systems <italic>GAL4/UAS</italic> to label <italic>Gr28</italic> expressing neurons and <italic>LexA/lexAop</italic> to mark <italic>Gr66a</italic> neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>; note that the neuron numbers below refer to the number present in one of each paired ganglion). In the TOG, we found expression of all four <italic>Gr28</italic> genes, along with that <italic>Gr66a</italic>, which was expressed in 3 or 4 neurons (one neuron exhibits often stronger expression of <italic>Gr66a</italic> than the two or three remaining neurons). This number slightly smaller than the 6 neurons reported using a distinct <italic>Gr66a-GAL4</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Gr28ba</italic>, <italic>Gr28bc</italic> and <italic>Gr28be</italic> are co-expressed in a single neuron with <italic>Gr66a</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Gr28a</italic> is expressed in a distinct TOG neuron than <italic>Gr66a</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), and by extension, in a different neuron than the co-expressed <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes, which we independently confirmed using a <italic>Gr28bc-QF</italic> driver (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>). In the DOG, we find only a single <italic>Gr28a</italic> neuron, while none of the <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes, or <italic>Gr66a</italic>, is expressed there (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Expression in the internal sensory organs was similarly complex. <italic>Gr66a</italic> was found in one neuron in the DPS/VPS, co-expressed with <italic>Gr28bc</italic> as well as <italic>Gr28a</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). None of the <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes is expressed in the PPS, but two neurons express <italic>Gr28a</italic>, one of which also expresses <italic>Gr66a</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In summary, the internal sensory organs can be subdivided in three distinct groups: <italic>Gr66a/Gr28b/Gr28a</italic> positive neurons, <italic>Gr66a/Gr28a</italic> positive neurons and <italic>Gr28a<sup>only</sup></italic> neurons, which contrasts expression in the external sensory organs where <italic>Gr28a</italic> and the <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes are mutually exclusive.</p>

<title>Subsets of <italic>Gr28</italic> neurons mediate opposing feeding behaviors</title>
<p>We previously showed that at least one of the six Gr28 genes is necessary for feeding attraction to RNA, ribonucleosides and ribose using a well-established two choice feeding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, larvae homozygous for a <italic>Gr28</italic> null allele, a deletion of the entire <italic>Gr28a</italic> gene and most of the coding region of all <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes (<italic>ΔGr28</italic>), lose their ability to sense these compounds, a phenotype that is restored when single <italic>UAS-Gr28</italic> genes are expressed in <italic>Gr28a</italic> neurons using <italic>Gr28a-GAL4</italic>. This observation and the largely non-overlapping expression of <italic>Gr28a</italic> and the <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes suggests that respective neurons represent functionally distinct entities. To investigate this possibility, we took advantage of the mammalian Vanilloid Receptor 1 (VR1), a TRP channel that is activated by capsaicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caterina et al., 1997</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> have no <italic>VR1</italic> like-gene in their genome and do not respond to capsaicin behaviorally, but flies are attracted to this chemical when a modified <italic>VR1</italic> gene (<italic>VR1E600K</italic>) is expressed in sweet taste neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Marella et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, we expressed <italic>VR1E600K</italic> (henceforth referred to <italic>UAS-VR1</italic>) under the control of the four <italic>Gr28-GAL4</italic> drivers (<italic>Gr28a-GAL4</italic>, <italic>Gr28ba-GAL4</italic>, <italic>Gr28bc-GAL4</italic> and <italic>Gr28be-GAL4</italic>) in larvae and tested their response to capsaicin using the two-choice preference assay. Additionally, we expressed <italic>UAS-VR1</italic> in bitter neurons as well as sweet neurons using respective <italic>GAL4</italic> drivers (<italic>Gr66a-GAL4</italic> and <italic>Gr43a<sup>GAL4</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Scott et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Miyamoto et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with the observation in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Marella et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> control larvae and larvae carrying <italic>UAS-VR1</italic> or <italic>Gr-GAL4</italic> genes alone were unresponsive to 0.1 mM or 0.5 mM capsaicin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). However, larvae expressing <italic>UAS-VR1</italic> under the control of <italic>Gr28a-GAL4</italic> or <italic>Gr43a-GAL4</italic> showed strong appetitive responses to both capsaicin concentrations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, larvae expressing <italic>UAS-VR1</italic> under the control of <italic>Gr28bc-GAL4</italic> or <italic>Gr66a-GAL4</italic> showed robust avoidance behavior to both concentrations of capsaicin. Lastly, expression of <italic>UAS-VR1</italic> with the <italic>Gr28ba-GAL4</italic> or <italic>Gr28be-GAL4</italic> driver, which is co-expressed in a single TO neuron with <italic>Gr28bc</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), did cause neither attraction to nor avoidance of capsaicin.</p>

When expressing <italic>UAS-VR1</italic> in <italic>Gr28a</italic> GRNs (<italic>Gr28a-GAL4/UAS-VR1</italic>), larvae display robust taste preference for capsaicin for both 0.1 and 0.5 mM capsaicin. In contrast, when expressed in <italic>Gr28bc</italic> GRNs (<italic>Gr28bc-GAL4/UAS-VR1</italic>), larvae strongly avoid both 0.1 and 0.5 mM capsaicin. Neither avoidance nor preference was observed when VR1 was expressed in the <italic>Gr28ba</italic> or <italic>Gr28be</italic> GRNs. For comparison, expression of VR1 in sweet taste neurons (<italic>Gr43a<sup>GAL4</sup>/UAS-VR1</italic>) or bitter taste neurons (<italic>Gr66a-GAL4/UAS-VR1</italic>) led to strong preference for or strong avoidance of capsaicin.

<p>Expression difference between <italic>Gr28bc</italic> and <italic>Gr28ba/be</italic> is a single neuron in the DPS/VPS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), a neuron required to mediate avoidance of capsaicin in <italic>Gr28bc-GAL4, UAS-VR1</italic> larvae. Even though this GRN also expresses <italic>Gr28a</italic>, it appears unlikely that it is necessary to mediate appetitive behavior as well. Indeed, we could further restrict the necessary set of appetitive neurons to four <italic>Gr28a</italic> positive neurons (<italic>Gr28a<sup>only</sup></italic>GRNs), as suppression of VR1 expression in <italic>Gr66a</italic> GRNs (one being the <italic>Gr28bc</italic> expressing GRN in the DPS/VPS) did not affect capsaicin preference (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We further note that activation of the two <italic>Gr28bc</italic> neurons by capsaicin drives repulsion to the same degree as when all seven <italic>Gr66a</italic> expressing neurons are activated. Taken together, this analysis indicates that <italic>Gr28a-GAL4</italic> is expressed in appetitive inducing neurons, while <italic>Gr28bc-GAL4</italic> neurons mediate avoidance behavior.</p>
<p>Wild type larvae, like adult flies, avoid bitter compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Apostolopoulou et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Apostolopoulou et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Choi et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">van Giesen et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). If <italic>Gr28bc</italic> neurons are indeed central to the avoidance of these chemicals in larvae, we expect that eliminating their function would result in loss of larval avoidance behavior to bitter chemicals. Thus, we inactivated neuronal subsets using the potassium inward rectifying channel Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baines et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Paradis et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast to larvae with an intact taste neuron repertoire, larvae in which two <italic>Gr28bc</italic> neurons were inactivated no longer avoided any of these bitter compounds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). A more subtle phenotype was observed when the single <italic>Gr28be</italic> neurons were inactivated, eliminating lobeline and caffeine avoidance, but leaving denatonium and quinine repulsion intact, a finding consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). These data suggest that two pairs of neurons, one in the TO and one in the D/VPS are necessary and sufficient for avoidance of all four bitter tasting chemicals.</p>

<title>Gr28bc and Gr28ba are subunits of a taste receptor complex for denatonium</title>
<p>We examined whether any of the Gr28 proteins is part of a taste receptor complex detecting these bitter chemicals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Surprisingly, only avoidance of denatonium was affected in larvae without any functional <italic>Gr28</italic> gene (<italic>ΔGr28</italic>), while responses to quinine, lobeline or caffeine was not significantly affected. Moreover, avoidance to caffeine increased significantly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We next tested which Gr28 protein is necessary for denatonium avoidance and expressed individual <italic>Gr28</italic> genes under the control of the <italic>Gr28bc-GAL4</italic> driver. Only when either <italic>Gr28ba</italic> or <italic>Gr28bc</italic> was expressed in these neurons, denatonium avoidance was fully recovered, whereas expression of <italic>Gr28bb</italic>, <italic>Gr28bd</italic>, <italic>Gr28be</italic> or <italic>Gr28a</italic> failed to do so (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).

<p>Previous work had established that <italic>Gr66a</italic> is required for caffeine avoidance, in both larvae and adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Moon et al., 2006</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Apostolopoulou et al., 2016</xref>). We confirmed this, as <italic>Gr66a</italic> mutant larvae show little if any avoidance of caffeine, while avoidance of lobeline was not affected (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>). Somewhat surprisingly, avoidance of denatonium and quinine increased significantly. This is likely a result of the heteromeric composition of bitter taste receptor complexes, whereby absence of Gr66a allows Grs that tuned to denatonium (such as Gr28bc or Gr28ba) and quinine be incorporated into multimeric receptor complexes.</p>
<p>Finally, we investigated neuronal responses in larvae expressing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6m in <italic>Gr28bc-GAL4</italic> GRNs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). We developed a whole larvae imaging preparation, whereby larvae were placed in an “imaging chamber” to minimize head movements (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), and visualized neural activity in real time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) upon exposure to the four bitter compounds, as well as sucrose, ribose and fructose (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> to <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). All bitter compounds elicited rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases in <italic>Gr28bc</italic> GRNs in the TO, while none of the sugars did (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). When neural activity was recorded in <italic>ΔGr28</italic> homozygous mutant larvae (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), cellular responses to denatonium and quinine were severely reduced, while responses to both caffeine and lobeline were not affected.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The Gr28 receptors comprise one of the few Gr subfamilies conserved across diverse insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Engsontia and Satasook, 2021</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agnihotri et al., 2016</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Yu et al., 2023</xref>). Yet, they were the least characterized when compared to other conserved subfamilies, such as the sugar receptors (Gr5a, Gr61a and Gr64a-f), the carbon dioxide receptors Gr21a and Gr63a or the bitter taste receptors. The only ligands associated with the Gr28 proteins were ribonucleosides and RNA, which are appetitive nutrients for larvae and are mediated by <italic>Gr28a</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, RNA has been found to be an appetitive taste ligand across many dipteran insects, including mosquitoes, and we showed that Gr28 homologs of both <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and <italic>A. gambiae</italic> can rescue the preference for RNA and ribose when expressed in <italic>Gr28a</italic> neurons of <italic>ΔGr28</italic> mutant larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fujii et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we established a precedent for members of the same subfamily for mediating both appetitive and repulsive behavior and being expressed in largely non-overlapping sets of GRNs. In flies, members of other conserved Gr subfamilies are either precisely (<italic>Gr21a</italic> and <italic>Gr63a</italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jones et al., 2007</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kwon et al., 2007</xref>), or largely (sugar <italic>Gr</italic> genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>) co-expressed in one type of GRNs, forming multimeric receptors that mediate a single type of behavior.</p>
<p>Our expression analysis in larvae is consistent with earlier reports, despite some variation in number of neurons expressing <italic>Gr66a</italic> and <italic>Gr28b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Choi et al., 2016</xref>), which is likely due to the use of different <italic>GAL4</italic> drivers and/or variability in expression. Importantly, all <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes are co-expressed with the bitter marker <italic>Gr66a</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure1</xref>), while <italic>Gr28a</italic> is found in a largely, but not entirely distinct set of GRNs. Based on our VR1-capsaicin experiments, the GRNs sharing expression of both <italic>Gr28a</italic> and <italic>Gr66a</italic> (and by extension some <italic>Gr28b</italic> genes) are critical for avoidance, and not required for appetitive behavior (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Distinct functions of small set of GRNs expressing specific Gr28 subunits</title>
<p>A key finding presented of this study is the observation that <italic>Gr28a<sup>only</sup></italic> and <italic>Gr28bc</italic> neurons dictate distinct behavioral programs, the former representing an ensemble of neurons that instruct a larvae to “go towards” chemical source and consume it, while the latter do the opposite (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The set of “go-away” GRNs co-expressing <italic>Gr28bc</italic> and <italic>Gr66a</italic> is remarkably small, consisting of only two pairs, one in the TO and the other in the DPS/VPS. It seems likely that this is the smallest, minimal subset of neurons sufficient for avoidance, as expression of V1R in only the TO pair (under the control of either <italic>Gr28ba-GAL4</italic> or <italic>Gr28be-GAL4</italic>) has no behavioral effect when challenged with capsaicin. The “go-to” neurons are characterized by expression of <italic>Gr28a</italic> and represent a slightly larger set of four GRN pairs (<italic>Gr28a<sup>only</sup></italic> only GRNs). Thus, we propose that the minimal requirement to induce “go-to” and “go-away” behavior is defined by distinct sets of GRNs, and that each appears to be composed of neurons located in both external as well as the internal taste organs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Co-expression of a subunit for the bitter taste receptors Gr28bc/Gr28ba and Gr28a, a receptor for RNA, a nutrient essential for larval growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>) in bitter taste neurons raises interesting questions about the function of Gr28a. As these neurons are necessary for repulsion, we propose that Gr28a might serve as a subunit along with other Grs (possibly Gr28bc and/or Gr66a) in heteromeric bitter taste receptor complexes, detecting yet other bitter compounds. In “go-to”, <italic>Gr28a<sup>only</sup></italic> GRNs, Gr28a is likely to form a homomultimeric receptor, since its expression in fructose sensing GRNs confers RNA recognition to these neurons, both in cellular and behavioral assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>). We note that the sweet taste receptor Gr5a, a subunit of a multimeric receptor in sweet taste GRNs in the labial palps of flies is also expressed in non-sweet neurons of unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, while Gr28bc was shown to be required for detecting and avoiding 5% saponin in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sang et al., 2019</xref>), larvae showed no behavioral response to 0.1% of saponin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Choi et al., 2016</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Choi et al., 2020</xref>), a finding we independently confirmed using both concentration of saponin (data not shown).</p>

<title>Mapping ligand specificity for denatonium</title>
<p>Only Gr28ba and Gr28bc can rescue responses to denatonium when expressed in <italic>Gr28bc</italic> GRNs of <italic>ΔGr28</italic> mutant larvae. Thus, sequence comparison between the unique N-terminal halves of the Gr28 proteins might provide insights as to possible residues important for denatonium recognition/binding, especially residues located in extracellular loops (EL) and transmembrane (TM) regions.

Reducing the stringency requirement by allowing one of the remaining receptors to share the same residue, nine additional sites are identified. Interestingly, five of these sixteen amino acid residues map to four of the nine most probable binding pocket as predicted by Prankweb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://prankweb.cz/">https://prankweb.cz/</ext-link>), with three residues part of the pocket with the highest probability score (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, targeted substitutions of single amino acids residing in predicted ligand binding pockets in other Gr28 proteins and testing such “chimera” provides a theoretical framework for practical experiments using either behavior analysis or Ca2+ imaging to precisely define the specific requirement for denatonium specificity. Additional complementary approaches can be taken to identify the critical residues in the predicted binding pockets of other members of this family once their ligands have been identified. Thus, the Gr28 proteins might serve as model to experimentally validate the predictions created by these powerful algorithms.</p>

Heads of third instar larvae were dissected using microscissors in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and immediately fixed in PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hour at 4 °C. Heads were washed six times in washing buffer (PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) for 20 min and blocked for 1 h in washing buffer containing 5% heat-inactivated goat serum (SouthernBiotech, Cat. No. 0060-01), followed by incubation with the primary antibodies (rabbit anti–GFP, 1:1,000 dilution; rat anti–mCD8, 1:200 dilution, ThermoFisher Scientific) at 4°C overnight. Heads were washed six times for 20 min in washing buffer and blocked in washing buffer containing 5% heat-inactivated goat serum for 1 hour. Heads were incubated with the secondary antibodies (goat anti rabbit ALEXA 488, 1:500 dilution, ThermoFisher Scientific; goat anti–rat Cy3, 1:300 dilution, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc.) at 4°C overnight.

<title>Larval two-choice preference assay</title>
<p>Two-choice preference assay of larvae was conducted as described in Mishra et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mishra et al., 2013</xref>) with minor modification. Flies were placed on standard corn meal food in plastic vials and allowed to lay eggs for 24 h under a 12 h light/dark cycle at 25°C. Flies were removed from food vials and feeding-stage third-instar larvae were collected. All dishes for two-choice preference assay were prepared just prior each experiment. Petri dishes (60 x 15 mm, Falcon, Cat. No. REF353004) with two halves marked on the bottom were filled with melted plain 1% agarose or 1% agarose containing 1.75% ethanol (for capsaicin preference). After the agarose solidified, one half was removed and replaced with 1% agarose solution containing taste ligands (capsaicin or bitter compound). For each experiment, 15 larvae from food vials were briefly rinsed twice with Millipore Q water and placed along the middle separating pure and ligand containing agarose. After 16 min, photos were taken for record keeping and used to calculate larval preference indices. Larvae that crawled onto the wall of a dish or dug in the agarose were excluded. The preference index (P.I.) was calculated as follow: PI = (N<sub>tastant</sub> - N<sub>plain</sub>) / N<sub>Total,</sub> whereby N is the number of larvae in the tastant sector, the plain agarose sector and the total number on the plate. Positive values indicate a preference for capsaicin or bitter compound while negative values indicate repulsion (avoidance).</p>

<title>Calcium imaging</title>
<p>Calcium imaging was performed in <italic>Gr28bc</italic> GRNs expressed in the terminal organ of feeding-stage, third instar larvae, reared as described for the larval two-choice preference assay. For each experiment, larvae from food vials were briefly rinsed twice with Millipore Q water and were mounted dorsally on a large microscope cover glass (24 x 50 mm, VWR, Cat. No. 16004-098) using double-sided scotch tape and covered with a small microscope cover glass (12CIR-1, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. 1254580). Millipore Q water (40 µl) was applied to the tip of the larval head, and the preparation was placed on the stage of a Nikon eclipse Ti inverted microscope. Images were obtained every 500 ms, starting 15 s before application and ending 105 s after ligand application. Each recording was initiated by applying water (40μl) to set a baseline. The first ligand solution (40 μl of bitter chemical or sugar) was applied thereafter, followed by 5 washes with carrier (100 μl of water). After a 3-minute pause to allow the preparation to recalibrate, a second ligand solution (40 μl bitter chemical or sugar) was applied. To assure validity in experiments with <italic>Gr28</italic> mutants and rescues, each recording was concluded with application of caffeine, and recordings were included only if caffeine generated a positive response. Baseline fluorescence, which was determined from the average of five frame measurements from a region next to the cell immediately before ligand application, was subtracted from the actual measurements. ΔF/F (%) = (fluorescence light intensity of the cell body – baseline/baseline) x 100. ΔF/F (max %) is the maximum value within 40 seconds after ligand application.</p>

<p>Statistical analyses were conducted using Prism software 9.5.1 (GraphPad Software). Larval two-choice preference assay and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data were analyzed for normal distribution using D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus and Shapiro-Wilk normality tests. When groups did not meet the assumption for normal distribution, nonparametric statistics was used. For comparison between multiple groups, one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test by ranks (nonparametric one-way ANOVA) was performed to test for difference of mean or rank distribution. As a post hoc test, Bonferroni’s or Dunn’s (nonparametric) multiple comparison tests were employed to compare two specific groups. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison tests were used in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study focuses on the role of the Gr28 family of insect chemoreceptors. Using the Drosophila larva, the authors show that taste neurons expressing different members of this family of bitter taste receptors trigger opposite behavior - attraction and repulsion. They establish the minimal bitter taste receptor subunit composition needed in these neurons to mediate the repulsion of bitter tastants. The evidence presented is <bold>convincing</bold>, using well-validated and controlled tools and experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Ahn and Amrein characterize the expression of members of the Gr28 family of gustatory receptors in taste neurons in the Drosophila melanogaster larva, define the behaviorally-relevant ligands for these receptors, and use chemogenetic experiments to show, strikingly, that different neurons have opposite behavioral responses to the chemogenetic ligand. They go on to show what neurons need to be silenced to lose responses to bitters, and very nicely show what subunits of the Gr28 bitter receptors are necessary and sufficient for responses to bitters. This is a nice piece of work, rigorously carried out, that tackles the neurons and receptors that drive innate responses to tastants in Drosophila larvae.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
1. The chemogenetic experiments in Figure 2 are cleanly done with very clear results, and the subsetting in Figure 2B further clarifies the cellular requirements for the behavior.</p>
<p>
2. The rescue experiments with different Gr28 subunits in the Gr28 mutant are creative and clear.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. The authors should define early and clearly that expression of Gr28 genes studied in this paper relies not on looking at the endogenous gene but at the expression of Gal4 under the control of enhancers from these loci. The Gal4 drivers are useful and important tools, but the possibility exists that their expression is not 100% congruent with the endogenous expression of these receptors. I would not require a comprehensive validation of the lines by RNA in situ hybridization compared to the Gal4 driver lines but would recommend the disclaimer be made and that the authors are more precise in talking about the expression of the marker rather than the expression of the specific receptor gene.</p>
<p>2. The important chemogenetic behavioral data would benefit from a clearer presentation including a cartoon to explain what the behavior is and how it is scored. Figure 2 is the key figure in this paper and it would be helpful if the figure were re-organized to guide the non-expert reader to the key result. I recommend labeling the positive controls Gr43a as &quot;sweet&quot; and Gr66a as &quot;bitter&quot; and perhaps organize the presentation to have the negative control at the left, then Gr28ba that had no effect, then group Gr28a with Gr43a for positive valence and Gr28bc with Gr66a for negative valence. I'm not sure what the value is of showing both 0.1 mM and 0.5 mM capsaicin, the text does not explain. The experiment in Figure 2B is important but non-experts will not understand what is being done here - can the authors please provide a cartoon like those in Figure 1 showing what cells are being subjected to chemogenetics and how this differs from Figure 2A?</p>
<p>3. The AlphaFold ligand docking in Figure 8 is conducted with Gr28bc monomers, which are unlikely to be the in vivo relevant structure, given that the related OR/ORCO ancestor structures are tetramers. I recommend that this component of the paper either be removed entirely or that the authors redo the in silico work using the AlphaFold-Multimer package reported by Hassabis and Jumper in 2022 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.04.463034v2">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.04.463034v2</ext-link>. It will be interesting to see what a tetramer structure looks like with the ligand.</p>

<p>This study investigates how genes in the Gr28 family of gustatory receptors function in the taste system of Drosophila larvae. Gr28 genes are intriguing because they have been implicated in taste as well as other functions, such as sensing temperature and ultraviolet light. This study makes several new findings. First, the authors show that four Gr28 genes are expressed in putative taste neurons, and these neurons can be largely divided into subsets that express Gr28a versus Gr28bc. The authors then demonstrate that these two neuronal subsets drive opposing behaviors (attraction versus avoidance) when activated. The avoidance-promoting neurons respond to bitter compounds and are required for bitter avoidance, and Gr28bc and Gr28ba were specifically implicated in bitter detection in these cells. Together, these findings provide insight into the complexity of taste receptor expression and function in Drosophila, even within a single receptor subfamily.</p>
<p>The conclusions are well-supported by the experimental data. Strengths of the paper include the use of precise genetic tools, thorough analyses of expression patterns, carefully validated behavioral assays, and well-controlled functional imaging experiments. The role of Gr28bc neurons is more thoroughly explored than that of Gr28a neurons. However, a previous study from the same lab (Mishra et al., 2018) showed that Gr28a neurons detect RNA and ribose, which are attractive to larvae. Presumably, this is the attractive response that is being recapitulated upon artificial activation of Gr28a neurons.</p>
<p>I only have one technical concern: In Figure 2B, the authors do not show confirmation that using Gr66a-lexA driving lexAop-Gal80 eliminates Gal4-driven gene expression in the desired cells (cells co-expressing Gr66a and Gr28a). This is important for interpreting the behavioral experiment in order to demonstrate that the Gr28a cells mediating attraction are distinct from Gr66a/Gr28bc cells.</p>

<p>a) Important findings</p>
<p>
- This study confirms that Gr28 subfamily members are expressed in distinct sets of taste neurons in Drosophila larvae, supporting previous findings (e.g., Kwon et al., 2011).</p>
<p>
- Neurons expressing different members of the Gr28 family exhibit distinct behavioral responses when chemically activated with capsaicin.</p>
<p>
- Silencing experiments reveal that neurons expressing Gr28bc are necessary for larval avoidance of four bitter compounds, whereas neurons expressing Gr28be are necessary for avoiding lobeline and caffeine.</p>
<p>
- Inserting either Gr28ba or Gr28bc into the GR28 mutant line restored larval avoidance of denatonium.</p>
<p>
- Calcium imaging experiments show that Gr28ba and Gr28bc are involved in sensing denatonium, while none of the GR28 family members are involved in detecting quinine.</p>
<p>b) Caveats</p>
<p>
- The authors did not acknowledge that neurons expressing members of the GR28 family also express other Gr family members, which could potentially contribute to the detection and behavioral responses to the tested bitter compounds.</p>
<p>
- Gal4 lines from various studies exhibit varying expression patterns, highlighting the necessity for improved reagents. These findings also suggest the importance of employing different Gal4 lines for each receptor to validate the results of the current study.</p>
<p>
- Activating or silencing neurons pertains to the function of the neurons rather than the receptors.</p>
<p>
- Inconsistency is observed in the use of different reagents across the experiments. Specifically, all six Gal4 lines were utilized in the Chemical Activation experiments, while only two lines were employed in the silencing experiments.</p>
<p>
- The Alphafold structure prediction is exciting but lacks conclusive evidence.</p>
