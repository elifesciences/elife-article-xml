<title>Abstract</title><p>Small molecule ligands exhibit a diverse range of conformations in solution. Upon binding to a target protein, this conformational diversity is reduced. However, ligands can retain some degree of conformational flexibility even when bound to a receptor. In the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a small number of ligands have been modeled with distinct alternative conformations that are supported by macromolecular X-ray crystallography density maps. However, the vast majority of structural models are fit to a single ligand conformation, potentially ignoring the underlying conformational heterogeneity present in the sample. We previously developed qFit-ligand to sample diverse ligand conformations and to select a parsimonious ensemble consistent with the density. While this approach indicated that many ligands populate alternative conformations, limitations in our sampling procedures often resulted in non-physical conformations and could not model complex ligands like macrocycles. Here, we introduce several improvements to qFit-ligand, including integrating RDKit for stochastic conformational sampling. This new sampling method greatly enriches low energy conformations of small molecules and macrocycles. We further extended qFit-ligand to identify alternative conformations in PanDDA-modified density maps from high throughput X-ray fragment screening experiments, as well as single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) density maps. The new version of qFit-ligand improves fit to electron density and reduces torsional strain relative to deposited single conformer models and our prior version of qFit-ligand. These advances enhance the analysis of residual conformational heterogeneity present in ligand-bound structures, which can provide important insights for the rational design of therapeutic agents.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protein-ligand interactions are fundamental to many biological processes, involving both natural metabolites that regulate proteins and drugs developed to activate or inhibit proteins for therapeutic purposes. Prior to binding, both the ligand and protein receptor can sample a wide number of conformations. Upon binding, it is typically assumed that both ligand and protein will lose access to nearly all of their conformational states <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. This assumption leads to the common practice in X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of modeling the ligand as adopting a single, fixed conformation within the binding site, with little to no consideration of potential heterogeneity other than refined B-factors.</p>
<p>Both macromolecular X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM generate averaged datasets by compiling scattering information from &gt;10000s of system copies, including macromolecules, solvents, ions, and small molecules. The resulting data from which structural models are built encompass significant conformational and compositional heterogeneity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Conformational heterogeneity, when the same substance is in multiple conformations, includes subtle, sub-Ångstrom changes that are difficult to model by eye, yet these shifts are crucial for accurate biological interpretation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Compositional heterogeneity refers to variation in the molecular contents of a sample, such as a ligand or macromolecular subunit only bound in a portion of the complexes captured. Ligand modeling, even as a single conformer, is challenging due to compositional heterogeneity, interference from water molecules, and system-wide conformational heterogeneity, all of which lead to ambiguity in electron density map interpretation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>This challenge in manual modeling is a major reason why structural variability is often underrepresented in deposited models. However, in the PDB, a small number of ligands are modeled as multiple conformers, representing their conformational heterogeneity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. These structures likely represent just a small fraction of ligands with experimental evidence that could support modeling multiple conformations, as has been shown in proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. When handled correctly, modeling ligands in multiple conformations can reveal critical information about biological function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> and guide small molecule design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To help assist in modeling conformational heterogeneity, we have developed qFit, which can automatically build multiconformer models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The underlying concept of qFit is to enumerate a large number of conformations according to a sampling procedure and then to use mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) to optimize the selection of a parsimonious set of conformers, along with their corresponding occupancies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. This approach improves the fit to experimental data and agreement with geometric priors for proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. We previously extended qFit to qFit-ligand to identify and model alternative conformations of ligands to experimental data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The prior version of qFit-ligand used iterative sampling over each torsional degree of freedom <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. This approach overlooked correlated motions and over-explored conformations that were energetically unfavorable. Here, we present a redeveloped sampling algorithm powered by the RDKit implementation of the Experimental-Torsion Knowledge Distance Geometry (ETKDG) conformer generator, which is a stochastic search method that combines distance geometry and knowledge derived from experimental structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. We demonstrate that our improved qFit-ligand can automatically model multiple conformations of ligands where supported by electron density. The majority of qFit models improved real space correlation coefficients (RSCC), electron density support for individual atoms (EDIA), and ligand strain. We also extend qFit-ligand to accommodate emerging strategies in structure-based drug design, including macrocycles, fragment screening, and cryo-EM. While the cyclic nature of macrocycles makes modeling the flexibility by our prior approach incredibly troublesome, with improved sampling, we can now model this expanding class of small molecules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Second, X-ray based fragment screening has exploded in popularity since our first release; however, these approaches rely on density map manipulations accounting for compositional heterogeneity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. With improved map handling, we can now model into these “event” maps, identifying multiple conformations even for low molecular weight compounds. Lastly, recent advances in cryo-EM have enabled increasingly high resolution reconstructions, which in turn allow for atom-level modeling of conformational heterogeneity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In response, we introduce cryo-EM map compatibility, making qFit-ligand a method for automated multiconformer ligand model building using cryo-EM data. Together, these advancements and the enhanced code base will enable more accurate identification and modeling of ligand conformational heterogeneity across a variety of ligands, leading to a better interpretation of protein-ligand interactions.</p>

<title>Overview of the qFit-ligand Algorithm</title>
<p>The qFit-ligand algorithm takes as input a crystal or cryo-EM structure of an initial protein-ligand complex with a single conformer ligand in PDBx/mmCIF format, a density map or structure factors (encoded by a ccp4 formatted map or an MTZ), and a SMILES string for the ligand. The SMILES string is used for bond order assignment internally <bold>(Methods)</bold>. The algorithm produces a multiconformer model of the ligand, embedded into the context of the rest of the unaltered structural model. This version of qFit-ligand leverages advances to the code base that have improved the stability of the code for protein modeling applications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and uses the Chem.rdDistGeom module of RDKit, which implements ETKDG, for conformational sampling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> (see Conformer Generation).</p>
<p>To ensure compatibility with the surrounding protein, the ensemble is generated under constraints defined by the geometry of the binding site (see Biasing Conformer Generation), generating 5,000-7,000 ligand conformations depending on the size of the ligand. We then use quadratic programming (QP) and MIQP optimization algorithms to determine the best fit of the coordinate and occupancy of conformers to the experimental map. For X-ray data, we restrict the algorithm to output a maximum of three conformations, whereas cryo-EM is restricted to outputting a maximum of two conformations. Examples can be found in the qFit Github repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ExcitedStates/qfit-3.0">https://github.com/ExcitedStates/qfit-3.0</ext-link>) under version 2025.1 and is packaged as part of SBGrid <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Conformer Generation</title>
<p>For an input molecule (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), the RDKit Chem.rdDistGeom.EmbedMultipleConfs function generates a distance bounds matrix containing the minimum and maximum allowable distances between every pair of atoms for an input molecule (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1— figure supplement 1</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The algorithm then explores the conformational space by stochastically generating distances within the defined distance bounds, generating diverse and chemically plausible conformers across torsional angles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-E</xref>). For example, within a torsion angle formed by four atoms, the minimum distance between atoms 1 and 4 corresponds to the syn conformation, and the maximum distance corresponds to the anti conformation. Conformations are generated with torsional angles between the maximum and minimum, while obeying other constraints, ensuring exploration of the molecule’s conformational space within realistic and chemically meaningful limits.</p>

<label>Figure 1.</label>
<caption><title>qFit-ligand algorithm workflow.</title> <p>All ligands undergo three preliminary searches: unconstrained, fixed terminal atoms, and blob search, allowing varying degrees of freedom (A-C). If the ligand has short or long side chains, the algorithm progresses to more specialized searches: branch search for ligands with side chains of at least four atoms (D), and long chain search for those exceeding 30 atoms (E). The algorithm then determines the best fit of generated conformers to electron density through quadratic programming, followed by additional sampling with rotations and translations (F). The remaining conformers then undergo quadratic and mixed-integer quadratic programming to ensure that only the most well-supported conformers are included in the final model.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="613996v2_fig1.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>The sampled distances are converted into three-dimensional coordinates through an embedding procedure. Next, torsional angles are refined using potentials derived from experimental distributions observed in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> <bold>(Methods)</bold>. Following torsional minimization, we apply the optionally available force field minimization step, using the MMFF94 force field <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> to eliminate steric clashes and reduce molecular strain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. All these steps help to ensure that only conformers with low torsional strain are allowed to be selected for final fitting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Biasing Conformer Generation</title>
<p>To guide the conformation generation from the Chem.rdDistGeom based on the ligand type and protein pocket, we developed a suite of specialized sampling functions to bias the conformational search towards structures more likely to fit well into the receptor’s binding site. For a given molecule, up to six of these modified sampling functions are used to refine the conformational search. All steps are initialized with the input ligand model and are run in parallel.</p>
<p>First, in all cases, we perform an <italic>unconstrained search function</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), a <italic>fixed terminal atoms search function</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), and a <italic>blob search function</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The <italic>unconstrained search function</italic> generates conformers only constrained from the default RDKit parameters as described above. The <italic>fixed terminal atoms search function</italic> places hard constraints on the distance between the terminal atoms, allowing the atoms in between to randomly sample distances within their respective upper and lower bounds. This preserves the overall shape of the ligand while still allowing for internal movement. Finally, the <italic>blob search function</italic> confines generated conformers within a spherical volume, determined by the maximum Euclidean distance from the geometric center of the input ligand to its outermost atoms.</p>
<p>For ligands with side chains of at least four atoms, we also implement a <italic>branching search function</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Here, atoms not included in the side chain (core atoms), are fixed to the coordinates of the input ligand model. This method allows the sampling of side chain conformations while maintaining the relative positioning of the core atoms. When these chains exceed 30 atoms, we apply a <italic>long chain search function</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). This approach does the opposite of the <italic>branching search function</italic> by fixing the atoms in the long side chains in place while allowing the core atoms to explore various conformations. This ensures the generation of relevant conformations of the core atoms without excessive variability in the side chains, which is crucial for ligands with a high degree of freedom.</p>
<p>Additionally, an optional flag turns on the <italic>180-degree flip sampling function</italic>. This function takes the input modeled ligand conformer and rotates it 180 degrees around the three principal axes (x, y, and z), effectively generating three new conformations that are flipped relative to the original structure. After each 180-degree flip, the function applies rotations to each of these three conformers within a range of ± 10 degrees in 2-degree increments. This option is turned off by default and is only recommended for supervised cases where a user suspects the ligand in their crystal may adopt this specific type of conformational disorder.</p>
<p>By default, each run of qFit-ligand generates 5,000 conformers if the input ligand has fewer than 25 heavy atoms and 7,000 otherwise, evenly distributed across the specialized search strategies. Users can optionally customize this number using the command line flag ‘-nc’. After all conformers are generated, we identify pairs of redundant conformers, defined as those with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) less than 0.2Å, randomly choosing one to remove.</p>
<p>To select the set of conformers that best explains the observed density, qFit-ligand employs a QP optimization algorithm. For each sampled conformer, we generate a calculated density map based on the ligand’s atomic coordinates, element types, B-factors, and the map resolution. Each conformer is assigned a weight (occupancy) that collectively optimizes the real space residual of the observed density versus the weighted sum of all the calculated densities. The algorithm has two constraints, first that all weights are non-negative and that the sum of all weights lies between 0-1. QP usually outputs 1-80 conformations (<bold>Methods</bold>). We then further sample these remaining conformers by applying rotational and translational perturbations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). New conformations are created by rotating by 15 degrees in 5-degree increments and translating by 0.3 (Å) along the x, y, and z axes. Conformers are then selected through an additional round of QP. The final conformations are then selected using MIQP, where the optimization problem is the same (optimizing real space residuals of observed versus weighted sum of all calculated densities), but with additional linear constraints to limit the final multiconformer model to a maximum of three (or two for cryo-EM) conformers. The output is then one to three ligand conformations with relative occupancies that collectively best explain the observed density (<bold>Methods</bold>).</p>

<title>Refinement of qFit-ligand models</title>
<p>qFit-ligand builds a parsimonious multiconformer ligand model and outputs both an independent ligand structure and the protein-ligand complex embedded in the rest of the system (containing solvent, other heteroatoms, etc). After running qFit-ligand, we refine this complex using phenix.refine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> or phenix.real_space_refine for cryo-EM structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The resulting final, refined, model is used for all subsequent comparisons throughout the rest of the paper.</p>

<title>qFit-ligand runtime</title>
<p>qFit-ligand operates on up to 5 CPU cores, demonstrating efficient performance on a standard laptop, if all 5 cores are engaged, with typical runtimes for most ligands (70.6%) being less than 10 minutes (mean: 8.6 minutes, median: 6.1 minutes, range: 1.9-44.9 minutes). qFit-ligand is not parallelized by default, but an optional command line flag ‘-p’ is available to set the number of cores used during conformer generation. Analysis across a large dataset of structures reveals a strong correlation between the size of the input ligand and the runtime (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.75), with larger ligands resulting in longer processing times (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Detection of experimental true positive multiconformer ligands</title>
<p>To develop the new qFit-ligand algorithm, we collected a set of true positive multiconformer ligand models from the PDB. We identified 2,199 PDB files containing ligands with multiple conformations, more than 10 heavy atoms, and resolutions better than 2.0 Ångstroms (Å). We removed structures that had alternative conformers in common crystallographic additives (n=453), as well as structures with the same protein and ligand pair (n=212). This further pruned our collection to 1,534 structures, with resolutions ranging from 0.73 - 1.99 Å. We randomly sampled 150 structures and after a manual inspection removed 15 where the deposited conformations did not visually resolve well into the density, leaving us with 135 structures as a development set for improving qFit-ligand <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, Supplementary Table 1).</p>
<p>To simulate a realistic scenario where the multiple conformations of a ligand are initially unknown, we retained only the ‘A’ conformations (all structures had 2 conformations), setting its occupancy to 1.00. Occupancy of the ‘A’ conformer was higher than the ‘B’ conformer in 82.2% of structures (n=111/135). These single conformer ligand structures were refined using phenix.refine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> <bold>(Methods)</bold>. We refer to these altered structures as our ‘modified true positives’, which we use as input to qFit-ligand, and subsequent refinement using Phenix (<bold>Methods</bold>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. For the map input, we calculated a 2mF<sub>o</sub>-DF<sub>C</sub> composite omit map using the modified true positive model and the deposited structure factors. A composite omit map is a crystallographic density map that reduces model bias by omitting small regions of the model, calculating the density for each omitted segment, and then combining the results into a final map <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To evaluate the impact of qFit-ligand algorithmic improvements, we compared the modified true positive dataset to the output of qFit-ligand (qFit-ligand dataset), evaluating three primary metrics: RSCC, EDIAm, and ligand torsion strain <bold>(Methods)</bold>. RSCC evaluates how well the model fits into the electron density, with values exceeding 0.80 indicating a satisfactory agreement between the model and experimental data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. EDIAm assesses the local agreement between atomic positions and the electron density map, providing a more sensitive per-atom measure of model quality, where higher values indicate stronger support from the experimental data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Torsion strain measures the physical viability of predicted conformations, where lower strain values suggest more stable and naturally occurring conformations. To carry out these strain calculations, we use the software <italic>TLDR: Strain</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, which calculates ligand strain by comparing the torsional angle populations of a ligand to those in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), quickly assessing strain energy without detailed quantum or molecular mechanical calculations. This is a different strain calculation than what is used internally in RDKit, ensuring that this is a somewhat independent metric. We note that there is currently no consensus in the field regarding what constitutes a significant improvement in RSCC, EDIAm, or strain, but we believe that any marginal improvements likely reflect a model that more accurately reflects the underlying experimental data.</p>
<p>qFit-ligand modeled an alternative conformation in 72.5% (n=98) of structures. Compared with the modified true positive models, 83.7% (n=113) of qFit-ligand models have a better RSCC and 77.0% (n=104) structures saw an improvement in EDIAm, representing an improved fit to experimental data in the vast majority of structures.</p>
<p>Further, the majority of structures (61.5%, n=83) exhibited reduced torsional strain with qFit-ligand, with a mean difference of-0.2 kcal/mol (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref><bold>, B, </bold><xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that over half of the qFit-ligand models were more energetically favorable compared to the modified true positive models, however, the majority of these improvements were of relatively low magnitude. The increased strain of the modified true positives may be due to the removal of correctly modeled alternate conformations observed in the deposited structures, followed by re-refinement of an incomplete single conformer model using Phenix. Thus, the reduced strain observed in our qFit-ligand models relative to the modified true positives is not unexpected. Overall, 48.9% (n=66) of ligands had both improved RSCC and reduced torsional strain, demonstrating that we frequently improved the fit between experimental data, while also maintaining or improving the strain.</p>

</fig>
<p>To identify places for algorithmic improvement, we examined the five qFit-ligand structures for which there was the greatest degradation in strain compared to the input model. In most cases, the unrefined qFit-ligand model displayed strain levels that were much closer to the modified true positive, but strain increased after refinement with Phenix (<xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). While refinement improves the correlation between the model and the electron density map, it may inadvertently increase strain without careful calibration of geometry weights and restraint files. This should be carefully examined by the modeler.</p>
<p>To assess improvements over the prior version of qFit-ligand, we examined how the prior version performed on the modified true positive dataset. Compared to the prior version, we found that the new qFit-ligand achieved higher RSCC values in 57.8% (n=78) of the structures (<xref rid="fig2s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>), lower strain in 68.9% (n=93) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>), and higher EDIAm in 85.9% (n=116) (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C, D</xref>). We closely examined outlier cases where the new qFit-ligand most dramatically outperformed its predecessor. Among the 10 structures with the largest strain reduction and concurrent increase in RSCC and EDIAm, 6 of the deposited true positive models exhibited branching disorder, where a side chain in the ligand adopts an alternate conformation. In these models, the new qFit-ligand decreased strain by up to 8.1 kcal/mol, increased RSCC by up to 0.4, and increased EDIAm by up to 0.6. These examples highlight an improvement in our modeling of non-localized conformational disorder, where the structural heterogeneity affects large portions or the entirety of the ligand, often involving shifts in all atomic coordinates or branching side chains (<xref rid="fig2s5" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, among the structures where the prior algorithm produced a model with a higher RSCC (n=56), 67.9% (n=38/56) were found to be higher in strain compared to the models created by the new qFit-ligand. This suggests that while the prior algorithm sometimes provided a better fit to the density, it often did so by compromising on structural or geometric integrity of the ligand. Moreover, of the structures where the prior qFit-ligand produced a model with a better RSCC (n=56), only 14.3% (n=8/56) had a new model RSCC lower than 0.80, indicating that the new qFit-ligand models were still generally well correlated to the experimental data. This demonstrates that the new qFit-ligand algorithm strikes a better balance between agreement with the density data and low strain conformations. This directly addresses a major limitation in the prior version of qFit-ligand, which often produced conformers that fit the density but were physically or chemically unrealistic, as evidenced by their higher strain.</p>

<title>Determining the Operational Bounds of qFit-ligand Using Synthetic Data</title>
<p>To determine the lowest ligand occupancy qFit-ligand can accurately recognize and model across resolution ranges, we constructed a synthetic dataset comprised of four main ligand types. These include a ligand with a localized ring flip (3SC), a long linear ligand with non-localized displacement (3P3), one with localized disorder from a simple torsional shift, (9BM) and a macrocycle with both branching and terminal end rotation heterogeneity (AR9) <bold>(Figure 3—figure supplement 1)</bold>. For each ligand type, we designed an alternate conformation in COOT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and created synthetic density data across a range of conformer occupancy ratios (0.50/0.50, 0.40/0.60, 0.30/0.70, 0.20/0.80, and 0.10/0.90) and map resolutions (0.8 to 2.5 Å, in 0.1 Å increments) <bold>(Methods)</bold>. This resulted in 360 unique pairs of electron density maps and models, representing various combinations of conformer occupancy and resolution, which we refer to as the “true” structures <bold>(Figure 3—figure supplement 1)</bold>. We then inserted only the “A” conformers into qFit-ligand to evaluate its ability to predict and approximate the “B” conformer for each ligand type.</p>
<p>We directly compare the RSCC of the output qFit-ligand models with the true structures containing both conformers <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref><bold>, B)</bold>. We observe a decrease in RSCC as resolution gets worse for all occupancy ratios. As map resolution approaches 2.0 Å, regardless of the occupancy split, there is a notable decline in qFit-ligand model RSCC. This suggests that qFit-ligand performs most effectively and consistently with map resolutions better than 2.0 Å.</p>

</fig>
<p>While RSCC quantifies the overall map to model fit, our ultimate objective is the accurate recovery of alternate conformers. Therefore, we further utilized RMSD calculations to examine qFit-ligand’s ability of recovering the ‘B’ conformer present in the true model. We found that doing this successfully was correlated with the alternative conformer occupancy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). qFit-ligand models originating from a true model with an occupancy ratio of 0.50/0.50 and 0.60/0.40 exhibit comparable accuracy. Models with a 0.70/0.30 split begin to display marginally higher RMSD values, as well as an increase in inconsistency across map resolutions, though still remaining within acceptable limits. However, models at 0.80/0.20 exhibit greater variability across resolutions, with those at 0.90/0.10 showing even more pronounced inconsistencies.</p>
<p>We show an example of the true versus qFit-ligand generated models for the 3SC ligand at a map resolution of 0.8 Å, with a true model conformer occupancy split of 0.50/0.50 and 0.20/0.80 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). These results suggest that the qFit-ligand occupancy detection limit is around 30%.</p>

<title>qFit-ligand applied to unbiased dataset of experimental true positives</title>
<p>To determine how qFit-ligand performed on an independent dataset, we curated a new benchmark from the initial true positive collection of 1,534 structures, excluding those used in the development set. Recognizing the impracticality of manually inspecting every structure and the detection limit we identified in the synthetic dataset we applied additional filtering metrics to ensure data quality. Structures were required to have two deposited conformers with a root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of at least 0.2 Å, an average ligand B-factor of less than 80 Å<sup>2</sup>, and conformer occupancies of at least 0.3.</p>
<p>This process yielded a final set of 589 structures for analysis <bold>(Figure 2—figure supplement 1)</bold>.</p>
<p>For all structures, we generated a modified true positive by deleting alternative conformers, setting occupancy to 1, and re-refining the model. We then followed the same outline as above, including pre-qFit refinement, qFit-ligand, and post-qFit refinement. The qFit-ligand models yielded 46.0% (n=271) with a single conformer, 35.7% (n=210) with two conformers, and 18.3% (n=108) with three conformers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Comparing qFit-ligand models to the modified true positives, 79.8% (n=470) showed an enhanced RSCC and 80.6% (n=475) of the complexes had a higher EDIAm value (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), reflecting a superior fit to the density map. qFit-ligand models had a reduced torsional strain in 55.3% (n=326) of structures, though the overall strain difference was minimal in most cases (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>qFit-ligand shows particular strength in scenarios with strong evidence of unmodeled alternate conformations, often improving the fit to density, while sometimes improving the torsional strain. Interestingly, despite modeling a single conformer in nearly half of the structures, there is little to no evidence of qFit-ligand decreasing model-to-map fit. In fact, some of these single conformers show improved quality relative to the modified true positives (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). These findings reinforce that qFit-ligand is not only capable of detecting alternate conformers when supported by the data, but also serves as a valuable alternative to manual ligand modeling even in single conformer cases.</p>

<sec id="s2i">
<title>Evaluating qFit-ligand on a set of structures known to be highly strained</title>
<p>High ligand strain is energetically unfavorable, and the associated energy penalty paid to adopt a distorted bound conformation reduces overall binding affinity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Because of this, it is generally accepted that drug-like molecules should adopt low-energy, minimally strained geometries. However, optimizing both fit to density and internal energetics simultaneously remains a challenge <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. While our modified true positive datasets demonstrate that qFit-ligand can alleviate distortion by recovering alternate conformations, these cases are somewhat artificial; removing a valid altloc and re-refining can artificially inflate energetic penalties. To further validate our approach, we tested qFit-ligand on deposited structures with genuinely unfavorable conformations to gain a better understanding of whether our modeling algorithm impacts strain by discovering multiple low-energy conformations that satisfy the density as well, or better, than a single high-energy conformation.</p>
<p>To this end, we curated a dataset of deposited structures containing ligands with unusually high conformational energy by collecting all PDB entries with a resolution between 1.0 and 1.8 Å, an R<sub>free</sub> below 0.25, and a ligand molecular weight between 400 and 520 Da. We required the structures to not have a deposited alternate conformer.</p>
<p>From an initial pool of 5,452 structures, we followed the pre-qFit-ligand refinement protocol previously described, calculated ligand energies, and selected those exceeding 10 kcal/mol for our final dataset. This resulted in a collection of 191 structures that we used as input to qFit-ligand (Supplementary Table 2). We note that there is no consensus in the field as to what constitutes high strain, but that 10 kcal/mol represents a conservative, if somewhat arbitrary cutoff <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>qFit-ligand modeled 75.4% (n=144) of the structures with a single conformer, while 19.4% (n=37) had two conformers, and 5.2% (n=10) had three conformers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, even without modeling an alternative conformer in the majority of structures, RSCC and EDIAm increased over the deposited model (RSCC increase-53.4% of structures (n=102), EDIAm 81.2% (n=155), and strain decreased in 66.5% (n=127) <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Many of these strain improvements came from from the pool of 144 single conformer outputs, suggesting that qFit-ligand is able to sample from highly strained input models to result in new models that are out of a local minima <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref><bold>, top)</bold>. In fact, the largest strain reductions in this dataset came from this pool of improved single conformer models. We also identified several examples of qFit-ligand lowering strain through the addition of a well modeled alternate conformation <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref><bold>, bottom; 5D)</bold>. In summary, our analysis reveals that qFit-ligand models adopt strain energies that are generally lowered from geometrically distorted deposited models, which supports using qFit-ligand to correct those distorsions, even in the single conformer case.</p>

<title>qFit-ligand can automatically detect and model multiple conformations of macrocycles</title>
<p>While small molecules are great for inhibiting proteins with deep pockets, many proteins with pharmaceutical interests are classified as “undruggable”, due to their flat surfaces or involvement in protein-protein interactions. Macrocycles, cyclic molecules consisting of 12 or more atoms, have a great ability to interact with flat surfaces or shallow grooves <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Due to their high degrees of freedom, the conformations of macrocycles are difficult to sample exhaustively and are likely to adopt a diverse ensemble in solution and even when bound to a receptor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>With our improved sampling strategy, we wanted to evaluate if we could accurately model multiple conformations of macrocycles. We utilized a dataset of 150 cyclic ligands with map resolutions ranging from 1.1-3.6 Å assembled during the development of XGen, an ensemble-based method for modeling macrocycles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Through an ensemble modeling strategy, XGen encodes several full-system copies that collectively satisfy the experimental data using restrained force field energy calculations. This procedure frequently reduced strain compared to input structures. In contrast, qFit-ligand represents conformational heterogeneity through a multiconformer approach, labeling discrete parsimonious conformations with alternative location indicators (altlocs). We wanted to determine if we could detect and explain the similar conformational heterogeneity as XGen using qFit-ligand and multiconformer models.</p>
<p>All the originally deposited macrocycles models contain only single conformer ligands. As done above, we re-refined the deposited models before running qFit-ligand. Of these, 19.33% (n=29) could not be refined against the deposited structure factors and were removed from the analysis. We then ran qFit-ligand as described in the methods section, and re-refined output structures. Refinement is notoriously difficult for macrocycles due to difficulty creating restraint files. This can lead to altered chemical connectivity, effectively changing ligand’s composition, therefore, we conducted post-refinement ligand geometry validation checks to ensure that the chemical connectivity of the ligand remained unchanged, even if the conformation varied (<bold>Methods</bold>). We identified 19 cases of compromised ligand geometry (8 from pre-qFit and 11 from post-qFit refinement), which were subsequently excluded from this analysis. Additionally, strain calculation failed in 19.3% of cases (n=29/150), producing N/A values, leaving 73 structures available for final analysis (Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Table 4). Of note, the strain algorithm used was not developed for macrocycles, so this was not completely unexpected <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The resolution range of the remaining structures was between 1.4 and 3.2 Å. The loss of structures reflect broader limitations in current bioinformatics and refinement protocols when handling complex macrocycle ligands.</p>
<p>Analysis of qFit-ligand models for these 73 macrocycles shows the following distribution of conformers per model: 39.7% (n=29) having one conformation, 34.3% (n=25) having two conformations, and 26.0% (n=19) having three conformations (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). Compared to the single-conformer deposited models, qFit-ligand improved the RSCC in 69.9% (n=51) of structures (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We observed a correlation between the number of conformers generated by qFit-ligand and the RSCC of the input model (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B), where a lower input RSCC increases the likelihood of identifying more alternate conformers. For our EDIAm calculations, we assume that the electron density contribution from an atom adopts a spherical shape. This assumption becomes invalid at map resolutions worse than 2Å, as the atomic scattering factors can no longer be reliably be approximated by the Gaussian functions. Only 36 structures met the 2Å resolution criteria, and we computed EDIAm values for this subset. Among them, 58.3% (n=21/36) showed higher EDIAm values in the qFit-ligand models compared to their corresponding deposited structures (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Torsion strain analysis showed that 57.5% (n=42/73) of structures had a lower qFit-ligand model strain, with a mean strain difference of-0.1 kcal/mol. This indicates that, on average, our models maintain a similar level of energetic favorability as the deposited structures, while improving the fit to density (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A,C</xref>).</p>

<p>A few outlier cases have substantially reduced strain in the qFit-ligand models, particularly PDB 4Z2G, which shows a decrease of 4.61 kcal/mol <bold>(Figure 6—figure supplement 1C)</bold>. In this case, qFit-ligand generated two conformers: one similar, including the strained pathologies, to the deposited model and a second, distinct conformer. Using COOT’s ligand distortion tool, we compared the strain between the deposited and this distinct qFit-ligand ‘B’ conformer by analyzing each bond and angle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. This tool evaluates deviations from ideal geometries based on COD (Crystallography Open Database) data, with restraint dictionaries generated through the AceDRG program <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> <bold>(Methods)</bold>. In the qFit model, the overall strain is lower because alternative conformer ‘A’ is now at partial occupancy and the ‘B’ conformer has much lower strain. Overall, while qFit-ligand primarily improves RSCC across most models, in a subset of cases, it also substantially reduces strain, demonstrating its ability to enhance both the fit and the energetic favorability of macrocycle conformations.</p>

<title>qFit-ligand recovers heterogeneity in fragment-soaked event maps</title>
<p>X-ray crystallography-based fragment screens have taken off in academic and industry settings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Accurately modeling fragments is essential for effective building and merging strategies to create more drug-like molecules. However, as fragments are often bound at low occupancy, modeling into traditional 2F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub> maps is incredibly difficult. To overcome this, ‘event maps’ are often created to detect low occupancy ligands by averaging electron density across many apo datasets and subtracting these from the density of a potential ligand bound structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. This produces a ligand binding “event map” and an estimate of the ligand occupancy.

<p>Therefore, we wanted to determine if qFit-ligand could automatically identify and model multiple conformations in event maps.</p>
<p>To assess qFit-ligand’s ability to detect multiple conformations in event maps, we took advantage of ongoing fragment based drug discovery efforts through the UCSF QCRG Antiviral Drug Discovery (AViDD) program to design inhibitors against the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) NSP3 macrodomain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. We identified previously published and new fragments manually modeled with multiple conformations (n=20) (Supplementary Table 5). We used these as a true positive dataset to determine if we could identify multiple fragment conformations in event maps using qFit-ligand.</p>
<p>We created a modified true positive dataset (n=20) by removing all ‘B’ conformers and setting the ‘A’ conformer occupancy to 1.0. qFit-ligand was then run as described above, but with an event map, rather than a composite omit map (<bold>Methods</bold>). To determine how precisely we captured the second conformation, we calculated the RMSD between the manually modeled ‘B’ conformer and the closest qFit-ligand conformer for each structure (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Only 9 of the structures exhibit an RMSD of less than 0.5 Å, indicating that for approximately half of the cases, our algorithm struggles to recapitulate the second deposited conformer. Of the 11 of fragments with poor RMSD, about a third (n=4/11) adopted a completely different binding pose, which our current algorithm often fails to capture accurately due to reliance on the input model. This highlights a limitation of our sampling strategy and suggests a potential direction for future development (Figure 7—figure supplement 1).</p>

</fig>
<p>Despite this, compared to the modified true positive models, the qFit-ligand models had a higher RSCC in 17 structures, and a higher EDIAm in 15 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B, C</xref>). There are a number of structures for which we calculate an RMSD &gt; 0.5 Å and also an improved qFit-ligand map-to-model fit. In many of these cases, the improvement is generally very small. In others, we believe they represent situations where multiple combinations of conformations can accurately represent the underlying data. For instance, in PDB 7HHW the qFit-ligand model generated a flipped Thiophene compared to the deposited model, resulting in a relatively high RMSD to the deposited’B’ while still providing an equally good fit to the electron density <bold>(Figure 7—figure supplement 2)</bold>. In addition, the torsion strain analysis reveals that 13 of structures have a lower strain in the qFit-ligand model, and 12 structures have both a higher RSCC and a lower model strain in the qFit-ligand model (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). While the mean strain improvement in the qFit-ligand models was marginal, only-0.6 kcal/mol, it indicates that we can reliably fit to density without straining the molecule (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>).</p>
<p>In this use case, qFit-ligand models alternative conformations into an event map, which represents only partial occupancy of the unit cell. Therefore, we scale the output ligand conformer occupancies to estimated occupancy from the background density correction prior to merging into the full system. Following this scaling, we perform standard refinement and note that the sum of occupancy across ligand conformations is a refined variable that can be &lt;1. Together, these results suggest that qFit-ligand can be used alongside manual modeling of fragment modeling, but additional development is needed where there are large ligand conformational changes.</p>

<title>qFit-ligand models multiple conformations of ligands into cryo-EM density maps</title>
<p>Recent advances in cryo-EM are resulting in many reconstructions with better than 2Å resolution. At this resolution, it is possible to resolve conformational heterogeneity at the atomic level, prompting us to determine if qFit-ligand can capture this heterogeneity. To evaluate the performance of qFit-ligand on cryo-EM data, we examined recently deposited inhibitors of human CDK-activating kinase (CAK), a three-subunit protein complex recognized as a compelling candidate for cancer and antiviral drug development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Four of their molecules were manually modeled as multiconformer ligands, providing a valuable set of true positives (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). All map resolutions were better than 2Å, and ligand molecular weights were between 350 - 397 Da (Supplementary Table 7).</p>

<p>For each deposited model, we created a new modified single conformer true positive following the same procedure as outlined above. Next, we applied a similar pipeline as with the other true positive datasets. For both refinement stages, we instead used <italic>phenix.real_space_refine</italic> <bold>(Methods)</bold> with the deposited EM map. In all four structures, qFit-ligand identified a second conformation. Compared to the modified single conformer true positive input model, all generated multiconformers were improved in terms of RSCC, EDIAm, and strain (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Across the four structures, RSCC increased by up to 0.1, EDIAm by up to 0.2, and strain decreased by up to 2.3 kcal/mol in the qFit-ligand models. Interestingly, in all of the structures, qFit-ligand place slightly different conformations and occupancies compared to the deposited model, however, all resulted in improved RSCC and strain, although two out of the four structures had lower EDIAm (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). This result suggests that qFit-ligand can be used to model conformational heterogeneity to improve model quality in cryo-EM derived structures, although this needs to be examined with a larger dataset.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although ligands can retain conformational flexibility when bound to receptors, this conformational heterogeneity is rarely captured in deposited models, potentially leading to misinterpretations of protein-ligand interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. A key reason for this modeling gap is the significant compositional and conformational heterogeneity surrounding ligands, making accurate modeling of ligands particularly challenging. qFit-ligand directly tackles the challenge of conformational heterogeneity by automatically modeling alternative ligand conformations in high-resolution X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM maps with clear unmodeled features. It is advisable to employ qFit-ligand selectively, focusing on cases where there is a moderate correlation between the input model and the experimental data, strong visual density in the binding pocket, high map resolution, or when a single conformer ligand model is strained.</p>
<p>The major advancements in qFit-ligand presented here stem from integrating the torsionally aware sampling strategy from RDKit resulting in a reduction of ligand torsional strain, while still providing an increase in model to map fit. We observed this improvement in both ligands that fit by multiple low strain conformations, along with improved fit of single ligand conformations. High ligand strain is energetically unfavorable and can reduce binding affinity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Therefore, we would expect that most observed protein-ligand complexes in the PDB are likely to represent relatively unstrained ligands. While the majority of deposited structures are low in strain, analyses across multiple tools reveal a wide distribution of strain observed, with many structures having high strain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. We demonstrate the possibility of using qFit-ligand to fix high-strain ligands by identifying where multiple ligand conformations should be used, or by improving the geometry of a single conformation through torsionally aware sampling.</p>
<p>In addition to these overall improvements, we have expanded qFit-ligand in three primary directions. First, we enabled qFit ligand to model conformational heterogeneity in macrocycles. Macrocycles have the possibility for targeting’undruggable’ proteins because their exceptional conformational flexibility allows them to interact effectively with relatively flat protein surfaces <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. We showed that qFit-ligand can parsimoniously capture the heterogeneity present in bound macrocycles, often improving fit to density while lowering strain compared to the deposited single-conformer structures. While a previous effort, XGen, showed that ensemble representations of macrocycles also reduced the strain compared to deposited structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, ensemble models are complex to analyze, difficult to manipulate in model building software <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, and require specific refinement protocols that prevent easy integration into modeling pipelines.</p>
<p>Second, we have added capabilities to model partially occupied fragments from high throughput screening campaigns. The popularity of X-ray crystallography-based fragment screening has surged due to beamline improvements and algorithmic developments that enhance detection of low-occupancy binding events <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Fragments can potentially bind in multiple conformations due to the small size and promiscuous or weak interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. We expanded qFit-ligand to automatically model fragments into event maps. Because of the weak signal in event maps, we emphasize the importance of manual scrutiny of the output conformations for fragments to an even greater extent than for larger, fully occupied ligands. Further, we identified that qFit-ligand has difficulty identifying alternative conformations resulting from larger translations and “ligand flips” that are more common with fragment screening. We have also added an experimental flag that samples 180 degree flips of ligands; however, this approach should only be used as an exploratory tool where there is a strong visual prior.</p>
<p>Third, we can now apply qFit-ligand to cryo-EM data. This capability opens up exciting new opportunities for structure-based drug discovery. There are several applications where cryo-EM is better suited to experimental objectives than crystallography, including the characterization of dynamic and heterogeneous biomolecular assemblies in more native-like environments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. As a proof of principle, we showed that qFit-ligand can recapitulate deposited alternate conformations from a ligand series, demonstrating its potential to model multiconformer ligands directly into high-resolution cryo-EM density maps.</p>
<p>Despite these advancements, qFit-ligand has room for further improvement. Our approach is limited by its reliance on an initial single-conformer structure, which introduces bias toward the starting model and hinders effective exploration of conformational space when the input ligand is poorly resolved. Additionally, qFit-ligand performs best when unmodeled density is consistent with subtle conformational changes, such as torsion angle variations or minor translational shifts. It struggles to identify more dramatic conformational heterogeneity, such as 180 degree flip ligand conformations as seen in our fragment dataset <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. As such, qFit-ligand primarily serves as a “thought partner” for manual modeling. Modelers still must resolve many ambiguities, including initial ligand placement, in order to fully take advantage of qFit capabilities. In active modeling workflows or large scale analyses, the workflow would only accept the output of qFit-ligand when it improves model quality. In cases where qFit-ligand degrades map-to-model fit and/or strain, we can simply revert to the input model. In practice, users can easily remove poorly fitting conformations using molecular modeling software such as COOT, while keeping the well modeled conformations, which is an advantage of the multiconformer approach over ensemble refinement methods.</p>
<p>Additionally, our algorithm’s placement within the larger refinement and ligand modeling ecosystem highlighted other areas that need improvement. We note that macrocycles, due to their complicated and interconnected degrees of freedom, suffer acutely from the refinement issues, as demonstrated by the failure of approximately one-third of datasets in our standard preparation or post-refinement pipelines due to ligand parameterization issues. Many of these stemmed from problematic ligand restraint files, highlighting the difficulty of encoding the geometric constraints of macrocycles using standard restraint libraries. Improved force-field or restraints for macrocycles are desperately needed to improve their modeling. New approaches such as quantum mechanical restraints (QMR) refinement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, which replaces standard geometric restraints with <italic>in situ</italic> energy-minimized quantum calculations, may offer a path towards more accurate modeling of chemically complex ligands. We note that even linear non-canonical peptides present similar failure modes to macrocycles, with a mix of ATOM and HETATM records and the need for custom cif definitions and link records. For these reasons, we did not include analysis on small peptide ligands; however, canonical peptides can be modeled with standard qFit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Finally, we ultimately strive for modeling the conformational heterogeneity across the entire system including ligands, proteins, nucleic acids, and water molecules. Currently, qFit algorithms allow for modeling either the protein or the ligand separately, focusing on the conformational possibilities of one while treating the other as static <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Joint modeling across all system components would generate conformational ensembles that enhance our understanding of how the conformational heterogeneity of each component impacts the other. However, the combinatorial complexity of such problems is ill-suited for the sample-and-select strategies employed by qFit. Beyond the computational modeling advancements, without machine-readable and human-interpretable encoding, we will remain limited in understanding the natural heterogeneity that impacts molecular recognition and drug design <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Overall, qFit-ligand provides structural biologists with an efficient tool for modeling parsimonious multiconformer ligand models that fit optimally into electron density maps, reducing the need for manual intervention, aiding in understanding how conformational heterogeneity impacts ligand binding and downstream biology.</p>

<p>ETKDG is an enhancement of traditional Distance Geometry (DG), implemented within RDKit’s EmbedMultipleConfs function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. During the distance bounds matrix construction, bounds are set for 1-2 (bonded atoms), 1-3 (bond-angle related atoms), 1-4 (torsion angle related atoms), and 1-5 interactions, based on empirical knowledge of ideal bond lengths and angles from chemical structures. These bounds are subsequently sampled and embedded into 3D coordinates.

<p>When bulk solvent correction is included, it adjusts the electron density by assuming the presence of uniform solvent in regions of low density, such as areas surrounding the ligand. This can reduce the contrast between weak ligand density and the surrounding solvent, potentially smearing or flattening the electron density around flexible or poorly ordered regions like alternative ligand conformations. By excluding bulk solvent correction, you retain the raw electron density in those regions, ensuring the density is not artificially raised or smoothed. This allows clearer visualization of weak or partial densities that might indicate alternative conformers.</p>

</disp-formula>
The distance-dependent weighting factor ω(<italic>p, a</italic>) distinguishes between meaningful and excess electron density near atom <italic>a</italic>, assigning negative weights to density located outside the atom’s expected region. The ownership function <italic>o(p, a</italic>) allocates each grid point <italic>p</italic> to one or more atoms, determining which parts of the map are attributed to which atoms. The density score <italic>z(p</italic>) for an atom <italic>a</italic> is then computed as follows:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="613996v2_ueqn10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Where ζ = 1.2, <italic>ρ(p</italic>) represents the density at grid point <italic>p</italic>, μ is the mean of the 2<sub>9-:94</sub> map, and σ is the root mean square of the 2<sub>9-:94</sub> map. To quantify the fit of an entire molecule to the electron density map (EDIAm), the EDIA score is first computed for each atom individually and then combined across all atoms in the ligand. Code for calculating EDIAm is available on our GitHub repository.</p>

<title>RMSD</title>
<p>Root Mean Squared Deviation (RMSD) is a widely used metric in structural biology for comparing molecular conformations. It measures the average distance between corresponding atoms of two superimposed structures, and is valuable for assessing differences in conformers, protein structures, and ligand poses.</p>
<p>The RMSD between two sets of atomic coordinates is calculated using the formula:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="613996v2_ueqn11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Where <italic>N</italic> is the number of atoms, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="613996v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> are the coordinates of the <italic>i</italic>-th atom in the two conformers.</p>

<title>Torsion Strain</title>
<p>To calculate molecular strain, we take advantage of software available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tldr.docking.org/">https://tldr.docking.org/</ext-link> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The TLDR software employs a statistical method based on torsion patterns observed in crystal structures. It identifies all torsions in an input molecule, where each pattern consists of a sequence of four atoms forming a dihedral angle. These patterns are compared against a pre-compiled library of torsion energies sourced from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) and Protein Data Bank (PDB).</p>
<p>For each torsion pattern, the software retrieves a histogram of observed dihedral angles and their associated energies. The dihedral angle of the molecule’s conformation is matched to this histogram, and the corresponding energy is determined. This process is repeated for all torsion patterns in the molecule, and the total strain energy is calculated by summing the individual torsion energies.</p>

<title>Generating a Synthetic Dataset</title>
<p>To create our synthetic dataset, we constructed four multiconformer ligands using COOT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. We generated five new PDB files for each ligand, varying the occupancy between the two conformers in the ratios: 0.50/0.50, 0.40/0.60, 0.30/0.70, 0.20/0.80, and 0.10/0.90. These files represent different relative populations of the conformers. For each of these ligand models, we produced a series of electron density maps covering resolutions from 0.8 Å to 2.5 Å, with increments of 0.1 Å using <italic>phenix.fmodel.</italic> This process involves the following steps.</p>
<p>For each given ligand input coordinate file, the script adjusts the B-factors, or temperature factors, of ligand atoms based on the specified resolution. As the resolution degrades from 0.8 Å to 2.5 Å, the B-factors incrementally increase. This adjustment models the increased positional uncertainty of atoms that typically occurs at lower resolutions. The modified ligand structures with these adjusted B-factors at each resolution level are saved as new PDB files. Following this, the script utilizes <italic>phenix.fmodel</italic> to calculate theoretical structure factors from each altered atomic model. These structure factors are then used to compute synthetic electron density maps. To each of these maps, we generate and add random Gaussian noise values scaled proportionally to the resolution. This scaling reflects the escalation of experimental noise as resolution deteriorates, a common occurrence in real-life crystallographic data.</p>
<p><italic>phenix.fmodel</italic> is used with the following parameters:</p>
<p>phenix.fmodel input_pdb_file.pdb k_sol=0.4 b_sol=45 high_resolution= &lt;resolution&gt; r_free_flags_fraction=0.05 output.file_name=output_file.mtz</p>

X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Light Source (ALS beamline 8.3.1) or the Stanford Synchrotron Light Source (SSRL beamline 9-2). Data were indexed, integrated and scaled with XDS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> and merged with Aimless <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. The P43 Mac1 crystals contain two copies of the protein in the asymmetric unit (chains A and B). The active site of chain A is open, however chain B is blocked by a crystal contact. We previously observed that potent Mac1 inhibitors dissolve crystals, likely through the displacement of the B chain crystal contact <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. In addition, crystal packing in the chain A active site restricts movement of the Ala129-Gly134 loop, leading to decreased occupancy for compounds with substituents on the pyrrolidinone. To aid modeling the resulting conformational and compositional disorder, we used the PanDDA method <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> to model ligands where the occupancy was low (&lt;25%) or where there was substantial disorder.

<caption><title>RDKit determines a distance bounds matrix for a molecule by establishing upper and lower bounds for interatomic distances.</title> <p>These bounds are informed by experimental data and chemical knowledge of bond length, angle, and dihedral angle preferences obtained from the Cambridge Structural Database. Within a torsion angle formed by four atoms, the minimum distance between atoms 1 and 4 corresponds to the syn conformation, and the maximum distance corresponds to the anti conformation. These specific distances, d for syn and d’ for anti, are recorded in the bounds matrix as the lower and upper bounds, respectively. This is performed for every distance between each atom in the molecule. Randomly sampling these bounds with RDKit’s implementation of ETKDG gives rise to different conformations of the torsion angle.</p></caption>

The deposited conformer is highly strained, with the highest bond penalty scores of 71.97 (C<sub>1</sub>-O<sub>2</sub>) and 69.32 (C<sub>14</sub>-O<sub>3</sub>), and the highest angle penalty scores of 29.97 (C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>1</sub>-O<sub>2</sub>) and 25.5 (O<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>14</sub>-N<sub>1</sub>). The qFit-ligand ‘B’ conformer is significantly less distorted at these locations.

The closest qFit-ligand conformer (yellow) shares an extremely similar atomic space with the deposited ‘B’, differing primarily due to a flipped Thiophene, resulting in the high RMSD.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Flowers et al describe an improved version of qFit-ligand, an extension of qFit. qFit and qFit-ligand seek to model conformational heterogeneity of proteins and ligands, respectively, cryo-EM and X-ray (electron) density maps using multiconformer models-essentially extensions of the traditional alternate conformer approach in which substantial parts of the protein or ligand are kept in place. By contrast, ensemble approaches represent conformational heterogeneity through a superposition of independent molecular conformations.</p>
<p>The authors provide a clear and systematic description of the improvements made to the code, most notably the implementation of a different conformer generator algorithm centered around RDKit. This approach yields modest improvements in the strain of the proposed conformers (meaning that more physically reasonable conformations are generated than with the &quot;old&quot; qFit-ligand) and real space correlation of the model with the experimental electron density maps, indicating that the generated conformers also better explain the experimental data then before. In addition, the authors expand the scope of ligands that can be treated, most notably allowing for multi conformer modeling of macrocyclic compounds.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written, provides a thorough analysis, and represents a needed improvement of our collective ability to model small-molecule binding to macromolecules based on cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography, and can therefore has a positive impact on both drug discovery and general biological research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Weaknesses were addressed during review. Overall, the demonstrated performance gains are modest.</p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>(1) The accuracy of initial placement may be critical. At the same time, in my experience ambiguous cases are quite common, for example with flat ligands with a few substituents sticking out or with ligands with highly mobile tails. There remain some questions regarding sensitivity to initial ligand placement, which individual users should check for.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Flowers et al describe an improved version of qFit-ligand, an extension of qFit. qFit and qFit-ligand seek to model conformational heterogeneity of proteins and ligands, respectively, cryo-EM and X-ray (electron) density maps using multi-conformer models - essentially extensions of the traditional alternate conformer approach in which substantial parts of the protein or ligand are kept in place. By contrast, ensemble approaches represent conformational heterogeneity through a superposition of independent molecular conformations.</p>
<p>The authors provide a clear and systematic description of the improvements made to the code, most notably the implementation of a different conformer generator algorithm centered around RDKit. This approach yields modest improvements in the strain of the proposed conformers (meaning that more physically reasonable conformations are generated than with the &quot;old&quot; qFit-ligand) and real space correlation of the model with the experimental electron density maps, indicating that the generated conformers also better explain the experimental data than before. In addition, the authors expand the scope of ligands that can be treated, most notably allowing for multi-conformer modeling of macrocyclic compounds.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written, provides a thorough analysis, and represents a needed improvement of our collective ability to model small-molecule binding to macromolecules based on cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography, and can therefore have a positive impact on both drug discovery and general biological research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are several points where the manuscript needs clarification in order to better understand the merits of the described work. Overall the demonstrated performance gains are modest (although the theoretical ceiling on gains in model fit and strain energy are not clear!).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful review. To address comments, we have added clarifying statements and discussion points around the extent of performance gains, our choice of benchmarking metrics, and the “standards” in the field for significance. We expanded our analysis to highlight how to use qFit ligand in “discovery” mode, which is aimed at supporting individual modeling efforts. As we now write in the discussion:</p>
<p>“It is advisable to employ qFit-ligand selectively, focusing on cases with a moderate correlation between your input model and the experimental data, strong visual density in the binding pocket, high map resolution, or when your single-conformer ligand model is strained.”</p>
<p>Additionally, we note in the discussion:</p>
<p>“qFit-ligand primarily serves as a “thought partner” for manual modeling. Modelers still must resolve many ambiguities, including initial ligand placement, to fully take advantage of qFit capabilities. In active modeling workflows or large scale analyses, the workflow would only accept the output of qFit-ligand when it improves model quality. In cases where qFit-ligand degrades map-to-model fit and/or strain, we can simply revert to the input model. In practice, users can easily remove poorly fitting conformations using molecular modeling software such as COOT, while keeping the well modeled conformations, which is an advantage of the multiconformer approach over ensemble refinement methods.”</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Flowers et al. aimed to enhance the accuracy of automated ligand model building by refining the qFit-ligand algorithm. Recognizing that ligands can exhibit conformational flexibility even when bound to receptors, the authors developed a bioinformatic pipeline to model alternate ligand conformations while improving fitting and more energetically favorable conformations.</p>

<p>The authors present a computational pipeline designed to automatically model and fit ligands into electron density maps, identifying potential alternative conformations within the structures.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Ligand modeling, particularly in cases of poorly defined electron density, remains a challenging task. The procedure presented in this manuscript exhibits clear limitations in low-resolution electron density maps (resolution &gt; 2.0 Å) and low-occupancy scenarios, significantly restricting its applicability. Considering that the maps used to establish the operational bounds of qFit-ligand were synthetically generated, it's likely that the resolution cutoff will be even stricter when applied to real-world data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer #2 for their comments on the role of conformational flexibility and how our tool addresses the complexity involved in modeling alternative conformations. We agree that there are limitations at low resolution, limiting the application of our algorithm. That is the case with all structural biology tools. Automatically finding alternative conformations of ligands in high-resolution structures is an enhancement to the toolbox of ligand fitting. Expanding the algorithm to work with fragment screening data is important in this realm, as almost all of this data fits in the high-resolution range where qFit-ligand works best.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The reported changes in real-space correlation coefficients (RSCC) are not substantial, especially considering a cutoff of 0.1. Furthermore, the significance of improvements in the strain metric remains unclear. A comprehensive analysis of the distribution of this metric across the Protein Data Bank (PDB) would provide valuable insights.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the changes are small, partially because the baseline (manually modeled ligands) is very high. To provide additional evidence, we added evaluations using EDIAm, which is a more sensitive metric. In Figure 2 (page 10), representing the development dataset, we see more improvements above 0.1. With this being said, it is unclear what constitutes a ‘substantial’ improvement for either of these metrics, especially considering alternative conformations may only change the coordinates of a subset of ligands, just slightly improving the fit to density.</p>
<p>We agree that looking across the PDB on strain would provide valuable insight. To explore this, we looked to see how qFit-ligand could improve the fitting of deposited ligands with high strain (see section: Evaluating qFit-ligand on a set of structures known to be highly strained, Page 15). While only a subset of these structures had alternative conformers placed (24.6%), we observed that in this subset, the ligands often improved the RSCC and strain. This figure also demonstrates that while RSCC may not change much numerically, the alternative conformers explain previously unexplained density with lower energy conformers than what is currently deposited.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>To mitigate the risk of introducing bias by avoiding real strained ligand conformations, the authors should demonstrate the effectiveness of the new procedure by testing it on known examples of strained ligand-substrate complexes.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>A - Specific comments:</p>
<p>(1) It appears necessary to provide qFit-ligand with an initial model with the ligand already placed. This is not clear from the start of the introduction on page 3. It appears that ligand position is only weakly adjusted fairly late in the process, in step F of Figure 1. It seems, therefore, that the accuracy of initial placement is rather critical (see the example discussed on page 21). At the same time, in my experience, ambiguous cases are quite common, for example with flat ligands with a few substituents sticking out or with ligands with highly mobile tails. It would be helpful for the authors to comment on the sensitivity to initial ligand placement, either in the discussion or, better yet, in the form of an analysis in which the starting model position is randomly perturbed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our revised version, we have modified the introduction to clarify the necessity of including an initial ligand model (page 4).</p>
<p>“The qFit-ligand algorithm takes as input a crystal or cryo-EM structure of an initial protein-ligand complex with a single conformer ligand in PDBx/mmCIF format, a density map or structure factors (encoded by a ccp4 formatted map or an MTZ), and a SMILES string for the ligand.”</p>
<p>We also describe our sampling algorithm more clearly (see: Biasing Conformer Generation, page 6). Steps A-E generate many conformations (using RDKit), which are then selected/fit into experimental density (using quadratic programming). To help with additional shifting issues in the input ligand, after the first selection, we do additional rotation/translation of the generated conformers that are kept. We then do another round of fitting to the density (quadratic programming followed by mixed integer quadratic programming).</p>
<p>Given this sampling, we have not elected to do an additional computational experiment to test the “radius of convergence” or dependence on initial conditions. However, we outline the fundamental procedure here so that someone can build on the work and test the idea:</p>
<p>- Create single conformer models as we currently do</p>
<p>- randomly perturb the coordinates of the ligand by 0.1-0.3Å</p>
<p>- refine to convergence, creating a series of “perturbed, modified true positives” for each dataset</p>
<p>- Run qFit ligand</p>
<p>- Evaluate the variability in the resulting multi-conformer models</p>

<p>(2) Top of page 6 (&quot;Biasing Conformer Generation&quot;): the authors say &quot;as we only want to generate ligands that physically fit within the protein binding pocket, we bias conformation generation towards structures more likely to fit well within the receptor's binding site&quot;. Apart from the odd redundancy of this sentence, I am confused: at the stage that seems to be referred to here (A-C in Figure 1) is the fit to the electron density already taken into account, or does this only happen later (after step E)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have edited the statement to clarify it:</p>
<p>“To guide the conformation generation from the Chem.rdDistGeom based on the ligand type and protein pocket, we developed a suite of specialized sampling functions to bias the conformational search towards structures more likely to fit well into the receptor’s binding site.”</p>
<p>We do not consider the electron density during conformer generation (only selection from the generated conformers). The sampling is additionally biased by the type of ligand and the size of the binding pocket.</p>

<p>(3) qFit-ligand appears to be quite slow. Are there prospects for speedup? Can the code take advantage of GPUs or multi-CPU environments?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this. We have made some algorithmic improvements, most notably removing duplicate conformers based on root mean squared distance. This, along with parallelization, decreased the average runtime from ~19 minutes to ~8 minutes (see additional details: qFit-ligand runtime, page 8). We do not currently take advantage of GPU specific code.</p>

<p>(4) Section: Detection of experimental true positive multi-conformer ligands:</p>
<p>a) Why are carbohydrate ligands excluded? This seems like an important class of ligands that one would like qFit to be able to treat! Which brings me to a related question: can covalently attached groups (e.g., glycosylation sites!) be modeled using qFit-ligand, or is qFit-ligand restricted to non-covalently bound groups?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Currently, qFit-ligand does not support covalently bound ligands, but this is an area of interest we are hoping to expand into. In the revised version, we added the non-covalently attached carbohydrates back into the true positive dataset. In Figure 4 (page 14), we show that qFit-ligand is able to improve fit to the experimental density in around 80% of structures, while also often reducing torsion strain (see additional details: qFit-ligand applied to unbiased dataset of experimental true positives, page 14).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b) &quot;as well as 758 cases where the ligand model's deposited alternate conformations (altlocs) were not bound in the same chain and residue number&quot; - I do not understand what this means, or why it leads to the exclusion of so many structures. Likewise, a number of additional exclusions are described in Figure S3. Some more background on why these all happened would be helpful. Are you just left with the &quot;easy&quot; cases?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes modelers will list the multiple conformations of a bound ligand as a separate residue within the PDB file, rather than as a single multiconformer model. For example, rather than writing a multiconformer LIG bound at A, 201 with altlocs ‘A’ and ‘B’, a modeler might write this instead as LIG, A, 201 and LIG A, 301. We initially excluded these kinds of structures. However, we agree that this choice resulted in the removal of many potentially valid true positives. We have since updated our data processing pipeline to include these cases, and they are examined in the updated manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>c) I do not follow the argument made at the end of this section (last two paragraphs on page 9): &quot;when using a single average conformation to describe density from multiple conformations, the true low-energy states may be ignored&quot;. I get that, but the conformations in the &quot;modified true positives&quot; dataset derive directly from models in which two conformations were modeled, so this cannot be the explanation for why qFit-ligand models result in somewhat lower average strain. It would seem that the paper could be served by providing examples where single conformations were modeled in deposited structures, but qFit detects multiple conformations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this comment that the strain obtained from the modified true positives is likely higher than the deposited models. However, the modified structure is refined with a single conformation, and therefore changed from the deposited “A” conformation. Thus, the reduced strain observed in our qFit-ligand models relative to the modified true positives is not unexpected.</p>
<p>To expand our dataset, we also looked at deposited structures with high strain, all of which were modeled as single conformers. Here, we saw a decrease in strain when alternative conformers were placed (see section: Evaluating qFit-ligand on a set of structures known to be highly strained, page 15). Further, we provide an example from the XGen macrocycle dataset where a ligand initially modeled as a single conformer exhibited relatively high strain. After qFit‐ligand modeled a second conformation, the overall strain was reduced (Figure 6C, page 19; Figure 6—figure supplement 1C, page 59).</p>

<p>(5) Section: qFit-ligand applied to an unbiased dataset of experimental true positives Bottom of page 14: The paragraph starting with &quot;qFit-ligand shows particular strength in scenarios with strong evidence...&quot; is enigmatic: there's no illustration (unless it directly relates to the findings in Figure 4, in which case this should be more explicit). Since this points out when the reader will and will not benefit from using qFit-ligand, it should be clear what the authors are talking about.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This claim considers all the evidence presented in the manuscript, not necessarily one particular aspect of it. We advise using qFit-ligand when there is a moderate correlation between the input model and the experimental data, strong visual density in the binding pocket, high map resolution, and/or when your single conformer ligand model is strained. We have made all of these points clearer in the updated manuscript.</p>

<p>B  - Section: qFit-ligand can automatically detect and model multiple conformations of macrocycles:</p>
<p>This is an exciting extension of qFit-ligand, but some aspects of the analysis strike me as worrisome. Of the initial dataset of 150 structures, fewer than half make it all the way through analysis. It's hard to believe that this is a fully representative subset. Why, for example, could 29 structures not be refined against the deposited structure factors? Why does strain calculation (in RDKit?) fail on 30 ligands? What about the other 18 cases--why did these fail (in PHENIX?).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this is a striking number of failures, however, we note that they are not specific shortcomings of qFit-ligand (in fact, most are because standard structural biology and/or cheminformatics software fail on many PDB depositions). Therefore, these failures reflect broader limitations in standard bioinformatics and refinement restraint files when handling macrocycles. The strain calculator we used was not built for macrocycles, and after consulting with many experts in the field, the consensus was that no method works well with macrocycles. We discuss these issues in additional detail in the discussion (page 27):</p>
<p>“Additionally, our algorithm’s placement within the larger refinement and ligand modeling ecosystem highlighted other areas that need improvement. We note that macrocycles, due to their complicated and interconnected degrees of freedom, suffer acutely from the refinement issues, as demonstrated by the failure of approximately one-third of datasets in our standard preparation or post-refinement pipelines due to ligand parameterization issues. Many of these stemmed from problematic ligand restraint files, highlighting the difficulty of encoding the geometric constraints of macrocycles using standard restraint libraries. Improved force-field or restraints for macrocycles are desperately needed to improve their modeling.”</p>

<p>(3) The authors are keen to classify decreases in RSCC as significant only when these changes exceed 0.1, but do not apply the same standard for increases. For instance, in Figure 4B if we were to classify improvements as significant if ΔRSCC &gt; 0.1, there would be fewer significant improvements than decreases in performance (although it is visually clear that for most datasets things get better. Similarly, in Figure 5A if we were to classify improvements as significant if ΔRSCC &gt; 0.1, qFit-ligand would only yield significant improvements for two out of 73 cases-not a lot).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that there needs to be more consistency in our analysis of improvements/deteriorations. However, we note that operationally, when the decreases in model quality are observed, the modeler would simply reject the new model in favor of the input model. We have added to the discussion:</p>
<p>“In active modeling workflows or large scale analyses, the workflow would only accept the output of qFit-ligand when it improves model quality. In cases where qFit-ligand degrades map-to-model fit and/or strain, we can simply revert to the input model. In practice, users can easily remove poorly fitting conformations using molecular modeling software such as COOT, while keeping the well modeled conformations, which is an advantage of the multiconformer approach over ensemble refinement methods.”</p>
<p>There is generally no consensus in the field as to what might indicate a ‘significant’ change in RSCC, and any threshold we choose would be arbitrary. We note that in our manuscript, we had previously characterized a decrease in RSCC to be ‘significant’ if it exceeded 0.1. However, as there is no real scientific justification for this cutoff, or any cutoff, we moved away from this framing in the revised manuscript. Therefore, we just classify if we improve RSCC. For example, on page 9:</p>
<p>“qFit-ligand modeled an alternative conformation in 72.5% (n=98) of structures. Compared with the modified true positive models, 83.7% (n=113) of qFit-ligand models have a better RSCC and 77.0% (n=104) structures saw an improvement in EDIAm, representing an improved fit to experimental data in the vast majority of structures.”</p>
<p>In addition, we have conducted additional experiments using more sensitive metrics (EDIAm) to further illustrate qFit-ligand’s performance.</p>

<p>Canonical peptides can be modeled with standard qFit.

For these reasons we have not included an analysis outside of the macrocycle section. We have noted this caveat in the discussion:</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The data should consistently present the number of structures that exhibit improvements or deterioration in particular metrics, like RSCC and strain, using a cutoff that should be significant. For instance, stating that &quot;85.93% (n=116) of structures having a better RSCC in the qFit-ligand models compared to the modified true positive models&quot; without clarifying the magnitude of improvement (e.g., a marginal increase of 0.01 in RSCC) lacks meaningful context. The figures should clearly indicate the specific cutoff values used for each metric. The accompanying text should provide a detailed explanation for the selection of these cutoff values, justifying their significance in the context of the study.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no established consensus within the field on what constitutes a 'significant' improvement in RSCC or strain values. As such, we chose not to impose an arbitrary cutoff and just look at which structures improve RSCC. We also removed all language stating significance, as there isn’t a good standard in the field to assess significance. This is especially important as only improvements would be considered in an active modeling project. In cases where qFit ligand degrades the RSCC (or strain) to a large extent, the modeler would simply revert to the input model.</p>
<p>In the first section of Results: &quot;First, for all ligands, we perform an unconstrained search function allowing the generated conformers to only be constrained from the bounds matrix (Figure 1A). This is particularly advantageous for small ligands that benefit from less restriction to fully explore their conformational space. We then perform a fixed terminal atoms search function (Figure 1B).&quot; It is unclear whether a fixed terminal atom search was conducted for each conformer generated in the initial step to further explore the conformational space. This aspect should be clarified to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the methodology.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Each independent conformer generation function (A-E) is initialized with only the input ligand model and runs in parallel with the other functions. These functions do not build on each other, but rather perturb the input molecule independently of one another. In our updated manuscript, we have clarified the methodology (page 6).</p>
<p>“First, in all cases, we perform an unconstrained search function (Figure 1A), a fixed terminal atoms search function (Figure 1B), and a blob search function (Figure 1C).”</p>

<p>Phrase: &quot;We randomly sampled 150 structures and, after manual inspection of the fit of alternative conformations, chose 135 crystal structures as a development set for improving qFit-ligand.&quot; The authors should explain why they filtered 10% of the structures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To develop qFit-ligand, we wanted to use a very high-quality dataset. We needed to know with some degree of certainty that if qFit-ligand failed to produce an alternate conformation (or generated conformations low in RSCC or high in strain), the failure was due to an algorithmic limitation rather than poor-quality input data. Therefore, after selection based on numerical metrics, we manually examined each ligand in Coot to observe if we believed the alternative conformers fit well into the density.</p>
