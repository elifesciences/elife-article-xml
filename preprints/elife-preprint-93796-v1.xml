<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Drugs that induce reversible slowing of metabolic and physiological processes would have great value for organ preservation, especially for organs with high susceptibility to hypoxia-reperfusion injury, such as the heart. Using whole-organism screening of metabolism, mobility, and development in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, we identified an existing drug, SNC80, that rapidly and reversibly slows biochemical and metabolic activities while preserving cell and tissue viability. Although SNC80 was developed as a delta opioid receptor activator, we discovered that its ability to slow metabolism is independent of its opioid modulating activity as a novel SNC80 analog (WB3) with almost 1,000 times less delta opioid receptor binding activity is equally active. Metabolic suppression was also achieved using SNC80 in microfluidic human organs-on-chips, as well as in explanted whole porcine hearts and limbs, demonstrating the cross-species relevance of this approach and potential clinical relevance for surgical transplantation. Pharmacological induction of physiological slowing in combination with organ perfusion transport systems may offer a new therapeutic approach for tissue and organ preservation for transplantation, trauma management, and enhancing patient survival in remote and low-resource locations.</p>

<body>
<p>Tissue and organ loss to trauma, disease, and physical injury account for a large proportion of human ailments and approximately $400 billion in annual medical burden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> The rapid and reversible slowing of metabolic and other physiological processes, here referred to as ’biostasis’, can improve the survival of cells and organs for transplantation. This is currently accomplished clinically by lowering temperature and static cold storage is the standard of care for organ and tissue preservation; however, its long-term use can cause damage to the integrity of the graft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Hypothermia also has been used to induce a state of biostasis clinically using <italic>ex-vivo</italic> machine perfusion technologies, for example, during cardiac transplant surgery.</p>
<p>Combination of protective agents with perfusion and/or partial freezing approaches have extended preservation times in rat livers and whole pigs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and neural modulation approaches have been successful at demonstrating central control of body temperature and general metabolic state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> However, both mechanical cooling and neural stimulation approaches are challenging to implement in a trauma triage or resource-limited situations, which would be better addressed by pharmaceutical interventions.</p>
<p>Several molecular strategies have been proposed to achieve metabolic suppression for organ preservation, including modulating H<sub>2</sub>S, AMPK, opioid receptors, microRNAs, HO-1, and Nrf2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> H<sub>2</sub>S exposure has been reported to induce a hypometabolic state (reduced metabolism and body temperature) in a rodent model, although this was later found to be mediated in part by a low baseline laboratory temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> The synthetic opioid peptide DADLE also can induce hypometabolism and improve organ preservation via a delta opioid receptor (DOR) mechanism, but with varied results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Compounds that directly impact glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration also have been considered for modulating organ metabolism, but many are acutely toxic and not reversible, fail to protect tissues from ischemic injury, or lack drug-like properties. Specifically, reduced functionality of the mitochondrial electron transport chain system without the endogenous antioxidant and anti-inflammatory molecules released by hibernators can result in the release of reactive oxygen species and cause tissue damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite these efforts, there remains a large unmet need for improved tissue and organ preservation approaches across multiple application areas. Thus, in the present study, we set out to identify small molecules that could slow metabolism and mimic states normally induced by hypothermia, hibernation, or torpor, which could be used for preservation of living cells, tissues, and organs ex v<italic>ivo</italic>, and potentially <italic>in vivo</italic> as well. Specifically, we required this biostasis approach to be rapidly inducible (&lt; 1 hour) and safely reversible, with major tissue functions returning to control levels within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Through survey of the literature, we identified drugs with unintended side effects, such as lowering body temperature, which suggested they might have broad effects on metabolism. Among these drugs was SNC80, a small molecule drug originally developed as a nonaddictive pain reliever that acts independently of the mu-opioid pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> This drug caught our attention because it has been shown to induce hypothermia and protect against the effects of spinal cord ischemia in rodents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> To explore whether SNC80 had potential to broadly slow tissue metabolism and physiology, we administered the drug to <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryos and tadpoles, which we and others have previously shown to be useful models for drug screening due to their small size, extrauterine development, and skin permeability to small molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> The Xenopus tadpoles were dosed at higher levels than dictated by SNC80’s defined IC50 value, with the goal of exploring the effects of SNC80 outside its known pain relief properties and accentuating the drug’s “off-target” effects, including hypometabolism.</p>
<sec id="s1">
<title>Demonstration of physiological slowing in <italic>Xenopus</italic></title>
<p>We first assessed SNC80’s impacts on mobility, metabolism, and heart activity in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Behavioral assessment in mobile tadpoles showed that 100 μM SNC80 slows movement relative to vehicle-treated counterparts, reducing activity by approximately 50% within 1 hour, which is rapidly reversible when the drug is removed (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref></bold>). SNC80 also suppressed the rate of oxygen consumption to one-third of baseline within 3 hours of treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref></bold>) and had extreme suppressive, but fully reversible, effects on heart rate after only 1 hour of exposure (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref></bold>). Oxygen consumption was reduced in immobile <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos treated with SNC80 as well (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1a</xref></bold>), suggesting that its metabolism-suppressing effects are independent of the slowed movement observed in mobile tadpoles.</p>

<p>Using <italic>in situ</italic> Matrix-Assisted-Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-ToF MSI), we assessed and visualized the biodistribution of SNC80 in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpole. SNC80 was detected within 1 hour of treatment and it appeared in a punctate distribution in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, gill region and skeletal muscle (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2a,b</xref></bold>), suggesting full-body delivery of the drug. Past lipidomic studies of hibernating mammals demonstrated the importance of lipid molecules for thermal adaptation during hibernation with significant alterations of lipidomic profiles being observed in liver, plasma, brain, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle during torpor as compared to the animal’s active state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> Similarly, MALDI-ToF MSI analysis revealed significantly higher levels of acylcarnitine and cholesterol ester in SNC80-treated groups in both skeletal muscle and brain (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Attenuating the delta opioid activity of SNC80</title>
<p>To further test if the physiological slowing effects of SNC80 are independent of DOR activation, we used a medicinal chemistry approach to explore whether we could separate its metabolism slowing and DOR activities. Toward this end, we designed molecular entities void of the distal basic nitrogen (N-ally group within SNC80), which we hypothesized was a critical DOR pharmacophore. This effort led to the development of a novel morpholino compound, WB3 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref></bold> &amp; <bold>Supplemental Synthesis Description</bold>), which was synthesized and subsequently tested for DOR binding activity using a radioligand binding assay and non-linear fitting for specific binding to calculate the Hill Slope and IC50 value. A specific binding curve could not be fit for SNC80 due to its high affinity and therefore its IC50 is &lt;4.6 nM, whereas WB3 exhibited an IC50 of 3,470 nM (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref></bold>), suggesting almost 1,000 times less DOR binding activity for WB3 compared to SNC80. Subsequently, we screened WB3 in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> swimming and heart rate assays and found that the analog retains physiological slowing properties <italic>in vivo</italic> despite lacking delta opioid activity (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c,d</xref></bold>). In fact, we observed more potent and rapid effects on swimming with exposure to WB3 compared to SNC80, suggesting that the non-opioid properties of SNC80 may be primarily responsible for its observed physiological effects.</p>

<title>Enhanced preservation of whole pig hearts and limbs perfused <italic>ex vivo</italic></title>
<p>Based on these intriguing findings with human Organ Chips and <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles, we set out to explore the potential clinical value of SNC80. Cardiac transplant is the gold standard for treating end-stage heart failure; however, it is hindered by donor shortage, limited cardiac graft preservation time, and lack of optimal organ preservation conditions. Currently, hearts are allocated to patients located within 4 hours of organ removal from the donor. Thus, to explore the potential utility of biostasis induction to lengthen the time between organ donation and recipient surgery through pharmacological induction of a hypometabolic state, we perfused surgically explanted whole porcine hearts with SNC80 using a portable, oxygenated perfusion preservation device (VP.S ENCORE<sup>®</sup>) at subnormothermic temperatures (20-23°C). Prior work has demonstrated that the VP.S ENCORE<sup>®</sup> enhances cardiac viability over standard of care-static cold storage and hearts perfused in this device for 4 hours demonstrate similar cardiac function to a healthy heart in both preclinical animal models and human deceased donor hearts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>We investigated the application of a biostasis inducer for preservation of the heart during 6 hours of perfusion in the VP.S ENCORE<sup>®</sup> device. Importantly, with SNC80 treatment, we observed a rapid decline in the heart’s oxygen consumption to &lt; 50% of that observed in hearts exposed to the vehicle control, which was sustained over the 6-hour preservation period (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref></bold>). After preservation, hearts were removed from the VP.S ENCORE<sup>®</sup> and placed in a Langendorff system for reperfusion and evaluation of oxygen consumption and cardiac contractility. This system assesses the left ventricular dP/dT without preload and afterload, thereby allowing the evaluation of the intrinsic contractility of the left ventricle. After 30 minutes of reperfusion and before defibrillation, SNC80-treated hearts had a lower oxygen consumption level than vehicle treated hearts (2.39 ± 1.23 versus 4.28 ± 2.48 ml/min/100g, respectively, at the 30-minute timepoint) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>)</bold> that recovered to normal levels after defibrillation and with increases in temperature (2.49 ± 0.53 and 2.35 ± 0.31 ml/min/100g, respectively, at 60 minutes post-defibrillation) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref></bold>). No evidence of substantial change in left ventricle (LV) contractility or relaxation were detected in SNC80-exposed hearts, either before or after they were defibrillated and exposed to epinephrine (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Gene expression analysis of heart biopsy samples showed significant reduction of markers of inflammation (IL-6, IL-8, TNFα), hypoxia (Hif1α), and cell death (TP53, BCL2) in SNC80-treated hearts when compared to vehicle control hearts (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref></bold>), and no changes in the mitochondrial ATP synthase marker, ATP5MC3, were observed. Histopathological evaluation showed retention of normal muscle morphology (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4f</xref></bold>) without signs of tissue edema immediately after perfusion in the VP.S ENCORE<sup>®</sup>. In some hearts treated with SNC80 greater waviness of muscle fibers was observed, possibly indicating a state of muscle contraction.</p>
<p>Electrocardiogram (ECG) data revealed that both vehicle and SNC80-treated hearts exhibited irregular beating after perfusion and prior to defibrillation. After defibrillation with epinephrine, the P and QRS waveforms were visible in ECGs from 3 of 4 SNC80-treated hearts (<bold><xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref></bold>), suggesting that those hearts regain atrial and ventricular polarization. The pulse rates of SNC80-treated hearts were at or near normal range for porcine hearts (70-120 beats/min) after defibrillation. Vehicle-treated hearts exhibited tachycardia following defibrillation, with all exhibiting pulse rates above the normal range for porcine hearts.</p>
<p>We also tested organ preservation in porcine limbs, where prolonged ischemia after amputation rapidly decreases the viability of skeletal muscle. Current preservation methods limit the success of limb reimplantation due to complications from rhabdomyolysis, necrosis, and reperfusion injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Again, we found that the relative metabolic rate measured during 3 hours of SNC80 exposure was significantly lower compared to vehicle-treated limbs (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2a</xref></bold>). Histopathological evaluation also showed retention of normal muscle morphology with no apparent changes in muscle bundle area (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2b</xref></bold>) or glycogen content (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2c</xref></bold>) suggesting that the tissue’s potential for ATP synthesis was not compromised after SNC80 administration, although an increase in intercellular spacing was observed (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2d</xref></bold>). We did not observe full recovery of O<sub>2</sub> uptake at the 3-hour time point analyzed in this study (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2c</xref></bold>); however, the porcine limb contains a large amount of fat tissue that may be acting as a depot for the highly lipophilic SNC80, thereby leading to extended stasis under these conditions. <bold>Elucidating potential SNC80 targets and pathways</bold></p>
<p>To gain insight into the molecular basis of SNC80’s hypometabolic and other physiological effects, we used thermal proteome profiling (TPP) to assess drug-protein binding and thereby identify previously unknown molecular targets of SNC80 that might be critical for its metabolism slowing activity. TPP of SNC80-treated <italic>Xenopus</italic> tissues revealed 19 direct and indirect binding targets (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>), including proteins involved in transmembrane transport, mitochondrion activity, and metabolic processes. Two potentially interesting binding targets of SNC80 are the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1; also known as SLC1A3) and the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger 1 (NCX1; also known as SLC8A1), both of which have been identified in cardiac tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> In addition to their individual functions, mitochondrial ATP production has been previously reported to be stimulated through intermolecular interactions between EAATs and NCXs in neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> If this complex is also present in cardiac tissue, inhibition of EAAT and NCX1 could reduce cellular ATP levels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and thereby play a role in slowing metabolism.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Specifically, the blockade of Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange via interference with EAAT1-NCX1 interactions could prevent the influx of calcium into the mitochondria that is necessary for calcium-sensitive mitochondrial dehydrogenases that fuel ATP synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> However, the mitochondrial variant of NCX1 (NCLX) was not included in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> protein library used for TPP analysis so could not be fully evaluated in this study. TPP also identified two additional SNC80-binding proteins located within the mitochondrion: TOMM40 and COX6C. TOMM40 is a translocase located in the outer membrane of the mitochondria that has been implicated in tissue protective effects against late-onset Alzheimer disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> and COX6C is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, catalyzing the electron transfer from reduced cytochrome c to oxygen.</p>
<p>In addition to interaction with mitochondrial proteins, we detected binding between SNC80 and enzymes involved in other metabolic processes, including alpha-L-fucosidase 2 (FUCA2), cysteine conjugate beta-lyase (CCBL1), retinoid isomerohydrolase (RPE65), and acyl-CoA Oxidase 3 (ACOX3). SNC80 also binds to multiple membrane-spanning proteins, including vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) and ABCB1, an ATP-dependent translocase, in addition to NCX1 and EAAT1. The drug also bound to two proteins of the immune system, histocompatibility minor 13 (HM13) and pentraxin 3 (PTX3), as well as two cytoskeletal proteins, calmodulin regulated spectrin associated protein family member 2 (CAMSAP2) and integrin subunit alpha 7 (ITGA7). Interestingly, SNC80 also bound to four ribosomal proteins, RPL4, RPL27A, RPS25, and RRP9, which are frequent targets of antibiotic and antiviral drugs. Collectively, these data suggest that induction of physiological slowing by SNC80 may involve simultaneous modulation of multiple pathways, with critical mechanisms involving mitochondria, membrane-spanning transporters, and possibly other metabolic processes as well.</p>

<title>Metabolic suppression in human Organ Chips</title>
<p>To explore whether this drug also induces a state of biostasis in human cells and tissues, as well as non-cardiac cells, we tested SNC80 in human organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture devices that reconstitute tissue-tissue interfaces and human organ-level physiology with high fidelity in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> The Organ Chip models reconstitute a tissue-tissue interface between organ-specific epithelium and endothelium across a porous extracellular matrix-coated membrane within a two-channel microfluidic device, and hence allow tissue-tissue cross talk observed in vivo that is not normally present in studies with cultured cells, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> In this study, we used a Gut Chip lined by Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells interfaced with HUVECs and a Liver Chip containing Huh7 liver epithelial cells interfaced with LSECs, respectively. However, we modified the Organ Chip design by integrating sensors that allow for live monitoring of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) (tissue barrier function) (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3a</xref></bold>). Both Organ Chips were treated with SNC80 by flowing the drug in medium for 2 days through the apical and basal channels of the chip, and then removing the drug followed by 7 days of additional culture. We confirmed that the intestinal epithelial cells underwent villus differentiation and accumulated mucus under these culture conditions (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3b</xref></bold>), in addition to maintaining a low oxygen environment after 10-16 days of culture (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3c</xref></bold>) as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> The Liver Chips also produced albumin and urea at levels (5 and 135 μg/day/chip, respectively) (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3d,e</xref></bold>) that were similar to those measured in Organ Chips lined by primary hepatocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>These studies revealed that SNC80 treatment reduced the respiratory (oxygen utilization) rate in the Gut Chip, resulting in an almost 6-fold increase in extracellular oxygen levels after 48 hours, which then progressively returned to baseline levels during the 7-day washout period (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4a</xref></bold>). Similar results were obtained with the more highly metabolic Liver Chip with SNC80 inducing higher levels of extracellular oxygen compared to control chips and this again reversed after drug washout (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4a</xref></bold>). Importantly, the tissues in both the human Organ Chips remained healthy after 2 days treatment with SNC80 as there was no significant change in barrier function (<bold>Figures S5a,b</bold>), cell growth (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref></bold>), or cytotoxicity (<bold>Figures S5c,d</bold>). Similar to the data observed in cell cultures, ATP/ADP ratio in Liver Chips was significantly decreased after 24 and 48h of SNC80 treatment compared to the vehicle control chips. However, ATP/ADP ratio measurements between SNC80 and vehicle control were not significantly different after washout of the drug, indicating that Liver Chip tissues recover their normal metabolic function up to 4 days after treatment (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4b</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these data suggest that treatment with SNC80 in these physiologically relevant human cells and tissues cultured on-chip in an organ-relevant context resulted in a drop in respiration, with no switch towards glycolysis or reductive carboxylation, since the levels of lactate (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5e,f</xref></bold>) and glutamate remained unchanged in both chips (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5g,h</xref></bold>). Thus, in this organ-like microenvironment, the tissues decrease their total ATP production in presence of SNC80, which is accompanied by a global slowing of metabolism.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we report the discovery that the small molecule drug, SNC80, and its analog WB3, are capable of slowing of multiple physiological processes, and thereby inducing a hypometabolic state without external cooling. Although there is extensive clinical experience using hypothermia to cryopreserve organs during surgery (e.g., cardiac bypass) and for donor transplants, comparatively little work has been done in the area of molecular induction of biostasis without external cooling. We found that SNC80 reversibly suppressed metabolism across multiple cell and tissue types, as well as different species and experimental models, at their basal temperatures, suggesting that this approach could be appropriate for preservation of a variety of cells, tissues, and organs. Critically, integrating this small molecule drug in a commercial organ preservation system with whole explanted pig hearts demonstrated potential for near-term translation and impact of this approach for applications relating to organ preservation and surgical transplantation.</p>
<p>Initially developed as a nonaddictive pain reliever, SNC80 was previously shown to induce hypothermia and protect against the effects of spinal cord ischemia in rodents,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> but its broad effects on metabolism were not known. In the present study, treatment with SNC80 slowed swimming movement and reduced oxygen consumption rates in a reversible manner in <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles, and it lowered the metabolic rate in non-mobile <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos as well. Importantly, SNC80 displayed similar metabolism suppressing activities that were reversible in physiologically relevant human Organ Chip microfluidic devices that reconstitute organ-level structures and functions in vitro. These data suggested that induction of a hypometabolic state by this small molecular drug could potentially provide a new paradigm to prolong organ preservation. Indeed, when we perfused explanted porcine hearts and limbs with SNC80, we experimentally confirmed that this biostasis agent can slow metabolism in a whole complex living organs, providing direct support for its potential integration into commercial organ preservation devices that strive to extend the viability of human organs for surgical transplantation.</p>
<p>SNC80 is defined as a highly selective non-peptide DOR agonist drug and other DOR agonists, such as the enkephalin DADLE, have been shown to reduce metabolic demand and protect against oxidative stress, thereby decreasing injury and apoptosis in perfused organs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Prior studies of DADLE found that the DOR pathway was required to alter metabolism and provide protective effects, however, we found that SNC80 suppresses metabolism via a mechanism that is independent of its DOR modulating activity. Instead, we found that SNC80 interacts with multiple proteins involved in transmembrane transport, mitochondrion activity, and metabolic processes. Interestingly, one of the identified targets, NCX1, has been previously implicated in control of temperature compensation and autonomous oscillation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> suggesting that it plays a key role in the regulation of biochemical reaction speed, cell cycle, and other forms of biological timing, such as circadian rhythm. In addition to its effects on tissues of the nervous system, multiple drugs that target Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange by NCX, such as the KBR family of drugs, were developed for the treatment of ischemia, reperfusion injury, and heart arrhythmias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> In rats, pre-ischemic or post-ischemic treatments with KBR compounds improved recovery of ventricular pump function and reduced reoxygenation-induced injury as measured the reduced release of intracellular components (e.g., lactate dehydrogenase).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> Our results suggest that SNC80 could be acting on the NCX1 transmembrane protein and/or NCX1/EAAT1 pathway may result at least in part from induction of a hypometabolic state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> Of the tissues impacted by SNC80, the observed effects were most profound on <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpole heart function and porcine hearts. SNC80 and other opioids have been shown to decrease cardiac inotropy and contractility,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> and prior work has demonstrated that decreases in cardiac inotropy and contractility by opioid agonists may be mediated by opioid receptor-<italic>independent</italic> actions of these drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> Substantial slowing of heart rate by WB3, which exhibits approximately 1,000 times less delta opioid activity than SNC80, further supports this claim. Similar to our findings by TPP, other investigators identified <italic>non-opioid</italic> receptor-mediated actions of these compounds on ion channel function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> Changes in contractility were not observed immediately after perfusion with SNC80 in porcine hearts tested here, likely because the SNC80 was washed out of the tissue before contractility was measured; however, future work should continue to monitor these parameters, especially at later time points. Although bradycardia likely contributes to the hypometabolism observed in both systems, we also see reduced metabolic rates in systems lacking cardiac cells, and thus the hypometabolic activity of SNC80 we observed is not completely cardiac-specific.</p>
<p>The <italic>Xenopus</italic> and perfused porcine heart systems may be particularly amenable to extreme slowing of cardiac output because these live tissues are surrounded by well-oxygenated medium during treatment, potentially avoiding tissue injury sometimes associated with hypometabolic states. However, the assumption that high oxygen content in the perfusate completely precludes ischemia may not be valid. Assuming adequate flushing during recovery, local vasospasm or a fat micro embolism occurring during perfusion could restrict perfusion flow thereby inducing a localized hypoxic state and HIF1α expression in the tissue. SNC80 may be acting in a vasodilatory capacity, thereby facilitating oxygen delivery and suppressing HIF1α expression. In addition, although HIF1α is primarily known for its role in response to hypoxia, it has some oxygen-independent functions and can be induced by factors other than oxygen levels, such as growth factors and cytokines, which can activate its transcriptional activity even under normoxic conditions. In these cases, HIF1α can regulate genes involved in cell proliferation, metabolism, inflammation, and other cellular processes. Therefore, observation of suppressed HIF1α, as well as the reduction of multiple inflammatory and cell death markers, in the treated porcine cardiac tissue suggests a protective effect of SNC80.</p>
<p>Before considering broader applications of SNC80 or any of its analogs, such as whole-body infusion during trauma or infection, it will be critical to consider impacts of this drug not only on the heart but other organ systems as well. In particular, our <italic>Xenopus</italic> data suggest that there could be substantial uptake of SNC80 in the brain, thus potentially impacting tissues of the central nervous system. Therefore, future work should characterize cognitive recovery in organisms receiving systemic delivery of stasis inducers. In addition, whole-body infusion applications may require further pharmaceutical development, including chemical modifications to SNC80 and development of targeted delivery methods to ensure clinical safety.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings demonstrate that the small molecule drugs SNC80 and WB3 can be used as a biostasis inducer to produce a hypometabolic state, which can provide potential therapeutic value for clinical applications, such as enhanced preservation of organs. The use of a biostatic compound in combination with a self-contained transport system could potentially increase organ viability for sustained times <italic>ex vivo</italic>, thus helping to advance organ and tissue preservation for surgical transplantation. The ability to induce a reversable hypometabolic, suspended animation-type state rapidly through injection at the point-of-care also could enable new therapeutic approaches to slow the detrimental effects of trauma and acute infection, thereby increasing patient survival in military settings and space exploration, as well as in civilian health emergency operations. It also may be possible to use this biostasis approach to slow metabolic activities in the brain in cases of stroke or traumatic brain injury, indications for which current treatments are severely limited.</p>

<title>MALDI-ToF</title>
<p>Tadpoles were embedded in gelatin (0.11 g/mL) and stored in -80C. Embedded tadpoles were sectioned into 16 um-thick slices using a Leica CM1850 (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) onto indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) and immediately placed in a vacuum desiccator before matrix application (N=5 tadpoles per condition; N=3 sections/slide). Experiments were duplicated to confirm the reproducibility. The matrix solution was composed of 2,4 Dihydroxybenzoic acid (40mg/mL) in 0.1% formic acid, methanol/water (1:1 v/v) and was made fresh for each application. The HTX-sprayer nebulizer (HTX Technologies, Carrboro, NC, USA) was used to apply the matrix at 80°C at 24 passes over the sample, at a flow rate of 50μL/min, 10 psi pressure and a track speed at 1,250 mm/min. Before imaging, SNC80 spotting with matrix and <italic>Xenopus</italic> lysate was performed to determine the optimal matrix for the best S/N ratio and the least ion suppression from <italic>Xenopus</italic> tissue and to identify which adducts were detectable for each compound for imaging. <italic>In situ</italic> MALDI-ToF imaging was acquired using the rapifleX (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA), in positive ion mode at 1000 Hz in the mass range of 300-990 m/z. The laser raster step spacing was set to 45 μm step size at 500 shots per pixel. External calibration was performed using a red phosphorus slurry drop casted on a region of the ITO slide without tissue. Preliminary processing of the data was performed using FlexAnalysis (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). Images were normalized by the total ion count and baseline-corrected using Top Hat algorithm with a _baseline width. After MALDI-ToF MSI acquisition, ITO slides were then stained for H&amp;E and imaged using the Cytation 5 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and Epsilon scanner at 3000 dpi to select regions of interest using the open-source program, Qupath.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> Mass selection windows and signal intensity analysis was conducted with SCiLS Lab (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA), where ions of interest, including SNC80, acylcarnitine and cholesterol ester C18, were chosen with a width of ±0.25 Da.

<p>To identify drug-bound targets based on altered thermal stability, <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles were treated with either SNC80 or vehicle for 2 hours. <italic>Xenopus</italic> were euthanized in 20X tricaine and then transferred back to their respective drug solutions to ensure drug effect is not lost during heat treatment. <italic>Xenopus</italic> samples were incubated at 9 temperature points (30C, 35C, 40C, 44C, 48C, 52C, 56C, 60C, 65C) using a PCR machine (3 minutes heat time per condition, 3 tadpoles per condition) for both drug treated and vehicle treated groups. After transfer to room temperature, liquid was aspirated from samples and samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were lysed in 100 µl of PBS + 0.4 % NP-40 with 4 cycles of freeze/thaw. 11µl of each of the 9 temperatures were pooled in one tube and samples were centrifuged at 13,000 RPM for 75 minutes, at 4C. Proteins were reduced and alkylated with 10 mM DTT and 15 mM IAA for 15 minutes at 65C and 30 minutes at room temperature, respectively. Proteins were then precipitated with 8 volumes of ice-cold acetone and 1 volume of ice-cold methanol overnight. Digestion was carried for 4 hours in 50 mM Tris ph 8 + 0.75 mM Urea + 1µg trypsin/LysC at 37 Celcius with agitation. Another 1 µg of trypsin/LysC was added and digestion was continued overnight. Peptides were purified by reversed phase SPE and analyzed by LC-MS/MS (PhenoSwitch Bioscience, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada). LC-MS/MS acquisition was performed with a ABSciex TripleTOF 6600 (ABSciex, Foster City, CA, USA) equipped with an electrospray interface with a 25 μm iD capillary and coupled to an Eksigent μUHPLC (Eksigent, Redwood City, CA, USA). Analyst TF 1.8 software was used to control the instrument and for data processing and acquisition. Samples were acquired twice in SWATH acquisition mode using gas phase fractionation. The source voltage was set to 5.5 kV and maintained at 325C, curtain gas was set at 45 psi, gas one at 25 psi and gas two at 25 psi. Separation was performed on a reversed phase Kinetex XB column 0.3 μm i.d., 2.6 μm particles, 150mm long (Phenomenex) which was maintained at 60C. Samples were injected by loop overfilling into a 5μL loop. For the 60 minutes LC gradient, the mobile phase consisted of the following solvent A (0.2% v/v formic acid and 3% DMSO v/v in water) and solvent B (0.2% v/v formic acid and 3% DMSO in EtOH) at a flow rate of 3 μL/min. GPF files for both acquisitions were analyzed on a previously generated 3D ion library. Each GPF file was analyzed using 10 peptides per protein, 4 MS/MS transition per peptide, 12.5-minute RT window and 25 ppm XIC width in Peakview (Sciex). The reported quantification for a protein is the sum of all the correctly integrated peptides (FDR&lt;0.05) in both GPF files.</p>

<p>Huh7 cells were transfected with a reporter that enables direct measurements of cellular ATP:ADP ratio. The basal excitation spectrum of the reporter protein was similar to that of YFP (peak around 490 nm) but it had an additional peak at CFP wavelength (405 nm). As ATP levels decreased, more ADP can bind to the site, decreasing the YFP/CFP ratio value. BioTek Cytation 5 Cell Imager (Agilent) was used to take RFP, YFP and CFP images of each well every 20min for 180 minutes upon exposure to 100uM SNC80 or 1:100 DMSO vehicle. Post processing of the images was performed using the open source CellProfiler program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> We implemented the following pipeline to obtain quantitative ATP/ADP ratio values: (1) Identify nuclei with RFP marker, (2) Define a cell as 4pixels around the edge of the nuclei, (3) Measure cells YFP and CFP intensity and YFP/CFP ratio, (4) Count cells per Image, (5) Track cells YFP and CFP intensity over the time course (0-3h with 20min intervals), (6) Measure YFP/CFP ratio average <bold>over all cells</bold> per image and normalize to cell count (7).</p>
<p>For the qualitative images, raw images were processed with ImageJ by using the image calculator to divide yfp/cfp intensity of respective images. “Rainbow RGB” lookup table was used to show the intensity changes.

<title>Organ Chips with Integrated Sensors</title>
<p>To allow for live oxygen and transepithelial\endothelial resistance (TEER) monitoring, we used our in-house developed and fabricated microfluidic chips with integrated TEER and oxygen sensors. To mimic the in vivo-like cell-cell interface on the models, a dual-channel PDMS microfluidic chip was used where the apical channel is separated from the basal channel with a porous PDMS membrane. A pair of TEER sensing electrodes where integrated on the apical side of the top channel and the basal side of the bottom channel to measure the electrical resistance across the epithelium-endothelium tissue interface. The O<sub>2</sub> sensing nanoparticles (OXNANO, PyroScience) were integrated at four different locations in the chip: two in the apical channel and two in similar locations in the bottom channel. This is to allow a fair representation of the whole chip oxygen tension levels.</p>
<p>After fabrication, the chips were sterilized by plasma treatment and desiccated for 30 minutes. The polymeric surfaces of the membrane were then chemically functionalized using ER1/ER2 buffers following Emulate<sup>TM</sup> Inc. protocol and coated with extracellular matrix (ECM) for 1.5-2 hours at 37°C. Gut Chip apical and basal channels were coated with 30 μg/ml Collagen I (Advanced BioMatrix, Cat. no. 5005) and 100 μg/ml Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in cold PBS. Liver Chip apical channel was coated with 30 µg/mL fibronectin (Corning, Cat. no. 356008) and 400 µg/mL Collagen I (Advanced BioMatrix, Cat. no. 5005) in cold DPBS, while the basal channel was coated with 100 µg/mL Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and 200 µg/mL type I collagen in cold DPBS. To create Gut Chip, HUVECs (6-8×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> cells/ml (P5)) were first seeded on the bottom side of the permeable membrane in the basal channel and incubated for 2-3 hours at 37°C before seeding the Caco-2 cells (2-3×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> cells/ml (P78)) on the membrane in the apical channel. Liver Chip was similarly created by seeding the LSEC (4-5×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> cells/ml (P3-8)) the first in the basal channel followed by seeding he Huh7 hepatocytes (2.5-3.5×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> cells/ml (P5-15)) on the membrane in the apical channel The chips were then cultured under continuous flow using the commercial culture module instrument (ZOË™ Culture Module, Emulate Inc.,USA). The Gut Chips were maintained under continuous flow of 30μl/hr in the apical and basal channels for 10 days before changing their respective media to differentiation-promoting media (5% FBS in DMED apically and 0.5% FBS endothelial medium basally) for the rest of the culture time. The Liver Chips were also maintained under continuous flow of growth media at 30μl/hr in the apical and basal channels for 5-6 days before reducing the FBS content to 5% in Huh7 media and 0.5% in LSEC media for inducing tissue differentiation.</p>

<title>Porcine heart ex vivo perfusion studies</title>
<p>After induction of anesthesia and preparation for clean, non-survival surgery, a median sternotomy was performed followed by longitudinal incision in the pericardium to expose the heart and the great vessels. Following blunt dissection and exposure of the vena cava, aorta and the brachycephalic artery, the superior vena cava, and azygos vein was ligated and divided. The brachycephalic artery was catheterized for infusion of cardioplegia solution. The inferior vena cava was clamped and divided proximal to the clamp. Two or three pulmonary arteries were incised for decompression of the left side of the heart. The aorta was immediately clamped and 10-15 ml/kg of body weight of cold (2-4°C) cardioplegia solution (del Nido without lidocaine, 3 L) was infused at a pressure of 70-80mmHg to stop the heart. Cold 4°C saline and ice were poured over the heart and the accumulated fluids from the thoracic cavity were removed by suction. Following cessation of myocardial function, the heart was removed from the chest by further dissection and division of the pulmonary vessels and aorta distal to the clamp. The heart was cooled in a surgical bowl with cold saline for inspection and preparation for perfusion. All procedures were conducted under the UT Health San Antonio approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocol 20210080AR.</p>
<p>After the heart was removed and placed in a surgical bowl, the aorta and the coronary sinus were cannulated using sterile zip ties. The heart was placed into the VP.S ENCORE<sup>®</sup> perfusion device filled with 3 L of Krebs-Henseleit buffer supplemented with 20PEG and hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOC; Hemoglobin Oxygen Therapeutics, LLC, Souderton, PA). The heart was perfused with a pressure of approximately &lt;20 mmHg resulting in a coronary perfusate flow of 50-100 mL/min at a 20-23°C temperature. Hearts were immediately treated with 3 mL of 3% lactic acid containing 135 mg of SNC80 (100 μM final concentration), administered through the arterial line followed by the 3 mL of Krebs-Henseleit flush. Post drug administration, the heart continued to be perfused for additional 6 hours.</p>
<p>Two oxygen probes (Pyro FireSting<sup>TM</sup>) collected oxygen partial pressure (mmHg) data of the solution before entering the coronary arteries (arterial) and after exiting the cannulated pulmonary artery (venous), whereas flow was measured using the Sensirion flow meter. Oxygen consumption was captured using the following formula, (([O<sub>2</sub>]a-[O<sub>2</sub>]v )/100 * Q)/heart weight) * 100. [O<sub>2</sub>]a and [O<sub>2</sub>]v are defined as oxygen content of arterial and venous perfusate respectively. [O<sub>2</sub>] was calculated as (1.34 * Hb* SO<sub>2</sub> ) + (K * pO<sub>2</sub>); where 1.34 is mL O<sub>2</sub> / Hb (g), Hb is the concentration of hemoglobin measured in g/dL, SO<sub>2</sub> is the oxygen saturation ratio calculated using the equation developed by Severinghaus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> K is the oxygen solubility coefficient adjusted for the perfusate temperature at every data point, pO<sub>2</sub> is the partial pressure of oxygen in mmHg for the perfusate sample, and Q is coronary flow in mL/min.</p>
<p>After preservation, hearts were placed on a Langendorff system with a perfusate mixture of 1:1 porcine blood and Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO<sub>2</sub> mLO<sub>2</sub> /min / 100g) was calculated during an initial 30 min of rewarming stage (before defibrillation) and after defibrillation using two oxygen probes (Pyro FireSting<sup>TM</sup>, placed in arterial and venous effluent). Oxygen consumption was <sup>53</sup>calculated using the same approach described for the VP.S ENCORE<sup>®</sup> perfusion stage. The left ventricular function was expressed as dP/dT (mmHg/sec) measured by placing a pressure catheter (Millar, 5F) in the left ventricle. Data was analyzed using PowerLab (LabChart 8.1.16) blood pressure analyzer. Data was selected from the left ventricular pressure waveform as the average of 30 beats after stabilization (approx. 30 minutes after defibrillation). Contractility after ionotropic support was measured less than 5 minutes after administration of epinephrine (0.5mg injected arterial). End diastolic pressure of the left ventricle was maintained 5.14 +/- 1.89 mmHg through administering perfusate directly into the left ventricle through the pulmonary veins and venting to atmosphere.</p>
<p>ECG data were obtained through the placement of leads on the apex (positive), right atrial appendage (negative), and aortic root (ground). Data was collected through the PowerLab system and 30-second time intervals were selected for all groups before the flush, before defibrillation, at native contraction, and after epinephrine drug administration. The ECG amplitude (mV) was analyzed using LabChart Pro (v8.1.19) peak analysis detection at approximate time points 10min (before flush) and 30min (before defibrillation) to detect the average amplitude of electrical activity without full contraction. LabChart Pro (v8.1.19) ECG Analysis detection was used at time points 35min (Epinephrine) and 60min (Native) to detect the average amplitude of the QRS complex with contraction. The native QRS Interval (s) and ST Height (mV) was averaged over a 30-second time interval using LabChart Pro (v8.1.19) ECG Analysis.</p>
<p>Total RNA from cardiac tissue biopsies (2.5 mm) were extracted following the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration of total RNA was evaluated and measured at 260/280nm by spectrophotometer (NanoVue Plus, GE Healthcare). Synthesis of cDNA was performed from 0.5 μg of total RNA, which was reverse transcribed using (iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit, Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Gene-specific pre-designed oligonucleotide primers were purchase from Sigma. qRT-PCR was done using SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix and SFX96 Touch real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, T100 Thermal Cycler). The cycling parameters were as follows: initial denaturation 95°C, 2 min; denaturation 95°C, 5 s; annealing/extension 60°C, 30 s; number of cycles 40; melt curve 65°-95°C (0.5°C increments). The comparative CT (2-ΔΔCT) method was used for all quantification. Values were normalized to the Gapdh housekeeping gene.</p>

<title>Porcine limb ex vivo perfusion studies</title>
<p>Hindlimbs (N=8) were procured via protocol tissue sharing at the Joint Base San Antonio Clinical Investigation and Research Support (CIRS) building, following IV Pentobarbital euthanasia, 100 mg/kg from a host protocol. Host protocol animals were treated with the same surgical manipulations and no chemicals or drugs were introduced experimentally prior to euthanasia. Following euthanasia, a curvilinear incision was made around the hindlimb circumferentially. Subsequently, the neurovascular pedicle in the medial hindlimb was identified and carefully dissected out to preserve the vascular bundle. The pedicle was then divided at the origin of the artery and vein to preserve maximal length of the vessels. Hindlimb bone was separated using a Gigli Saw. Hindlimbs were cannulated through the femoral artery and underwent immediate arterial flush with up to 200-400 mL heparinized-saline solution (10,000 units of heparin per 1L of saline), until venous outflow was clear. Additionally, the femoral vein was cannulated for measurement and collection of venous outflow samples.</p>
<p>Limbs were divided into two groups, control (N=3) and experimental SNC80 (N=5). All hindlimbs were connected to the ENCORE<sup>®</sup> head for perfusion via the cannulated femoral artery. The femoral vein was cannulated for obtaining venous samples. Hindlimbs were perfused with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit (KH) at ambient temperature. Arterial and venous pO2 were assessed hourly using a commercial blood gas analyzer (ALB1000 by Radiometer, Brea, California USA). Oxygen consumption was calculated from A-V differences obtained from arterial and venous blood gas readings. After 3 hours of perfusion (baseline), torpor inducing compound SNC80 (44.96 µg/ml) was administered via the femoral artery to the experimental group (SNC80) (N=5) and an equal volume of the sham vehicle to the control limbs (N=3) followed by and additional 3 hours of perfusion (drug). The hind limbs were then removed from the perfusor and flushed with fresh KH perfusate and replaced into the perfusor containing fresh KH solution (flush). The perfusion then resumed for an additional 6 hours. The hindlimbs were weighed pre and post perfusion. Biopsy tissue samples were taken at baseline (pre-ENCORE<sup>®</sup>), and before and after the administration of the SNC80 compound for RNA-Seq analysis and histological evaluation.</p>
<p>Biopsies for histopathology were obtained superficially from the rectus femoris muscle bundle immediately after amputation and then 24 hours after the perfusion period. Biopsies were stored in 10% formalin for 24 hours and then stored for 3 days in 70% ethanol and embedded in paraffin. The samples were sectioned into 5μm slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) to evaluate tissue morphology, intracellular distance, muscle bundle area, and Periodic Acid-Schiff to evaluate glycogen content. Histological analysis was performed by visualizing slides under a light microscope (AM Scope T670Q, Irvine, California) and capturing images using a high-definition camera (AM Scope Model# MU2003B1, Irvine, California). From each slide, 10 digital images from randomly selected fields were obtained at 10x magnification. The images were de-identified and evaluated for intracellular distance, muscle bundle area and glycogen content by two independent reviewers using Image J software (v.1.51.).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study of metabolism using Xenopus, explanted porcine hearts and limbs, and human organs-on-chips, Sperry et al studied the ability of WB3 to slow metabolism and mobility. The group developed WB3, an analog of SNC80, void of SNC80's delta-opioid receptor binding capacity, and studied its metabolic impact. The authors concluded that SNC80 and its analog WB3 can induce &quot;biostasis&quot; and produce a hypometabolic state which holds promise for prolonging organ viability in transplant surgery as well as other potential clinical benefits.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This study also opens new avenues for therapeutic possibilities in areas such as trauma, acute infection, and brain injuries. The overall methodology is acceptable, but certain concerns should be addressed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. In cardiac and renal transplantation, cold preservation in ice remains a common practice for transporting explanted hearts to donors which remains a cheap and easily accessible way of preserving organs. While ex-vivo mechanical circulatory platforms have been developed and are increasingly being utilized to prolong organ viability, cold preservation remains widely used. The authors perfused explanted hearts with oxygenated perfusion preservation devices at subnormothermic temperatures (20-23C) which is even much lower than routinely used in clinical cardiopulmonary bypass scenarios (28-32C) (in the discussion, the authors allude to SNC80's possible &quot;protective effect&quot; in cardiac bypass). It is unclear how much of the hypometabolic state is related to WB3 administration versus hypothermia. The study will benefit from a comparison of WB3 administration and hypothermia in Xenopus, explanted porcine organs versus cold preservation alone to show distinction in biostasis parameters.</p>
<p>2. The authors selected SNC80 based on a literature survey where it was identified based on its ability to induce hypothermia and protect against the effects of spinal cord ischemia in rodents. While this makes sense, were other drugs (eg. Puerarin) considered? The induction of hypothermia and spinal cord protective effect of SNC80 may be multifactorial and not necessarily related to its biostatic effects as the authors describe. Please provide some more context into the background of SNC80.</p>
<p>3. In most of the models, the primary metric that the authors utilize to characterize metabolic activity is oxygen consumption, which is a somewhat limited indicator. For instance, this does not provide any information, however, on anaerobic metabolic activity. In addition, the ATP/ADP ratio was found to decrease in the organ chips where SNC80 was utilized, but similar findings were not presented for the other models.</p>
<p>4. The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of SNC80's mechanisms of interaction with proteins related to transmembrane transport, mitochondrial activity, and metabolic processes. What is the impact of SNC80 on mitochondrial function, particularly ATP production and mitochondrial respiration? Are there changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, electron transport chain activity, or oxidative phosphorylation? In this context, the authors discuss the potential role of NCX1 as a binding target for SNC80 and its various mechanisms in slowing metabolism. However, no experiments have been done to confirm this binding in the present study. Co-immunoprecipitation studies using appropriate antibodies against SNC80 and NCX1 should be considered to demonstrate their direct binding. Additionally, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments could be employed to quantify the binding affinity between SNC80 and NCX1, providing further evidence of their interaction. These experiments would elucidate the binding mechanism between SNC80 and NCX1 and reveal more information on the mechanism of action for SNC80.</p>
<p>5. The manuscript notes that histological analysis was conducted, but it seems that only example images are provided, such as Figure 4f. Quantified histological data would provide a more thorough understanding of tissue integrity.</p>
<p>6. Some of the points mentioned in the discussion and conclusion are rather strong and based on possible associations such as SNC80's potential vasodilatory capacity conferring a cardioprotective effect, and ability to reversibly suppress metabolism across different temperatures and species. Please tone this down and stay limited to the organs studied. Further, the reversibility of the findings may be more objectively assessed by biomarkers with decreased immunofluorescence in response to ischemia such as troponin I for the heart and albumin for the liver. Additionally, an investigation of proteins involved in inflammation, hypoxia, and key cell death pathways using immunohistochemistry analysis can better describe the impact of treatment on apoptosis/necroptosis.</p>
<p>7. What could be the underlying cause of the observed increase in intercellular spacing after SNC80 administration in porcine limbs which also seems to be evident in the heart histology samples? This seems to be more prominent in the SNC80 compared to the vehicle group.</p>
<p>8. In the Discussion section, it would be valuable to provide a concise interpretation of the lipidomic data, particularly explaining how changes in acylcarnitine and cholesterol ester levels may relate to tadpole metabolism, hibernation, or other biological processes.</p>
<p>9. What are the limitations or disadvantages of the study? Does SNC80 possess any immunomodulatory properties that might affect the outcomes of organ transplantation? Are there specific organs for which SNC80 may not be a suitable preservation agent, and if so, what are the reasons behind this?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript titled &quot;Identification of pharmacological inducers of a reversible hypometabolic state for whole organ preservation&quot; reports the effects of delta opioid receptor activator SNC80 and its modified analog WB3 with ~1,000 times less delta opioid receptor binding activity on metabolic state.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This is an interesting study with potentially broad implications for organ preservation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are several limitations that raise concerns.</p>
<p>1. The authors developed an analog of a known delta opioid receptor activator SNC80 with three orders of magnitude lesser binding with the delta opioid receptor WB3. This will likely reduce the undesirable effects of SNC80 while preserving the metabolic slowing needed for organ preservation. Yet, most experiments were done with SNC80, not the superior modification, WB3, shown in only a limited set of experiments, Figure 3.</p>
<p>2. The heart is one of the most challenging organs to preserve, and some experiments are done to establish the metabolic effects of SNC80. However, the biodistribution study, shown in Figure 2, conspicuously omitted the heart.</p>
<p>3. I do not understand the design of the electrophysiology and contractility experiments with the porcine hearts. How did you defibrillate the hearts after removal and establishing perfusion? Lines 173-175 on Page 7 state: &quot;After defibrillation with epinephrine, the P and QRS waveforms were visible in ECGs from 3 of 4 SNC80-treated hearts (Table S1), suggesting that those hearts regain atrial and ventricular polarization.&quot; Please clarify. Defibrillation is done with an electric shock. Also, please show the ECG recordings to support your conclusions about &quot;polarization.&quot; What did you mean by &quot;polarization&quot;? Depolarization? Repolarization? Or resting potential. To establish a normal physiological state, please show ECG waveforms and present data on basic ECG characteristics: heart rate, PQ and QT intervals, and P and QRS durations. I recommend perfusion of the porcine heart with WB3, not only SNC80.</p>
<p>4. Pathology data also raises concerns. The histology images shown in Figure 4f are not quantified, and they show apparently higher levels of tissue disruption in SNC80-treated tissue vs vehicle-treated. The test (lines 169-171) confirms this concern: &quot;In some hearts treated with SNC80, greater waviness of muscle fibers was observed, possibly indicating a state of muscle contraction.&quot; It will be helpful to measure markers of apoptosis and necrosis and to apply TTC viability staining.</p>
<p>5. The apparent state of contracture suggests a higher degree of myocardial damage and a high intracellular calcium level in SNC80-treated hearts. The authors suggested that the sodium-calcium exchanger NCX is a possible target of SNC80 and could be responsible for the &quot;hypometabolic state.&quot; However, NCX1 is critically important in the extrusion of cytosolic Ca2+ during the diastolic phase. Failure to remove excessive calcium and restore ionic homeostasis would lead to calcium overload and heart failure.</p>
<p>6. I am surprised the authors did not consider using the gold standard assay for measuring mitochondrial function in cells by the Seahorse Cell Mito Stress Test.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Sperry and colleagues identify SNC80 as a compound that can slow metabolism and mimic hibernation, thereby prolonging tissue viability in organ transplantation and cardiovascular disease settings. Overall, the use of varied and relevant model systems is a strength of this study.</p>
<p>The authors perform a literature search to identify SNC80 as a promising hit. However, the details of the literature search, a list of other potential hits, and the criteria for identification of SNC80 are not described. The hypometabolic effect of SNC80 exposure is well-characterized in the Xenopus model. Furthermore, the authors show that SNC80 localises to the brain, but do not discuss several studies that have pointed to convulsions induced by exposure to high doses of SCN80, and whether this would be apparent in the Xenopus studies. The authors have promising data on the WB3 morpholino that retains or even improves on the hypometabolism phenotype of SCN80 while likely not retaining delta opioid activity. However, this is not functionally demonstrated. Moreover, WB3 is not used in any of the other assays and models used in the study. In the setting of cardiac transplant surgery, co-administration of SNC80 reduces metabolic activity and inflammation, although it is unclear if there is an improvement in recovery of organ function due to SCN80. The reversible induction of hypometabolic status is also demonstrated in two different organ chips. These models could identify the differential response of epithelial cells and vascular cells to drug perfusion, but the authors have mostly focused on the former. Finally, the authors identify specific targets for the hypometabolic effect of SNC80, which is a valuable resource for other screening studies and can form the basis for future work.</p>
