<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Resting-state brain networks (RSNs) have been widely applied in health and disease, but their interpretation in terms of the underlying neural activity is unclear. To systematically investigate this cornerstone issue, here we simultaneously recorded whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and electrophysiology signals in two separate brain regions in rats. Our data show that for both recording sites, band-specific local field potential (LFP) power-derived spatial maps can explain up to 90% of the spatial variance of RSNs obtained by the rsfMRI signal. Paradoxically, the time series of LFP band power can only explain up to 35% of the temporal variance of the local rsfMRI time course from the same site. In addition, regressing out time series of LFP power from rsfMRI signals has limited impact on the spatial patterns of rsfMRI-based RSNs. This disparity in the spatial and temporal relationships between resting-state electrophysiology and rsfMRI signals suggest that the electrophysiological activity alone does not account for all effects in the rsfMRI signal. To further interpret this disparity, we propose a model hypothesizing that a significant component in the rsfMRI signal is driven by electrophysiology-invisible neural activities that are active in neurovascular coupling. Temporally, this electrophysiology-invisible signal is weakly correlated to electrophysiology data. However, as signaling of these two types of neural activities are both constrained by the same anatomical backbone, they can generate similar RSN spatial patterns. These data and the model provide a new perspective of our interpretation of RSNs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sophisticated brain function requires coordinated activities from separate brain regions, which collectively constitute functional brain networks. Functional brain networks in humans and animals are predominantly studied using the method of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), which quantifies the synchronization of brain-wide spontaneous blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signals, and such networks are termed as resting-state brain networks (RSNs).</p>
<p>Although BOLD-derived RSNs have been widely applied in health and disease, their relationship to the underlying neural activity is not fully understood. This is a fundamental issue, because the BOLD signal is known to not directly, but indirectly reflect neural activity via the accompanied hemodynamic/metabolic changes, a mechanism called neurovascular coupling (NVC). Although tight NVC has been repeatedly demonstrated when neural activities are evoked by explicit external stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Goense and Logothetis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nemoto et al., 2004</xref>), this relationship in the resting state remains elusive. On the one hand, substantial evidence demonstrates that the spatial patterns of most RSNs well replicate known functional systems and activation patterns elicited by various tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Biswal et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hampson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lowe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Smith et al., 2009</xref>), as well as patterns of structural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Greicius et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lowe et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, alterations in RSNs are reported in various brain disorders that correspond to neuropathophysiological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Buckner et al., 2009</xref>), collectively suggesting that RSNs must have strong neural basis. On the other hand, time series of the resting-state electrophysiological signal often has fairly low prediction power of the corresponding rsfMRI time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mateo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scholvinck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Winder et al., 2017</xref>), and some studies even show a disconnect between neural activity and hemodynamic signals in certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Maier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, different studies reported mixed electrophysiology correlates of the rsfMRI signal across local field potential (LFP) bands in a wide frequency range, from infraslow signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hiltunen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pan et al., 2013</xref>), low-frequency delta/sub-delta band signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">He et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lu et al., 2007</xref>) to high-frequency gamma band signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bastos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Foster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Keller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mukamel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nir et al., 2008</xref>) and spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mukamel <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), which indicate that the rsfMRI signal may reflect different aspects of neural activity. Taken together, it is far from being clear how RSNs and rsfMRI are related to spontaneous neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Laufs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mantini et al., 2007</xref>), and lack of such knowledge represents a major knowledge gap in our ability to interpret functional brain networks.</p>
<p>To address this critical issue, we systematically examined the role of electrophysiology activity in determining specific spatiotemporal patterns of BOLD-based RSNs. Along with whole-brain rsfMRI, electrophysiology signals were simultaneously recorded in the primary motor cortex (M1) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in rats under both light sedation and awake conditions. M1 and ACC were selected given their distinct role in sensorimotor function and integrative cognition, respectively. Our data show that in both light-sedation and awake states, the gamma band power-derived RSN spatial patterns highly resemble BOLD-derived RSNs for both recording sites, and lower frequency band-derived RSNs exhibit inversed spatial patterns, both indicating strong neural underpinning of RSNs. Paradoxically, at both recording sites, the time course of band-limited LFP powers display considerably lower temporal correlations with the corresponding time course of local BOLD signals. Further, regressing out the gamma band power or powers of all LFP bands has limited effects on the spatial pattern of BOLD-derived RSNs, collectively suggesting LFP powers only play a partial role in the local rsfMRI signal. This disparity in spatial and temporal relationships between resting-state BOLD and electrophysiology signals indicate that there might be an electrophysiology-invisible component of brain activities that have major contributions to the rsfMRI signal and RSNs.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To systematically analyze the spatiotemporal relationship between resting-state electrophysiology and fMRI signals, we simultaneously recorded the whole-brain rsfMRI and electrophysiology signals in the M1 and ACC in rats in both light-sedation and awake states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The placement of implanted electrodes in the M1 and ACC was verified using T2-weighted structural images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref>). Raw electrophysiology data were initially preprocessed to remove MR artifacts using a template regression approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tu and Zhang, 2022</xref>). The LFP was obtained by bandpass filtering preprocessed electrophysiology data in the frequency range of 0.1 - 300 Hz. An example of denoised LFP is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref>. The band-specific LFP power was generated using a conventional LFP band definition (delta: 1-4 Hz, theta: 4-7 Hz, alpha: 7-13 Hz, beta: 13-30 Hz, gamma: 40-100 Hz). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1B&amp;C</xref> show cross correlations of the LFP power and BOLD signal in the M1 across the LFP spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>, 1-Hz band interval) and for individual LFP bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>), indicating that gamma band power is positively correlated with the BOLD signal, while lower-frequency bands display negative peak correlations with the BOLD signal. The lag of the BOLD signal is approximately 2 sec for all bands, consistent with the hemodynamic response function (HRF) delay previously reported in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scholvinck <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Winder <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>LFP and rsfMRI signals derive consistent RSN spatial patterns in lightly sedated rats</title>
<p>We first examined the spatial relationship between brain-wide rsfMRI signals and frequency band-specific LFP powers in lightly sedated rats. For each recording site, its BOLD-derived RSN is obtained as the seedmap, calculated by voxel-wise correlating the regionally averaged BOLD time series of the seed (M1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref> and ACC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>) with BOLD time series of individual brain voxels. This map is conventionally defined as the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) pattern for the seed region. To determine to what extent this RSN can also be derived using the LFP signal recorded from the same location (M1 or ACC), we convolved power of each LFP band with an rodent-specific HRF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tong et al., 2019</xref>)) to generate the LFP band-predicted BOLD signal, which was then voxel-wise correlated with the brain-wide rsfMRI signal, yielding the LFP band-derived RSN map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We found that the gamma band power-derived RSN map is spatially highly consistent with the corresponding BOLD-derived RSN map (i.e. seedmap). For M1, the voxel-to-voxel Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) between the mean gamma-derived RSN map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>) and mean BOLD-derived RSN map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1F</xref>) is 0.95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1K</xref>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.90), indicating 90% of the variance in the M1 BOLD-derived RSN map can be explained by the gamma-derived map. The spatial maps generated by lower-frequency bands are inversely correlated with the M1 BOLD-derived RSN maps, with a trend of more negative spatial CC in lower-frequency bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1E-J</xref>, delta: CC = -0.78; theta: CC = -0.78; alpha: CC = -0.5; beta: CC = -0.34), consistent with the LFP-BOLD cross correlations for these bands shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B-C</xref>. These relationships are repeatable in the ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2A-G</xref>, delta: CC = -0.62; theta: CC = -0.3; alpha: CC = -0.12; beta: CC = 0.12; gamma: CC = 0.85). These data indicate that the spatial patterns of BOLD-based RSNs can be reliably obtained using the band-specific LFP signal.</p>

<p>To examine whether these findings actually result from the specific frequency cutoffs we adopted for any LFP band, we repeated the analysis for all individual 1-Hz bands in the full LFP spectrum. Our data again show a gradual transition from negative to positive spatial correlations in LFP-derived RSN maps with the corresponding BOLD-derived RSN map as the LFP signal goes from low to high frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1L</xref> for M1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2H</xref> for ACC). Furthermore, as a control analysis, the gamma band power in the ACC was temporally shuffled, convolved with the HRF and the correlation map was recalculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref>). In this case the spatial pattern observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref> disappeared, suggesting the LFP-derived spatial patterns are indeed specifically related to the LFP signal, instead of an artifact of HRF. We also confirmed that all our results are not sensitive to the rsfMRI data preprocessing step of global signal regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figs. S4</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">S5</xref>).</p>
<p>These data collectively indicate the BOLD-derived RSNs can be reliably replicated using LFP power from the same site in lightly sedated rats, suggesting the critical involvement of neural activity in RSN spatial patterns.</p>

<sec id="s2-2">
<title>Temporal correlation between LFP power and local rsfMRI signal is significant but considerably weaker</title>
<p>Given the high reliability of the gamma power in determining spatial patterns of BOLD-based RSNs, it is reasonable to assume the HRF-convolved gamma power ought to reliably predict the rsfMRI time series from the same location. To test this hypothesis, for each recording site temporal correlations of local rsfMRI time series and HRF-convolved LFP powers were calculated for individual scans, and resulting correlation values were then averaged across scans. Surprisingly, the local rsfMRI signal displays considerably weaker temporal correlations with LFP powers. In the M1, the LFP-BOLD temporal correlations gradually change from negative to positive as the LFP signal goes from low to high frequencies—the same trend observed in spatial correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1E-K</xref>), with, however, significant but considerably lower absolute magnitude in CC values (one sample t-tests, delta: CC = -0.20, p = 2.1 × 10<sup>-57</sup>; theta: CC = -0.19, p = 7.1 × 10<sup>-62</sup>; alpha: CC = -0.11, p = 1.2 × 10<sup>-42</sup>; beta: CC = -0.06, p = 8.4 × 10<sup>-15</sup>; gamma: CC = 0.37; p = 2.1 × 10<sup>-58</sup>; number of scans = 159). The same results are observed in the ACC (one sample t-tests; delta: CC = -0.13, p = 1.9 × 10<sup>-28</sup>; theta: CC = -0.04, p = 8.4 × 10<sup>-7</sup>; alpha: CC = -0.03, p = 6.0 × 10<sup>-5</sup>; beta: CC = -0.01, p = 0.1; gamma: CC = 0.18, p = 6.7 × 10<sup>-42</sup>; number of scans = 172). We also confirmed that lower temporal correlations are not due to the HRF used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Fig. S6</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, one difference in our calculation of spatial and temporal correlations may contribute to the disparity in their CC values. In the calculation of spatial correlations, we first scan-wise generated LFP- and BOLD-derived RSN maps, and these maps were then averaged within each group before the spatial correlations were calculated using two averaged maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). On the other hand, temporal correlations were first calculated for individual scans before the resulting correlation values were averaged across scans, as averaging time courses first would diminish the actual signal due to the semi-random nature of spontaneous brain activities. As a result, the variance in averaged RSN spatial maps might be lower than the variance in time series of individual scans, which can result in higher apparent spatial correlations than temporal correlations. To control for this factor, we also calculated spatial correlations between LFP- and BOLD-derived RSN maps for individual scans, and then averaged the corresponding correlation values across scans. Like scan-wise temporal correlations, scan-wise spatial correlations are significant for all LFP bands (one sample t-tests; in the M1, delta: CC = -0.37, p = 4.9 × 10<sup>-52</sup>; theta: CC = -0.39, p = 3.9 × 10<sup>-62</sup>; alpha: CC = -0.24, p = 5.8 × 10<sup>-37</sup>; beta: CC = -0.15, p = 3.9 × 10<sup>-15</sup>; gamma: CC = 0.58, p= 1.0 × 10<sup>-56</sup>; in the ACC, delta: CC = -0.26, p = 2.6 × 10<sup>-27</sup>; theta: CC = -0.09, p = 1.7 × 10<sup>-6</sup>; alpha: CC = -0.04, p = 0.04; beta: CC = 0.03, p = 0.06; gamma: CC = 0.33; p=5.4 × 10<sup>-40</sup>). Comparisons of scan-wise spatial and temporal correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>) indicate that even after controlling for the variance level, the magnitude of spatial correlations are still appreciably higher than that of temporal correlations for all bands (paired t tests across individual scans; in the M1, delta: p = 1.01 × 10<sup>-35</sup>; theta: p = 3.74 × 10<sup>-50</sup>; alpha: p = 3.54 × 10<sup>-25</sup>; beta: p = 1.18 × 10<sup>-12</sup>; gamma: p= 7.02 × 10<sup>-42</sup>; in the ACC, delta: p = 6.73 × 10<sup>-21</sup>; theta: p = 5.75 × 10<sup>-5</sup>; alpha: p = 0.74; beta: p = 7.34× 10<sup>-5</sup>; gamma: p=3.43 × 10<sup>-29</sup>).</p>

<p>Given that the gamma power-derived RSN map can explain ~90% of spatial variance of the BOLD-derived RSN map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1K</xref>, R = 0.95, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.90) when noise is diminished by averaging RSN maps across scans, we ask how much variance of the local BOLD time series the gamma power can explain without significant influence of noise. Although we cannot directly average rsfMRI/electrophysiology time courses across scans to reduce the noise level like we did when calculating spatial correlations, we can still estimate the true LFP-BOLD temporal correlation by quantitatively assessing the effect of noise on correlation values. To this end, we leveraged the difference between the spatial correlation of averaged M1 RSN maps (i.e. termed as denoised data, R = 0.95, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1K</xref>) and that of unaveraged RSN maps (i.e. termed as with-noise data, R = 0.58 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>, gamma band power). Using this difference, we simulated two fixed signals with the true correlation of 0.95, and by adding different noise to the signals we determined at what noise level the apparent correlation of the two signals became 0.58 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Specifically, in each trial random noise at a defined contrast-noise-level (CNR) level was added to the simulated signals, and this process was repeated 159 times (i.e. equal to # of scans in our study) for a given CNR level. At each CNR, the correlation was calculated either based on the averaged signals from all 159 trials (i.e. simulating denoised data, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>), or on signals of individual trials (i.e. simulating with-noise data) before the resulting correlations were averaged across trials.</p>
<p>As expected, lower CNR gives lower apparent trial-wise correlation values. Interestingly, we found that the trial-wise apparent correlation of 0.58 with the true correlation of 0.95 corresponds to the CNR at 1.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D-E</xref>), consistent with the CNR of BOLD contrast reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Atkinson et al., 2008</xref>). At this CNR level, we estimated that the true BOLD-LFP temporal correlation in the M1 should be ~0.59 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.35, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3F-G</xref>) when the apparent correlation is 0.37 as measured by the gamma-BOLD temporal correlation in our real data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>). These data indicate the gamma power time information can only explain a minor portion (up to ~35%) of the temporal variance in the BOLD time series even after removing the noise effect. These results are consistent with previous reports of relatively weak temporal correlations between gamma power and hemodynamic signals at rest obtained using different imaging modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scholvinck <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Winder <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Our simulation also indicates the difference in the number of data points (1200 in temporal correlation calculation vs 6157 in spatial correlation calculation) has a negligible influence on correlation values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E-G</xref>).</p>

<title>Regressing out LFP powers has limited impact on RSN spatial patterns</title>
<p>Given the lower predictive value of the LFP power on the local rsfMRI signal, we ask to what extent the temporal information of LFP powers affect the RSN spatial patterns. The M1 (or ACC) gamma-band power, after convolving with HRF, was linearly regressed out from th rsfMRI signals of all brain voxels. As expected, the spatial patterns of gamma power-derived RSN maps observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1E</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref> disappeared after the regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>).

The data show limited mutual information between any band-specific power and voxel-wise rsfMRI signals, indicating that the nonlinear component between BOLD and electrophysiological signals does not play a major role in RSN spatial patterns.

<title>Disparity in temporal and spatial correlations is consistent in different physiologic states</title>
<p>To determine whether the disparity between temporal and spatial correlations of resting-state LFP and fMRI signals we observed is a specific phenomenon under anesthesia or can be generalized to different physiologic states, we concurrently collected electrophysiology and rsfMRI data in awake rats. Despite the drastic change in the physiologic state, we again observed higher spatial correlations between LFP-derived maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Fig. S8A</xref>) and the BOLD-derived RSN map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Fig. S8B</xref>) in the M1, which gradually changed from negative correlations in low-frequency bands to positive correlations in high-frequency bands, revealed both in conventionally defined bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figs. S8C-G</xref>) and 1-Hz bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Fig. S8H</xref>). This trend is generally maintained in the ACC, although the spatial correlations in low-frequency bands are diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Fig. S9</xref>). Similar to the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>, weaker but significant temporal correlations between the rsfMRI signal and HRF-convolved gamma band power were observed in unanesthetized rats (one sample t-tests; for M1, delta: CC = -0.05, p = 2.3 × 10<sup>-4</sup>; theta: CC = -0.06, p = 4.7 × 10<sup>-6</sup>; alpha: CC = -0.06, p = 4.6 × 10<sup>-5</sup>; beta: CC = -0.032, p = 3.0 × 10<sup>-3</sup>; gamma: CC = 0.04, p= 0.02; for ACC, delta: CC = 0.02, p = 0.29; theta: CC = 0.0009, p = 0.96; alpha: CC = -0.02, p = 0.31; beta: CC = 0.006, p = 0.66; gamma: CC = 0.10, p= 9.52 × 10<sup>-7</sup>; number of scans = 50). Scan-wise comparison between temporal and spatial correlations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS10">Fig. S10</xref>. Overall, we found that the magnitudes of both spatial and temporal correlations are generally lower in the awake state compared to the light sedation state, likely due to larger variances from motion and/or other physiological fluctuations, as well as a much lower number of scans (50 awake scans, 159 light-sedation scans for M1 and 172 light-sedation scans for ACC), but the pattern of lower temporal but higher spatial correlations between gamma power and the rsfMRI signal remains consistent.</p>
<p>Regressing out gamma-band power or powers of all LFP bands again did not significantly alter the BOLD-derived RSN maps for both ACC and M1 in awake rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS11">Fig. S11</xref>).

<title>Ongoing rsfMRI signal could be contributed by electrophysiology-invisible brain activities</title>
<p>Our data reveal that the LFP signal can derive RSN patterns that can explain nearly all spatial variance in BOLD-based seedmaps. On the other hand, the temporal information of the LFP signal only explains a minor portion of the local BOLD time series and minimally impacts BOLD-based RSN spatial patterns. To reconcile this apparent contradiction, here we propose a theoretical model that can possibly explain this apparent paradox, described as follows:</p>
<p>Brain activities include components that can be measured by electrophysiology and components that are electrophysiology invisible. Electrophysiology-invisible brain activities, such as activities of nNOS neurons and astrocytes, are actively involved in NVC, and can play a major role in the rsfMRI signal. At the resting state, these two components are not necessarily synchronized, leading to low temporal correlations between electrophysiology and rsfMRI signals. Another factor that can contribute to low LFP-BOLD temporal correlations is neuromodulations from distal modulator nuclei (e.g. locus coerulues and/or basal forebrain), which have strong vasoactive effects but may not commensurately affect the electrophysiology activity. Meanwhile, signaling of electrophysiology activities as well as that of electrophysiology-invisible, and thus major BOLD activities are both constrained by the same anatomical pathways, allowing the two signals to separately generate similar RSN spatial patterns which can reflect both direct and indirect anatomical connectivity. The model is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">S13</xref>. More details of the model will be discussed in the next section.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although BOLD-derived RSNs have been widely investigated in multiple species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Damoiseaux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mantini et al., 2011</xref>) and applied in health and disease, the interpretation of interareal spontaneous BOLD synchronization is not fully comprehended. To gain more insight into this issue, here we systematically analyzed electrophysiology and rsfMRI signals simultaneously recorded in lightly anesthetized and unanesthetized animals. We found that both electrophysiology and rsfMRI signals can derive highly consistent brainwide RSN patterns, but the temporal information of the LFP signal only minorly contributes to the BOLD time series. These paradoxical results, as well as those from literature studies can possibly be reconciled by the theoretical model we propose. These data and the model provide a new perspective for our interpretation of the neural basis underlying the resting-state BOLD signal.</p>
<p>The spatial correspondence between BOLD- and electrophysiology-derived RSNs has been repeatedly reported using multiple methodologies across different physiological states in both humans and animals. Studies utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) or electrocorticography (ECoG) in humans demonstrate that RSNs derived from the power of multiple-site electrophysiological signals show similar spatial patterns to classic BOLD-derived RSNs such as the default-mode network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hacker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kucyi et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, simultaneous recordings of resting-state calcium and fMRI signals in awake rats show highly consistent spatial patterns between calcium- and BOLD-associated RSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ma et al., 2022</xref>). Millisecond-timescale voltage-sensitive dye imaging reveals similar sensory-evoked and hemisphere-wide activity motifs represented in spontaneous activity in lightly anesthetized and awake adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mohajerani et al., 2013</xref>). All these data also well agree with the notion that the spatial patterns of RSNs are highly consistent with known functional systems and activation patterns observed in task-based studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Biswal <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Glasser <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hampson <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lowe <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), as well as patterns of structural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrews-Hanna <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Greicius <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lowe <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Taken together, previous studies and our data indicate consistent spatial patterns of RSNs can be derived from both electrophysiology and rsfMRI measurements, strongly suggesting that RSNs originate from neural activities.</p>
<p>Previous studies also demonstrate that RSNs are very likely constrained by axonal projections. Consistent sensory-evoked and hemisphere-wide activity motifs in mice revealed using voltage-sensitive dye imaging mentioned above are indeed defined by regional axonal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mohajerani <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Our previous work in awake rats also demonstrate spatial consistency between RSNs and anatomical connectivity patterns in thalamocortical networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liang et al., 2013</xref>). In the present study, we compared the RSNs (i.e. seedmaps) of M1 and ACC to their anatomical networks defined by the axonal projection patterns obtained from the database of Allen Brain Institute (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS12">Fig. S12</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Oh et al., 2014</xref>)). Our data show that RSNs revealed by either the BOLD or LFP signal well resemble the corresponding anatomical networks. Taken together, these data indicate that RSNs are most likely constrained by the backbone of structural connectivity. It needs to be pointed out that RSNs measured by functional connectivity can reflect both direct and indirect connectivity. Therefore, RSNs do not necessarily have identical spatial patterns as the corresponding anatomical networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Honey et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to the seemingly strong LFP-BOLD relationship inferred from their high spatial correlations, we observed appreciably lower (but significant) temporal correlations between the two signals from the same recording sites (M1 and ACC). This result is corroborated by the finding that regressing out LFP power in any band has limited impact on RSN spatial patterns, indicating that the contribution of temporal variations of the LFP signal to RSN spatial patterns is minor. Despite the apparent discrepancy, these findings are in fact supported by several literature studies. In a well-controlled experiment, Winder et al. demonstrated weak but significant correlations between cerebral blood volume (CBV) changes measured by intrinsic optical imaging and spontaneous gamma-band LFP or multiunit activity in the barrel cortex in awake, head-fixed mice during rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Winder <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Importantly, they also observed persistent spontaneous fluctuations in CBV after blocking local neural spiking and glutamatergic input, as well as noradrenergic receptors, indicating that hemodynamic signal fluctuations may not necessarily reflect local ongoing electrophysiology activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Winder <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). These data are in line with comparably low temporal correlations between gamma-band power and the rsfMRI signal in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scholvinck <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Shmuel and Leopold, 2008</xref>). Data published in our group also show similarly low temporal correlations between spontaneous calcium peaks, a measure of neural spiking activity, and the rsfMRI signal in awake rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ma <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). All these data collectively suggest that although the temporal correlation between electrophysiology and rsfMRI signals is significant, the effect size of this correlation might be small. Notably, our results are different from two earlier studies in isoflurane-anesthetized rats, which found that the LFP power in the primary somatosensory cortex was highly correlated with the BOLD fluctuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). This discrepancy might be attributed to the effect of brain-wide synchronization during burst suppression in deeply anesthetized states in those studies.</p>
<p>Why would electrophysiology and rsfMRI signals exhibit unmatched spatial and temporal correlations? Our model hypothesizes that the majority of the rsfMRI signal is driven by electrophysiology-invisible brain activities that are actively involved in NVC. Indeed, LFP is a composite signal that records various neural activities, such as synaptic potentials and voltage-gated membrane fluctuations, reflecting the input and local neural processing of a particular brain region. However, electrophysiology cannot measure activities from certain cell populations, while electrophysiology-invisible components can trigger vasoactive responses and significantly contribute to the rsfMRI signal. For instance, the electrical activity of nNOS neurons is not detectable by electrophysiology measurement because the nNOS neuron population is very small, but it strongly contributes to NVC. Chemogenetic or pharmacological stimulation of nNOS neurons causes vasodilation without detectable changes in LFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Echagarruga et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, astrocytes, a type of glia cell, are known to coordinate communication between neurons and blood vessels and play a crucial role in NVC. Astrocytes contribute to the regulation of vessel tone by releasing signaling molecules such as ATP, arachidonic acid metabolites and nitric oxide (Ladecola and Nedergaard, 2007; Mulligan and MacVicar, 2004; Murphy et al., 1993). Additionally, astrocytes can alter the diameter of blood vessels by extending or retracting the endfeet wrapping around them (Mills et al., 2022; Niu et al., 2019). Optogenetically stimulating astrocytes in transgenic mice without affecting neurons led to a BOLD response, suggesting that astrocyte activity alone can cause changes in the BOLD signal, independent of neuronal activity (Takata et al., 2018). These studies collectively suggest some electrophysiology-invisible activities can significantly drive the rsfMRI signal. Exclusively identifying all electrophysiology-invisible sources that contribute to the rsfMRI signal is beyond the scope of this work. However, a key point is that as the resting state LFP and electrophysiology-invisible (and thus rsfMRI) signals reflect different components of brain activities, they can be minimally synchronized and display low temporal correlations. Another possible factor that can contribute to low BOLD-LFP temporal correlations is direct modulation of the vasculature from distant modulator nuclei (e.g. locus coerulues and/or basal forebrain). Some neuromodulators, such as norepinephrine (NE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bekar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kim et al., 2016</xref>) and acetylcoline (Ach) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sato and Sato, 1995</xref>), have vasoconstrictor/vasodilatory effects that are spatially targeted in distributed brain regions, and thus can modulate the brain-wide rsfMRI signal. However, these neural modulation effects may not be commensurately reflected from the electrophysiology signal, leading to low BOLD-LFP temporal correlations (see a schematic diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS13">Fig. S13</xref>). On the other hand, as the signaling of LFP- and electrophysiology-invisible components in functional networks are constrained by the same anatomical connectivity structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liu et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al., 2018b</xref>), the LFP- and BOLD-derived RSN spatial patterns can be highly similar and thus have high spatial correlations.</p>
<p>Our model can potentially also explain high spatial and temporal correlations when brain activation is evoked by external stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Winder <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). At the evoked state, both LFP (and spiking activity) and electrophysiology-invisible components are temporally modulated by the same external stimulation paradigm, leading to both high temporal and high spatial correlations between fMRI and electrophysiology signals.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Our study revealed that BOLD-based RSNs can be reliably derived by the electrophysiology signal, but they might be dominantly contributed by the electrophysiology-invisible signal. This study provides a new interpretation of RSNs. However, this new concept of RSN signaling does not in any way argue against the importance of BOLD-based RSNs and the rsfMRI method. In fact, it makes fMRI even more important than previously thought because it might provide a new signal that traditional electrophysiology measures cannot provide.</p>

Baytril (2.5mg/kg) and long-acting buprenorphine (1.0mg/kg) were administered subcutaneously as antibiotics and analgesics, respectively. The animal was then endotracheal incubated and ventilated with oxygen using the PhysioSuite system (Kent Scientific Corporation). Body temperature was monitored and maintained at 37 °C with a warming pad placed underneath the animal (PhysioSuite, Kent Scientific Corporaition). Heart rate and SpO<sub>2</sub> were continuously monitored using a pulse oximetry (MouseSTAT® Jr, Kent Scientific Corporation) throughout the surgery. After performing craniotomies over the right ACC (coordinates: anterior/posterior +1.5, medial/lateral +0.5, dorsal/ventral -2.8) and the left M1 (coordinates: anterior/posterior +3.2, medial/lateral +3, dorsal/ventral -2.8), two MR-compatible electrodes (MRCM16LP, NeuroNexus Inc) were carefully implanted into the ACC and M1, respectively. The reference and grounding wires from each electrode were wired together and connected to one of the two silver wires placed in the cerebellum. At last, the skull was sealed with dental cement.

The duration of the acclimation procedure was gradually increased from 15 min on the first day to 60 min on days 4-7 days (i.e., 15 min on day 1, 30 min on day 2, 45 min on day 3, and 60 min on days 4-7). More details of the acclimation procedure can be found in previous publications from our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liang et al., 2012</xref>) and other research groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bergmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chang et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Simultaneous rsfMRI and electrophysiology recordings</title>
<p>All rsfMRI experiments were conducted on a 7T Bruker 70/30 BioSpec system running ParaVision 6.0.1(Bruker, Billerica, MA) using a homemade single loop surface coil at the <italic>high field MRI facility</italic> at the Pennsylvania State University. During each fMRI session, T2*-weighted rsfMRI images covering the entire brain were obtained using an echo planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 1 s; echo time (TE) = 15 ms; field of view = 3.2 × 3.2 cm<sup>2</sup>; matrix size = 64 × 64; slice number = 20; slice thickness = 1mm; volume number = 1200. Five to ten scans were repeated within each session. T2-weighted anatomical images were also acquired using a rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence with the following parameters: TR = 3000 ms; TE= 40 ms; field of view = 3.2 × 3.2 cm<sup>2</sup>; matrix size = 256 × 256; slice number = 20; slice thickness = 1 mm; repetition number = 6.</p>
<p>Six rats with two electrodes implanted in the ACC and M1 were imaged in both awake and lightly sedated states in separate fMRI sessions. Two additional rats with an electrode only implanted in the ACC were imaged in the light sedation state. For both states, animals were restrained throughout the imaging session. In the light sedation state, the animal was sedated with the combination of low-dose dexmedetomidine (initial bolus of 0.05 mg/kg followed by a constant infusion at the rate of 0.1 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>·h<sup>−1</sup>) and low-dose isoflurane (0.3%). Artificial tears were applied to protect the animal’s eyes from drying out. Body temperature was maintained at 37°C using warm air and was monitored using a rectal thermometer.</p>
<p>Before imaging, the implanted electrodes were connected to MR-compatible LP16CH headstages and a PZ5 neurodigitizer amplifier (Tucker Davis Technologies (TDT) Inc, Alachua, FL). Electrophysiology recording began 10 min before rsfMRI data acquisition and continued until the end of the imaging session using a TDT recording system and an RZ2 BioAmp Processor (TDT Inc, Alachua, FL). The raw, unfiltered electrophysiology signal was sampled at 24414 Hz and stored using the TDT Synapse software on a WS8 workstation.</p>

<sec id="s5-5">
<title>rsfMRI and electrophysiology data preprocessing</title>
<p>All data preprocessing and analysis were performed using MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). First, the movement of each rsfMRI volume was estimated using the framewise displacement (FD). For the awake imaging data, volumes with FD &gt; 0.1 mm and their adjacent preceding and following volumes were removed. If &gt; 25% of volumes in a scan were scrubbed, the entire scan was excluded from further analysis. For rsfMRI data collected in the lightly sedated state, scans with any volume that had FD &gt; 0.1 mm were removed from further analysis. Subsequently, data were preprocessed using the following steps: co-registration to a defined atlas, motion correction (SPM12), spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel (FWHM = 0.75 mm), voxelwise nuisance regression with the regressors of motion parameters as well as signals from the white matter and ventricles, and the global brain signal, and, lastly, bandpass filtering (0.01-0.1 Hz).</p>
<p>Raw electrophysiology data were preprocessed to remove the MR interference using a template regression method as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tu and Zhang, 2022</xref>). Briefly, the raw electrophysiology signal for each scan was first aligned to the corresponding rsfMRI scan, and segmented for each imaging slice based on the starting time of the scan. Next, an MRI interference template for each rsfMRI slice acquisition was obtained by averaging the electrophysiology data across all slices from all rsfMRI volumes. The template was further aligned to the electrophysiology data for each slice acquisition using cross correlation and was then linearly regressed out from the raw electrophysiology data. In addition, a series of notch filters for harmonics of the power supply (60 Hz and multiples of 60 Hz) and slice acquisition (20 Hz and multiples of 20 Hz) were applied to further denoise the data.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The LFP power was obtained by bandpass filtering preprocessed electrophysiology data in the frequency range of 0.1 - 300 Hz. Based on the conventional LFP band definition (delta: 1-4 Hz, theta: 4-7 Hz, alpha: 7-13 Hz, beta: 13-30 Hz, gamma: 40-100 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), the LFP band power was computed using the MATLAB function <italic>spectrogram</italic> with a window size of 1 s and a step size of 0.1 s. To investigate the relationship between the LFP and rsfMRI signals, the time course of band-specific LFP power was convolved with a hemodynamic response function (HRF, p = [4 4 1 1 6 0 32] for function <italic>spm_hrf)</italic> to generate the corresponding LFP-predicted BOLD signal. The HRF used was specific to rodents with a shorter onset time and time-to-peak as a faster HRF was reported in rats relative to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tong <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). The temporal relationship between the LFP and fMRI signal was quantified using the Pearson correlation between the HRF-convolved LFP band power and the regionally averaged rsfMRI time course from voxels surrounding the implanted electrode for each site. To examine the potential impact of HRF used, we calculated the BOLD-gamma power correlation using different HRFs with various response delays, ranging from 2 sec to 8 sec with the increment of 0.25 sec, as well as different undershoot delays ranging from 2 sec to 12 sec with the increment of 0.5 sec.</p>
<p>The LFP-derived spatial correlation maps for the M1 and ACC were respectively generated by computing voxel-wise Pearson correlations between each HRF-convolved LFP band power and brain-wide rsfMRI signals. The seedmaps for the M1 and ACC were respectively obtained by calculating the voxel-wise Pearson correlations between the regionally averaged rsfMRI time course for each seed and the rsfMRI signals of all brain voxels.</p>
<p>To determine the contribution of LFP power to BOLD-based RSFC, we removed the LFP powers from voxel-wise fMRI signals and then recalculated RSNs. Given that the gamma signal might be the most related to the rsfMRI signal, the time course of gamma-band power (convolved with HRF) was linearly regressed out from rsfMRI signals of all brain voxels. To examine the potential contributions of other LFP bands, all five LFP band powers (each convolved with HRF) were “softly” removed from voxel-wise rsfMRI signals, meaning only the unique components in five bands were regressed out but the shared components were maintained. Specific details of soft regression can be found in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Griffanti et al., 2014</xref>). This method can avoid ‘over regression’ when multiple regressors are involved particularly when regressors are correlated between themselves. Lastly, we removed rsfMRI volumes corresponding to peaks in the M1/ACC gamma power. The seedmaps of M1 and ACC were recalculated and compared before and after removing the LFP signal.</p>

<title>Simulation</title>
<p>We simulated two fixed signals with the true Pearson correlation of 0.95. The first signal was generated using MATLAB function <italic>rand</italic> with 10000 data points. The second signal with a defined correlation with the first signal (i.e. 0.95) was obtained based on the equation below:
<disp-formula id="ed1"><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="e1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>A</mml:mtext><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mtext>Corr</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><graphic xlink:href="3251741v2_eqn1.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
in which A represents the first signal, Corr is the desired Pearson correlation coefficient, and N(0, 1) represents random values with the mean equal to 0 and standard deviation equal to 1. For each signal, random noise was added to achieve a contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) ranging from 0.1 to 5 with the step size of 0.1. CNR was quantified by the standard deviation of the signal over the standard deviation of the noise. This process was repeated 159 times (equal to the # of scans in the present study). The noise-added signals were resampled to either 1200 or 6157 data points, which corresponded to the total number of time points used to calculate temporal correlations and total number of brain voxels used to calculate spatial correlations, respectively, in our study. Pearson correlations between the resampled signals either based on the averaged signals from all 159 trials or on individual trials were calculated.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study combines fMRI and electrophysiology in sedated and awake rats to show that LFPs strongly explain spatial correlations in resting-state fMRI but only weakly explain temporal variability. They propose that other, electrophysiology-invisible mechanisms contribute to the fMRI signal. The evidence supporting the separation of spatial and temporal correlations is <bold>convincing</bold>, however, the support of electrophysiological-invisible mechanisms is <bold>incomplete</bold>, considering alternative potential factors that could account for the differences in spatial and temporal correlation that were observed. This work will be of interest to researchers who study the mechanisms behind resting-state fMRI.</p>

<p>Tu et al investigated how LFPs recorded simultaneously with rsfMRI explain the spatiotemporal patterns of functional connectivity in sedated and awake rats. They find that connectivity maps generated from gamma band LFPs (from either area) explain very well the spatial correlations observed in rsfMRI signals, but that the temporal variance in rsfMRI data is more poorly explained by the same LFP signals. The authors excluded the effects of sedation in this effect by investigating rats in the awake state (a remarkable feat in the MRI scanner), where the findings generally replicate. The authors also performed a series of tests to assess multiple factors (including noise, outliers, and nonlinearity of the data) in their analysis.</p>
<p>This apparent paradox is then explained by a hypothetical model in which LFPs and neurovascular coupling are generated in some sense &quot;in parallel&quot; by different neuron types, some of which drive LFPs and are measured by ePhys, while others (nNOS, etc.) have an important role in neurovascular coupling but are less visible in Ephys data. Hence the discrepancy is explained by the spatial similarity of neural activity but the more &quot;selective&quot; LFPs picked up by Ephys account for the different temporal aspects observed.</p>
<p>This is a deep, outstanding study that harnesses multidisciplinary approaches (fMRI and ephys) for observing brain activity. The results are strongly supported by the comprehensive analyses done by the authors, which ruled out many potential sources for the observed findings. The study's impact is expected to be very large.</p>
<p>There are very few weaknesses in the work, but I'd point out that the 1-second temporal resolution may have masked significant temporal correlations between LFPs and spontaneous activity, for instance, as shown by Cabral et al Nature Communications 2023, and even in earlier QPP work from the Keilholz Lab. The synchronization of the LFPs may correlate more with one of these modes than the total signal. Perhaps a kind of &quot;dynamic connectivity&quot; analysis on the authors' data could test whether LFPs correlate better with the activity at specific intervals. However, this could purely be discussed and left for future work, in my opinion.</p>

<p>The authors address a question that is interesting and important to the sub-field of rsfMRI that examines electrophysiological correlates of rsfMRI. That is, while electrophysiology-produced correlation maps often appear similar to correlation maps produced from BOLD alone (as has been shown in many papers) is this actually coming from the same source of variance, or independent but spatially-correlated sources of variance? To address this, the authors recorded LFP signals in 2 areas (M1 and ACC) and compared the maps produced by correlating BOLD with them to maps produced by BOLD-BOLD correlations. They then attempt to remove various sources of variance and see the results.</p>
<p>The basic concept of the research is sound, though primarily of interest to the subset of rsfMRI researchers who use simultaneous electrophysiology. However, there are major problems in the writing, and also a major methodological problem.</p>
<p>Major problems with writing:</p>
<p>(1) There is substantial literature on rats on site-specific LFP recording compared to rsfMRI, and much of it already examined removing part of the LFP and examining rsfMRI, or vice versa. The authors do not cover it and consider their work on signal removal more novel than it is.</p>
<p>(2) The conclusion of the existence of an &quot;electrophysiology-invisible signal&quot; is far too broad considering the limited scope of this study. There are many factors that can be extracted from LFP that are not used in this study (envelope, phase, infraslow frequencies under 0.1Hz, estimated MUA, etc.) and there are many ways of comparing it to the rsfMRI data that are not done in this study (rank correlation, transformation prior to comparison, clustering prior to comparison, etc.). The one non-linear method used, mutual information, is low sensitivity and does not cover every possible nonlinear interaction. Mutual information is also dependent upon the number of bins selected in the data. Previous studies (see 1) have seen similar results where fMRI and LFP were not fully commensurate but did not need to draw such broad conclusions.</p>
<p>(3) The writing refers to the spatial extent of correlation with the LFP signal as &quot;spatial variance.&quot; However, LFP was recorded from a very limited point and the variance in the correlation map does not necessarily reflect underlying electrophysiological spatial distributions (e.g. Yu et al. Nat Commun. 2023 Mar 24;14(1):1651.)</p>
<p>Major method problem:</p>
<p>(4) Correlating LFP to fMRI is correlating two biological signals, with unknown but presumably not uniform distributions. However, correlating CC results from correlation maps is comparing uniform distributions. This is not a fair comparison, especially considering that the noise added is also uniform as it was created with the rand() function in MATLAB.</p>
