<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Organoid transplantation has a promising future in the treatment of liver disease, but a major limitation is the lack of guidance on the most appropriate method for transplantation that maximises organoid survival. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived liver progenitor cell organoids were transplanted into four different transplantation sites in a mouse model of liver disease, using five organoid delivery methods. Organoids were transplanted into the vascularised chamber device established in the groin, or into the liver, spleen, and subcutaneous fat. For organoid transplantations into the liver, organoids were delivered either in Matrigel alone, or in Matrigel and a polyurethane scaffold. At 2 weeks post-transplantation, the vascularised chamber had the highest organoid survival, which was 5.1x higher than the site with second highest survival (<italic>p</italic>=0.0002), being the intra-hepatic scaffold approach. No organoid survival was observed when delivered into the liver without a scaffold, or when injected into the spleen. Very low survival occurred in transplantations into subcutaneous fat. Animals with the vascularised chamber also had the highest levels of human albumin (0.33 ± 0.09 ng/mL). This study provides strong evidence supporting the use of the vascularised chamber for future liver organoid transplantation studies, including its translation into clinical therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent pre-clinical advances in regenerative medicine suggest that organoid transplantation may alleviate liver disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. However, transplantation approaches used in experimental animal models are often unsuitable for clinical translation because they are too invasive or risky, provi inadequate space for large-scale organoid delivery, or cannot be easily monitored and surgically explored. Examples of such methods include the cranial window [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], dorsal skinfold chamber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], and direct puncture or subcapsular delivery into organs such as the spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], or kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. To develop a clinically viable method for organoid transplantation, it is important to consider the surgical technique (level of difficulty and risk) and the location of organoid delivery (intra-hepatic or ectopic). Moreover, it is likely that different methods are more suited for different types of patients. For example, patients with early-stage disease may be adequately treated with a low-dose of organoids via a simple portal vein infusion, whereas patients with severe liver disease may require a greater number of organoids delivered via a more invasive method. To guide these future decisions in clinical therapy, the field requires experimental data comparing different methods and sites of organoid transplantation for liver disease. However only few such studies exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], with conflicting outcomes. There is a need for expanded studies addressing this pertinent issue.</p>
<p>In this study, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived liver organoids were transplanted into 4 different sites in a mouse model of liver disease. The sites were intra-hepatic onto the liver surface, spleen, subcutaneous fat, and the vascularised chamber created around the blood vessels in the groin. For intra-hepatic delivery, organoids were delivered either in a hydrogel plug smeared onto the surface, or a clinically used bioabsorbable porous scaffold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. A unique aspect of the study is the inclusion of a vascularised chamber, which comprises a non-collapsible silicone chamber that acts as a protective device around a major artery and vein, inducing a highly angiogenic environment that robustly supports the engraftment of transplanted cells and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Although the vascularised chamber has been used to transplant various liver cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], its use has never been directly compared to other sites of transplantation, either for liver bioengineering or any other application.</p>

<title>eGFP-hiPSC culture and differentiation into iLPCs</title>
<p>An eGFP reporter hiPSC line was used for this study, which has been previously characterised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. This eGFP-hiPSC line was generated by inserting the eGFP reporter gene into the GAPDH locus, thereby ensuring all cells constitutively express eGFP. hiPSCs were maintained in TeSR-E8 Media (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) with 10% knockout serum replacement (ThermoFisher, Massachusetts, USA).</p>
<p>eGFP-hiPSCs were differentiated into hiPSC-liver progenitor cells (iLPCs) by plating onto Matrigel-coated plates (hESC-qualified Matrigel, Corning, New York, USA), then differentiated using a 12-day protocol with 3 steps. Base media throughout this period was RPMI-1640 media (ThermoFisher) with 1% B27 supplement (ThermoFisher). For the first 4 days, media was supplemented with 100ng/mL Activin A (Peprotech), then for the next 4 days media was supplemented with 50ng/mL bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) (Peprotech), and for the final 4 days 50ng/mL of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (Peprotech) was added. Following differentiation, cells were purified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) on a BD Aria Fusion cell sorter (BD Bioscience, New Jersey, USA) using a GCTM-5 antibody conjugated to Allophycocyanin (APC) [GCTM-5 hybridoma provided by Professor Martin Pera (Jackson Laboratory) and Dr Alison Farley (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute)]. GCTM-5 has been previously shown to be expressed in endoderm/liver progenitor cells from adult liver as well as ESC-derived hepatoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Purified GCTM-5+ iLPCs were expanded in LPC medium comprising base medium of Williams’ Medium E (ThermoFisher), with 10% foetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA), 10mM HEPES (ThermoFisher), 2mM GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher), 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (ThermoFisher), 5% R-spondin1 conditioned medium (supplied by Monash Biodiscovery Institute Organoid Program, Victoria, Australia), 10μg/mL Actrapid® human insulin (Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd, Denmark), 20ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Peprotech), 30mg/mL insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) (Peprotech), 25ng/mL HGF (Peprotech), 50ng/mL fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF) (Peprotech), 1.25mM N-acetyl cysteine (Sigma), 10mM Nicotinamide, 5µM A83-01 (Sigma), 10µM Forskolin (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), 10nM [Leu15]-Gastrin I (Sigma), and 0.5µM CHIR99021 (Sigma).</p>

<title>Formation of iLPC organoids</title>
<p>iLPCs were lifted from monolayers, and 1 x 10 <sup>6</sup> iLPCs were plated onto each well of an ultra-low attachment 6-well plate (Corning). LPC medium for this step was modified to increase the R-Spondin1 concentration to 10%, with further additions of 20% Wnt3A conditioned medium (Monash), 25ng/mL Noggin (Peprotech), and 10µM of Y-27632 (Abcam). Individual cells were allowed to aggregate into organoids over a 48-hour period.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Organoid processing for histology</title>
<p>iLPC organoids formed after 48 hours post-seeding were fixed for 3 hours in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma), before a double-embedding process in 1.5% agarose gel then paraffin as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Organoids were sectioned at 5µm thickness and mounted onto polysine-coated adhesion slides (Epredia, Michigan, USA).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Transplantation of iLPC organoids</title>
<p>All animal experiments were performed with approval of the St Vincent’s Hospital Melbourne Animal Ethics Committee (Protocol AEC 20/19), in accordance with Australian National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines. <italic>Fah</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>/Rag2</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>/Il2rg</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (FRG) mice (Yecuris corporation, Oregon, USA) were maintained as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Animals were routinely maintained on 8mg/L of (2-(2-nitro-4-fluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione) (NTBC) supplemented in drinking water. From three weeks prior to transplantation and after organoid transplantation, NTBC was with-held every 5-7 days for a period of 2 days, and this cycle was continued until harvest, to induce mild liver injury and therefore to mimic the process of metabolic liver disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Male and female mice (approximate 1:1 ratio) weighing 16-20g and 6-8 weeks of age were used for all experiments. A total of 5 different groups (N=3-7 per group) was completed, with each group representing a different type of organoid delivery and surgery. For all animals iLPC organoids generated from <sup>6</sup> 1cexlls w1 a0s delivered, suspended in 25µL of growth-factor full Matrigel (Corning).</p>
<p>For the vascularised chamber device group, chambers were established in the groin using a surgical method described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Briefly, this involved surgically isolating the proximal segment of inferior epigastric pedicle (an artery/vein branch from the femoral vessels) by freeing it from its surrounding tissue, then sleeving the exposed portion with a 5mm length of split silicone tubing (Corning) and securing the tubing to the underlying muscle with 10-0 nylon suture (Ethicon, New Jersey, USA). The total chamber volume was 50µL. The proximal end and longitudinal seams of the tube were sealed using bone wax (Ethicon), then the chamber was filled from its distal end with 50µL of growth factor full Matrigel. The distal end was then sealed with bone wax to create an enclosed space. The skin was closed using staples. Chambers were allowed to vascularise through angiogenic sprouting from the enclosed artery/vein for a period of 3 weeks, then opened again for organoid transplantation. By this time some Matrigel had remodelled and was resorbed to provide enough space for 25µL of additional Matrigel containing iLPC organoids to be delivered.</p>
<p>For intra-hepatic organoid delivery in a scaffold and Matrigel, a polyurethane scaffold (NovoSorb® provided by PolyNovo Ltd, Port Melbourne, Australia) was used. This is a porous synthetic polymer containing interconnected pores of 300-600µm diameter. iLPC organoids suspended in 25µL of Matrigel were seeded into scaffold discs of 1mm thickness and 5mm diameter, and allowed to set at 37°C. For transplantation into the liver, a transverse laparotomy was performed, then an incision to the left liver lobe was made and a pocket was created with micro-forceps. A single scaffold was laid into this pocket and sandwiched between the left liver lobe and the overlying median lobe without sutures. This positioning meant that the sandwiched scaffold was unlikely to move from the pocket. The abdominal wall and skin were closed using a 7-0 prolene suture (Ethicon).</p>
<p>For intra-hepatic organoid delivery with Matrigel only, organoids in Matrigel were allowed to set at 37°C to form a semi-solid plug. A pocket was created in the left liver lobe as described above, and the Matrigel plug containing organoids was smeared into this pocket using a spatula. Cauterisation was used to leave a small scar on the edge of the lobe so the pocket could be identified during harvest.</p>
<p>For subcutaneous organoid delivery, organoids in Matrigel were injected into the subcutaneous fat pad in the groin using a 29G insulin syringe. This created a bleb just under the skin, confirming subcutaneous delivery (and not muscle delivery). The needle insertion point was sutured with a 7-0 prolene suture to prevent organoid leakage.</p>
<p>For intra-splenic organoid delivery, an incision was made into the left flank, and the spleen was partially exposed to access the distal pole. Organoids suspended in Matrigel were injected into the spleen using a 29G insulin syringe inserted from the distal pole, and the tip of the spleen proximal to the needle entry-point was tied off using a 5-0 vicryl suture (Ethicon) to prevent organoid leakage. The abdominal wall and skin were closed using a 7-0 prolene suture.</p>

<title>Post-transplantation tissue harvest</title>
<p>Tissues were collected 2 weeks post-transplantation and fixed in 4% PFA in PBS (Sigma) overnight prior to embedding in paraffin. Tissue sections of 5µm thickness were cut and mounted onto polysine adhesion slides (Epredia, Michigan, USA).</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Paraffin sections of <italic>in vitro</italic> organoids and <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue samples were dewaxed and rehydrated, then immuno-labelled using a standard protocol. This involved sequential treatment with heat-mediated citric acid (Sigma) buffer antigen retrieval, peroxidase quench with 3% hydrogen peroxide (Merck, New Jersey, USA), protein block with Dako protein block solution (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), incubation with primary antibodies [<bold>eGFP</bold> (Abcam, ab6673, 1:400), <bold>HNF4α</bold> (R&amp;D Systems, Minnesota, USA, PP-H14150C, 1:200), <bold>Sox9</bold> (Abcam, ab185966, 1:1000), <bold>human albumin</bold> (Bethyl Laboratories, Texas, USA, A80-229A, 1:200), <bold>K i 6</bold> (<bold>7</bold>ThermoFisher, RM-9106-S1, 1:300), <bold>CD31</bold> (ThermoFisher, PA1-37326, 1:50) or <bold>LYVE-1</bold> (Abcam, ab14917, 1:250)] in Dako antibody solution (Dako), incubation with secondary antibodies (either anti-goat, anti-rabbit, or anti-mouse biotinylated secondary antibody, all from Vector Labs, California, USA, at 1:200), detection using a Vector Elite ABC kit (Vector), then 3,3’-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen staining (Dako). Sections were counter-stained with haematoxylin and cover-slipped with Entellan mounting medium (Merck).</p>

<sec id="s2g">
<title>Morphometry assessments</title>
<p>The number and size of eGFP+ liver organoids per tissue sample, and the percentage of HNF4α+ and Sox9+ nuclei within organoid structures were identified using serial paraffin sections immuno-labelled with eGFP, HNF4α and Sox9. For each tissue sample, serial sections were first staine regular intervals (every 10 sections) with haematoxylin &amp; eosin to identify the area of greatest engraftment. Tissue sections from this area were then stained with the relevant markers for morphometric analysis.</p>
<p>Organoids were identified using 4x magnification, then individually imaged at 40x magnification for assessment of organoid diameter, circumference, and area, and counting of HNF4α positive/negative and Sox9 positive/negative nuclei within organoids. Number of organoids per sample and nuclei counts were conducted manually, whereas ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Maryland, USA) was used to assess organoid diameter, circumference, and area. Morphometric assessments were completed by one observer, then independently checked by a second observer. Between observers there was less than 5% of discrepancy, so the first observer’s assessments have been used for analysis.</p>

<p>Two methods of organoid delivery onto the surface of the liver were tested.

<p>Overall, organoid survival was diminished with intra-hepatic delivery, and engraftment was only found when organoids were delivered in a scaffold. This suggests that given the same site (liver surface) and extracellular matrix (Matrigel) and organoid dosage (total of 1 x 10 <sup>6</sup> cells), the use of the scaffold constrained organoids to a localised site and promoted their survival. The scaffold material was well adhered onto the liver at 2 weeks and showed dense infiltration of host tissue indicating that the material was being integrated over time.</p>

<title>Intra-splenic organoid delivery leads to zero organoid engraftment</title>
<p>When organoids were suspended in Matrigel and injected into the spleen, no survival was found (N=4). Small, isolated specks of eGFP+ staining was scattered throughout the spleen <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E, 5F</xref>)</bold>, but were not associated with nucleated cells and this could either be remnants of disintegrated iLPCs or a staining artifact. Because cells injected into the spleen are commonly known to rapidly translocate to the liver by travelling through the vasculature and blood flow which drains from the spleen into the liver, the livers of animals that received intra-splenic organoid injections were systematically sampled. This involved the dissection of every lobe into 5mm strips (approximately 3-4 strips per lobe) and histological examination of every strip. This step confirmed no eGFP+ organoids were found in any animals, in both the spleen and liver. Moreover, liver translocation in this situation was not expected because organoids typically 50-150µm in diameter were unlikely to traverse into the splenic vasculature because of their size, and the use of viscous Matrigel which solidifies at body temperature would be a further impediment.</p>

Although not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.1654), the 40% increase in HNF4α expression in the intra-hepatic scaffold group suggests that the native liver provides a hepato-inductive niche that is not present in the ectopic vascularised chamber.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By comparing the survival and function of iLPC organoids transplanted using 5 different methods across 4 transplantation sites <italic>in vivo</italic>, this study demonstrated that the vascularised chamber led to the highest survival of organoids. Transplantation into the liver surface using Matrigel alone led to no survival, but when organoids were delivered with Matrigel into a scaffold, this led to modest survival although still 5.1x less than the chamber. Subcutaneous transplantation had minimal survival, and intra-splenic transplantation had zero survival. Human albumin levels in mouse plasma correlated with the survival of organoids, with the highest levels of human albumin detected in animals with the vascularised chamber. The results are summarised in the table presented in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>.</p>
<p>Previous studies compared 2-3 different transplantation sites, with conflicting data on the best site for organoid engraftment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], and only one study examined engraftment into the liver itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Including the liver site for comparison is important because delivering organoids to the native organ serves as a useful reference point. Furthermore, studies with cell transplantation have indicated that intra-portal infusion of cells into the liver leads to the best survival compared to other sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], although this specific method may not be suitable for organoids because of their size and thus increased risk of portal hypertension or portal vein thrombosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. In this study, two different methods were used to deliver large numbers of organoids to the liver without the risk of complications associated with intra-vascular infusion. Concurrently, ectopic locations need to be considered as alternatives to intra-hepatic delivery because this may be inappropriate for certain types of patients with liver disease, such as those with cirrhotic livers, portal hypertension, or significant coagulopathy, which increases the risk of surgical complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] and this also creates a hostile environment for transplanted organoids. The vascularised chamber circumvents some of these issues by providing a quick, simple, and relatively minimally invasive surgical technique which creates a closed, protected space in an ectopic location. This surgical device facilitates the reliable generation of substantial volumes of well vascularised tissues and can accommodate large numbers of organoids, unlike other transplantation sites like the spleen or kidney capsule. The chamber can be created around any artery/vein branch, although the groin is commonly used for ease of access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. This approach has only been used in a few liver bioengineering studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. The data presented here suggests it has significant advantages over other organoid transplantation methods and its use should be expanded.</p>
<p>Several different mechanisms may influence the survival of organoids at different transplantation sites. This includes the level of vascularisation, hypoxia, immune surveillance, trophic factors, and local microenvironment, as well as whether the organoids were delivered via an injection syringe or pipette, which exposes organoids to different shear forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. For example, reasons for the lack of organoid survival in the spleen could be the relative low levels of extracellular matrix and high immune surveillance in the spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], as well as shear stress exerted on the organoids during injection using a fine needle syringe. Although complex and multi-factorial, these mechanisms need to be explored and optimised to maximise organoid engraftment. One important concept that appears to have considerable impact is constraining organoids within a localised space, using biomaterials. Both the chamber and scaffold achieve this, either in a closed space in the chamber, or within interconnected porous spaces and channels within a scaffold. Interestingly, delivering organoids in a small volume of thermo-responsive hydrogel (Matrigel) alone does not appear to facilitate organoid survival (as seen in the liver, spleen and subcutaneous fat), possibly because the hydrogel is easily dislodged or spread over a large area without physically constraining organoids to the extent that the chamber or scaffold does. Further development of these strategies and investigating the effect of organoid densities, the effect of compacting organoids in a small space, and how this influences viability and overall engraftment is warranted. Additionally, combining the two concepts by transplanting organoids within a scaffold into the chamber may enhance further organoid survival by combining the effects of localising organoids in a small space with the high levels of vascularisation in the chamber. This has been done previously using blood vessels, where the scaffold was used as a carrier vehicle to deliver transplantable blood vessels into the chamber, which acted as a vascularised bioreactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].</p>
<p>The type of organoid used for transplantation is also likely to have an important impact on organoid survival and development. There are many varieties of human liver organoids, spanning from the less-clinically relevant immortalised cell-line derived organoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] to primary cell-derived organoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], and those created from pluripotent stem cells including hiPSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. The cell types within organoids can vary and may be liver progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], cholangiocytes (biliary epithelial cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], or a mixture including non-parenchymal cells such as endothelial or stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. In this study hiPSC-derived organoids were used because these represent the most likely source of cells to be used for future clinical therapy. Furthermore, liver progenitor cells (LPCs) derived from hiPSC were used because they can readily expand in culture unlike terminally differentiated hepatocytes which have a very limited lifespan in culture, and LPCs can form not only hepatocytes but cholangiocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] which are important for the drainage of bile produced by hepatocytes. In our system, the chamber provides the most optimal environment for iLPC organoids, with limited to no survival in the spleen and subcutaneous group. However, in other studies, different types of liver organoids have been reported to survive after intra-splenic injection by translocating into the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], and in subcutaneous fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] (although not compared to other sites). These various types of organoids should be tested in the chamber device. Furthermore, when considering other organoid transplantation studies, it is worth noting that many organoid transplantation studies do not transplant whole organoids, but organoid-derived single cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. This effectively serves as cell therapy, not organoid therapy, and makes it difficult to compare these studies to those transplanting actual organoids.</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of this study worth further developing is the use of the polyurethane scaffold loaded with iLPC organoids, which can serve as a “liver patch” that can be applied on the liver surface. Several other studies have reported liver cell/organoid patches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], and the advantage of such methods is the ability to easily apply this using minimally invasive methods such as laparoscopic surgery, and this can be delivered on multiple areas of the liver surface, and even repeated over time. Most of these studies have used extra-cellular matrix and synthetic hydrogels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], stacked cell sheets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>] or electro-spun fibres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>] to create the patches, however these methods create thin delicate patches that can be difficult to physically manipulate without damaging them. The advantage of the polyurethane scaffold is its robust physical properties. The scaffold is a sponge-like foam that can be easily picked up, loaded with organoids, and transferred to the liver surface in one piece, without any risk of tearing or disintegrating. This means it can be upscaled in diameter and thickness and still be easily applied to the liver surface and will physically hold its form. Although an attractive concept, given that organoid survival in these scaffolds was relatively poor in this study, there needs to be further optimisation to increase organoid survival. This may involve increasing the organoid number seeded per scaffold and incorporating additional non-parenchymal cells that enhance organoid survival and maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>].</p>
<p>Future directions for this work include assessing longer time-points to determine the extended survival of organoids with the vascularised chamber and intra-hepatic scaffold, repeating the study with different kinds of liver organoids, and comparing transplantation sites across different animal models to confirm these findings are universally applicable. An additional transplantation site that should be considered is the omentum, which has been often used to transplant organoids and hepatocytes including in human studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. It is an easily accessible large space which is well vascularised and directly connected to the portal blood supply. However, one major limitation of this approach is that any major intra-abdominal surgery predisposes the patient to intra-abdominal adhesions (scarring), which often causes long-term complications such as repeated bowel obstructions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Furthermore, any infection or tumour formation can lead to rapid peritoneal dissemination. It is also likely that organoids will need to be delivered using a scaffold, otherwise they can be easily dislodged without attaching to any surface. These issues need to be carefully considered in future studies. Lastly, the most effective methods of organoid transplantation need to be applied in different models of liver disease to stratify which approach is best for a type of liver disease.</p>
<p>Overall, this study adds clinically relevant data to the field of liver organoid transplantation by highlighting modalities of organoid transplantation that optimise organoid survival and suggesting a roadmap for future developments to hasten the clinical translation of this concept.</p>

<p>This <bold>solid</bold> manuscript describes a preclinical model to assess different methods of infusion of organoids for clinical applications. This is an <bold>important</bold> and timely study with practical implications beyond a single subfield. The methods described, including the analysis, broadly support the claims although there are some areas for improvement.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors describe their work on finding optimal ways of infusing organoids into mice. They describe five delivery methods and compare organoid survival two weeks after delivery. This work is concluded with the use of a vascularized chamber being the most optimal for organoid viability.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The aim is to have a preclinical, translational model to test methods of organoid infusion. This is important and timely to the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
- A clear aim seems to be missing, although I can extract this from the manuscript. The approach is described a bit cryptically. The manuscript could use a bit more explanation here and there.</p>
<p>
- Although the authors themselves argue in the introduction that the use of mice is not optimal, they show a mouse study in which human-derived iPSC organoids are infused in mice.</p>
<p>
- As far as I can extract from the Methods section, only one iPSC line was used. Given the huge donor variance, it is essential to repeat the work with multiple iPSC lines.</p>
<p>
- I am missing the right control groups, especially for the surgical groups. And the group size is very variable (3 to 7 mice per group). Three per group is then somewhat small in size.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived liver progenitor cell organoids were transplanted into four different transplantation sites in a mouse model of liver disease, using five organoid delivery methods. Organoids were transplanted into the vascularised chamber device established in the groin, or into the liver, spleen, and subcutaneous fat. Results show that the vascularised chamber had the highest organoid survival, 5.1x higher than the site with the second highest survival (p=0.0002), being the intra-hepatic scaffold approach. Animals with the vascularised chamber also had the highest human albumin levels (0.33 {plus minus} 0.09 ng/mL). No organoid survival was observed when delivered into the liver without a scaffold, or when injected into the spleen. Meager survival occurred in transplantations into subcutaneous fat.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
A systematic study with a clear line of experiments and well-presented results. The manuscript is well-written and easy to follow. The results and conclusions drawn are convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Although the number of organoids and albumin secretion is visibly higher in the vascularised chamber device, the organoids possess relatively higher Sox9+ cells compared to HNFa4a+ cells suggesting higher biliary differentiation than hepatic differentiation. On the other hand, although the intrahepatic scaffold approach, with a relatively smaller number of organoids and less albumin secretion, showed higher hepatic differentiation (although non-significant) suggesting that better scaffolds could be researched further to assess the clinical application of intrahepatic scaffold-based organoid transplantation.</p>
