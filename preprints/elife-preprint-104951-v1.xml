<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Natural killer (NK) cells are classically defined as innate immune cells, but experiments show that mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection in C57BL/6 mice can cause NK cells to undergo antigen-specific proliferation and memory formation, similar to adaptive CD8+ T cells. One shared behavior between CD8+ T cells and NK cells is clonal expansion, where a single stimulated cell proliferates rapidly to form a diverse population of cells. For example, clones derived from single cells are most abundant during expansion when they are primarily CD27-for NK cells and CD62L-for T cells, phenotypes derived from precursor CD27+ and CD62L+ cells, respectively. Here we determined the mechanistic rules involving proliferation, cell death, and differentiation of endogenous and adoptively transferred NK cells in the expansion phase of the response to MCMV infection. We found that the interplay between cell proliferation and cell death of mature CD27-NK cells and a highly proliferative CD27-Ly6C-mature subtype and intrinsic stochastic fluctuations in these processes play key roles in regulating the heterogeneity and population of the NK cell subtypes. Furthermore, we estimate rates for maturation of endogenous NK cells in homeostasis and in MCMV infection and found that only NK cell growth rates, and not differentiation rates, are appreciably increased by MCMV. Taken together, these results quantify the differences between the kinetics of NK cell antigen-specific expansion from that of CD8+ T cells and unique mechanisms that give rise to the observed heterogeneity in NK cell clones generated from single NK cells in the expansion phase.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Natural Killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system and provide important protection against viral infections and tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Caligiuri, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Vivier et al., 2008</xref>). NK cells develop in the bone marrow and express a diverse set of germline-encoded activating and inhibitory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Biassoni, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Huntington et al., 2007</xref>). Mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection induces antigen-specific expansion of naïve Ly49H+ NK cells in mice, followed by a contraction phase, and then the formation of long-lived adaptive NK cells displaying recall responses to the same antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cerwenka and Lanier, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Robbins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schlub et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sun et al., 2009</xref>). The activating Ly49H receptor, encoded by <italic>Klra8</italic>, recognizes the MCMV-encoded m157 glycoprotein and leads to activation of Ly49H+ NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Orr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Voigt et al., 2003</xref>). In humans, a similar activation of NK cells by human cytomegalovirus is observed with the preferential expansion of NKG2C+ NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hendricks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ishiyama et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lopez-Verges et al., 2011</xref>). The expansion, contraction, and memory formation of Ly49H+ NK cells during MCMV infection bears similarity to antigen-specific responses of adaptive CD8+ T cells that generate memory CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Adams et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buchholz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kaech et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schlub et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A range of experiments investigated epigenetic changes, RNA transcription, and surface protein expression in single and bulk Ly49H+ NK cells undergoing expansion and contraction in mice responding to MCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Flommersfeld et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Grassmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Martinet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Min-Oo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nabekura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Potempa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Riggan et al., 2022</xref>). These observations show that the NK cell compartment undergoes phenotypic changes, resulting in changes in the abundances of varying subpopulations of cells. The development of these subpopulations depends on the three main signal inputs, antigen simulation of a specific receptor (e.g., Ly49H), co-stimulation, and cytokine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Peng and Tian, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Romee et al., 2016</xref>). These subpopulations express distinct epigenetic, transcriptomic, and protein markers imprinted by signaling and gene regulatory processes. Observations of clonal expansion of barcoded single Ly49H+ NK cells adoptively transferred into <italic>Rag2</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>Il2rg</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mice revealed another layer of heterogeneity where sizes and compositions of NK cell clones originating from single naïve Ly49H+ NK cells vary widely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Flommersfeld et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Grassmann et al., 2019</xref>). This heterogeneity in the NK cell population is regulated by the stochastic kinetics of cell proliferation, cell death, and differentiation involving the subpopulations that emerge as the NK cells respond to the infection. Analysis of similar heterogeneities in clonal CD8+ T cell populations have shown generation of a highly proliferative short-lived effector phenotype and intrinsic stochastic fluctuations in the differentiation and proliferation processes, which account for heterogeneity of the CD8+ T cell clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buchholz et al., 2013</xref>). These effector CD8+ T cells are CD62L- and differentiate during the expansion phase from upstream memory precursors that are CD62L+(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Schlub et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yang et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the qualitative similarities between the antigen-specific responses of NK cells and CD8+ T cells there are several marked differences. Single-cell NK clones typically undergo a relatively smaller 1000× increase in number compared to the 40,000× increase in CD8+ T cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Adams et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, mature CD27-NK cells grow more slowly than their immature CD27+ counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buchholz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hayakawa and Smyth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Paul et al., 2016</xref>), whereas effector CD62L-CD8+ T cells proliferate faster than precursor CD62L+ subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Adams et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kretschmer et al., 2020</xref>). These data suggest there may be mechanistic differences in antigen-specific NK and CD8+ T cell responses.</p>
<p>Here, we addressed whether distinct mechanisms underlie the expansion of NK cells and CD8+ T cells during antigen-specific responses by performing stochastic population dynamic modeling on published bulk and single-cell NK cell data collected during the expansion phase following MCMV infection in C57BL/6 mice. Our analysis and modeling show that the mechanistic rules that describe the expansion of CD8+ T cells are inadequate for describing the development of MCMV-specific NK cells. We found that mature CD27-Ly6C-NK cells undergo a greater rate of cell proliferation compared to immature CD27+ NK cells and mature CD27-Ly6C+ NK cells, and mature CD27-NK cells undergo increased death relative to the CD27+ immature cells. The variations in the timescales of proliferation and death processes coupled with the intrinsic stochastic fluctuations within these processes among the NK cell subsets regulate the heterogeneity in the sizes of the NK cell clones originated from individual immature NK cells during MCMV infection. Quantification of the population kinetics of Ly49H+ NK cells in MCMV infection in the expansion phase shows a 10-fold increase in the cell growth rate compared to that in homeostatic conditions, whereas the effect of the infection on the maturation rate appears to be negligible. We also find that growth rates of adoptive NK cells in transfer experiments during MCMV infection in the expansion phase are higher than those of endogenous NK cells.</p>

<title>A progressive two-state immature to mature differentiation model cannot capture the heterogeneity of the NK cell clones in the expansion phase</title>
<p>We began our investigations by studying whether a minimal two-state progressive differentiation model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) could describe the size and composition of NK cell clones that originated from single immature Ly49H+ CD27+ NK cells at day 8 post-infection with MCMV, a time typically at the peak of expansion. The differentiation of immature CD27+ to mature CD27-NK cells during MCMV infection and in homeostasis has been widely documented and established in previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chiossone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Grassmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Min-Oo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mitrovic et al., 2012</xref>). We used data collected by Flommersfeld et al.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Flommersfeld et al., 2021</xref>), in which they adoptively transferred single genetic marker barcoded Ly49H+ NK cells to a host that is subsequently infected with MCMV. We characterized the NK cell clones by the means and variances of the populations of CD27+ or CD27-NK cells and the co-variance between the two cell types in the clones. The NK cell clones reported by Flommersfeld et al. contained mixtures of CD27+ and CD27-NK cells. We evaluated the percentage of CD27+ NK cells in each clone and computed the correlation (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>size-CD27+</italic></sub>) of the size of the clone with the percentage of CD27+ NK cells in the clones. The larger size NK cell clones contained a greater proportion of the CD27-NK cells and thus produced a negative correlation between the clone size and the percentage of CD27+ NK cells in individual clones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). This finding is in line with that found in a similar experiment by Grassmann et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Grassmann et al., 2019</xref>). These authors also transferred congenically-marked CD27- and CD27+ Ly49H+ NK cells in 1:1 ratio at day 0 and then assayed the expanded CD27+/-NK cells at day 8 post infection, showing a higher proportion of mature CD27-NK cells compared to the immature CD27+ NK cells (Figure S2E in Grassmann et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Grassmann et al., 2019</xref>)). This result is supported by other experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hayakawa and Smyth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Paul et al., 2016</xref>), and we used this observation to constrain our model parameter space. Heterogeneity of clones of CD8+ T cells generated by antigenic SIINFEKL stimulation showed a similar pattern where the largest clones in the expansion phase (day 7 post-stimulation) are composed of higher fractions of the mature CD62L-CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buchholz et al., 2013</xref>). Because mature CD62L-CD8+ T cells proliferate faster than the immature CD62L+ CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buchholz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kretschmer et al., 2020</xref>), it is intuitive that a larger size of a clone can be attributed to the larger proportion of the mature CD8+ T cells in the clone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). In contrast, NK cells proliferate slower when they differentiate to the mature CD27-phenotype. Thus, it is unclear how the similar relationship between the clone size and the composition of the clones can be understood. In order to probe this question further we used a stochastic model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) that describes the proliferation and differentiation processes in single Ly49H+ NK cells in response to MCMV infection. We do not model the MCMV infection explicitly and assume that the parameters of the model capture the effects of antigen, co-receptor, and cytokine stimulation and signaling and epigenetic modifications on the rates of differentiation and the proliferation of the cell types. In this model, immature CD27+ NK cells differentiate with a rate <italic>r</italic> to mature CD27-NK cells, and each cell type proliferates with rates, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>M</italic>,</sub> respectively. The proliferation and differentiation processes are modeled as stochastic events occurring with the above rates. We start our simulations with a single CD27+ NK cell and evaluated the number of CD27+ and CD27-NK cells at 8 days, which represent the size and the composition of a single NK cell clone. Repetitions of the stochastic simulations with the same initial configuration and rates will produce clones of different sizes and compositions due to intrinsic noise fluctuations in the stochastic simulations. We computed the correlation (<italic>C</italic><sub>size-CD27+</sub>) between the clone sizes and the percentages of the CD27+ NK cells in each clone from our simulations. Our parameter scan of randomly sampled values of <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub>, and <italic>r</italic> revealed that <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>size-CD27+</italic></sub> is negative <italic>only</italic> when <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub> &lt; <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). However, the observations that CD27+ cells should grow faster than CD27-cells imply <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub> &gt; <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> for the NK cells. Therefore, the two-state model cannot capture the heterogeneity of the NK cell clones.</p>

<p>Next, we investigated if inclusion of death of NK cells can make the model consistent with the negative correlation between the clone size and the percentage of CD27+ NK cells in each clone. We updated our proposed model to include both proliferation and death of each cell population (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). In such a model, each cell has a probability of proliferating according to birth rate <italic>b</italic> and probability of dying indicated by the death rate <italic>d</italic>. Cells can go through many proliferation events before undergoing death, which would indicate a positive growth rate. The net growth of the CD27+ and CD27-NK cell populations are determined by <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub><italic>=b</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub><italic>-d</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub><italic>=b</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub><italic>-d</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub>, respectively, where <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub> and <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub> (or <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> and <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub>) are the proliferation and death rates of the immature CD27+ (or mature CD27-) NK cells. Repeating a parameter scan by randomly sampling the 5 parameters (<italic>b</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub>, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub>, <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub>, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub>, and <italic>r</italic>) from uniform distributions and evaluating the correlation <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>size-CD27+</italic></sub> shows that some parameter configurations can generate the negative values at the parameter values, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub> &gt; <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Further inspection shows that parameter values in the regime <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub> &gt; <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> that produce the negative correlation share a common trait: mature CD27-cells proliferate <italic>and</italic> die faster than immature CD27+ cells. To gain further insight into this behavior we investigated the dependence of <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>size-CD27+</italic></sub> on the parameter values and stochastic fluctuations analytically and found that larger proliferation and death rates of the CD27-NK cells produce large stochastic fluctuations in the sizes of the CD27-cell populations. Thus, mature CD27-NK cells in a clone could undergo many proliferation events before encountering death, creating larger clones with higher proportion of mature CD27-NK cells. Conversely, the CD27-cells could go through many death events before a proliferation event causing the clone size to shrink (details in Supplementary Text 1).</p>
<p>We investigated whether this model could accurately fit the first (means) and second (variances and covariance) moments of the measured CD27+ and CD27-NK cell populations at 8 days post-infection. We fit the model by minimizing the sum of square errors (SSE) subject to the constraints <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>size-CD27+</italic></sub> &lt; −0.2 and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub> <italic>&gt; k</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub>. This parameter configuration cannot accurately capture the moments of the clonal burst data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). Thus, although the model that incorporates both NK cell proliferation and death is able produce the negative correlation between the clone size and the percentage of CD27+ NK cells in each clone, it poorly describes the distributions of the immature and mature NK cells in the clones.</p>
<p>To further investigate the role of NK cell death in explaining the clone size distribution we compared the above two-state models without or with NK cell death based on the theory of model selection using modified Akkaike Information Criterion (AIC<sub>c</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burnham et al., 2011</xref>). We computed the probability distribution function of the number of immature CD27+ (N<sub>I</sub>) and mature CD27-(N<sub>M</sub>) cells at any time obtained from our stochastic model by solving the corresponding Master equation numerically and computed the Likelihood function for the available clone size distribution data (details in the Materials and Methods section), and then evaluated modified-AIC (AIC<sub>c</sub>) for the two models. To keep the computation in a feasible range we used a part (38 out of 56 clone sizes) of the available data where the maximum clone size is ~ 1000. The subset of clone size data used here also shows a negative value of <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>size-CD27+</italic></sub>. The AICc value for the two-state model with death is over 50 points lower than that for the two state model without death, which clearly show that the data favor the model with NK cell death.</p>
<p>Although this approach only models a subset of the data, it also finds that birth and death rates for mature cells are greater than that of immature cells, and that the growth rate of immature cells is greater than that of mature cells. Further details regarding the analysis are provided in the Materials and Methods section and the Supplementary Material. Because of the computational intensive nature of this approach and its agreement with the simpler method of fitting moments with a constraint, we continue with the later approach for subsequent models.</p>

<title>A progressive three-stage differentiation model can quantitatively recreate clonal burst dynamics</title>
<p>We modified our two-state model to include an intermediate state (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) in the model. This reflects many investigations probing NK cell maturation, which show NK cell development goes through several maturation states and some of those states can potentially represent the proposed intermediate state in the model. A well-established NK cell maturation scheme is CD27+CD11b-→CD27+CD11b+ →CD27-CD11b+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chiossone et al., 2009</xref>). However, the clonal burst data show a negligible proportion of CD11b-NK cells at 8 days post-infection. Another potential maturation scheme could be CD27+KLRG1-→CD27+KLRG1+ →CD27-KLRG1+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kamimura and Lanier, 2015</xref>). In addition, recent single cell RNA-seq experiments show the presence of CD27-Ly6C+ and CD27-Ly6C-cells at 8 days post-MCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Riggan et al., 2022</xref>), thus the intermediate state could represent a CD27-Ly6C-state as well. Here we present results for the model where the intermediate state represents a mature CD27-state, the other variations of the model are shown in the Supplementary Material (Fig. S3-S5). In order to determine parameter ranges that give rise to higher growth of immature NK cells compared to their immature counterparts, we computed the average size of a clone that originates from either a single CD27+ NK cell or single CD27-NK cell by solving ODEs describing the kinetics of the average NK cell populations. We constructed an effective growth difference metric <italic>Δ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>, which describes the difference between the average NK cell populations at day 8 that originate from a single CD27+ or CD27-NK cell at t=0. If <italic>Δ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> is positive, then CD27+ cells grow faster than CD27-cells (Materials and Methods). We performed a parameter scan on this three-stage model and find that some parameter configurations with <italic>Δ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> &gt; 0 can capture the negative values of <italic>C</italic><sub>size-CD27+</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). We then evaluated whether this three-stage model can accurately describe the distributions of the immature and mature NK cells in clones. We fitted the means, variances, and the covariance of the NK subpopulations in the clones by varying the model parameters with constraints <italic>Δ</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> &gt; 0 and <italic>C</italic><sub>size-CD27+</sub> &lt; −0.2 and found that the best-fit three-stage model shows an excellent fit to the data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, adding an intermediate CD27-stage to the model can capture all the key features of the heterogeneity in the NK cell clonal populations.</p>

<p>The three-stage model above makes no assumptions about the identities of the differing phenotypes of the CD27-cell subsets. However, the best fit parameters indicate that the first CD27-subset has a high proliferation rate, and the final CD27-subset has a high death rate. Riggan <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Riggan et al., 2022</xref>) previously determined that, in the contraction phase, Ly6C+ NK cells differentiate from Ly6C-cells, and that Ly6C+ cells die more rapidly than Ly6C-cells. Our model shows that similar activity may be observed during the expansion phase as well, as we show higher death of Ly6C+ cells and a unidirectional maturation from Ly6C-→ Ly6C+ cells. Because our analysis pertains to the expansion phase of the NK cell response to MCMV we thus aimed to validate if the mature states proposed in the model can be identified with CD27-Ly6C- and CD27-Ly6C+ NK cells. We found that our best fit parameters correctly recreate the experimentally observed strong negative correlation between the %CD27+ and %Ly6C+ NK cells across clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Grassmann et al., 2019</xref>), and correctly estimate that most clones have &lt;20% Ly6C+ cells at day 8 post-infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d-e</xref>). This independent validation gives evidence that our parameter estimates can be meaningfully interpreted for a model where NK cells differentiate along a trajectory from CD27+Ly6C-→ CD27-Ly6C-→ CD27-Ly6C+.</p>
<p>We sought to understand the mechanism by which the three-stage model can generate negative values for the correlation <italic>C</italic><sub>size-CD27+</sub> as well as quantitatively describe the heterogeneity in the NK cell populations in the clones. The two-stage model predictions for the first and the second moments for the NK cell populations are substantially less than the actual values, indicating that our best-fit parameters are not producing enough NK cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). The presence of the intermediate state in the three-stage model alleviates this issue, which can rapidly grow and increase the number of CD27-Ly6C+ NK cells while the rapidly dying CD27-Ly6C-NK cells can help meet the constraint that a population of CD27-cells grows slower than one of CD27+ cells. This variation increases stochastic fluctuations in the observed numbers of CD27-cells, as some clones will have many CD27-cells from high growth of the intermediate Ly6C-subset, while other clones will have few CD27-cells from low growth of the Ly6C+ subset.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the presence of the CD27-Ly6C+ NK cells expand the range of the model parameters that can give rise to negative values of <italic>C</italic><sub>size-CD27+</sub>.</p>

<title>Comparison of kinetics between endogenous NK cells, adoptively transferred cells, and homeostatic cells identifies potential identical maturation rates in all conditions</title>
<p>Here we compare the kinetics of NK cell maturation occurring in response to MCMV infection and in homeostasis. In particular, we investigated the changes in the rates of cell growth and differentiation induced by MCMV infection. First, we quantified the growth and the differentiation rates using time-stamped flow cytometry data on homeostatic NK cells with a one-time treatment of tamoxifen in fluorescent NK cell reporter mice reported by Adams <italic>et al</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adams et al., 2021</xref>). Treating the mice with tamoxifen determines whether observed NK cells are newly populated from bone marrow or existed in peripheral blood at the onset of the infection. We fitted a two-state CD27+ → CD27-maturation model described by ordinary differential equations (see Materials and Methods) to the data collected at days 3, 7, 14, 23, 29, and 35 to estimate the growth rates of the immature CD27+ (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>CD27</italic>+</sub>) and the mature CD27-(<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>CD27-</italic></sub>) NK cells, the rate of differentiation (<italic>r</italic>) of the CD27+ to CD27-NK cells, and the rate (<italic>λ</italic>) with which CD27+ NK cells are populated from bone marrow. We estimated these rates both for Ly49H+ and Ly49H-NK cells. The estimated rates for Ly49H+ cells (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) show that a CD27+ cell population would double every 6.9 days if there were no differentiation, whereas CD27-cells have a negative growth rate with a half-life of 5.6 days. This implies that the death rate of a population of CD27-cells is greater than their proliferation rate. The differentiation rate from CD27+ → CD27-phenotypes is similar to that of the death rate of Ly49H+ CD27-cells. Approximately 1.37% of the Ly49H+ NK pool is replenished from bone marrow every day. Comparing these rates to those of the Ly49H-NK pool reveals that Ly49H-NK cells are repopulated from bone marrow at almost twice the rate (~2.4%/day). All other estimated rates for Ly49H-NK cells are within the confidence bounds of the Ly49H+ estimated rates (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>).

(Materials and Methods) the difference in estimated λ values can be attributed to a higher percentage of CD27-cells. Next, we compared these rates with corresponding rates estimated in our three-state model using the clonal burst data. The estimate for CD27+ → CD27-differentiation rate is equivalent between Ly49H+ NK cells in homeostasis and in MCMV infection. Our estimations for the clonal burst data (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) show that varying subsets of CD27-cells have varying growth rates ranging −0.7 day<sup>−1</sup> to 1.3 day<sup>−1</sup>in MCMV infection, a wide range not in disagreement with the estimate for homeostatic data. Ly49H+ CD27+ cells grow ~10× faster in MCMV infection than in homeostatic conditions.</p>
<p>We investigated whether the kinetics of NK cell maturation in the expansion phase during MCMV infection in single-cell adoptive transfer experiments is quantitatively similar to that of an endogenous population of NK cells. To this end, we collected time-stamped mass cytometry data on C57BL/6 mice splenocytes at days 0, 4, and 7 post-MCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Potempa et al., 2022</xref>). We then gated Ly49H+ NK cells from each mouse and determined the mean relative abundances across mice of CD27+Ly6C-, CD27-Ly6C-, and CD27-Ly6C+ subsets among the NK cell population (Fig. S6). We multiplied these relative abundances by mean absolute numbers of Ly49H+ endogenous NK cells during MCMV infection from Robbins <italic>et al</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Robbins et al., 2004</xref>) to obtain time-stamped population sizes of NK cell subsets. We then modeled these data with the ordinary differential equation (ODE) solution in Equations S17-S25 using the parameters from <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and an initial condition of the mean uninfected <italic>in vivo</italic> abundances of endogenous NK cells. The ODE result is multiple orders of magnitude above the measured abundances (Fig. S7a). This indicates that the kinetics of endogenous NK cells differ significantly from that of NK cells in adoptive transfer experiments.</p>
<p>To further quantify the differences in the kinetic rates between the adoptively transferred and endogenous NK cells, we then fit the 3-stage model with 2 mature stages to the endogenous cell population. We used the gated Ly49H+ populations of CD27+/Ly6C-, CD27-/Ly6C-, and CD27-/Ly6C+ NK cells and fit to a system of ODEs that describe the net growth rates of each population and the differentiation rates between them (Materials and Methods). The best fit to this data has unrealistic estimates for the death rate of CD27-/Ly6C+ NK cells and the differentiation rate from CD27+ → CD27-cells (Table S5, Fig. S7b). We then attempted to constrain the fitting procedure by setting the CD27+ → CD27-differentiation rate to those of the previous estimations for the clonal burst kinetics and homeostatic conditions (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p>
<p>Under this constraint, the only rate estimated to be within the confidence interval for the equivalent rate in adoptive transfer experiments is the differentiation rate from Ly6C-→ Ly6C+ (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). The growth rate of CD27+Ly6C-cells is ~4× faster for adoptively transferred cells, the growth rate of CD27-Ly6C-cells is 2-3× faster, and the death rate of mature cells is ~1.5× faster. However, the resulting best fit to the endogenous NK cell population does show that the intermediate CD27-/Ly6C-cell population has the fastest growth rate, and the mature CD27-/Ly6C+ cells have a large death rate, confirming the qualitative results from the adoptive transfer experiments. Thus, although the growth kinetics are different between endogenous and adoptive transfer experiments, both systems have the intermediate population proliferating rapidly and the terminally mature population dying rapidly.</p>

<p>Both the adoptively transferred cells and endogenous population are estimated to have a large death rate for CD27-cells. To test this result, we analyzed NK cell viability in mice that were infected with MCMV at different times post-infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Surprisingly, mature (CD27-) cells indeed had a greater fraction of dead cells than immature (CD27+) cells during expansion (days 4 and 7 post-infection) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). To determine if the higher rates of cell death in the CD27-NK cell population in the three-state model give rise to a higher fraction of dead NK cells we extended our three-state model to evaluate the number of dead mature and immature NK cells (Fig. S8c) which showed that the best fit parameters for the adoptive transfer experiments are consistent with the results reported above (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Because we only have best fit growth rates of the endogenous NK cells and not separate proliferation and death rates, we tested a variety of birth and death rates consistent with the best fit parameters such that <italic>b-d=k</italic> for each cell subset.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We employed stochastic minimal mechanistic <italic>in silico</italic> models to investigate mechanisms that underlie development of MCMV-specific NK cells at early times (0 – 8 days post-infection). We found Ly49H+ NK cells undergoing antigen-specific expansion follow a maturation scheme from (immature) CD27+Ly6C-→ (mature I) CD27-Ly6C-→ (mature II) CD27-Ly6C+, characterized by a highly proliferative mature CD27-Ly6C-phenotype and a more mature CD27-Ly6C+ phenotype with higher rates of cell death (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The differences in the rates of proliferation and cell death are crucial to give rise to the heterogeneous clones that originate from single immature CD27+ NK cells, in particular, the presence of larger sized NK cell clones composed of mature CD27-NK cells at 8 days post-infection. Similar heterogeneity in the clones of CD8+ T cells generated in the expansion phase (&lt;8 days post-infection) from an acute antigen-specific expansion of single immature CD62L+ cells in C57BL/6 mice has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buchholz et al., 2013</xref>); however, the larger CD8+ T cell clones composed of effector CD62L-arise from the higher rate of proliferation of the CD62L-CD8+ T cells. This is in contrast with the NK cell maturation program where the larger sized clones of mature NK cell populations arise due to the interplay of uneven increase in the proliferation rates and increase in the rates of cell death as the NK cells mature, and intrinsic stochastic fluctuations occurring in these processes. Innate heterogeneity in adoptively transferred single NK cell phenotypes may also contribute to observed stochasticity. In CD8+ T cells, precursor CD62L+ cells are deemed memory precursors, matching their lowly proliferative phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kretschmer et al., 2020</xref>). An equivalent population of memory precursor NK cells has not been identified. CD27-Ly6C+ cells match previously defined phenotypes for memory NK cells and could potentially be memory precursors. However, our model shows that these cells experience rapid cell death. Therefore, for these cells to live longer to become memory cells additional processes such as a change in environmental conditions or an epigenetic change that promotes survival in these cells at later times during the contraction phase could become relevant. This differentiation trajectory is also in contrast with CD8+ T cells, as NK cell memory precursors would be formed downstream of effector (Ly6C-) NK cells, whereas CD8+ effectors (CD62L-) are formed downstream of CD8+ T cell memory precursors (CD62L+) in acute infection. Alternately, another mature NK subset such as Ly6C-KLRG1-that is lowly proliferative and long-lived could give rise to the adaptive NK cell phenotype. Inclusion of these processes as well as the later time kinetics could be a future extension of our approach. We note a similarity of our three state NK cell maturation model with maturation of T cells in persistent (13-140 days) <italic>T. gondi</italic> infection in genetically resistant mice reported by Robey and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chu et al., 2016</xref>) where the infection gave rise to a continuous production of CXCR3-KLRG1+ terminally differentiated effector T cells from a quiescent memory CXCR3+KLRG1-T cells via an intermediate CXCR3+KLRG1+ state. The intermediate T cell state showed higher proliferation and increased death compared to the memory and effector T cells. However, these T cells were uniformly CD62L-in contrast to the memory and effector T cells that are produced in response to acute antigenic SIINFEKL infection.</p>

<caption><title>Proposed mechanism of NK clonal expansion in response to MCMV infection.</title>
<p>Three distinct subsets of NK cells are necessary to generate full NK response to infection. The first is CD27+, Ly6C-, and moderately proliferative, with a doubling time of ~0.3 days and negligible cell death. The second is CD27-, Ly6C-, and highly proliferative, with a doubling time of ~0.2 days. The last is CD27-, Ly6C-, and prone to rapid cell death with a half-life of ~0.45 days. This picture paints CD27-Ly6C-NK cells as having a highly proliferative and highly effective phenotype, similar to effector CD8+ T cells, and CD27+Ly6C-cells as long-lived, similar to memory precursor CD8+ T cells.</p></caption>

<p>NK cell clones in MCMV infection go through a smaller (~1000×) fold increase in the expansion phase compared that (~40,000×) of antigen-specific expansion of CD8+ T cells. This could be because CD8+ T cells can generate autocrine cytokines such as IL-2 that help the cells to proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kalia and Sarkar, 2018</xref>), whereas NK cells rely on other cells to make the necessary cytokines for proliferation (such as IL-2 and IL-15) and survival (such IL-21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fauriat et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, NK cells are more dependent on cytokines such as IL-15 compared to the CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">DeGottardi et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, cytokine competition for IL-15 and IL-2 might also explain increased death of mature NK cells in the expansion phase. A test of this hypothesis could be investigation of MCMV-induced NK cell maturation in <italic>Il15+/-</italic> mice.</p>
<p>We quantified the population kinetics of antigen-specific Ly49H+ NK cells during the expansion phase of MCMV infection (&lt;8 days post-infection) using both endogenous and adoptively transferred NK cells. This antigen-specific response was further compared with the kinetics of NK cell maturation in the absence of MCMV infection. Adoptively transferred Ly49H+ NK cells grow at an increased rate compared to the endogenous Ly49H+ NK cells (~3× faster for Ly6C-cells). A possible explanation of this phenomenon is the stronger competition for resources (e.g. antigens and/or cytokines) that would occur in endogenous NK cells could prevent them from growing as quickly as the less dense population of adoptively transferred NK cells. Interestingly, our estimate of the differentiation rate of the immature CD27+ to mature CD27-NK cells showed negligible effect of MCMV infection on this process. This shows that the signaling processes governing NK cell antigen-specific expansion and cytotoxicity are not impacting transcription and translation of CD27, but rather preferential expansion of certain subsets is creating altered phenotype abundances observed in MCMV infection.</p>
<p>Our stochastic modeling of heterogeneous NK cell clones showed that larger stochastic variations in the mature NK cell populations arising due to higher intrinsic noise fluctuations generated by the interplay between the higher proliferation and cell death processes are important for producing large clones of mature NK cells at 8 days post-infection. This is in contrast with stochastic kinetics of CD8+ T cells where the larger clones of effector CD62L-CD8+ T cells can arise due to a higher rate of proliferation of these cells even in the absence of any cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buchholz et al., 2013</xref>). Our effort to use different models to quantitatively describe the heterogeneity of NK cell clones demonstrate the critical role of the correlation between the clone size and the proportion of the mature NK cells in the clones, <italic>C</italic><sub>size-CD27+</sub>, in screening out mechanisms that are unable to give rise to the observed heterogeneity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wethington et al. investigated the mechanistic principles underlying antigen-specific proliferation and memory formation in mouse natural killer (NK) cells following exposure to mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV), a phenomenon predominantly associated with CD8+ T cells. Using a rigorous stochastic modeling approach, the authors aimed to develop a quantitative model of NK cell clonal dynamics during MCMV infection.</p>
<p>Initially, they proposed a two-state linear model to explain the composition of NK cell clones originating from a single immature Ly49+CD27+ NK cell at 8 days post-infection (dpi). Through stochastic simulations and analytical investigations, they demonstrated that a variant of the two-state model incorporating NK cell death could explain the observed negative correlation between NK clone sizes at 8 dpi and the percentage of immature (CD27+) NK cells (Page 8, Figure 1e, Supplementary Text 1). However, this two-state model failed to accurately reproduce the first (mean) and second (variance and covariance) moments of the measured CD27+ and CD27- NK cell populations within clones at 8 dpi (Figure 1g).</p>
<p>To address this limitation, the authors increased the model's complexity by introducing an intermediate maturation state, resulting in a three-stage model with the transition scheme: CD27+Ly6C- → CD27-Ly6C- → CD27-Ly6C+. This three-stage model quantitatively fits the first and second moments under two key constraints: (i) immature CD27+ NK cells exhibit faster proliferation than CD27- NK cells, and (ii) there is a negative correlation (upper bound: -0.2) between clone size and the fraction of CD27+ cells. The model predicted a high proliferation rate for the intermediate stage and a high death rate for the mature CD27-Ly6C+ cells.</p>
<p>Using NK cell reporter mice data from Adams et al. (2021), which tracked CD27+/- cell population dynamics following tamoxifen treatment, the authors validated the three-stage model. This dataset allowed discrimination between NK cells originating from the bone marrow and those pre-existing in peripheral blood at the onset of infection. To test the prediction that mature CD27- NK cells have a higher death rate, the authors measured Ly49H+ NK cell viability in the mice spleen at different time points post-MCMV infection. Experimental data confirmed that mature (CD27-) NK cells exhibited lower viability compared to immature (CD27+) NK cells during the expansion phase (days 4-8 post-infection).</p>
<p>Further mathematical analyses using a variant of the three-stage model supported the hypothesis that the higher death rate of mature CD27- cells contributes to a larger proportion of CD27- cells in the dead cell compartment, as introduced in the new variant model.</p>
<p>Altogether, the authors proposed a three-stage quantitative model of antigen-specific expansion and maturation of naïve Ly49H+ NK cells in mice. This model delineates a maturation trajectory: (i) CD27+Ly6C- (immature) → (ii) CD27-Ly6C- (mature I) → (iii) CD27-Ly6C+ (mature II). The findings highlight the highly proliferative nature of the mature I (CD27-Ly6C-) phenotype and the increased cell death rate characteristic of the mature II (CD27-Ly6C+) phenotype.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>By designing models capable of explaining correlations, first and second moments, and employing analytical investigations, stochastic simulations, and model selection, the authors identified the key processes underlying antigen-specific expansion and maturation of NK cells. This model distinguishes the processes of antigen-specific expansion, contraction, and memory formation in NK cells from those observed in CD8+ T cells. Understanding these differences is crucial not only for elucidating the distinct biology of NK cells compared to CD8+ T cells but also for advancing the development of NK cell therapies currently under investigation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are largely supported by the available data. However, a comparative analysis of model predictions with more recent works in the field would be desirable. Moreover, certain aspects of the simulations, parameter inference, and modeling require further clarification and expansion, as outlined below:</p>
<p>(1) Initial Conditions and Grassmann Data: The Grassmann data is used solely as a constraint, while the simulated values of CD27+/CD27- cells could have been directly fitted to the Grassmann data, which assumes a 1:1 ratio of CD27+/CD27- at t = 0. This approach would allow for an alternative initial condition rather than starting from a single CD27+ cell, potentially improving model applicability.</p>
<p>(2) Correlation Coefficients in the Three-State Model: Although the parameter scan of the three-state model (Figure 2) demonstrates the potential for achieving negative correlations between colony size and the fraction of CD27+ cells, the authors did not present the calculated correlation coefficients using the estimated parameter values from fitting the three-state model to the data. Including these simulations would provide additional insight into the parameter space that supports negative correlations and further validate the model.</p>
<p>(3) Viability Dynamics and Adaptive Response: The authors measured the time evolution of CD27+/- dynamics and viability over 30 days post-infection (Figure 4). It would be valuable to test whether the three-state model can reproduce the adaptive response of CD27- cells to MCMV infection, particularly the observed drop in CD27- viability at 5 dpi (prior to the 8 dpi used in the study) and its subsequent rebound at 8 dpi. Reproducing this aspect of the experiment is critical to determine whether the model can simultaneously explain viability dynamics and moment dynamics. Furthermore, this analysis could enable sensitivity analysis of CD27- viability with respect to various model parameters.</p>

<p>Wethington et al. investigated the mechanistic principles underlying antigen-specific proliferation and memory formation in mouse natural killer (NK) cells following exposure to mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV), a phenomenon predominantly associated with CD8+ T cells. Using a rigorous stochastic modeling approach, the authors aimed to develop a quantitative model of NK cell clonal dynamics during MCMV infection.</p>
<p>Initially, they proposed a two-state linear model to explain the composition of NK cell clones originating from a single immature Ly49+CD27+ NK cell at 8 days post-infection (dpi). Through stochastic simulations and analytical investigations, they demonstrated that a variant of the two-state model incorporating NK cell death could explain the observed negative correlation between NK clone sizes at 8 dpi and the percentage of immature (CD27+) NK cells (Page 8, Figure 1e, Supplementary Text 1). However, this two-state model failed to accurately reproduce the first (mean) and second (variance and covariance) moments of the measured CD27+ and CD27- NK cell populations within clones at 8 dpi (Figure 1g).</p>
<p>To address this limitation, the authors increased the model's complexity by introducing an intermediate maturation state, resulting in a three-stage model with the transition scheme: CD27+Ly6C- → CD27-Ly6C- → CD27-Ly6C+. This three-stage model quantitatively fits the first and second moments under two key constraints: (i) immature CD27+ NK cells exhibit faster proliferation than CD27- NK cells, and (ii) there is a negative correlation (upper bound: -0.2) between clone size and the fraction of CD27+ cells. The model predicted a high proliferation rate for the intermediate stage and a high death rate for the mature CD27-Ly6C+ cells.</p>
<p>Using NK cell reporter mice data from Adams et al. (2021), which tracked CD27+/- cell population dynamics following tamoxifen treatment, the authors validated the three-stage model. This dataset allowed discrimination between NK cells originating from the bone marrow and those pre-existing in peripheral blood at the onset of infection. To test the prediction that mature CD27- NK cells have a higher death rate, the authors measured Ly49H+ NK cell viability in the mice spleen at different time points post-MCMV infection. Experimental data confirmed that mature (CD27-) NK cells exhibited lower viability compared to immature (CD27+) NK cells during the expansion phase (days 4-8 post-infection).</p>
<p>Further mathematical analyses using a variant of the three-stage model supported the hypothesis that the higher death rate of mature CD27- cells contributes to a larger proportion of CD27- cells in the dead cell compartment, as introduced in the new variant model.</p>
<p>Altogether, the authors proposed a three-stage quantitative model of antigen-specific expansion and maturation of naïve Ly49H+ NK cells in mice. This model delineates a maturation trajectory: (i) CD27+Ly6C- (immature) → (ii) CD27-Ly6C- (mature I) → (iii) CD27-Ly6C+ (mature II). The findings highlight the highly proliferative nature of the mature I (CD27-Ly6C-) phenotype and the increased cell death rate characteristic of the mature II (CD27-Ly6C+) phenotype.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>By designing models capable of explaining correlations, first and second moments, and employing analytical investigations, stochastic simulations, and model selection, the authors identified the key processes underlying antigen-specific expansion and maturation of NK cells. This model distinguishes the processes of antigen-specific expansion, contraction, and memory formation in NK cells from those observed in CD8+ T cells. Understanding these differences is crucial not only for elucidating the distinct biology of NK cells compared to CD8+ T cells but also for advancing the development of NK cell therapies currently under investigation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are largely supported by the available data. However, a comparative analysis of model predictions with more recent works in the field would be desirable. Moreover, certain aspects of the simulations, parameter inference, and modeling require further clarification and expansion, as outlined below:</p>
<p>(1) Initial Conditions and Grassmann Data: The Grassmann data is used solely as a constraint, while the simulated values of CD27+/CD27- cells could have been directly fitted to the Grassmann data, which assumes a 1:1 ratio of CD27+/CD27- at t = 0. This approach would allow for an alternative initial condition rather than starting from a single CD27+ cell, potentially improving model applicability.</p>

<p>(2) Correlation Coefficients in the Three-State Model: Although the parameter scan of the three-state model (Figure 2) demonstrates the potential for achieving negative correlations between colony size and the fraction of CD27+ cells, the authors did not present the calculated correlation coefficients using the estimated parameter values from fitting the three-state model to the data. Including these simulations would provide additional insight into the parameter space that supports negative correlations and further validate the model.</p>

<p>We will include the above calculation in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(3) Viability Dynamics and Adaptive Response: The authors measured the time evolution of CD27+/- dynamics and viability over 30 days post-infection (Figure 4). It would be valuable to test whether the three-state model can reproduce the adaptive response of CD27- cells to MCMV infection, particularly the observed drop in CD27- viability at 5 dpi (prior to the 8 dpi used in the study) and its subsequent rebound at 8 dpi. Reproducing this aspect of the experiment is critical to determine whether the model can simultaneously explain viability dynamics and moment dynamics. Furthermore, this analysis could enable sensitivity analysis of CD27- viability with respect to various model parameters.</p>
