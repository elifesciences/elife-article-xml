<p><italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection (CDI) is the leading cause of hospital- acquired diarrhea that seriously threatens public health. The disruption of normal gut microbiota by the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents enables <italic>C. difficile</italic> to proliferate in the colon. The emergence and prevalence of hypervirulent <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains result in increased morbidity, mortality, and recurrence rates of CDI, thus creating a pressing need for novel therapeutics. The multi-domain toxins TcdA and TcdB are the primary determinants of CDI pathogenesis, rendering them ideal drug targets in the anti-virulence paradigm. In this study, we identified caffeic acid and its derivatives as active inhibitors of TcdB via a cell-based high-throughput phenotypic screening. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) could directly bind to TcdB, thus suppressing InsP6-induced autoproteolysis and inhibiting glucosyltransferase activity. CAPE treatment remarkably reduces the pathology of CDI in a murine infection model in terms of alleviated diarrhea symptoms, decreased bacterial colonization, and relieved histopathological lesions. Moreover, CAPE treatment of C. difficile-challenged mice induces a remarkable increase in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota (e.g., <italic>Bacteroides</italic>) and alterations of gut metabolites (e.g., adenosine, D-proline, and melatonin), which might partially contribute to the therapeutic outcomes of CAPE against CDI. Our results reveal the potential of CAPE as a therapeutic for the management of CDI, or CAPE might serve as a lead compound for the development of antivirulence drugs targeting TcdB.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> (<italic>C. difficile</italic>) is an obligate anaerobic, spore-forming, gram-positive bacterial pathogen that is the most common cause of hospital- acquired and antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal diseases, including mild diarrhea and life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In the United States, <italic>C. difficile</italic> is responsible for almost half a million infections and approximately 29,000 deaths per year, resulting in an estimated annual healthcare-associated cost of up to $4.8 billion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Importantly, the incidence, severity, mortality and healthcare costs of <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection (CDI) have dramatically increased in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, at least partially owing to the frequent use of antimicrobial agents and the emergence of hypervirulent strains (e.g., PCR ribotypes 027 and 078) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Limited options are available for the treatment of CDI, while antibiotics including metronidazole, fidaxomicin and vancomycin, are the mainstays of clinical practice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. However, antibiotic treatment is ineffective in more than 35% of CDI patients and can lead infection recurrence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, the rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance in <italic>C. difficile</italic> has further compromised the therapeutic efficacy of current treatment options <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, the high morbidity and mortality, high recurrence rates, and emergence of multiple antibiotic-resistant isolates have made this pathogen a major threat to public health; these factors highlight the urgent need for novel therapies.</p>
<p><italic>C. difficile</italic> widely exists in the environment and in the intestinal tract of humans and animals and is mainly transmitted via the fecal-oral route <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The pathogenesis of CDI is correlated with the use of antibiotics, which impair the structure and composition of the normal gut microbiota, thus allowing <italic>C. difficile</italic> to proliferate in the colon <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, previous antibiotic therapy is the major risk factor for the development of CDI. In the colon, the dormant spores of <italic>C. difficile</italic> germinate into oxygen-sensitive vegetative cells that produce toxins and cause symptoms of disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. <italic>C. difficile</italic> secretes two large clostridial exotoxins (TcdA and TcdB), which are directly responsible for the clinical pathology of CDI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Epidemiological studies suggest that most disease- causing <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains have genes that encode TcdB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. TcdA and TcdB have identical functional domains: a N-terminal glucosyltransferase catalytic domain (GTD), a cysteine protease active domain (CPD), a transmembrane domain (DRBD), and a C-terminal receptor binding domain (CROPs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. When secreted into the colon, both toxins are internalized by host cells through receptor-mediated, clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Following a decrease in endosomal pH, the toxins undergo conformational changes in the DRBD, resulting in insertion of the toxin into the endosome membrane, pore formation, and the release of the GTD and CPD domains into the cytosol. Then, CPD binding with cytosolic inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP<sub>6</sub>) activates its protease activity, leading to the cleavage and release of the GTD. Eventually, the GTD utilizes UDP-glucose to glucosylate Rho and/or Ras family GTPases, thus disrupting GTPase signaling and resulting in deleterious effects, including cytopathic “rounding”, dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton, apoptosis, and pyroptosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Although both toxins are cytotoxic to host cells, TcdB shows greater toxicity than TcdA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Disruption of the gut microbiota by antimicrobial agents results in high recurrence rates, which limits the application of antimicrobial therapy for CDI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop nonantibiotic treatments for CDI, either as standalone or augmented therapies. Importantly, strategies targeting bacterial virulence factors, including toxins, are termed anti-virulence strategies and have attracted interest in the 21<sup>st</sup> century <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Owing to its essential role in <italic>C. difficile</italic> pathogenesis, TcdB has become an ideal target for the development of anti-virulence drugs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In this study, caffeic acid and a series of its derivatives were found to inhibit TcdB-mediated cell rounding via cell-based screening. Among these potential inhibitors, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) had the greatest inhibitory effect. Mechanistically, CAPE bound to both full-length TcdB and the GTD fragment, leading to alterations in the secondary structure. This interaction suppressed the InsP<sub>6</sub>-mediated self- cleavage of TcdB, as well as the enzymatic activity of GTD, thereby decreasing the level of glucosylated Rac1 in TcdB-treated host cells and further inhibiting the cytopathology and cytotoxicity of TcdB. Oral administration of CAPE significantly protected against CDI in models of animal infection. In addition to direct toxin inhibition, the therapeutic effect may also be attributed to CAPE- induced alteration of the gut microbiota (e.g., <italic>Bacteroides</italic>) as well as gut metabolites (e.g., adenosine, D-proline, and melatonin). Overall, our study revealed that caffeic acid and its derivatives, particularly CAPE, may serve as promising lead compounds for the development of anti-virulence drugs to treat CDI.</p>

<title>CAPE inhibits cell rounding induced by TcdB</title>
<p>TcdB can inactivate Rho GTPases via glucosylation, leading to the loss of cytoskeletal structure and cell-rounding. Consequently, we utilized this phenotype to identify potential TcdB inhibitors from 2076 chemicals, including 1515 FDA-approved drugs and 561 natural compounds. The minimal concentration of recombinant His6-TcdB (0.2 ng/mL) that induced 100% cell rounding within 1 h was used for drug screening. This concentration of TcdB was preincubated with 8 μg/mL of the individual compounds for 1 h before the compounds were added to Vero cell cultures. At 1 h post-TcdB treatment, cell morphology was visualized under a light microscope (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). These analyses allowed us to identify 22 candidate compounds with potent inhibitory effects (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, six out of the 22 compounds were caffeic acid derivatives. Caffeic acid itself only slightly inhibited TcdB-induced cell rounding, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 527.5 μg/mL (Table S1). Notably, except for rosmarinic acid, the IC<sub>50</sub> values for the other screened caffeic acid derivatives were less than 6 μg/mL, suggesting that these compounds potently inhibited TcdB-mediated toxicity (Table S1). CAPE is the phenethyl alcohol ester of caffeic acid and a main active component of propolis with broad pharmacological properties, such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory activities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. As CAPE has the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> (3.0 μg/mL) among the active caffeic acid derivatives, it was selected as the representative compound for subsequent investigations (Table S1). After preincubation with increasing concentrations of CAPE, dose- dependent inhibition of cell rounding was observed in both Vero and HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, we also determined whether inhibition of TcdB by CAPE could lead to loss of toxin function <italic>in vivo</italic> using a murine systemic intoxication model. A lethal dose of recombinant His<sub>6</sub>-TcdB (30 ng) was preincubated with either DMSO or CAPE (2 or 4 μg/mL) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by intraperitoneal injection into mice. Notably, all mice in the DMSO group (n=10) died within 36 h after toxin injection. However, 100% of mice pretreated with CAPE 4 (μg/mL) toxin survived at the monitoring endpoint (72 h) (n=10) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that CAPE is a potent toxin inhibitor of TcdB.</p>

<title>CAPE decreases InsP<sub>6</sub>-induced autoproteolysis of TcdB and inhibits the enzymatic activity of GTD</title>
<p>TcdB is a multi-domain containing toxin that induces toxicity in host cells via an intricate and multistep mechanism. This mechanism involves (i) receptor- mediated endocytosis, (ii) pore formation and subsequent membrane translocation, (iii) autoproteolysis and release of GTD, and (iv) the glucosylation of small GTPases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). To determine the mechanism by which CAPE suppresses the cytotoxicity of TcdB, we first labeled full-length TcdB with Alexa Fluor 488; then, the concentration of the endocytosed toxin was determined via flow cytometry. Apparently, incubation of CAPE with TcdB did not significantly affect its entry into host cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Next, we stained CAPE-treated cells with LysoTracker, a fluorescent dye that accumulates in the acidic organelles of live cells. In contrast to the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1), CAPE treatment did not alter the intensity of LysoTracker fluorescence staining in either THP-1 or Caco-2 cells, suggesting that inactivation of TcdB by CAPE is not due to changes in the pH of endosomal compartments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref> and Figure S1A-B).</p>

<p>These observations indicate that CAPE might exert its effects after membrane translocation. Indeed, preincubation of full-length TcdB with CAPE blocked the InsP6-induced autoproteolysis of TcdB, as revealed by the gradual decrease in the production of released GTP, followed by the addition of increasing amounts of CAPE <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-F</xref>). Furthermore, we determined the glucosyltransferase activity using recombinant GTD in the absence or presence of different doses of CAPE. Strikingly, incubation with 2 μg/mL CAPE resulted in a significant reduction in GTD activity, whereas 32 μg/mL CAPE compromised 87.5% of the enzymatic activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Importantly, in response to suppression of InsP<sub>6</sub>-induced autoproteolysis and GTD function, treatment of TcdB-challenged cells with CAPE markedly decreased the level of glucosylated Rac1 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H-I</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that CAPE disrupts InsP<sub>6</sub>-induced autoproteolysis of TcdB and inhibits the enzymatic activity of GTD, thereby decreasing the glucosylation of Rac1 and alleviating cell rounding.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>CAPE alters the secondary structure of full-length TcdB and GTD</title>
<p>To further clarify the mechanisms used by CAPE to inactivate TcdB, we determined the secondary structures of full-length TcdB and GTD in the absence or presence of CAPE by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Apparently, incubation of CAPE with full-length TcdB resulted in a significant increase in the α-helix content (15.4% to 21.0%) and a concomitant decrease in the β-pleated sheet content (34.5% to 20.9%) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>). Similarly, the secondary structure of GTD was markedly altered upon incubation with CAPE, with the proportion of α-helices decreasing from 37.9% to 0.0% and the proportion of β- pleated sheets decreasing from 37.2% to 10.9% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-D</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that CAPE may interact with full-length TcdB and GTD to induce conformational changes, thus impairing their functions.</p>

<title>CAPE directly interacts with full-length TcdB and GTD</title>
<p>To investigate the potential interaction between CAPE and TcdB or GTD, the binding constants were determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. The results showed that CAPE has strong binding affinity with full- length TcdB and GTD, and the KD values were 1.269×10<sup>-5</sup> M and 1.007×10<sup>-3</sup> M, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-B</xref>).

<p>Next, we performed molecular docking and molecular simulation dynamics analyses to investigate the interaction between CAPE and GTD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The results revealed that Leu265, Asp286, Thr465, Ile466, Leu519, and Trp520 in GTD were potential binding sites for CAPE (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the GTD/CAPE complex was stable over a 100 ns period of simulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Further energy decomposition analysis showed that the side chains of Leu265, Thr465, Leu519, and Trp520 of GTD contributed to binding with CAPE via van der Waals interactions, among which Trp520 had the highest binding energy (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, we mutated each of the residues that were involved in binding and subsequently determined their glucosyltransferase activities in the presence or absence of CAPE. The enzymatic activities of these mutants were similar to that of wild-type GTD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Mutations in GTD<sub>L265A</sub>, GTD<sub>T465A</sub>, GTD<sub>I466A</sub>, and GTD<sub>L519A</sub> did not affect the inhibitory effect of CAPE (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E-I</xref>).

<title>CAPE treatment reduces the pathology of CDI in a murine model</title>
<p>The abovementioned observation that CAPE suppresses the function of TcdB prompted us to further evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of this compound in CDI. To this end, we employed a well-established murine model in which infected mice can develop symptoms resembling those observed in human CDIs (25). First, cytotoxicity measurements revealed that the viability of both THP-1 and Vero cells was not affected by CAPE treatment (Figure S2A- B), thus indicating low toxicity. Mice were preconditioned with drinking water containing 0.5 g/L cefoperazone for 5 days, followed by normal drinking water for 2 days. After challenge with <italic>C. difficile</italic> BAA-1870 via gavage, mice were then treated daily with either vehicle or 30 mg/kg CAPE by gavage throughout the disease course (day 0 to day 5) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Severe weight loss in <italic>C. difficile</italic>-infected mice was observed on days 2 and 3 post infection and was accompanied by diarrhea (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Notably, compared to the infection control group, CAPE treatment significantly increased the dry/wet weight ratio of the mouse feces, suggesting the alleviation of diarrhea symptoms (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Correspondingly, the weight loss of mice was relieved upon receiving CAPE (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Moreover, fecal pellets collected on day 3 were used to determine the bacterial burden. The results revealed that CAPE treatment significantly decreased the number of <italic>C. difficile</italic> CFUs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). On day 3 post-<italic>C. difficile</italic> infection, the colon was collected for histopathological analysis. Remarkably, <italic>C. difficile-</italic>infected mice exhibited conspicuous colon edema, epithelial cell injury and inflammatory factor infiltration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). In contrast, these histopathological lesions were significantly less common in mice administered CAPE (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>).

<title>CAPE induces distinct microbiota changes in CAPE mice when compared with model mice</title>
<p>Antibiotic-induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota promotes the development of CDI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, we next determined whether CAPE has any impact on gut microbial communities that may contribute to its therapeutic efficacy. To this end, on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day after <italic>C. difficile</italic> challenge, fecal samples from the model group and CAPE treatment group were collected and subjected to microbiota analysis via 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

In addition, both the α- and β-diversity of the gut microbiota in CAPE-treated mice were significantly greater than those in model mice.

<p>A comparative analysis was performed to examine changes at the phylum level following CAPE treatment. <italic>Bacteroidota</italic>, <italic>Firmicutes,</italic> and <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> were the major constituents in both the CAPE treatment and model groups, suggesting that the administration of CAPE did not significantly alter the mouse microbiota at the phylum level (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>).

<title>CAPE alters the levels of gut metabolites in <italic>C. difficile</italic>-infected mice</title>
<p>In addition to the crucial role of the gut microbiota in conferring colonization resistance against <italic>C. difficile</italic>, gut microbiota-derived metabolites significantly contribute to the disease process <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Metabolomic analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of CAPE treatment on gut metabolites in mice. The PLS- DA model exhibited significant separation of clusters between the model and CAPE treatment groups (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). Among the 1599 metabolites, 109 showed substantial differences in levels between the two groups. Specifically, CAPE-treated mice exhibited 19 metabolites with upregulated expression and 50 metabolites with downregulated expression compared to those in the model group (fold change &gt; 1.5) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). Furthermore, KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the differentially abundant metabolites were significantly enriched in the purine metabolism and bile secretion pathways (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that binds to specific cell surface receptors to exert anti-inflammatory effects at high concentrations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Importantly, CAPE treatment of <italic>C. difficile</italic>-infected mice can increase the adenosine concentration in the gut (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>), which might be attributed to its inhibition of xanthine oxidase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Similarly, the levels of uric acid, the final product of purine metabolism, were markedly decreased in mice after receiving CAPE (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). An earlier study reported that increasing the gut adenosine concentration with an adenosine deaminase inhibitor prevents <italic>C. difficile</italic> toxin A-induced enteritis in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.

<p><italic>C. difficile</italic> predominantly utilizes sugars and amino acids for energy production through various metabolic pathways, such as fermentation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.

<title>Oral administration of melatonin alleviates the symptoms of CDI</title>
<p>Next, we investigated whether any of the upregulated metabolites had a direct influence on TcdB.

Interestingly, treatment with TcdB and 100 μg/mL melatonin significantly alleviated the cell death induced by this toxin (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>C. difficile</italic> has become the prevalent agent of nosocomial diarrhea and substantially threatens public health. In particular, the increase in morbidity and mortality caused by the prevalence of hypervirulent and drug-resistant strains has become a global concern <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In 2019, <italic>C. difficile</italic> was listed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as an “urgent threat” that surpassed methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) and ESBL-producing <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. <italic>C. difficile</italic> is a commensal bacterium that colonizes the lower gastrointestinal tract <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. CDI typically occurs in susceptible individuals whose normal gut microbiota is disrupted by the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Although CDI is considered an antibiotic-associated disease, the current treatment for CDI still relies on antimicrobial drugs, including metronidazole, fidaxomicin and vancomycin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Despite antibiotic therapy, more than 35% of CDI patients are susceptible to recurrent infection, which is primarily attributable to the intrinsic effects of antimicrobial agents, which disrupt the microbiota <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In addition, long-term administration of antibiotics promotes the selection of antibiotic-resistant subpopulations in the gut, thus increasing the risk of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant and opportunistic bacteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. As a result, the development of nonantibiotic therapeutics is needed for the treatment of CDI.</p>
<p>Indeed, numerous novel treatments for CDI are being investigated, among which the anti-virulence strategy represents one of the most promising and successful therapeutic approaches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Unlike antibiotics, which target bacterial components that are critical for bacterial growth, anti-virulence drugs aim to disarm pathogenic bacteria by neutralizing their virulence factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Therefore, this strategy imposes less selective pressure that directs bacterial evolution of antimicrobial resistance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The disease progression of CDI is strictly dependent on large clostridial toxins (TcdA and TcdB), as strains lacking both toxins (i.e., A<sup>-</sup>B<sup>-</sup>) were completely avirulent and failed to induce any discernable disease symptoms in a hamster model of infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Importantly, epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains with increased morbidity and mortality rates produce greater amounts of toxins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Based on these premises, TcdA and TcdB are considered ideal drug targets for CDI in the anti-virulence paradigm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Indeed, bezlotoxumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that neutralizes TcdB, was recently approved by the FDA and used in CDI patients to reduce the rate of recurrence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. This achievement has encouraged researchers to develop next-generation anti-virulence treatments. In particular, small molecule inhibitors of toxin production and/or activity have attracted increasing interest owing to their advantages in cost and the convenience of oral administration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. The multidomain architecture and mechanisms of action of clostridial toxins have provided distinct options for blocking their toxicity. Indeed, previous efforts have identified diverse inhibitors that act on distinct steps of intoxication, such as the inhibition of toxin binding to cell receptors, the suppression of endosomal maturation, and the inactivation of GTD or CPD activities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Although which approach is the best remains unknown, we believe that an inhibitor that targets multiple steps of intoxication would be superior to those that act on a single step. In this study, we identified a series of caffeic acid derivatives that were potent inhibitors of TcdB via a phenotypic screen. Further mechanistic study revealed that CAPE, the phenethyl alcohol ester of caffeic acid, could block InsP<sub>6</sub>-induced autoproteolysis of TcdB and inactivate its GTD function (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>). Moreover, CAPE treatment significantly protected against CDI in a mouse model of infection. Our results suggested that caffeic acid derivatives, particularly CAPE, are promising lead compounds for the development of anti- virulence drugs that target TcdB. CAPE is a major component of propolis, a natural bee-produced substance that has been used as a remedy for thousands of years in Europe and Asia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. As a result, further investigations on the therapeutic potential of propolis against CDI, either in combination with standard therapy or as a single therapy, would be of great interest.</p>

<p>Antibiotic-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis is a major risk factor for CDI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Thus, reconstituting the gut microbiota is a promising strategy for CDI therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is considered an effective CDI therapeutic strategy and is widely used in clinical practice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Despite the high cure rate and increasing popularity of FMT, its safety remains controversial. Another prominent advantage of anti-virulence drugs is that they allow maintenance of the normal microbiota, which is of critical importance for the treatment of CDI. Importantly, CAPE treatment of <italic>C. difficile</italic>-infected mice restored the structure and composition of the microbiota (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>). In particular, the abundance of <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, a critical gut microbiota component that is required for <italic>C. difficile</italic> resistance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, was significantly elevated upon CAPE treatment. Interestingly, <italic>Bacteroides</italic> were also predominant in CDI patients administered RBX2660 (Rebyota), an FDA-approved fecal microbiota product <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. The increased diversity of the gut microbiota might contribute to the therapeutic effects of CAPE in CDI.</p>
<p>In addition to the microbiota, gut metabolites also play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of CDI, either by promoting or suppressing disease progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. For example, bile acids and amino acids promote spore germination and pathogenesis, while secondary bile acid and short-chain fatty acids aid in colonization resistance and suppress spore germination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. In addition to restoration of the gut microbiota, metabolomics analysis of mouse fecal samples revealed dramatic alterations in gut metabolites upon CAPE treatment (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>). The differentially abundant metabolites were significantly enriched in the purine metabolism and bile metabolism pathways. Remarkably, the level of adenosine, an endogenous purine nucleoside that is released from cells upon injury or inflammation, was dramatically increased in CAPE-treated mice. In contrast, the amount of uric acid, the final product of purine metabolism, was reduced. Previous studies showed that the increase in adenosine concentrations caused by the inhibition of adenosine deaminase via EHNA prevents <italic>C. difficile</italic> TcdA-mediated damage and inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. This protection might be a result of the anti-inflammatory effects of adenosine, which rely on the activation of its receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. In addition, we observed a reduction in the amount of D-proline, which is one of the preferred amino acids utilized by <italic>C. difficile</italic> to generate energy through Stickland reactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Melatonin is a ubiquitous indolamine that has broad biological activities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Notably, we detected a significantly increase in the amount of melatonin in the feces of mice that were administered CAPE. Importantly, an earlier study demonstrated a decreased risk of recurrent CDI in patients exposed to melatonin, possibly owing to its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In this study, we found that oral administration of exogenous melatonin alleviated the symptoms of CDI in a mouse model of infection. Although determining the exact mechanism will require further investigation, we propose that the melatonin- mediated inhibition of TcdB intoxication observed in this study might contribute to its therapeutic effect. Taken together, these results indicate that the alterations in gut metabolites caused by CAPE might also contribute to treatment outcomes for CDI patients.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Guo and colleagues reports <bold>valuable</bold> findings about the inhibitory activity of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) against TcdB, a key toxin produced by Clostridioides difficile. C. difficile infections are a major public health concern, and this manuscript provides interesting data on toxin inhibition by CAPE, a potentially promising therapeutic alternative for this disease. The strength of the evidence to support the conclusions is <bold>solid</bold>, with some concerns about the moderate effects on the mouse infection model and direct binding assays of CAPE to the toxin.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Guo and colleagues used a cell rounding assay to screen a library of compounds for inhibition of TcdB, an important toxin produced by Clostridioides difficile. Caffeic acid and derivatives were identified as promising leads, and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) was further investigated.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Considering the high morbidity rate associated with C. difficile infections (CDI), this manuscript presents valuable research in the investigation of novel therapeutics to combat this pressing issue. Given the rising antibiotic resistance in CDI, the significance of this work is particularly noteworthy. The authors employed a robust set of methods and confirmatory tests, which strengthened the validity of the findings. The explanations provided are clear, and the scientific rationale behind the results is well-articulated. The manuscript is extremely well-written and organized. There is a clear flow in the description of the experiments performed. Also, the authors have investigated the effects of CAPE on TcdB in careful detail and reported compelling evidence that this is a meaningful and potentially useful metabolite for further studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This is really a manuscript about CAPE, not caffeic acid, and the title should reflect that. Also, a few details are missing from the description of the experiments. The authors should carefully revise the manuscript to ascertain that all details that could affect the interpretation of their results are presented clearly. Just as an example, the authors state in the results section that TcdB was incubated with compounds and then added to cells. Was there a wash step in between? Could compound carryover affect how the cells reacted independently from TcdB? This is just an example of how the authors should be careful with descriptions of their experimental procedures. Lastly, authors should be careful when drawing conclusions from the analysis of microbiota composition data. Ascribing causality to correlational relationships is a recurring issue in the microbiome field. Therefore, I suggest authors carefully revise the manuscript and tone down some statements about the impact of CAPE treatment on the gut microbiota.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work is towards the development of nonantibiotic treatment for C. difficile. The authors screened a chemical library for activity against the C. difficile toxin TcdB, and found a group of compounds with antitoxin activity. Caffeic acid derivatives were highly represented within this group of antitoxin compounds, and the remaining portion of this work involves defining the mechanism of action of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and testing CAPE in mouse C. difficile infection model. The authors conclude CAPE attenuates C. difficile disease by limiting toxin activity and increasing microbial diversity during C. difficile infection.</p>
<p>Strengths/ Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The strategy employed by the authors is sound although not necessarily novel. A compound that can target multiple steps in the pathogenies of C. difficile would be an exciting finding. However, the data presented does not convincingly demonstrate that CAPE attenuates C. difficile disease and the mechanism of action of CAPE is not convincingly defined. The following points highlight the rationale for my evaluation.</p>
<p>(1) The toxin exposure in tissue culture seems brief (Figure 1). Do longer incubation times between the toxin and cells still show CAPE prevents toxin activity?</p>
<p>(2) The conclusion that CAPE has antitoxin activity during infection would be strengthened if the mouse was pretreated with CAPE before toxin injections (Figure 1D).</p>
<p>(3) CAPE does not bind to TcdB with high affinity as shown by SPR (Figure 4). A higher affinity may be necessary to inhibit TcdB during infection. The GTD binds with millimolar affinity and does not show saturable binding. Is the GTD the binding site for CAPE? Autoprocessing is also affected by CAPE indicating CAPE is binding non-GTD sites on TcdB.</p>
<p>(4) In the infection model, CAPE does not statistically significantly attenuate weight loss during C. difficile infection (Figure 6). I recognize that weight loss is an indirect measure of C. difficile disease but histopathology also does not show substantial disease alleviation (see below).</p>
<p>(5) In the infection model (Figure 6), the histopathology analysis shows substantial improvement in edema but limited improvement in cellular infiltration and epithelial damage. Histopathology is probably the most critical parameter in this model and a compound with disease-modifying effects should provide substantial improvements.</p>
<p>(6) The reduction in C. difficile colonization is interesting. It is unclear if this is due to antitoxin activity and/or due to CAPE modifying the gut microbiota and metabolites (Figure 6). To interpret these data, a control is needed that has CAPE treatment without C. difficile infection or infection with an atoxicogenic strain.</p>
<p>(7) Similar to the CAPE data, the melatonin data does not display potent antitoxin activity and the mouse model experiment shows marginal improvement in the histopathological analysis (Figure 9). Using 100 µg/ml of melatonin (~ 400 micromolar) to inactivate TcdB in cell culture seems high. Can that level be achieved in the gut?</p>
<p>(8) The following parameters should be considered and would aid in the interpretation of this work. Does CAPE directly affect the growth of C. difficile? Does CAPE affect the secretion of TcdB from C. difficile? Does CAPE alter the sporulation and germination of C. diffcile?</p>
