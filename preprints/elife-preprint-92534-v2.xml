<title>Abstract</title><p>The microbiota is a key determinant of the physiology and immunity of animal hosts. The factors governing the transmissibility of viruses between susceptible hosts are incompletely understood. Bacteria serve as food for <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and represent an integral part of the natural environment of <italic>C. elegans.</italic> We determined the effects of bacteria isolated with <italic>C. elegans</italic> from its natural environment on the transmission of Orsay virus in <italic>C. elegans</italic> using quantitative virus transmission and host susceptibility assays. We observed that <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> species promoted Orsay virus transmission, whereas <italic>Pseudomonas lurida</italic> MYb11 attenuated virus transmission relative to the standard laboratory bacterial food <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> OP50. We found that pathogenic <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> strains PA01 and PA14 further attenuated virus transmission. We determined that the amount of Orsay virus required to infect 50% of a <italic>C. elegans</italic> population on <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 compared with <italic>Ochrobactrum vermis</italic> MYb71 was dramatically increased, over three orders of magnitude. Host susceptibility was attenuated even further in presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14. Genetic analysis of the determinants of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> required for attenuation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> susceptibility to Orsay virus infection revealed a role for regulators of quorum sensing. Our data suggest that distinct constituents of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> microbiota and potential pathogens can have widely divergent effects on Orsay virus transmission, such that associated bacteria can effectively determine host susceptibility versus resistance to viral infection. Our study provides quantitative evidence for a critical role for tripartite host-virus-bacteria interactions in determining the transmissibility of viruses among susceptible hosts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Viruses are ubiquitous and abundant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Infection can have profound consequences for the health of an individual host. The ability of viruses to transmit from one individual to another can scale these consequences causing morbidity and mortality throughout whole populations. Many factors influence virus transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Abiotic factors such as temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and humidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> and biotic factors such as viral load<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> and host immune status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> all interact to determine transmission rates. Despite these findings, the determinants of virus transmissibility remain incompletely understood.</p>
<p>The microbiota has emerged as a host-associated factor that modulates multiple aspects of virus infection and thereby alters transmission rates among host organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In general, the microbiota is critical for the proper development of the immune system and for the effective activation of antimicrobial immune responses even at sites distal to microbiota colonization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. More specifically, bacteria and bacterial surface structures such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan have been shown to stabilize poliovirus and reovirus <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. These observations likely explain why microbiota depletion by antibiotic treatment was sufficient to provide protection against the same viruses in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. The bacterial symbiont <italic>Wolbachia</italic> protects numerous insect species from multiple viruses either by upregulating antiviral defenses or competing for intracellular nutrients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Individual bacteria have also been found to enhance viral infection; <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> promoted infection of the mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> by Dengue, Zika, and Sindbis viruses by secreting a protein, enhancin, that degrades the mucus layer covering epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is a nematode often found in microbially rich environments such as rotting vegetation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The first naturally occurring virus capable of infecting the <italic>C. elegans</italic> was isolated from Orsay, France<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Orsay virus is a part of a group of nematode infecting viruses closely related to the <italic>Nodaviridae</italic> family of viruses which infect arthropods and fish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Like other Nodaviruses, Orsay virus is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a bipartite genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Transmission of Orsay virus occurs horizontally through the fecal-oral route. Fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and immunofluorescence imaging has revealed that Orsay virus solely infects <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Viral infection activates host defense mechanisms including the RNA-interference response and a transcriptional program known as the intracellular pathogen response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><italic>C. elegans</italic> is a bacterivore and is propagated in the laboratory on lawns of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> OP50. <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> an opportunistic pathogen of humans, is found in the soil and water and can also infect <italic>C. elegans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Infection of <italic>C. elegans</italic> with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> activates innate immunity and stress responses, as well as behavioral avoidance responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Recently, the bacteria resident in the natural environment of <italic>C. elegans</italic> in the wild have been of increasing interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. The intestinal lumen of free-dwelling <italic>C. elegans</italic> is occupied by taxonomically and functionally diverse bacteria that can affect <italic>C. elegans</italic> fitness and physiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we sought to understand how bacteria that are constituents of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> microbiota quantitatively affect the transmission of Orsay virus in <italic>C. elegans.</italic> We observed that monoaxenic cultures of different bacterial species had widely divergent effects on the transmission of Orsay virus and conducted genetic analysis of the bacterial determinants involved in modulating virus transmission. Our data point to a key species-specific role for bacteria as critical determinant of virus transmission.</p>

<title>Wide variation in the effects of bacteria on the transmission of Orsay virus</title>
<p>Orsay virus spreads horizontally through the fecal-oral route and transmission can spread from a single animal to a population of animals on a plate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. We sought to assess the impact of bacteria on Orsay virus transmission rates and utilized a collection of bacteria isolated from the environment with wild <italic>C. elegans</italic> to assemble a panel of Gram-negative bacteria for comparison with the standard laboratory bacterial food, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> OP50<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. All animals were raised to young adulthood on lawns of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 to eliminate differences in developmental rates caused by different bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. We set up a transmission assay by placing infected animals (“spreaders”) together with uninfected animals on a monoaxenic lawn of each test bacterium. We quantified the incidence proportion, defined as the number of new infections produced after 24 h as determined by detection of induction of the <italic>pals-5p::GFP</italic> reporter, which is induced by infection with Orsay virus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. We observed a wide range in the measured incidence proportion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Exposure to many of the naturally associated bacterial strains resulted in transmission that was comparable to the incidence proportion observed with <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 with some prominent exceptions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Two <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> species promoted virus infection in nearly all individuals in the transmission assay and increased the incidence proportion 2.7-fold and 2.9-fold compared to <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). We confirmed that transmission from the initial spreader animals in the assay, and not multiple rounds of infection, was responsible for the increased incidence proportion observed in the presence of <italic>Ochrobactrum vermis</italic> MYb71 (Supp. Fig. 1A-D). On the other hand, the presence of <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 reduced the incidence proportion 4.1-fold compared to <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 and 11-fold compared to <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B and C</xref>). These results present a striking divergence in the effects of individual bacterial constituents of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> microbiota on the level of transmission of Orsay virus from infected animals.</p>

<p>We reasoned that increased transmission of Orsay virus could be due to bacterial modulation of host susceptibility to viral infection. To quantify the degree of host susceptibility to Orsay virus we added Orsay virus in doses that ranged across four orders of magnitude and then measured the fraction of individuals that became <italic>pals-5p::GFP</italic> positive after 24 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>, Supp. Fig. 2 and Supp. Fig. 3). We also specifically calculated the ID<sub>50</sub>, or the dose of Orsay virus required to infect 50% of the population after 24 h of exposure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>, Supp. Fig 2). On average, 3.6 μL of Orsay virus stock prepared as indicated in the Methods was required to infect 50% of a population of ZD2611 animals in the presence of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 after 24 hours (Supp. Fig. 2). We observed variability in the measured ID<sub>50</sub> even when using the same batch of Orsay virus (e.g. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> vs Supp. Fig. 3A vs. Supp. Fig. 3B). We therefore chose to control all our experiments internally rather than attempt to normalize between Orsay virus batches and we report doses used in arbitrary units (a.u.), however 1 a.u. corresponds to 1 μL of Orsay virus filtrate (Methods).</p>
<p>To determine quantitatively how different bacterial species modulate host susceptibility to viral infection independently of the potential differential effects of bacteria on host shedding of viruses, we added fixed doses of Orsay virus to plates of each bacterial species and monitored infection using the <italic>pals-5p::GFP</italic> reporter. At lower doses of Orsay virus, the presence of <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 resulted in a higher fraction of infected animals than those observed in the presence of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 or <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, Supp. Fig. 3). At higher doses of Orsay virus, the presence of <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 resulted in a reduced fraction of infected animals compared to <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 and <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, Supp. Fig 3). We further quantified the ID<sub>50</sub> in the presence of each bacterium and on average we observed that the ID<sub>50</sub> in the presence of <italic>E. coli OP50</italic> was 14-fold higher than the ID<sub>50</sub> in the presence of <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>, Supp. Fig. 3). The ID<sub>50</sub> observed in the presence of <italic>P. lurida</italic> was 120-fold and 1800-fold higher than the ID<sub>50</sub> in the presence of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 or <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>, Supp. Fig. 3).</p>
<p>We corroborated our observations from the <italic>pals-5p::GFP</italic> reporter by scoring the same samples using fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization to detect the RNA1 segment of the Orsay virus genome in the intestinal cells of infected animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). As expected, we observed that at lower doses the presence of <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 resulted in a greater fraction of infected animals compared to <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 or <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11, while at higher doses the presence of <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 resulted in a reduced fraction of infected animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Together these data establish that individual members of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> microbiota can modulate host susceptibility to Orsay virus over three orders of magnitude with dramatic consequences for the transmissibility of Orsay virus.</p>
<p>We also assessed whether bacteria altered host feeding behavior as this may influence the transmission and infection rate of Orsay virus. We quantified the number of pharyngeal pumps per minute (ppm), a metric of <italic>C. elegans</italic> feeding, in the presence of each bacterium. After 6 h of exposure to <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50, <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11, or <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 there were no differences in pharyngeal pumping rates (Supp. Fig. 4A). At 24 h pumping rates were decreased in the presence of <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 to an average of 242 ppm compared to 261 ppm in the presence of <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 suggesting that changes to feeding behavior are unlikely to be responsible for observed effects on host susceptibility to Orsay virus (Supp. Fig. 4B).</p>

We observed that in the presence of either <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains PA01 or PA14, transmission from spreader animals to uninfected individuals was nearly completely blocked and the incidence proportion was 11-fold and 32-fold lower than that observed in the presence of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The attenuating effect of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 and PA14 on virus transmission was further reduced 3.1-fold and 9.5-fold, respectively, compared to the incidence proportion observed in the presence of <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>We confirmed that host susceptibility to Orsay virus was reduced in the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> by performing susceptibility assays at two doses of exogenous Orsay virus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, Supp. Fig. 5). At each dose, fewer animals were infected following exposure to equivalent doses of Orsay virus in the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01, PA14, or <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 as compared to the fraction of animals infected in the presence of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, Supp. Fig. 5). At the highest dose of virus used, we still observed robust attenuation of infection in the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 as 0.5% of the animals were infected as compared to 54%, 70%, and 97% in the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01, <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11, or <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). We confirmed that no individuals were detectably infected with Orsay virus while in the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 using FISH staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). FISH additionally confirmed that the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 and <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 attenuated average infection to 24% and 60% of the population respectively compared to <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 which supported infection of 86% of the population. Further, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01, <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11, and <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 all supported higher levels of infection than <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Together these results demonstrate a striking capacity of <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains to sharply reduce and even effectively block, host susceptibility to infection with Orsay virus.</p>
<p>We again assessed whether bacterial modulation of host feeding behavior may be responsible for the observed effects on host susceptibility to Orsay virus. There were no differences observed in pharyngeal pumping rate after 6 h of exposure to each bacterium (Supp. Fig. 4A). After 24 h pharyngeal pumping rate increased in the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 to an average of 264 ppm compared to 248 ppm in the presence of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 which suggests that changes to feeding behavior are unlikely to account for the attenuation of infection observed in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Supp. Fig. 4B).</p>
<p><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is a pathogen of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and numerous other organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Moreover, while both PA01 and PA14 are pathogenic, PA14 is more virulent towards <italic>C. elegans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 promotes developmental rate and fitness, although does so at a minor cost to overall lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. The effect of O. vermis MYb71 on lifespan has not been assessed. We assessed host lifespan under our assay conditions to examine links between bacterial pathogenicity and host susceptibility to Orsay virus. Under our assay conditions, including a full lawn of bacteria, which prevent <italic>C. elegans</italic> from avoiding undesirable bacteria, and a temperature of 20°C, which is below the optimal virulence temperature of <italic>P. aeruginosa,</italic> substantial mortality is not observed until 72 hours after exposure (Supp. Fig. 6). All bacteria enhanced mortality in comparison to <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (Supp. Fig. 6). Interestingly, <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 exposure led to similarly enhanced mortality when compared to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14, and both bacteria enhanced mortality in comparison to <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 (Supp. Fig. 6). <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 also enhanced mortality compared to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 under these conditions (Supp. Fig. 6). The similar lifespans of animals exposed to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 and <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 stand in contrast to their divergent effects on host susceptibility to Orsay virus. This suggests that general pathogenicity is unlikely to be responsible for effects on host susceptibility, although pathogenic consequences specific to exposure to each bacterium may still contribute to the observed effects on host susceptibility to Orsay virus.</p>

<title>Attenuation of Orsay virus transmission by <italic>P. lurida</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is not due to effects on Orsay virus replication, stability, or shedding</title>
<p>We considered the possibility that the attenuation of Orsay virus transmission in the presence of <italic>P. lurida</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains might be due to inhibitory effects of the bacteria on the replication of Orsay virus once transmitted to a susceptible animal host. To evaluate this possibility, we made use of a plasmid-based system in which viral RNA1 is expressed through a transgene introduced into <italic>C. elegans,</italic> so that replication of RNA1 can be assessed independent of the entry of exogenous virus into the host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. In this system, the Orsay virus RNA1 segment, which encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), is expressed following heat-shock. The expressed RNA1 may then be translated to produce the RdRP which can then replicate RNA1 through a negative-strand intermediate. The expression of RNA1 via heat-shock bypasses any differences in viral entry or pre-replication steps, allowing for a direct test of RNA1 replication efficiency under different conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. A plasmid expressing a mutated RdRP (RNA1[D601A]) incapable of supporting further RNA1 replication after the initial heat-shock serves as a control for heat shock efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Using this system, we observed that Orsay virus RNA1 replication efficiency was unaffected by the presence of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species relative to RNA1 replication observed in the presence of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Additionally, there were no differences observed in heat-shock efficiency between the different bacteria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). These data suggest that bacteria-induced differences in RNA1 replication in the host do not explain the substantial attenuation of Orsay virus transmission and infection rates caused by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 or PA14 and <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11.</p>

<p>We sought to confirm the successful replication of the plasmid expressed RNA1 of Orsay virus by assessing whether we could detect the replication of Orsay virus RNA1 in each <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species. We exposed young adult wild-type (N2) or RNAi defective animals (<italic>rde-1(ne219)</italic>) to exogenous Orsay virus and quantified the amount of virus present at 2 h and 24 h post-exposure, with the difference in RNA levels at these points reflecting viral genome replication. Animals of the RNAi defective <italic>rde-1(ne219)</italic> background have a defective antiviral response leading to higher viral loads than wild-type animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The <italic>rde-1(ne219)</italic> mutant therefore provides a more sensitive genetic background in which to detect viral replication following rare infection events within a population as is expected in the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14. In <italic>rde-1(ne219)</italic> animals viral RNA1 levels increased at 24 h relative to 2 h post exposure regardless of the bacteria present (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). On the other hand, in the wild-type background replication was not observed in animals exposed to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 and was attenuated in animals exposed to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 compared to animals exposed to <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 or <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). In a wild-type background individuals exposed to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 are less likely to become infected from exogenous Orsay virus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and Supp. Fig. 5). It is therefore likely that the viral load we observed in the wild-type populations is due to a smaller proportion of the population being infected, rather than hampered replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We also assessed whether <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01, or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 was capable of rapidly degrading Orsay virus or preventing viral shedding, either of which might account for attenuation of Orsay virus transmission. We did not observe a substantial decrease in viral stability in the presence of any bacterium suggesting Orsay virus is not rapidly degraded (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). We did observe an approximately 2-fold decrease in viral levels between <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 and <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11, however, this difference already existed within 30 min of exposure to each bacterium and did not grow further over the course of 24 h suggesting we are measuring differences in recovery of Orsay virus from each bacterial lawn, rather than enhanced degradation in the presence of <italic>P. lurid</italic>a MYb11 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). We measured rates of Orsay virus shedding during a transmission assay. We did not observe a substantial decrease in viral shedding in the presence of any bacterium (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). We observed approximately 4-fold lower levels of Orsay virus shed in the presence of <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 vs <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50, but as suggested by our virus stability data, we believe these differences at least partly reflect differences in Orsay virus recovery from each bacterial lawn rather than actual differences in viral shedding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>).</p>

<title>Attenuation of Orsay virus transmission by <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species is dependent on regulators of bacterial quorum sensing</title>
<p>Extensive studies on <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species have demonstrated the importance of quorum sensing for regulating many community-level behaviors in response to growing population density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> relies upon three quorum sensing systems: <italic>las</italic>, <italic>rhl</italic>, and <italic>pqs</italic>. These systems are arranged hierarchically, however crosstalk between them is extensive (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>.

However, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 preferentially produces Psl while <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 is unable to synthesis Psl and produces Pel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that quorum sensing might mediate the effect of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains to attenuate virus transmission, while differences in exopolysaccharide production might mediate the enhanced attenuation of virus transmission observed in the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 compared with what was observed in the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01. Therefore, we tested a panel of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 quorum sensing and biofilm mutants to determine whether quorum sensing or biofilm formation was involved in the attenuation of Orsay virus infection mediated by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p>

<p>Mutations of any the regulators of the <italic>las</italic>, <italic>rhl</italic>, or <italic>pqs</italic> quorum sensing systems suppressed the attenuation of Orsay virus infection caused by the presence of wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, Supp. Fig. 7). Knockout of <italic>gacA</italic> in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 also suppressed the attenuation of Orsay virus infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, Supp. Fig. 7). On the other hand, mutation of any of the three exopolysaccharide production pathways had no potent effect on the attenuation of infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, Supp. Fig. 7). These data support a role for quorum sensing regulated processes in reducing Orsay virus infection rates but do not implicate a role for individual exopolysaccharides.</p>
<p>For <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14, mutation of <italic>gacA</italic> or <italic>rhlR</italic> suppressed the attenuation of Orsay virus infection observed in the presence of wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, Supp. Fig. 8). Loss of the <italic>rhlR</italic> regulators <italic>rhlI</italic> or <italic>pqsE</italic> alone had no effect on the attenuation of Orsay virus infection, but simultaneous mutation of both <italic>rhlI</italic> and <italic>pqsE</italic> did suppress the attenuation of Orsay virus infection observed in the presence of wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14, similar to that observed for the <italic>rhlR</italic> mutant, suggesting <italic>rhlI</italic> and <italic>pqsE</italic> function redundantly to regulate <italic>rhlR</italic> in this context (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, Supp. Fig. 8)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Mutation of <italic>lasI</italic> or <italic>lasR</italic> suppressed the attenuation of Orsay virus infection to a lesser extent (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, Supp. Fig. 8). Independent mutation of two genes responsible for <italic>pel</italic> or <italic>alg</italic> exopolysaccharide production had no effect on infection rates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, Supp. Fig. 8). We further confirmed that mutation of <italic>rhlR</italic> and <italic>gacA</italic> in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 suppressed the attenuation of Orsay virus infection via FISH (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). These data suggest a role for quorum sensing in mediating <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 suppression of Orsay virus infection, as we observed for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01. However, our results obtained in the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 suggest that there may be some differential regulation of the bacterial effectors responsible in comparison to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01, or additional non-quorum sensing related factors that also mediate suppression.</p>
<p>As <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mutants could suppress the attenuation of infection observed by wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the presence of exogenous virus, we next confirmed that these <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mutants similarly affected transmission from infected spreader animals. All <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 quorum sensing mutants suppressed the attenuation of transmission by increasing the incidence proportion &gt;6-fold compared to the wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 <italic>rhlR</italic> and <italic>gacA</italic> mutants suppressed the attenuation of transmission by increasing the incidence proportion 19-fold and 17-fold respectively compared to wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14, but a <italic>lasI</italic> mutant had minimal effect consistent with the pattern we observed in the susceptibility assay using exogenous Orsay virus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Likewise, the magnitude of suppression of the attenuation of Orsay virus transmission observed in the <italic>P. aeruginosa rhlR</italic> or <italic>gacA</italic> mutants was greater in the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 background compared to the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 background, potentially suggesting the existence of additional strain specific factors that act in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 to attenuate Orsay virus transmission.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest the possibility that quorum sensing molecules could act directly to attenuate infection. To explore this hypothesis, we prepared liquid <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50, <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71, <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01, and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 cultures and added culture supernatant to plates containing <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 and Orsay virus. We did not observe any potent effect on host susceptibility to infection by Orsay virus from any supernatant (Supp. Fig. 9), although it is difficult to rule out the possibility that the compounds may act at concentrations that are locally higher than the concentrations at which the compounds are present in our experiments.</p>

<title><italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 <italic>gacA</italic> is required for attenuation of Orsay virus transmission</title>
<p>We next sought to determine whether our findings from the interaction of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and Orsay virus in the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> could inform us further regarding the mechanisms underlying the attenuation of Orsay virus transmission in the presence of <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11. In particular, we identified <italic>gacA, ptsP, prpC, and kinB</italic> orthologs using Orthovenn2 and generated a putative knockout allele of each gene by removing the coding potential for all but 10 amino acids from the N and C termini (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Following exposure to exogenous Orsay virus, knockout of <italic>gacA</italic> in <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 led to infection of 77% of the population compared to infection of 43% of the population in the presence of wild-type <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 from exogenous Orsay virus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, Supp. Fig. 11A and 11B). These observations were confirmed via FISH, as the <italic>gacA</italic> mutant supported infection of 62% of the population versus 37% infection in the presence of wild-type <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). The <italic>gacA</italic> mutation also suppressed the attenuation of Orsay virus transmission, increasing the incidence proportion 2.9-fold compared to wild-type <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). These data suggest that <italic>gacA</italic> has a conserved role between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 in the attenuation of Orsay virus transmission and infection of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. On the other hand, knockout of the <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 orthologs of <italic>ptsP</italic>, <italic>prpC</italic>, or <italic>kinB</italic> failed to suppress the attenuation of Orsay virus infection or transmission by <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>, Supp. Fig. 11C and 11D)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. One explanation of these results is that these genes play different roles within <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and therefore their mutation did not have the same consequences for Orsay virus attenuation. Alternatively, these results might suggest that <italic>ptsP</italic>, <italic>prpC</italic>, and <italic>kinB</italic> act to attenuate Orsay virus infection via some specific effect on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 virulence but do not influence the interaction of <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 with <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

<title><italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 closely interacts with the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal brush border</title>
<p><italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 and <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 can both be isolated from <italic>C. elegans</italic> natural environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. We were therefore curious how exposure to both bacteria simultaneously would impact Orsay virus infection rates. When cultures of <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 and <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 were concentrated to 25mg/mL and then mixed, we observed that a 50% mixture of each bacterium (v:v) attenuated infection to the same degree as pure <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, Supp. Fig. 11A-B). Moreover, we also noted that mixing <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 with <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 also lead to infection rates similar to pure <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, Supp. Fig. 11A-B).

<p>These data suggested that the presence of <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> in the intestine may be important for its ability to promote Orsay virus infection. We therefore fixed <italic>C. elegans</italic> exposed to <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 or <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 for examination via electron microscopy and imaged cross sections of the intestine. As expected from our fluorescence experiments, <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 was readily observed in the intestinal lumen at 4 or 24 h of exposure (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>). The glycocalyx is the mucus-like layer covering <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal cells and that recent work has suggested may play a role in defense against Orsay virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. The glycocalyx of animals exposed to <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 was observed with regions of variable thickness and potential instances of <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 deforming the microvilli brush border as opposed to animals exposed to <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 where the glycocalyx appeared uniform and undisturbed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>). A recent report observed that <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> promoted infection of the mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> by Dengue, Zika, and Sindbis viruses by secreting a protein, enhancin, that degrades the mucus layer covering epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In our study, we quantitatively define the effect of bacteria on the transmission of Orsay virus in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> host. While the presence of <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 enhanced the transmission of Orsay virus, the presence of <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains PA01 and PA14 attenuated Orsay virus transmission. The enhancement of Orsay virus transmission by <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 and reduction of transmission by <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 and PA14 was mirrored in assays assessing infection rates by exogenous virus. Our results using exogenous virus demonstrate that host susceptibility to Orsay virus infection may vary by over three orders of magnitude in the presence of <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 versus <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 which are found in the natural environment in association with <italic>C. elegans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Moreover, we observe that pathogenic <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which may be found in natural environments, can further attenuate Orsay virus transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Our work is also consistent with a recent study by González and Félix that also reported that monoaxenic cultures of other bacteria from the environment of <italic>C. elegans</italic> impact host susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our observations that two <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> species promoted transmission of Orsay virus are intriguing given that other <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> species have also been linked to viral infections. <italic>Ochrobactrum intermedium</italic> promoted poliovirus infection in mice and enhanced poliovirus stability in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. <italic>Ochrobactrum anthropi</italic>, an opportunistic human pathogen, was identified using a random forest analysis as one of the most predictive features differentiating the upper respiratory tract of human patients recovering from influenza infection versus healthy controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Our observations in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> host raise the speculative possibility that <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> colonization may have roles in evolutionarily diverse hosts in modulating viral infection. Further, our electron micrographs point to an intriguing hypothesis that <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> disrupts the brush border region of epithelial cells thereby promoting viral infection. Such a mechanism would be consistent with recent work identifying that <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> produces the protein enhancin, which promotes viral infection by degrading the mucus layer covering epithelial cells in the mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Additional work will need to be performed to explicitly test whether such a mechanism is at play in <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> mediated enhancement of Orsay virus infection and transmission.</p>
<p><italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 and PA14 shared the ability to attenuate Orsay virus infection and transmission. <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 promotes developmental rate and fitness at a cost to overall lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. In contrast, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> rapidly kills <italic>C. elegans</italic> and is detrimental to host fitness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Under our experimental conditions exposure to all three shortened lifespan compared to exposure to <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50. Given that <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 shortened lifespan to the same extent as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 but had the opposite effect on host susceptibility to Orsay virus, we do not believe that general virulence by any bacterium is responsible for the observed effects on host susceptibility. Rather, unique virulence processes specific to each bacterium may contribute to the unique effects of each bacterium on host susceptibility to Orsay virus.</p>
<p>We identified that <italic>gacA</italic> regulates the attenuation of Orsay virus by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 and PA14 and <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11. In Pseudomonads, <italic>gacA/gacS</italic> regulate processes related to quorum sensing and virulence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Quorum signaling influences additional aspects of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> physiology, including swarming behaviors, biofilm formation, secondary metabolism rates, and overall transcription patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. To gain additional insights into the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 effects on Orsay virus transmission we conducted a candidate-based screen of genes influenced by quorum signaling and genes that regulate virulence towards <italic>C. elegans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. We identified six additional genes, <italic>ptsP</italic>, <italic>prpC</italic>, <italic>kinB</italic>, <italic>clpA</italic>, <italic>glnK</italic>, and <italic>fabF1,</italic> that when mutated suppressed <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 attenuation of Orsay virus infection. Each of these genes, in addition to <italic>gacA</italic>, <italic>rhlR</italic>, and <italic>lasI</italic> has been shown to be required for full <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 virulence in <italic>C. elegans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. However, we observed that only these six out of the total 41 virulence-related genes identified in Feinbaum <italic>et al</italic>. influenced Orsay virus infection, arguing further against a role for general virulence in the attenuation of Orsay virus transmission and infection caused by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Additionally, while mutation of the <italic>ptsP</italic>, <italic>prpC</italic>, and <italic>kinB</italic> orthologs of <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 failed to suppress the attenuation of Orsay virus, it is unclear whether these genes influence the effect of <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 on host lifespan or even whether <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 pathogenicity mediated by other factors leads to attenuation of Orsay virus infection.</p>
<p><italic>C. elegans</italic> is unlikely to associate with a single bacterium in its natural environment. However, <italic>C. elegans</italic> shows clear behavioral preferences for grazing on certain bacteria from its environment and may eat monoxenic lawns in the wild<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Our data demonstrate that individual bacteria can have a profound impact on Orsay virus transmission rates in a species-specific manner. Additionally, the tractability of the <italic>C. elegans</italic>-Orsay virus experimental system allowed us to identify molecular determinants of viral transmission and will be useful for identifying additional biotic factors that influence viral transmission. Our work builds on the expanding body of knowledge showing that the microbiota can influence the interactions between viruses and their animal hosts.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors investigate how diverse bacterial species influence Orsay virus transmission and host susceptibility in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. They find that Ochrobactrum species increase infection rates, while Pseudomonas species decrease infection rates, and they identify regulators of quorum sensing and the gacA two-component system as genetic factors in the effects of Pseudomonas on infection. These findings provide important insights into the species-specific effects that bacteria can have on viral infection in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and they may have relevance for the impact of bacterial species on viral infection in other systems. Overall the manuscript has high rigor. However, a few minor concerns are listed below.</p>
<p>(1) The authors state that the amount of bacteria added to each plate was standardized by seeding plates with equivalent volumes of overnight culture. This approach does not account for differences in bacterial growth rate. A more rigorous approach would be to standardize based on OD600 measurements or CFU's. Alternatively, the authors could include bacterial growth curves to demonstrate that each strain/species has reached a similar growth phase (i.e. late log) at the time of plating, as bacterial physiology and virulence is dependent on the stage of growth. At the least, if it is not possible to perform these experiments, it would be useful to include a statement that potential differences in bacterial growth rate may influence their conclusions.</p>
<p>(2) Line 314-315: The claim &quot;We did not observe any potent effect on host susceptibility to infection by Orsay virus from any supernatant (Supp. Fig. 9)&quot; is not fully supported by the data, as the data in Fig S9 only show pals-5p::GFP levels. To confirm that host susceptibility is not affected, the authors would also measure the viral infection rate and/or viral load. Otherwise, the authors should rephrase the conclusion to increase accuracy. For example, &quot;We did not observe any potent effect on pals-5p::GFP activation upon Orsay virus infection when animals were exposed to bacterial culture supernatant&quot;.</p>
<p>(3) The Ct values shown in Fig 3B-F should be normalized to a reference gene (i.e. Ct values for snb-1).</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This important study identifies differential Orsay virus infection of C. elegans when animals are fed on different bacteria. The evidence for this is however, incomplete, as experiments to control for feeding rate and bacterial pathogenicity are needed as well as direct quantification of viral load.</p>

<p>We appreciate that the editors and reviewers felt that our manuscript addressed an important problem. We appreciate the constructive critiques provided by the reviewers and have worked to address all of the concerns, including a number of additional experiments as indicated below.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript explores the importance of food type on virus infection dynamics using a nematode virus as a model system. The authors demonstrate that susceptibility to viral infection can change by several orders of magnitude based on the type of bacterial food that potential hosts consume. They go on to show that, for the bacterial food source that reduces susceptibility, the effect is modulated by quorum sensing molecules that the bacteria produce.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript shows convincingly that nematode susceptibility to viral infection changes by several orders of magnitude (i.e. doses must be increased by several orders of magnitude to infect the same fraction of the population) depending on the bacterial food source on which hosts are reared. The authors then focus on the bacteria that reduce host susceptibility to viral infection and demonstrate that certain bacterial quorum-sensing compounds are required to see this effect of reduced susceptibility. Overall, sample sizes are large, methods are generally rigorous, experiments are repeated, and patterns are clear.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the molecular correlate of reduced susceptibility is identified (i.e. quorum sensing compounds) the mechanisms underlying this effect are missing. For example, there are changes in susceptibility due to altered nutrition, host condition, the microbiome, feeding rate, mortality of infected hosts, etc. In addition, the authors focus almost entirely on the reduction in susceptibility even though I personally find the increased susceptibility generated when reared on Ochrobactrum to be much more exciting.</p>
<p>I was a bit surprised that there was no data on basic factors that could have led to reductions in susceptibility. In particular, data on feeding rates and mortality rates seem really important. I would expect that feeding rates are reduced in the presence of Pseudomonas. Reduced feeding rates would translate to lower consumed doses, and so even though the same concentration of virus is on a plate, it doesn't mean that the same quantity of virus is consumed. Likewise, if Pseudomonas is causing mortality of virus-infected hosts, it could give the impression of lower infection rates. Perhaps mortality rates are too small in the experimental setup to explain this pattern, but that isn't clear in the current version of the manuscript. Is mortality greatly impacted by knocking out quorum-sensing genes? Also, the authors explored susceptibility to infection, but completely ignored variation in virus shedding.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added data on feeding rates (Line numbers 141-148 and 176-182, Supplementary Figure 4). After six hours of exposure no differences in feeding rate were observed. After 24 hours minor differences emerged between O. vermis MYb71 and each Pseudomonas species, however feeding rate inversely correlated with susceptibility to Orsay virus in that O. vermis MYb71 displayed the lowest feeding rate while P. aeruginosa PA14 displayed the highest feeding rate.</p>
<p>We have also added data on mortality rates (Line numbers 183-200, Supplementary Figure 6). No significant mortality was observed within the 24-hour exposure period used for our Orsay infection and transmission assays. P. aeruginosa virulence is dependent upon temperature and as our assays are done at 20°C rather than 25°C this may account for reduced mortality compared to other published results. Regardless, we noted that O. vermis MYb71 killed C. elegans as quickly as P. aeruginosa PA14 under these conditions and these two bacteria led to the shortest lifespan compared to the other tested bacteria. Interestingly, P. lurida MYb11 was observed to be more virulent than P. aeruginosa PA01 under these conditions. These results suggest that there is no direct correlation between mortality and susceptibility to Orsay virus, although it does not rule out that virulence effects unique to each bacterium could contribute to alterations in host susceptibility.</p>
<p>The reviewer is correct to assert that differences in viral shedding could exist. However, our susceptibility assays using exogenous Orsay virus remove this source of variation and yet we still observe the same trends such that O. vermis MYb71 promotes infection while P. lurida MYb11, P. aeruginosa PA01, and P. aeruginosa PA14 attenuate infection. Further we measured the amount of virus shed into the lawns in the presence of different bacteria and did not observe differences in shed virus that could account for the differences we observe in incidence proportion (Line numbers 241-254, Fig. 3 F). Viral stability could be an issue in both the transmission and susceptibility assays. We therefore tested viral stability in the presence of E. coli, P. lurida MYb11, P. aeruginosa PA01, and P. aeruginosa PA14 and successfully recovered virus from all lawns, suggesting virus is not rapidly degraded in the presence of any bacterium (Fig. 3D and 3E). However, we noted that the recovery of Orsay virus from lawns of E. coli OP50 and P. lurida MYb11 within 30 minutes was decreased compared to a spike-in control suggesting recovery from each lawn is not equivalent. This complicates a comparison of viral stability and shedding rates between different bacteria, but our ability to recover substantial amounts of virus in the shedding assay from the three Pseudomonas strains we examined precludes a substantial decrease in shedding rates as an explanation for the robust attenuation of Orsay virus observed in transmission assays.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I was also curious why the authors did not further explore the mechanism behind the quorumsensing effect. Not sure whether this is possible, but would it be possible to add spent media to the infection plates where the spent media was from Pseudomonas that produce the quorum sensing compound but the plates contain OP50, Pseudomonas, or the quorum sensing knockout of Pseudomonas? That would reveal whether it is the compound itself vs. something that the compound does.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We observed that quorum sensing mutants suppressed the attenuation of Orsay virus infection and we agree that this could be a consequence of the compounds themselves, or more likely an effect of the downstream consequences of quorum signaling. We added culture supernatant from each bacterium to lawns of E. coli OP50 to assess the effect on host susceptibility and did not observe any potent effect (Line numbers 311-318, Supplementary Figure 9). This supports an interpretation that it is not the compound itself that is responsible, however we cannot rule out that the compounds themselves may be responsible if provided at a higher concentration.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, I was surprised by how much focus there was on the attenuation of infection and how little there was on the enhancement of infection. To me, enhancement seems like the more obvious thing to find a mechanism for -- is the bacteria suppressing immunity, preventing entry to gut cells, etc?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are also intrigued by the enhancement of infection by Ochrobactrum spp, however we chose to focus on attenuation given the availability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa genetic mutants for study. We have added data (Line numbers 371-402, Figure 7, and Supplemental Figure 12) that inform our current hypothesis regarding Ochrobactrum mediated enhancement of Orsay virus infection.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I was a bit concerned about the &quot;arbitrary units&quot;, which were used without any effort to normalize them. David Wang and Hongbing Jiang have developed a method based on tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) that can be used to measure infectious doses in a somewhat repeatable way. Without some type of normalization, it is hard to imagine how this study could be repeated. The 24-hour time period between exposure and glowing suggests very high doses, but it is still unclear precisely how high. Also, it is clear that multiple batches of virus were used in this study, but it is entirely unclear how variable these batches were.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have clarified that we also measured the (TC)ID50 for every batch of virus used similar to the methods suggested by the Wang laboratory (Line numbers 107-119 and 499-506). We have added a figure showing the virus batch variability for all batches used in this study (Supp. Fig. 2). We have further clarified that the arbitrary units correspond to the actual microliters of viral filtrate used during infection and provided clear methods to replicate our viral batch production to assist with issues of reproducibility (Line numbers 107-119 and 499-506).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors in several places discuss high variability or low variability in incidence as though it is a feature of the virus or a feature of the host. It isn't. For infection data (or any type of binomial data) results are highly variable in the middle (close to 50% infection) and lowly variable at the ends (close to 0% or 100% infection). This is a result that is derived from a binomial distribution and it should not be taken as evidence that the bacteria or the host affect randomness. If you were to conduct dose-response experiments, on any of your bacterial food source treatments, you would find that variability is lowest at the extremely high and extremely low doses and it is most variable in the middle when you are at doses where about 50% of hosts are infected.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary and Major Findings/Strengths:</p>
<p>Across diverse hosts, microbiota can influence viral infection and transmission. C. elegans is naturally infected by the Orsay virus, which infects intestinal cells and is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. Previous work has demonstrated that host immune defense pathways, such as antiviral RNAi and the intracellular pathogen response (IPR), can influence host susceptibility to virus infection. However, little is known about how bacteria modulate viral transmission and host susceptibility.</p>
<p>In this study, the authors investigate how diverse bacterial species influence Orsay virus transmission and host susceptibility in C. elegans. When C. elegans is grown in the presence of two Ochrobactrum species, the authors find that animals exhibit increased viral transmission, as measured by the increased proportion of newly infected worms (relative to growth on E. coli OP50). The presence of the two Ochrobactrum species also resulted in increased host susceptibility to the virus, which is reflected by the increased fraction of infected animals following exposure to the exogenous Orsay virus. In contrast, the presence of Pseudomonas lurida MYb11, as well as Pseudomonas PA01 or PA14, attenuates viral transmission and host susceptibility relative to E. coli OP50. For growth in the presence of P. aeruginosa PA01 and PA14, the attenuated transmission and susceptibility are suppressed by mutations in regulators of quorum sensing and the gacA two-component system. The authors also identify six virulence genes in P. aeruginosa PA14 that modulate host susceptibility to virus and viral transmission, albeit to a lesser extent. Based on the findings in P. aeruginosa, the authors further demonstrate that deletion of the gacA ortholog in P. lurida results in loss of the attenuation of viral transmission and host susceptibility.</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings provide important insights into the species-specific effects that bacteria can have on viral infection in C. elegans. The authors also describe a role for Pseudomonas quorum sensing and virulence genes in influencing viral transmission and host susceptibility.</p>
<p>Major weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript has several issues that need to be addressed, such as insufficient rigor of the experiments performed and questions about the reproducibility of the data presented in some places. In addition, confounding variables complicate the interpretations that can be made from the authors' findings and weaken some of the conclusions that are stated in the manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) The authors sometimes use pals-5p::GFP expression to indicate infection, however, this is not necessarily an accurate measure of the infection rate. Specifically, in Figures 4-6, the authors should include measurements of viral RNA, either by FISH staining or qRT-PCR, to support the claims related to differences in infection rate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the reviewers comment we have corroborated our pals-5::GFP data using FISH staining (Line numbers 291-292 and 357-359, Figure 4D &amp; 4E, and Figure 6C).</p>

<p>(2) In several instances, the experimental setup and presentation of data lack sufficient rigor. For example, Fig 1D and Fig 2B only display data from one experimental replicate. The authors should include information from all 3 experimental replicates for more transparency. In Fig 3B, the authors should include a control that demonstrates how RNA1 levels change in the presence of E. coli OP50 for comparison with the results showing replication in the presence of PA14. In order to support the claim that &quot;P. aeruginosa and P. lurida MYb11 do not eliminate Orsay virus infection&quot;, the authors should also measure RNA1 fold change in the presence of PA01 and P. lurida in the context of exogenous Orsay virus. Additionally, the authors should standardize the amount of bacteria added to the plate and specify how this was done in the Methods, as differing concentrations of bacteria could be the reason for species-specific effects on infection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All experimental replicates are now included within the supplementary information.</p>
<p>We have also measured RNA1 fold change following infection in the presence of P. aeruginosa PA01 and P. lurida MYb11 (Line numbers Fig 3B and 3C) and found that these bacteria also do not eliminate Orsay virus replication.</p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comment on controlling the amount of bacteria and have clarified our methods section to more clearly explain that we seed our plates with equivalent amounts (based on volume) of overnight bacterial culture before allowing the bacteria to grow on the plates for 48 hours.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors should be more careful about conclusions that are made from experiments involving PA14, which is a P. aeruginosa strain (isolated from humans), that can rapidly kill C. elegans. To eliminate confounding factors that are introduced by the pathogenicity of PA14, the authors should address how PA14 affects the health of the worms in their assays. For example, the authors should perform bead-feeding assays to demonstrate that feeding rates are unaffected when worms are grown in the presence of PA14. Because Orsay virus infection occurs through feeding, a decrease in C. elegans feeding rates can influence the outcome of viral infection. The authors should also address whether or not the presence of PA14 affects the stability of viral particles because that could be another trivial reason for the attenuation of viral infection that occurs in the presence of PA14.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added data on feeding rates (Line numbers 141-148 and 176-182, Supplementary Figure 4). After six hours of exposure no differences in feeding rate were observed. After 24 hours minor differences emerged between O. vermis MYb71 and each Pseudomonas species, however feeding rate inversely correlated with susceptibility to Orsay virus in that O. vermis MYb71 displayed the lowest feeding rate while P. aeruginosa PA14 displayed the highest feeding rate.</p>
<p>We have also added data on mortality rates (Line numbers 183-200, Supplementary Figure 6). No significant mortality was observed within the 24-hour exposure period used for our Orsay infection and transmission assays. P. aeruginosa virulence is dependent upon temperature and as our assays are done at 20°C rather than 25°C this may account for reduced mortality compared to other published results. Regardless, we noted that O. vermis MYb71 killed C. elegans as quickly as P. aeruginosa PA14 under these conditions and these two bacteria led to the shortest lifespan compared to the other tested bacteria. Interestingly, P. lurida MYb11 was observed to be more virulent than P. aeruginosa PA01 under these conditions. These results suggest that there is no direct correlation between mortality and susceptibility to Orsay virus, although it does not rule out that virulence effects unique to each bacterium could contribute to alterations in host susceptibility.</p>
<p>We tested viral stability in the presence of E. coli OP50 and Pseudomonas spp. and successfully recovered virus from all lawns, suggesting virus is not rapidly degraded in the presence of P. lurida MYb11, P. aeruginosa PA01, and P. aeruginosa PA14 (Line numbers 241-249, Fig 3D and Fig 3E). However, we noted that the recovery of Orsay virus from lawns of E. coli OP50 and P. lurida MYb11 within 30 minutes was decreased compared to a spike-in control suggesting recovery from each lawn is not equivalent. This complicates a comparison of viral stability and shedding rates between different bacteria, but our ability to recover substantial amounts of virus in the shedding assay from each Pseudomonas species precludes a substantial decrease in shedding rates as an explanation for the robust attenuation of Orsay virus observed in transmission assays.</p>

<p>This sentence (line number 114) has been amended to clarify that all ID50 values referred to here were calculated for ZD2611 populations in the presence of E. coli OP50.

<p>We have chosen to exclude these plates as these samples lost spreaders at some point during the course of the assay potentially skewing the eventual number of new infections counted depending on when the infected spreader animal crawled off the plate.

<p>Line 546: Why was only a single representative experiment shown? I'm asking for a justification, not necessarily for you to show all the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We chose to show a single representative experiment for two reasons:  We noted variability between susceptibility assays even when using the same batch of virus such that we could not combine experiments into a single plot as we did for transmission assays. Second, while we could normalize to a control within each experiment and expect to see similar relative differences across experiments, we believe this makes it more difficult to interpret the underlying data. For example, an increase in the infection rate of 80% compared to 10% within a population has only a single interpretation while a relative increase in the infection rate by 8x within a population could have several underlying meanings (e.g. 80% vs 10%, 64%vs 8%, 24% vs 3%). We have now included all experimental replicates in the supplementary material.</p>

<p>(2) The presentation of data in Fig 1 could be improved. The authors should include the text &quot;pals-5p::GFP&quot; on the images shown in Fig 1B. The red dashed line in Fig. 1D should intersect the dose-response curve at y = 0.5. The column heading for Fig 1E states &quot;ID50 +/- SD (a.u.)&quot;, but should read &quot;ID50 ratio&quot; and should not have units. It also might be more intuitive to normalize the ID50 value for O. vermis to E. coli OP50. This way, having an ID50 ratio &gt;1 indicates decreased transmission relative to E. coli, and ID50 ratio &lt;1 indicates increased transmission relative to E. coli. To increase the transparency and rigor of 1E, the authors should plot the ratios from all 3 experimental replicates. The authors should also briefly explain why different viral doses were used in Fig 1D and 1F.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The text “pals-5p::GFP” has now been added to Figure 1B and throughout the text. The red dashed line in figure 1D has been corrected. Figure 1E has been adjusted to an actual figure as suggested and the y-axis label is “ID50 Ratio Compared to E. coli OP50”. The ID50 replicates have been plotted in Supplementary Figure 2. We have clarified that the doses used are the same. Briefly, the technical replicates of individual doses from Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure 3A and 3B were pooled and processed for FISH staining to provide each experimental replicate of Figure 1F.</p>

<p>(3) Line 110: The claim is that Ochrobactrum and P. lurida MYb11 reduce the variability of infection levels. However, another possibility is that there's simply less dynamic range in the assay because the infection levels have been compressed to 100% and 0% under these conditions.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>More context has been provided for why rde-1 mutants were tested (Line numbers 228-232). Briefly, using the rde-1 mutant, which has defective antiviral immunity and therefore supports higher viral replication levels than the wild-type (Félix et al. 2011), allows us to potentiate our infection assay in Figure 3B and 3C such that we maximize our chances of detecting viral replication in the presence of the Pseudomonas species, and especially P. aeruginiosa PA14, where fewer animals might be expected to get infected based upon Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 5.</p>

<p>(8) To improve overall clarity and flow, the order in which the data is presented could be reordered. In particular, Fig. 6 could be better positioned instead of being the last figure, as no further characterization is performed on the mutants, and the findings are not conserved in strains that are more relevant to the C. elegans microbiota, such as P. lurida. The overall story could be strengthened if the authors ended the manuscript with more details related to the mechanism by which regulators of quorum sensing modulate the outcome of viral infection.</p>

<p>(10) Lines 280-282: &quot;These data suggest that gacA has a conserved role across distant Pseudomonas species...&quot; Here, the authors can provide more context on how well-conserved gacA is across Pseudomonas species (i.e. phylogenetic analysis of gacA sequences across different Pseudomonas species/strains). Furthermore, the data in Fig 5 does not provide strong enough support for the conclusion that gacA has a conserved role broadly across Pseudomonas species, as the authors only assess the effects of a gacA deletion in two species, P. aeruginosa and P. lurida.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have adjusted lines 361-362 to “These data suggest that gacA has a conserved role between P. aeruginosa and P. lurida Myb11 in the attenuation of Orsay virus transmission and infection of C. elegans.” to reflect that we only assessed the effects of the gacA deletion in P. aeruginosa and P. lurida MYb11.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) The manuscript can be strengthened by performing additional experiments to elucidate the mechanism by which Pseudomonas modulates viral infection. Does the attenuation of viral transmission and host susceptibility by P. lurida and P. aeruginosa require C. elegans to be in the presence of live bacteria? For example, the authors could measure viral transmission and susceptibility of C. elegans grown on heat-killed Pseudomonas. Additionally, it would be interesting to determine if modulation of viral infection is dependent on a secreted molecule. To assess this, the authors could perform viral infections in the context of Pseudomonas culture supernatant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added bacterial culture supernatant from each bacterium to lawns of E. coli OP50 to assess the effect on host susceptibility and did not observe any potent effect (Line numbers 311-318, Supplementary Figure 9). This supports an interpretation that attenuation is not mediated by a secreted molecule, however we cannot rule out that attenuation activity would become apparent if supernatant were provided at a higher concentration.</p>
<p>We have found substantial challenges appropriately controlling live vs. heat-killed experiments particularly with the specifics of our susceptibility experiments. With regards to the underlying question of mechanism we believe that the genetic mutants (e.g. rhlR/gacA) are equally informative and that further comparison of these mutants’ interaction with the C. elegans host as compared to wild-type may be informative.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) The authors should include a discussion on the relative virulence potential of PA01, PA14, and P. lurida and the relationship between bacterial virulence potential and the outcome of viral infection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have also added data on mortality rates (Line numbers 183-200, Supplementary Figure 6). No significant mortality was observed within the 24-hour exposure period used for our Orsay infection and transmission assays. P. aeruginosa virulence is dependent upon temperature and as our assays are done at 20°C rather than 25°C this may account for reduced mortality compared to other published results. Regardless, we noted that O. vermis MYb71 killed C. elegans as quickly as P. aeruginosa PA14 under these conditions and these two bacteria led to the shortest lifespan compared to the other tested bacteria. Interestingly, P. lurida MYb11 was observed to be more virulent than P. aeruginosa PA01 under these conditions. These results suggest that there is no direct correlation between mortality and susceptibility to Orsay virus, although it does not rule out that virulence effects unique to each bacterium could contribute to alterations in host susceptibility.</p>
