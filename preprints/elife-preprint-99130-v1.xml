<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Discovering new strategies to combat the multi-drug resistance bacteria constitutes a major medical challenge of our time. Previously, artesunate (AS) has been reported to exert antibacterial enhancement activity in combination with β-lactam antibiotics, via inhibition of the efflux pump AcrB. However, combination of AS and colistin (COL) revealed weak synergistic effect against a limited number of strains, and few studies have further explored its possible mechanism of synergistic action. In this paper, we found that AS and EDTA could strikingly enhance the antibacterial effects of COL against <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>−</sup> and <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains either <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>, when used in triple combination. The excellent bacteriostatic effect was primarily related to the increased cell membrane damage, accumulation of toxic compounds and inhibition of MCR-1. The potential binding sites of AS to MCR-1 (THR283, SER284, and TYR287) were critical for its inhibition of MCR-1 activity. Additionally, we also demonstrated that the CheA of chemosensory system and virulence-related protein SpvD were critical for the bacteriostatic synergistic effects of the triple combination. Selectively targeting CheA, SpvD or MCR using the natural compound artesunate could be further investigated as an attractive strategy for treatment of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Collectively, our work opens up avenues towards the potentiation of colistin and revealed an alternative drug combination strategy to overcome COL resistant bacterial infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Infections of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, especially the carbapenemase-producing <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, pose an impending catastrophe of a return to the pre-antibiotic era. The drying up of the antibiotic discovery pipeline has resulted in increased use of polymyxins as the “last resort” antimicrobial drug with the inevitable risk of emerging resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Falagas &amp; Kasiakou, 2005</xref>). Colistin (polymyxin E, COL), a fatty acyl oligopeptide antibiotic, is an active agent against multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative (G<sup>−</sup>) pathogens. Generally, COL kills bacteria through a detergent-like effect, that the polycationic ring of COL electrostatically interacted with the cell envelope components, causing the competitive displacement of divalent cations calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>), destabilizing the membrane, thus killing the bacterium via the “self-promoted uptake” pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kaye <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Beyond that, other models for the antibacterial activity have been reported, including vesicle-vesicle contact, hydroxyl radical death, inhibition of respiratory enzymes and anti-endotoxin COL activity pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">El-Sayed Ahmed <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Until now, numerous chromosomally- or plasmid-mediated mechanisms underlying polymyxins resistance in G<sup>−</sup> bacteria have been identified, including intrinsic, mutation (eg. PmrAB, PhoPQ or AcrAB-TolC mutants), adaptation mechanisms or horizontally acquired resistance via the phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) transferase genes <italic>mcr-1</italic> to <italic>9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Carroll <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lima <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Poirel <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>To tackle the increasing emergence of MDR pathogens, many alternative therapies, less costly and time-consuming, become the areas of current research interest, involving the combination therapy of existing agents, the drug discovery from natural products, and the evaluation of drug resistance reversers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rosenthal, 2003</xref>). A variety of antibiotic adjuvants that may or may not have direct antibacterial effects have been widely investigated to increase the effectiveness of current antibiotics or delay the emergence of drug resistance, such as β-lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme inhibitors, membrane permeabilisers, and efflux pump inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Laws <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Several promising inhibitors, for example zidebactam and pyrazolopyrimidine compounds have been described as the β-lactam and aminoglycoside enhancers against G<sup>−</sup> bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Moya <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Stogios <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Alternatively, numerous synthetic antimicrobial peptides and plant-derived natural products have been shown to possess membrane permeabilising or efflux pump inhibitory activity, with the combination of azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aron &amp; Opperman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lin <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Su &amp; Wang, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Artesunate (AS) is a semi-synthetic derivative of anti-malarial compound artemisinin that extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Artemisia annua. Beyond remarkable antimalarial action, AS and other artemisinin derivatives, eg. dihydroartemisinin (DHA), have been proven to restored the antibacterial effect of COL against <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>), while themselves didn’t exhibited intrinsic antimicrobial activity against clinical <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates as well as ATCC 25922 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wei <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). In addition, AS has also been proved to enhance the effectiveness of various β-lactam and fluoroquinolones antibiotics against MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> via inhibiting the efflux pump AcrAB-TolC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pan <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wei <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Nonetheless, the synergistic effects between AS and COL were only observed in a limited number of strains, with a modest reversal effect. Therefore, few studies have been undertaken to evaluate its underlying mechanism. Under this circumstance, it is meaningful to explore new medication regimens between AS and COL against MDR bacteria. Encouragingly, in this study, we confirmed the prominent synergistic effects of AS and EDTA to restore the antimicrobial activity of COL and its possible molecular mechanism.</p>

<title>Artesunate and EDTA could enhance the effects of colistin against <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains</title>
<p>The antimicrobial activities of AS, EDTA or COL alone were initially investigated to the COL-sensitive strains of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (JS, S34), COL-resistant clinical strains of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (S16, S20, S13, and S30), <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (E16), and intrinsically COL-resistant species (<italic>Morganella morganii</italic> strain M15, <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> strain P01). Results showed that AS or EDTA alone had no direct antibacterial activity against these strains, with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 1250 or &gt; 125 mg/L (Table supplement 1). Excepting for the two intrinsically COL-resistant strains M15 and P01, there were only slight decrease of COL MICs for other strains (fold changes ranging from 0 to 133), when the sub-inhibitory concentrations (1/4, 1/8, 1/16 MIC) of AS or EDTA were combined with COL (namely AC or EC) (Table supplement 1). Whease, we found marked decrease of COL MICs (up to 60000 fold), after three drug combinations (namely AEC) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These results indicated that when used simultaneously with COL, AS and EDTA exerted antibacterial enhancement activity for <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, but not the intrinsically COL-resistant species. Thus, AS and EDTA could be considered as adjuvants to reverse COL resistance in <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p>

<p>To verify the antibacterial enhancement activity of AS and EDTA, the growth curves of <italic>Salmonella</italic> JS, S16 (<italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>−</sup>), and S30 (<italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>+</sup>) for the combined treatments were generated within 12 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Generally, the higher concentration of COL (2 mg/L), either alone or in combinations, was found more effective against these strains than that of the lower concentration (0.1 mg/L). Compared with the control groups, when these bacteria were grown in the presence of COL alone (0.1 mg/L) or two drug combinations (AC and EC), the antimicrobial activity were not significant, and only the three drug combination AEC exhibited a certain degree of growth inhibition after incubation for 8-12 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a, b, c</xref>). By contrast, higher concentration of COL (2mg/L), alone or in combinations, showed better antibacterial activity, and a gradual increase in antibacterial activity was observed: AEC &gt; AC &gt; EC &gt; C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d, e, f</xref>). It’s worth noting that the effect of different combinations against <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>+</sup> strain S30 was weaker than that of <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>−</sup> S16 and standard sensitive strain JS.</p>

<title>Artesunate and EDTA enhanced the membrane-damaging effect of colistin on <italic>Salmonella</italic></title>
<p>In order to gain insight into the membrane-damaging bactericidal mechanism of COL alone or combinations, the damages to the bacterial outer and inner membrane (OM and IM) were severally monitored by measuring the fluorescent intensity of <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains S16 and S30 mixed with NPN and PI. Overall, the fluorescence signals of NPN and PI increased progressively with increases in the concentration of COL. After the treatment of AEC, S16 and S30 both showed strongest fluorescence signals of NPN, compared to those of other groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a, b</xref>). Nevertheless, AS treatment group also exerted a significant increase of fluorescent signal, although it is not as strong as that of AEC treated group. Meanwhile, there were rapid and significant increase in fluorescence of PI, when AEC or EC were added to bacterial cultures, and the two regimens played dominant roles in low or high concentrations of COL, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c, d</xref>). Therefore, these results indicated that the bacterial cell surfaces were severely damaged after the AEC treatment, via the rapid perturbations of OM and IM. Subsequently, the morphological changes of <italic>Salmonella</italic> strain S16 treated with different regimens were further investigated using Scanning electron microscope (SME) analysis to confirm the above membrane-damaging effect. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, SEM micro-graphs of control and solvent treated groups revealed that cells were short and rod-shaped, with rounded ends and intact cell membranes. As expected, after exposure to COL alone and different regimens, noticeable damage to the OM were observed, especially in AC and AEC treated group. Exposure to AC and AEC leading to cell damages characterized by folds, crevices, and depressions, which further suggested that AS and EDTA combined with COL resulted in remarkable bacterial membrane injury for antibacterial activity. Collectively, these data confirmed the membrane-damaging effects of AS, EDTA and COL combination against <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p>

<title>AEC combination could collapse the Δψ component of Proton Motive Force (PMF) in <italic>Salmonella</italic></title>
<p>In bacteria, the PMF, alternatively known as electrochemical proton gradient, is result from the extrusion of protons by the electron transport chain, and made up of the sum of two parameters: an electric potential (Δψ) and an osmotic component (ΔpH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Farha <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). It has been reported to drives vital cellular processes in bacteria, including ATP synthesis, antibiotic transport, and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Le <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Therefore, PMF dissipation was considered as a promising strategy for combating microbial pathogens. In this work, we explored whether the antibacterial synergism activities of different combinations were accompanied by dissipation of PMF in cells. We uncovered that when compared to that of other groups, AEC treatment caused a rapid collapse of Δψ component, as shown by the increase in fluorescence values of DISC<sub>3</sub>(5) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e, f</xref>). But none of these combinations observed significant dissipation of ΔPH, when compared to that of control group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g, h</xref>). The above results indicated that AEC treatment was able to dissipate selectively the Δψ component of PMF.</p>

<title>Other reactive oxygen species (ROS), not H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, contributed to the AS and EDTA-mediated efficacy enhancement of COL</title>
<p>ROS including superoxide (O<sup>2−</sup>), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and hydroxyl radical (·OH), are commonly generated during the electron transfer process, which has been considered to associated with the lethal action of diverse antimicrobials. Subsequently, we investigated whether the addition of AS and EDTA could facilitate the intracellular ROS generation and stimulate the ROS-mediated killing. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2i, j</xref>, compared to control group, total ROS increases in S16 and S30 strains were observed in AC and AEC groups either after 0.1 or 2 mg/L COL was added, but for COL alone and EC groups, the increase were only occured after the addition of a relatively high COL concentration (2 mg/L). In addition, the ROS accumulation level was further increased in AEC group, when extending the incubation time period to 6 h (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, we found that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> did not contribute to the increase of total ROS, as there was no significant difference in intracellular level of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> among all the groups <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2k, l</xref>. Collectively, these observations support a role for ROS in AS and EDTA-mediated efficacy enhancement of COL.</p>

<sec id="s3a">
<title>Membrane-damaging played a crucial role in the bacteriostatic synergistic effects of AS+EDTA+COL combination</title>
<p>COL is an increasingly important antibiotic against serious infections caused by G<sup>−</sup> bacteria. It damages both the OM and IM layers of the cell surface by targeting LPS, displacing cations that form bridges between LPS molecules, and thereby leading to disruption of the cell envelope and bacterial lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sabnis <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Our data showed that the AEC combination could permit ingress of NPN fluorophore into the OM, as well as the membrane impermeant dye PI into the IM, which fluoresces upon contact with DNA in the bacterial cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a-d</xref>). Thus, it indicated AEC combination has punched holes in both the OM and IM of whole bacterial cells. The considerably deformed of cell membranes observed by SEM further supported the above results that the membrane integrity, and permeability were damaged after AEC incubation. Considering that EDTA is used as a complexing agent, we tried to explore if it could assist COL to destroy the bacterial membrane and reduce their survival by chelating cations that stabilize LPS and the outer membrane. Unfortunately, we found minimal change in MICs of different combinations to S16 and S30 strains, after different cations (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>) were supplemented (Table supplement 2). In contrast, LPS treatment resulted in dose-dependent changes in MICs of different combinations to S16 and S30 strains (Table supplement 3), which indicated that LPS on cell membrane was a crucial target for AEC to injure cell membrane and exert prominent antibacterial effects.</p>
<p>Whilst it is commonly believed that COL acts against G<sup>−</sup> bacteria by cell membrane lysis, we hypothesised that alterations in bacterial membrane lipid composition may also be a possible Achilles’ heel to increase efficacy of COL after the AEC incubation in this paper. The metabolomic results of AEC vs. C group in this study showed a significant decrease of prostaglandins (PGs) in arachdonic acid metabolism pathway (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Arachidonic acid is a highly abundant long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid in vertebrates, which have been proposed to have antibacterial roles. Exogenous Arachidonic acid has been reported to readily incorporated into the synthesis pathways of membrane phospholipids, and exert detrimental effects on membrane integrity by perturbing membrane ordering, altering membrane composition and increasing fluidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Eijkelkamp <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">MacDermott-Opeskin <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). PGs are lipid compounds derived from arachidonic acid, which has been demonstrate to enhance biofilm development and fungal load in the murine vaginae of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ells <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that the down-regulated lipid compounds PGs may lead to perturbtion of membrane phospholipids in cell membranes and reduce microbial viability.</p>
<p>Accumulation of toxic compounds may also be held responsible for the membrane damage. We noted that there were significant accumulation of styrene in both S16 and S30 strains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Styrene is naturally present as a minor metabolite, that can be synthesized at low levels by several microorganisms, like <italic>Pencillium camemberti</italic> and members of the <italic>Styracaceae</italic> family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Yeh <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). However, styrene itself is toxic to most cell types, and its hydrophobic molecules could readily partition into bacterial membrane, resulting in membrane disruption and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lian <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Additionally, we found that the taurocholic acid and protocatechuic acid were up-regulated respectively in S16 and S30 strains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Taurocholic acid is usually a major component of the selective culture medium, for example MacConkey agar, for G<sup>−</sup> bacteria, which has also been confirmed as a secondary metabolite of marine isolates and the soil bacterium <italic>Streptococcus faecium</italic>. Sannasiddappa <italic>et al</italic> have proved that taurocholic acid were able to inhibit growth of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> through increasing membrane permeability and disruption of the PMF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sannasiddappa <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Protocatechuic acid has been demonstrated to exert antimicrobial effects by disrupting the cell membranes, preventing bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bernal-Mercado <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Stojković <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Consequently, these toxic compounds were anticipated to accelerate the destruction of cell membrane and thus enhance the antibacterial activity.</p>

<title>The CheA of chemosensory system and virulence-related protein SpvD were critical for the bacteriostatic synergistic effect of AEC combination</title>
<p>Flagellar motility is intimately connected to chemotaxis, biofilm formation, colonisation and virulence of many bacterial pathogens. It is generally regulated by a chemotactic signaling system, which enables their movement toward favorable conditions and invade their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bolton, 2015</xref>). The chemotaxis proteins CheA, CheW, CheY, methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) have already been identified as core components and present in all chemotaxis systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Minamino <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). The <italic>Salmonella</italic> flagellum is composed of about 30 different proteins, such as FliD (the filament cap), FlgK and FlgL (the hook-filament junction) <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Minamino <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Tellingly, we have found an extensive down-regulation of chemotaxis and flagellar assembly related genes in S16 and S30 strains after AEC incubation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a-d</xref>). The overexpression of <italic>cheA</italic> in S16 strain, but not <italic>cheY</italic>, <italic>STMDT2-34621</italic>, <italic>aer</italic>, <italic>fliD</italic>, <italic>fliT</italic>, could lead to noticeable increases of MICs by 4 to 32 fold, after EC or AEC incubation (Table supplement 4). These results suggested that the down regulation of the central component of chemosensory system CheA may affect both chemotactic motility and general structure of flagellum, thus attenuating <italic>Salmonella</italic> survival after AEC treatment.</p>
<p>In addition to the above findings, we also noted that there were relatively large number of SDEGs, most of them were down-regulated, enriched in the ABC transports pathway in S16 and S30 strains after AEC incubation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e, f</xref>). ABC transporters are a class of transmembrane transporters, which mediate uptake of micronutrients, including saccharides, amino acids, metal ions <italic>et al</italic> and have also been shown to protect bacteria from hazardous compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Nguyen &amp; Götz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). The <italic>opuBB</italic> and <italic>opuBA</italic> encode components of the ABC-type proline/glycine betaine transport system, and their up-regulation were proved to promote accumulation of proline that acts as an osmoprotectant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dupre <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Similarly, the OsmU osmoprotectant systems, consisting of OsmV, OsmW, OsmY, and OsmX, were identified to enable bacterial survival at high-osmolarity through the accumulation of glycine betaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Frossard <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). The <italic>gltI</italic> gene encodes glutamate/aspartate transport protein, and its deletion in <italic>E. coli</italic> were shown to result in attenuated survival under antibiotics, acid, and hyperosmotic stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Niu <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Furthermore, the dipeptide permease operon (<italic>dpp</italic>), especially <italic>dppA</italic>, has been reported as an essential enzyme for survival of <italic>Mycobacteria tuberculosis</italic> under nutrient starvation conditions, and was associated with reduced bacterial burden in chronically infected mice in knockout studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fernando <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Unfortunately, the overexpression of <italic>opuBB</italic>, <italic>gltI</italic>, <italic>dppB</italic> and <italic>dppC</italic> genes caused no detectable change in MICs for S16 strain after AEC incubation (Table supplement 4). Thus, these observations suggest that overexpression of these SDEGs in ABC transporters were not sufficient enough for causing changes in COL susceptibility, and additional factors may be required for the excellent bactericidal activity of AEC.</p>
<p>Besides that, we also noticed that the expression levels of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection related genes <italic>sseJ</italic>, <italic>spvD</italic> and ribosomal protein genes <italic>rpmJ</italic>, <italic>rpmE</italic> were all strikingly changed in S16 strain (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 4a</xref>). SseL and SpvD are effectors of <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI1 and SPI2), which are required for full virulence during animal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Coombes <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Grabe <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). The <italic>rpmJ</italic> gene codified a part of 50S ribosomal subunit, and its up-regulation has been related to size increase and slow growth of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells under starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Peredo-Lovillo <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). The overexpression of <italic>spvD</italic> gene in S16 strain could attenuate the antibacterial activity of AC and AEC regimen with 4 fold increase in MICs (Table supplement 4), which indicated that the virulence-related protein SpvD contributed to the increase of COL susceptibility after AEC incubation.</p>

<title>Artesunate can be considered as a potential MCR-1 inhibitor that enhances the efficacy of colistin</title>
<p>During our research process, several phenomenon have caught our attention, that the synergistic effect of AEC combination was irrelevant to whether the <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic> gene exists or not, and the <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>−</sup> strain S16 exhibited more robust changes than that of <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>+</sup> strain S30 in different KEGG pathways. These results indicated that AS and EDTA were possible to exert synergistic effects by blocking the broad-spectrum resistance mechanisms (eg. efflux pumps, membrane damage), and coupling with the drug-specific resistance mechanisms (eg. MCR-1, β-lactamase). Previously, AS was capable of significantly enhancing the antibacterial activity of β-lactam antibiotics against <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, via inhibition of the efflux pumps such as AcrB, NorA, NorB, and NorC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). Molecular docking experiments showed that AS could dock into AcrB very well forming five hydrogen bonds with Ser46, Gln89 and Gln176 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wu <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Whereas, in this paper, the inhibitory actions of different medication regimens on efflux pump were only observed in <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>−</sup> strain S16, regardless of whether AS was added (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 4c</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesised that AS may exert synergistic effects with COL against <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>+</sup> S30 strain by targeting MCR-1 rather than efflux pump.</p>
<p>MCR-1 comprises two distinct domains, an N-terminal transmembrane domain and a soluble C-terminal α/β/α sandwich domain where the active site located. The active site contains a concentration of metal-binding residues to accommodate between one and four zinc ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wei <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Several crystal structures of the soluble domain have been well studied, and six residues GLU246, THR285, HIS395, ASP465, HIS466, and HIS478 were found conserved among pEtN transferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ma <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Especially the THR285 residue, which was highly conserved and providing a distinct electronegative potential to attract and bind the substrate pEtN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Son <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Mutations of these residues and stripping the metals by EDTA could re-establish polymyxin B antibacterial action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hinchliffe <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hu <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Stojanoski <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). In this paper, we firstly analyzed the relative expression of <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic> in S30 strain after the incubation of different medication regimens, and found a striking down-regulation of <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic> gene whether after AC, EC incubation or AEC incubation, when compered to that of A and E treatment (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 4b</xref>). Additionally, we performed the molecular docking between AS and MCR-1 to predict if there were possible interactions, and found that AS could bind to the residues arrounding the reported key residues within MCR-1 of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, forming seven hydrogen bonds with THR283, SER284, TYR287, PRO481, and ASN482 residues (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 4e</xref>). The interaction between AS and MCR-1 was further proved by competitive inhibitory assays, that the binding of AS with MCR-1 was blocked after the addition of polypeptide P<sub>u</sub> (containing unmutated THR283, SER284, and TYR287 sites) and lead to significant increases of MICs by 8 fold after AC or AEC treatment (Table supplement 5). Nevertheless, we also noticed that the blocking effect could not be removed by peptide P<sub>m</sub> (containing mutated THR283, SER284, and TYR287 sites) when EDTA exists. We supposed that EDTA may chelate zinc ions that required for MCR-1 activity. Thus, we suggested that AS could be developed as the a MCR-1 inhibitor, and coupled with the chelating agent EDTA may favor to additionally magnify its inhibitory effect.</p>
<p>In summary, our results established that the combination of COL with AS and EDTA was a promising candidate for combating infections caused by MCR-negative and -positive COL-resistant <italic>Salmonella</italic>. The membrane-damaging effect, accumulation of toxic compounds, inhibition of MCR-1 were supposed to play synergistic roles in reversing COL resistance of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). The CheA of chemosensory system and virulence-related protein SpvD were critical for the bacteriostatic synergistic effects of AEC combination. Selectively targeting CheA, SpvD or MCR using the natural compound AS could be further investigated as an attractive strategy for treatment of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection.</p>

<p>The ROS-sensitive fluorescence indicator 2’, 7’-dichlorodihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA, 10 μM) was used to assess the ROS levels in bacterial cells. Bacterial suspensions in PBS were mixed with DCFH-DA and incubated for 0.5 h, then different drug combinations were added and incubated for another 1 h and 6 h. Finally, fluorescence intensity were measured at an excitation wavele of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm.</p>

<title>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> assay</title>
<p>The bacterial culture conditions and sample preparation were same as the fluorescent probe-permeability assays section. The luminescence absorbancy were measured by a Spapk 10 M Microplate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). The cellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were assessed according to the kit procedure by using an Hydrogen Peroxide Assay Kit. Cells samples were prepared as described above and incubated with different drug combinations for 1.5 h. Cell precipitates were collected by centrifugation (10000 rpm), and 200 µL lysis solution were added under gentle shaking. Supernatants were then taken for luminescence (Abosorbance) detection at 560 nm.</p>

<p>Overnight S16 (<italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>−</sup>) culture was diluted 1:100 in fresh LB medium and grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.7. Cells were then divided equally and different drug combinations were added, same as that in the fluorescent probe-permeability assays section. After 6 h incubation at 37 ℃, cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4 ℃ for 24 h. Samples were then stained in 1% osmium tetroxide and dehydrated in a series of increasing ethanol concentrations (30% – 100%). The processed samples were dried in Critical Point Dryer (Quorum K850) and sputter-coated with gold. Finally, samples were observed and images were taken with SEM (HITACHI, SU8100).</p>

<title>Animals and treatments</title>
<p>A total of 36 SPF Kunming mice (Six to eight-week-old, 18-22 g, half male and half female) were purchased from the Huaxing Experimental Animal Center of Zhengzhou (Zhengzhou, China) and divided into six groups (n = 6 per group): (1) PBS control group; (2) COL (10 mg/kg) group; (3) AS (15 mg/kg) group; (4) AS (15 mg/kg) + COL (10 mg/kg) group; (5) EDTA (50 mg/kg) + COL (10 mg/kg) group; (6) AS (15 mg/kg) + EDTA (50 mg/kg)+ COL (10 mg/kg) group. Each mice was intraperitoneally injected with 100 µL bacterial solution (1.31 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU). Treatment was initiated at 2 h post infection and continued for 3 days. Treatment was administered once per day by intraperitoneal injection according to the therapeutic dose mentioned above. Mices were all euthanized and spleen, liver of aseptic were collected, weighed, homogenized with PBS. Then the tissue homogenates were serially diluted with PBS in an appropriate amount and 100 μL of each dilution was withdrawn and uniformly spread on SS agar plates. Bacterial counts were computed and presented as the mean ± SD log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL, after incubated at 37℃ for 16 to 18 h. Mice were maintained in a barrier facility and guaranteed strict compliance with the regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals approved by the State Council of People’s Republic of China (11–14– 1988).The mouse experiments were approved by the Henan Science and Technology Department (protocol number SCXK 2019-0002).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study addresses the growing threat of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, focusing on the efficacy of colistin (COL), a last-resort antibiotic, and its enhanced activity when combined with artesunate (AS) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) against colistin-resistant Salmonella strains. The researchers aim to explore whether these combinations can restore the effectiveness of colistin and understand the underlying mechanisms. The study used a combination of microbiological and molecular techniques to evaluate the antibacterial activity and mechanisms of action of COL, AS, and EDTA.</p>
<p>Key methods include:</p>
<p>(1) Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing: Determining minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of COL, AS, and EDTA, both alone and in combination, against various Salmonella strains;</p>
<p>(2) Time-Kill Assays: Measuring bacterial growth inhibition over time with different drug combinations;</p>
<p>(3) Fluorescent Probe-Permeability Assays: Assessing cell membrane integrity using fluorescent dyes;</p>
<p>(4) Proton Motive Force Assay: Evaluating the impact on the electrochemical proton gradient (PMF);</p>
<p>(5) Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Measurement: Quantifying intracellular ROS levels; (vi) Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM): Observing morphological changes in bacterial cells; and</p>
<p>(6) Omics Analysis: Transcriptome and metabolome profiling to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and significant differential metabolites (SDMs).</p>
<p>The combination of COL, AS, and EDTA (AEC) showed significant antibacterial activity against colistin-resistant Salmonella strains, reducing the MICs and enhancing bacterial killing compared to individual treatments. The AEC treatment caused extensive damage to both the outer and inner bacterial membranes, as evidenced by increased fluorescence of membrane-impermeant dyes and SEM images showing deformed cell membranes. AEC treatment selectively collapsed the Δψ component of PMF, indicating disruption of vital cellular processes. The combination therapy increased intracellular ROS levels, contributing to bacterial killing. Transcriptome data revealed changes in genes related to two-component systems, flagellar assembly, and ABC transporters. Metabolome analysis highlighted disruptions in pathways such as arachidonic acid metabolism. The findings suggest that AS and EDTA can potentiate the antibacterial effects of colistin by disrupting bacterial membranes, collapsing PMF, and increasing ROS levels. This combination therapy could serve as a promising approach to combat colistin-resistant Salmonella infections.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study employs a wide range of techniques to thoroughly investigate the antibacterial mechanisms and efficacy of the drug combinations.</p>
<p>(2) The results are consistent across multiple assays and supported by both in vitro and in vivo data.</p>
<p>(3) Combining AS and EDTA with COL represents a novel strategy to tackle antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The study focuses on a limited number of Salmonella strains, and broader testing on various MDR pathogens would strengthen the findings.</p>
<p>(2) While the study elucidates several mechanisms, further molecular details could provide deeper insights into the interactions between these drugs and bacterial targets.</p>
<p>(3) The time-kill experiment was conducted over 12 hours instead of the recommended 24 hours. To demonstrate a synergistic effect among the drugs, a reduction of at least 2 log10 in colony count should be shown in a 24-hour experiment. Additionally, clarifying the criteria for selecting drug concentrations is important to improve the interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>(4) While the combination of EDTA, artesunate, and colistin shows promising in vitro results against Salmonella strains, the clinical application of this combination warrants careful consideration due to potential toxicity issues associated with these compounds.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study by Zhai et al describes repurposing of artesunate, to be used in combination with EDTA to resensitize Salmonella spp. to colistin. The observed effect applied both to strains with and without mobile colistin resistance determinants (MCR). It was already known that EDTA in combination with colistin has an inhibitory effect on MCR-enzymes, but at the same time, both colistin and EDTA can contribute to nephrotoxicity, something which is also true for artesunate. Thus, the triple combination of three nephrotoxic agents has significant challenges in vivo, which is not particularly discussed in this paper.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is sound from a methodological point of view and has many interesting angles to address mechanistically how the three compounds can synergize.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The selection of strains is not very clear. Nothing is known about the sequence types of the strains or how representative they are for strains circulating in general. Thus, it is difficult to generalize from this limited number of isolates, although the studies done in these isolates are comprehensive.</p>
<p>(2) Nothing is known about the susceptibility of the strains to other novel antimicrobial agents. Colistin has a limited role in the treatment of gram-negative infections, and although it can be used sometimes in combination, it is not clear why it would be combined with two other nephrotoxic agents and how this could have relevance in a clinical setting.</p>
<p>(3) It is not clear whether their transcriptomics analysis should at least be carried out in duplicate for reasons of being able to assess reproducibility. It is also not clear why the samples were incubated for 6 hours - no discussion is presented on the selection of a time point for this.</p>
<p>(4) Discussion is lacking on the reproducibility and selection of details for the methodology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have studied the combination of three compounds, artesunate, EDTA, and colistin, to improve the activity of colistin instead of artesunate and colistin, which is weakly active. The three compounds appeared to possess activity against macr1 Salmonella both in vitro and in vivo.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A strong panel of experiments has been carried out.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Number of strains tested.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of data on cytotoxicity.</p>
