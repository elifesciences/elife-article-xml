<title>Abstract</title><p>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease, the pathophysiology and genetic basis of which are incompletely understood. Using a forward genetic screen in multiplex families with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) we identified an association between SLE and compound heterozygous deleterious variants in the non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) ACK1 and BRK. Experimental blockade of ACK1 or BRK increased circulating autoantibodies <italic>in vivo</italic> in mice and exacerbated glomerular IgG deposits in an SLE mouse model. Mechanistically, non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) regulate activation, migration, and proliferation of immune cells. We found that the patients’ ACK1 and BRK variants impair efferocytosis, the MERTK-mediated anti-inflammatory response to apoptotic cells, in human induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (hiPSC)-derived macrophages, which may contribute to SLE pathogenesis. Overall, our data suggest that ACK1 and BRK deficiencies are associated with human SLE and impair efferocytosis in macrophages.</p>

Ten multiplex families with lupus have been enrolled from Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Hospital in London, UK from July 2010 to January 2012, following stringent criteria: a severe phenotype (lupus nephritis for at least 1 patient in each family), and a familial disease (≥2 family members affected in first degree). A total of 24 patients and 17 healthy controls from different ethnic origins (5 African ancestry, 4 Asian ancestry and 1 European ancestry) were selected. The patients each met the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) classification criteria for SLE2. Lupus nephritis was confirmed by a kidney biopsy classified per the 2004 ISN/RPS (International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society) classification and verified independently by 2 renal histopathologists.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune rheumatic disease, characterized by the presence of circulating autoantibodies against nuclear antigens. Clinical manifestations vary among affected individuals and can involve many organs and systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, lungs, nervous system, and hematopoietic system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The prevalence of SLE ranges from 0.4 to 2 /1,000, and varies with sex, age, and ancestry, being more common in women of childbearing age and individuals of African, Asian, and Hispanic ancestry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Sex, hormones, and environmental factors, including drugs and chemical exposures, viral infections, and sunlight, contribute to disease. At present specific therapies for SLE are few and far between <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, and clinical manifestations such as lupus nephritis, one of the most common and serious manifestations of SLE, remain a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The contribution of genetics to SLE is supported by epidemiological data showing familial aggregation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and higher concordance rates between monozygotic than dizygotic twins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, the association of autosomal recessive deficiency in PKCdelta or DNAse1L3 with familial SLE, and similar phenotypes in the corresponding mouse models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In addition, genome wide association studies in large populations of patients have implicated a number of genes associated with immune system function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, and an SLE-like disease is observed in a proportion of patients with immunodeficiency due to autosomal recessive or X-linked C1q, C1r/s, C2, C4, and NADPH-Oxidase deficiencies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, with Rasopathies due to autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in the RAS pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, and a proportion of patients presenting with interferonopathies with bi-allelic or mono-allelic mutations in genes coding for nucleic acid sensors such as TREX1, STING, SAMHD1, ADAR, and IFIH1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study we performed a forward genetic screen in multiplex SLE families with a well-defined phenotype, lupus nephritis, to identify new SLE causing genes and molecular pathways involved in SLE. We report the characterization of novel and rare deleterious variant alleles of two genes encoding the non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTK) Tyrosine Kinase Non-Receptor 2 / Activated CDC42 kinase 1 (TNK2/ACK1) and Protein Tyrosine Kinase 6 / Breast Tumor Kinase (PTK6/BRK) in two multiplex families. The variant alleles strongly decrease ACK1 and BRK kinase activity. ACK1 and BRK were shown to control B-cell and T-cell proliferation, survival, and activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Although ACK1- and BRK-genetic deficiency <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> or their pharmacological inhibition does not result in spontaneous lupus development in C57BL/6 mice, we show that ACK1 or BRK inhibitors aggravate IgG glomerular deposition in the kidneys of BALB/cByJ mice treated with pristane to induce a lupus-like disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and increases serum autoantibody levels. NRTKs mediate phosphorylation of downstream effectors, including RAC1, AKT, and STAT1/3, which are involved in immune cells homeostasis, and their deficiency can cause autoimmunity through different mechanisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. NRTKs such as ACK1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, Src <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, and PTK2/FAK <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> are also targets of MERTK, which mediates efferocytosis, the recognition of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) on apoptotic cells for their anti-inflammatory engulfment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. MERTK deficiency is a cause of SLE-like disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. We found that the patients’ ACK1 and BRK variants are kinase dead in response to MERTK activation and fail to phosphorylate AKT and STAT3, and to activate RAC1. Human iPSC-derived macrophages from patients and isogenic variants presented with defective AKT/STAT3 driven anti-inflammatory response and control of TNF and IL1β production in response to apoptotic cells and had a modest decrease in uptake of apoptotic cells, in comparison to familial and isogenic controls. In contrast, ACK1 and BRK kinase activity are dispensable for the phagocytosis of polystyrene beads, opsonized cells, and microbes. These results altogether suggest that ACK1 and BRK deficiencies underlie SLE in the two families, and that a defective efferocytic response to apoptotic cells may contribute to the auto-immune phenotype of the patients.</p>

<title>NRTK compound heterozygous missense variants in two multiplex families with SLE</title>
<p>We recruited 10 multiplex SLE families, each with 2 or 3 individuals diagnosed with biopsy confirmed lupus nephritis, classified according to the SLICC criteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> for whom we obtained genomic DNA (blood) in the Louise Coote Lupus Clinic at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals, London. We collected peripheral blood from a total of 22 patients and 17 relatives. Thirty five percent (%) of patients were male, and the same proportion were diagnosed before the age of 18 years. Genomic DNA was submitted to whole exome sequencing. Polymorphisms with a minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt;0.01 in the publicly available database gnomAD (120,000 individuals), 1,000 genome Project (2,504 individuals) and our in-house database (&gt;10,000 individuals) were excluded from analysis. We analyzed each kindred independently, under X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive models of inheritance, and this analysis identified candidate genes in two kindreds.</p>
<p>In Family 1, we identified compound heterozygous missense variants in the non-receptor tyrosine kinase (NRTK) ACK1, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig1-S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>). The 2 patients were males and developed a class IV lupus nephritis between age 10-15. The K161Q allele was inherited from one parent and A156T from the other (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Principal components analysis (PCA) based on the whole-exome sequencing to analyze population structure, parental inbreeding, and familial linkage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> reveals South Asian ancestry, the closest 1,000 Genomes Project individuals being those from North India (India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, see Methods). The ACK1 mutant alleles, A156T and K161Q (transcript ENST00000333602, <xref rid="fig1-S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>), have not been reported in South Asian (31,442 alleles) or other populations from public database (gnomAD, 1,000 genomes project) or our own in-house databases of &gt;10,000 exomes of patients with infectious phenotypes. Finally, these variants were not found in DNA from 100 individuals from the small southeastern island from which they originated (see Methods). Altogether, ACK1 mutant alleles, A156T and K161Q are private to this family and their segregation is compatible with an autosomal recessive trait with complete penetrance.</p>

<p>In Family 2, we identified compound heterozygous missense variants in another NRTK, BRK in three siblings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1-S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>). Two patients developed lupus nephritis, and the third patient developed a severe panniculitis, between the ages of 20 and 30 years. Two patients were female and one male. One parent, who was not genotyped, probably transmitted the G321R to their children, and the 2 other parents (who are also siblings) transmitted the G257A allele (only one parent was available for genotyping) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1-S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2</xref>). An unaffected sibling (2.III.2) carries the G321R allele but not the G257A allele (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1-S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2</xref>). PCA analysis showed that individuals from family 2 have Sub-Saharan African ancestry, with the closest populations of 1,000 genomes project being African Caribbean in Barbados and African Ancestry in Southwest US and Luhya in Webuye in Kenya (see Methods). These 2 BRK mutant alleles, G257A and G321R are reported with a maximum MAF of ~ 8×10<sup>−5</sup> and 5×10<sup>−3</sup> respectively in Sub-Saharan African subpopulations (<xref rid="fig1-S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>), predicting a homozygosity frequency of ~ 10<sup>−8</sup> and 10<sup>−6</sup> respectively. These alleles are extremely rare outside Africa in the non-African gnomAD populations. These results are fully consistent under a recessive model with the overall prevalence of SLE (40 to 200 per 100,000 individuals). Genes that may cause SLE with high or low penetrance in accordance with their inheritance mode (<xref rid="fig1-S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 3</xref>) were not candidates in these kindreds.</p>

<p>ACK1 and BRK sequences are highly conserved in human populations, when compared with other species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Apart from the alleles we report here, only 90 and 35 predicted loss of function (LOF) alleles are reported in gnomAD for ACK1 or BRK respectively, with MAFs ≤ 10<sup>−4</sup>, and none of them reported in homozygosity. Conversely, we examined the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase activity of ACK1 mutants with a MAF≥0.005 and reported as homozygous in gnomAD (n=4). <italic>In vitro</italic> kinase activity of these variants was normal (<xref rid="fig2-S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2A-C</xref>). There was no BRK mutant with MAF≥0.005 reported as homozygous in gnomAD. Thus, autosomal recessive deficiency for either protein, whether complete or partial, is expected to be well below 1/100,000 in the general population, which is compatible with autosomal recessive ACK1 and BRK deficiencies underlying SLE in patients from these two kindreds. To investigate whether ACK1/TNK2 or BRK/PTK6 were subject to selection, we gathered data using different metrics quantifying negative selection in the human genome. Analysis of f parameter from SnIPRE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, lofTool <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, evoTol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, and CoNeS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> metrics, as well as intraspecies metrics from RVIS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, LOEUF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, and pLI / pRec <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> suggested that the genes are not under strong negative selection, consistent with the deficiency being recessive (<xref rid="fig2-S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p>

<title>ACK1 and BRK inhibition promotes autoimmunity in Balb/c mice</title>
<p>ACK1- and BRK-deficient T cells are characterized by increased proliferation and activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.

We therefore investigated the consequences of inhibiting ACK1 and BRK kinase activity in wild-type (WT) BALB/cByJ female mice which are more susceptible to developing autoimmunity. For this purpose groups of BALB/cByJ mice were either left untreated of received a single intraperitoneal injection of pristane to induce a lupus-like disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and a weekly injection of ACK1 or BRK inhibitors Aim100 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> and Cpd4f <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, or DMSO vehicle alone for 12 weeks. In the absence of pristane, mice that received ACK1 or BRK inhibitors developed a large array of circulating anti-nuclear IgG antibodies, including but not limited to autoantibodies associated with SLE such as anti-histones, anti-chromatin, anti U1-snRNP, anti-SSA, and anti-Ku (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). These data suggested that ACK1 and BRK inhibition are sufficient to promote autoimmunity in mice. We did not observe glomerular deposit of IgG at 12 weeks in these mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B,C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3-S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, BALB/cByJ mice which received pristane treatment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> in addition to either ACK1 or BRK inhibitors had increased kidney glomerular deposits of IgG as well as increased serum autoantibody levels including anti-Ku (p70/p80), LA/SSB, Ro-SSA, Histone H4 and H2B, in comparison to DMSO vehicle controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3-S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, inhibition of ACK1 or BRK increase serum autoantibody titers and worsen pristane-induced Lupus in WT BALB/cByJ mice. Together with the above genetic analysis, these findings support the hypothesis that autosomal recessive ACK1 and BRK kinase deficiency may underlie or contribute to the development of SLE in children and young adults depending on genetic and environmental context.</p>

<title>ACK1 and BRK kinase deficiency disrupts the anti-inflammatory response driven by apoptotic cells in macrophages</title>
<p>Efferocytosis can be carried out by multiple cell types, however macrophages are the main contributors in this process <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref></sup>.

GSEA analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated that, in contrast to control, ACK1- and BRK-deficient macrophages, as well as WT macrophages treated with ACK1 or BRK inhibitors failed to upregulate gene sets associated with AKT signaling and the negative regulation of the inflammatory response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Transcriptional repressors including the AKT targets ATF3, TGIF1, NFIL3, and KLF4, the STAT3 targets SOCS3 and DUSP5, as well as CEBPD and the inhibitor of E-BOX DNA Binding ID3 were among the top-ten genes which expression is induced by apoptotic cells in WT macrophages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), but this regulation was lost in mutant and inhibitor-treated macrophages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). ATF3, TGIF1, NFIL3, and KLF4 are involved in the negative regulation of inflammation in macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup>, SOCS3 is an inhibitor of the macrophage inflammatory response and DUSP5 is a negative regulator of ERK activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>.

<p>Decreased TNF gene expression by macrophages in response to apoptotic cells was prevented by the ACK1 inhibitor (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>), but the production of TNF at the protein level is not detectable by ELISA in this model (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). MERTK-deficient mice are susceptible to LPS-induced endotoxic shock <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup>, and MERTK-dependent anti-inflammatory program elicited by apoptotic cells on macrophages is best evidenced by the reduction of LPS-mediated production of inflammatory mediators such as TNF or IL1β <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup>.

Similarly, isogenic variants and control macrophages produced similar amounts of IL1β in response to LPS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>), but apoptotic cells only decreased IL1β production by isogenic macrophages and not by mutant macrophages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>).

We assessed actin-ring formation by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy in frustrated apoptotic engulfment assays on PtdSer-coated glass slides. Wild-type iPSC-derived macrophages formed a typical actin-ring, however isogenic ACK1 and BRK mutant macrophages presented with an altered actin-ring (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), and a reduced actin clearance factor (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating an impairment of actin remodeling following binding to PtdSer.

<p>We therefore investigated whether this defect translated to a reduced uptake of apoptotic cells by macrophages. We found that engulfment of apoptotic thymocytes labeled with the pH sensitive probe pHrodo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup> was only moderately reduced, by 10 to 20% in ACK1 and BRK isogenic mutant macrophages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). This phenotype, although modest, was reproducible by a 30-minute exposure of WT macrophages to two different ACK1 inhibitors, Aim100 (2 µM) and R-9b <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref></sup> (4 µM), and to the BRK inhibitor Cpd4f (0.5 μM) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). This reduced uptake of apoptotic cells was not attributable to a global engulfment defect, because ACK1 and BRK genetic kinase deficiency or inhibitors did not prevent Fc-dependent phagocytosis of a large cargo such as opsonized red blood cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>), or the uptake of polystyrene beads (<xref rid="fig5-S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A</xref>) or microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi (<xref rid="fig5-S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Altogether, these data show that the kinase activity of ACK1 and BRK participate to the formation of phagocytic synapse but are largely dispensable for engulfment of apoptotic cells and are not required for phagocytosis of microbes and opsonized cargo.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we combined whole exome sequencing and forward genetic analysis in multiplex SLE families, with a biochemical analysis of genetic variants, murine studies, and functional approaches in human iPSC-derived macrophages to identify novel genes the mutations of which may underlie SLE. In two unrelated families, we identified compound heterozygous loss-of-function or hypomorph variants in the kinase domains of two non-receptors tyrosine kinases, TNK2/ACK1 and PTK6/BRK. Patients from the two families were children or young adults and presented with a severe clinical form of SLE, lupus nephritis. However, we analyzed 27 GWAS studies of SLE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gwascentral.org/">https://www.gwascentral.org/</ext-link>), and none of them reported a common variant in the close vicinity of the TNK2/ACK1 or PTK6/BRK genes with a p-value lower than 5×10<sup>−8</sup>, a statistical threshold of genome-wide significance for GWAS. ACK1 and BRK deficiency are thus likely to only account for the genetic basis of SLE in a minority of patients. Nevertheless, ACK1 and BRK kinase inhibitors aggravate autoimmunity and IgG glomerular deposits in BALB/cByJ mice. Altogether, the present data indicate that autosomal recessive TNK2/ACK1 and PTK6/BRK kinase deficiency probably underlie the development of SLE in a small proportion of children and young adults, depending on genetic and environmental context.</p>
<p>Defective efferocytosis has been shown to contribute to autoimmunity in mice and is relevant to the pathogenesis of SLE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>. Our results also suggest that TNK2/ACK1 and PTK6/BRK kinase deficiencies, in addition to dysregulating B and T cell survival and activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, also impairs the MERTK-dependent anti-inflammatory response of the patients’ macrophages to apoptotic cells during efferocytosis, and to a lesser extent the engulfment of the apoptotic cells. MERTK-dependent engulfment of apoptotic cells and anti-inflammatory response were shown to be distinct and separable <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref></sup>. The NRTK PTK2/FAK and Src are important for the former <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref></sup>, while PTK2/FAK is dispensable for the latter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Our experiments suggest that in contrast, TNK2/ACK1 and PTK6/BRK are more important for the control of TNF and IL1β production than for engulfment itself. Altogether, our observations identify a rare Mendelian cause of severe SLE and a role for the NRTK TNK2/ACK1 and PTK6/BRK in efferocytosis, thereby contributing to a molecular and cellular dissection of SLE.</p>

Ten multiplex families with lupus have been enrolled from Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Hospital in London, UK from July 2010 to January 2012, following stringent criteria: a severe phenotype (lupus nephritis for at least 1 patient in each family), and a familial disease (≥2 family members affected in first degree). A total of 24 patients and 17 healthy controls from different ethnic origins (5 African ancestry, 4 Asian ancestry and 1 European ancestry) were selected. The patients each met the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) classification criteria for SLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.

<title>Genetic analysis</title>
<p>Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) of the 10 multiplex families (patients and familial healthy controls) was performed at the New York Genomics Centre on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing machine. Genomic DNA extracted from the patients and familial healthy control’s peripheral blood cells were sheared with a Covaris S2 Ultrasonicator. An adapter-ligated library was prepared with the Paired-End Sample Prep kit V1 (Illumina). Exome capture was performed with the SureSelect Human All Exon kit (Agilent Technologies). Paired-end sequencing was performed on a HiSeq 2000, generating 100-base reads. For sequence alignment, variant calling and annotation, we used BWA aligner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref></sup> to align sequences with the human genome reference sequence (hg19 build). Downstream processing was performed with the Genome analysis toolkit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref></sup>, SAMtools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref></sup>, and Picard Tools. Substitution and indel calls were identified with a GATK Unified Genotyper and a GATK Indel GenotyperV2, respectively. All calls with a read coverage ≤2x and a Phred-scaled SNP quality of ≤20 were filtered out. All the variants were annotated with the GATK Genomic Annotator. Variants were annotated following their minor allele frequency (MAF) in Exome Variant Server, 1,000 Genomes Project, and Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), including the MAF in each ethnic subpopulation from gnomAD.</p>
<p>First, the variants have been prioritized at the gene level. We used the gene damage index (<italic>GDI</italic>) which provides the accumulated mutational damage of each human gene in healthy human population, based on the 1,000 Genomes Project database (Phase 3) gene variations of healthy individuals and of the CADD score for calculating impact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref></sup>. GDI is very effective to filter out variants harbored in highly damaged (high GDI) genes that are unlikely to be disease-causing. We used a cut-off of 13.84, the recommended GDI value above which a gene is unlikely to be disease-causing which is the 95% CI upper boundary value, removing 5% of the genes in our analysis.</p>
<p>Secondly, we prioritized variants at the allele level. We excluded variants that were too frequent in our in-house database to explain the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref></sup>. We then filtered out variants based on the predicted damaging impacts. The deleteriousness of each variant was assessed using in silico algorithms: CADD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/score">http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/score</ext-link>) and Mutation Significance Cutoff browser (MSC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pec630.rockefeller.edu/MSC/">http://pec630.rockefeller.edu/MSC/</ext-link>). MSC scores were generated using 99% confidence interval based on the CADD 1.3 scores of all disease causing-mutations in Human Gene Mutation Database for any given gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. We kept only the variants with a CADD/MSC higher than 1.</p>
<p>We thus analyzed our WES with the remaining variants by keeping all non-synonymous coding variants and essential splice site variants with a MAF according to the genetic model: 1) heterozygous variations with MAF &lt;10<sup>−4</sup> in all ethnic subpopulations under an autosomal dominant (AD) model; 2) homozygous or compound heterozygous variants with MAF &lt;10<sup>−2</sup> in all ethnic subpopulations) under an autosomal recessive (AR) model; and 3) hemizygous (male) or homozygous (female) variations with MAF &lt;10<sup>−4</sup> in all ethnic subpopulations under X-linked genetic models.</p>

<title>Derivation of Human iPSCs</title>
<p>Generation of iPSCs from frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed using a previously published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">126</xref></sup>. Briefly, PBMCs were cultured in QBSF-60 media supplemented with L-Asorbic Acid (50 µg/mL), human SCF (50 ng/mL) (R&amp;D; 255-SC-010/CF), human IL-3 (10 ng/mL) (Peprotech; 200-03), human EPO (2 U/mL) (R&amp;D; 287-TC-500), IGF-1 (40 ng/mL) (R&amp;D; 291-G1-200), and Dexamethasone (1 µM) (Sigma; D8893-1MG) for 9 to 12 days to expand the erythroblast population. Then 4 Sendai viral vectors (ThermoFisher Scientific; A16517) expressing Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, or c-Myc are used for transduction of 2.5×10<sup>5</sup> cells with 10 MOI for each virus for 24 hr. At day 2 post transduction, cells were plated in a 6 well gelatin coated plate containing MEFs (ThermoFisher Scientific; A34181). After 9-12 days, small iPSCs colonies appear. At day 17-21, several colonies were picked and expanded individually into 1 well (12-well or 24-well plate) containing MEFs on gelatin in ESC media as detailed above, supplemented with 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; Peprotech; 100-18B). Five clones were established per cell line and were maintained in culture for 10 passages (2-3 months) to ensure stability of the lines. Two clones per cell line were selected and tested for chromosomal abnormality and showed a normal karyotype (46, XY or 46, XX). The other clones were frozen down.</p>

The slides were washed with PBS 2 times, and mounted using 170ul of ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen P36930) and high precision microscope cover glass (24X50mm; 170uM; No. 1.5H). Entire kidneys sections were imaged on confocal microscope with 10X objective.</p>
<p>To analyze IgG mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of glomeruli, podoplanin staining was used to algorithmically generate outlines around glomeruli in full kidney section images using ImageJ. The outlines were manually verified to remove incorrectly marked glomeruli and to outline the glomeruli the algorithm missed. Over 95% of all the glomeruli in a section (about 250 per whole longitudinal kidney section) were captured and analyzed for each mice (5 mice were analyzed for each condition (30 whole kidney sections in total)). The MFI of each outlined glomeruli was extracted with ImageJ.</p>

<title>Autoantigen Microarray Panel Profiling</title>
<p>For each sample, 10 µl of serum was treated with DNAse I, diluted 1:50, and incubated with autoantigen array. The autoantibodies binding to the antigens on the array were detected with Cy3 labeled anti-IgG. The arrays were scanned with GenePix® 4400A Microarray Scanner and the images were analyzed using GenePix 7.0 software to generate GPR files. The averaged net fluorescent intensity (NFI) of each autoantigen was normalized to internal (IgG) controls. Plotted values represent Ab Scores (Log<sub>2</sub> [antigen net fluorescence intensity (NFI) x signal to noise ratio (SNR)+1]. Heatmaps were plotted with Morpheus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/">https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/</ext-link>). Heatmap rows were sorted top to bottom starting with most significantly increased Ab Score in Cpd4f and AIM100 in comparison to DMSO treated mice. Single row P value between DMSO and Cpd4f or AIM100 mice was calculated by paired t test. Full panel P-values were calculated using a paired t test. Hierarchical clustering was done by one minus Pearson correlation with complete linkage method. K Means clustering was done by Euclidean distance, with 2 clusters, with 10000 maximum iterations.</p>

<title>Quantification and Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data are shown as mean with individual values or as bar plots with mean values and standard deviations. Statistical significance was analyzed with GraphPad Prism unless otherwise indicated (see below). Statistical significance was determined using a Student t test, Mann-Whitney, ordinary one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, or Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparisons tests depending on the number of conditions being compared and whether the data was normally distributed as determined by a Shapiro-Wilk normality test. P &lt; 0.05 values were considered statistically significant. R software was used for statistical analysis of RNA-seq data. For differential gene expression approach significance was considered for FDR (q value) &lt; 0.05. For gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) approach significance was considered for FDR (q value) &lt; 0.25 AND p-value &lt; 0.05.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors revealed that genetic deficiencies of ACK1 and BRK are associated with human SLE. First, the authors found that compound heterozygous deleterious variants in the kinase domains of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTK) TNK2/ACK1 in one multiplex family and PTK6/BRK in another family. Then, by an experimental blockade of ACK1 or BRK in a mouse SLE model, they found an increase in glomerular IgG deposits and circulating autoantibodies. Furthermore, they reported that ACK and BRK variants from the SLE patients impaired the MERTK-mediated anti-inflammatory response to apoptotic cells in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived macrophages. This work identified new SLE-associated ACK and BRK variants and a role for the NRTK TNK2/ACK1 and PTK6/BRK in efferocytosis, providing a new molecular and cellular mechanism of SLE pathogenesis.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors report compound heterozygous deleterious variants in the kinase domains of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTK) TNK2/ACK1 in familial SLE. They suggest that ACK1 and BRK deficiencies are associated with human SLE and impair efferocytosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The identification of similar mutations in non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) in two different families with familial SLE is a significant finding in human disease. Furthermore, the paper provides a detailed analysis of the molecular mechanisms behind the impairment of efferocytosis caused by mutations in ACK1 and BRK.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A critical point in this paper is whether the loss of function of ACK1 or BRK contributes to the onset of familial SLE. The authors emphasize that inhibitors of ACK1/BRK worsened IgG deposition in the kidneys in a pristane-induced SLE model, which contributes not to the onset but to the exacerbation of SLE, thus only partially supporting their claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The evidence supporting that the loss of function of ACK1 or BRK contributes to the onset of SLE in the patients from the 2 families mostly relies on the genetic analysis. As the reviewer states, the observation that inhibitors of ACK1/BRK worsened IgG deposition in the kidneys in a pristane-induced SLE model supports the genetic evidence.</p>
<p>To further address the possible role of ACK1 or BRK variants in the onset of autoimmunity <italic>in vivo,</italic> we treated wild-type (WT) BALB/cByJ female mice with inhibitors in the absence of pristane.</p>
<p>The results indicated that mice that had received a weekly injection of ACK1 or BRK inhibitors developed a large array of serum anti-nuclear IgG antibodies, including but not limited to autoantibodies associated with SLE such as anti-histones, anti-chromatin, anti U1-snRNP, anti-SSA, and anti-Ku in comparison to the control group inhibitor treated mice (Revised Fig 3A). However, they did not develop glomerular deposit of IgG after 12 weeks of treatment, in contrast to mice that have received Pristane (Revised Fig. 3B,C, Figure 3-figure supplement 1).</p>
<p>These additional data suggests that inhibition of ACK1 and BRK stimulates the production of serum autoantibodies, which strengthen the claim that ACK1 and BRK kinase deficiency contribute to autoimmunity in BALB/cByJ.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors revealed that genetic deficiencies of ACK1 and BRK are associated with human SLE. First, the authors found that compound heterozygous deleterious variants in the kinase domains of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTK) TNK2/ACK1 in one multiplex family and PTK6/BRK in another family. Then, by an experimental blockade of ACK1 or BRK in a mouse SLE model, they found an increase in glomerular IgG deposits and circulating autoantibodies. Furthermore, they reported that ACK and BRK variants from the SLE patients impaired the MERTK-mediated anti-inflammatory response to apoptotic cells in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived macrophages. This work identified new SLE-associated ACK and BRK variants and a role for the NRTK TNK2/ACK1 and PTK6/BRK in efferocytosis, providing a new molecular and cellular mechanism of SLE pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work identified new SLE-associated ACK and BRK variants and a role for the NRTK TNK2/ACK1 and PTK6/BRK in efferocytosis, providing a new molecular and cellular mechanism of SLE pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the manuscript is well-organized and clearly stated, there are some points below that should be considered:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors used forward genetic analyses to identify novel gene mutations that may cause SLE, combined with GWAS studies of SLE. To further explore the importance of these variants, haplotype analysis of two candidate genes could be performed, to observe the evolution and selection relationship of candidate genes in the population (UK 1000 biobank, for example).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To investigate whether ACK1/TNK2 or BRK/PTK6 were subject to selection, we gathered data using different metrics quantifying negative selection in the human genome. We collected the f parameter from SnIPRE1, lofTool2, and evoTol3, as well as intraspecies metrics from RVIS4, LOEUF5, and pLI6 (including pRec). We also used our in-house CoNeS metric7. None of these indicators suggest that the genes are under strong negative selection (Revised Figure 2-figure supplement 2). This is consistent with the deficiency being recessive. We also tested the variants with a MAF greater than 0.005. We found them to be neutral. We therefore did not test whether they were associated with any phenotype in the UK Biobank.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Although the authors focused on SLE and macrophage efferocytosis in their studies, direct evidence of how macrophage efferocytosis significantly affects SLE is lacking. This point should at least be explicitly introduced and discussed by citing appropriate literature.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We provide a more detailed description of the role of macrophage efferocytosis in autoimmunity and SLE in the revised manuscript. Specifically, we state (in the results section, paragraph: ACK1 and BRK kinase domain variants may lose the ability to link MERTK to RAC1, AKT and STAT3 activation for efferocytosis): <italic>“NRTKs such as ACK1 8 and PTK2/FAK 9 are also downstream targets of the TAM family receptor MERTK which is expressed on macrophages and controls the anti-inflammatory engulfment of apoptotic cells, a process known as efferocytosis 10-12. Efferocytosis allows for the clearance of apoptotic cells before they undergo necrosis and release intracellular inflammatory molecules, and simultaneously leads to increased production of anti-inflammatory molecules (TGFb, IL-10, and PGE2) and a decreased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1b, IL-6) 10-14. In line with these findings, mice deficient in molecular components used by macrophages to efficiently perform efferocytosis, such as MFG-E8, MERTK, TIM4, and C1q, develop phenotypes associated with autoimmunity10,11,14-27. Furthermore, defects in efferocytosis are also observed in patients with SLE and glomerulonephritis14,28-31.“</italic></p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is still not clear how the target molecules identified in this paper may influence macrophage efferocytosis. More direct evidence should be established.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our studies show that wt -but not variants- of ACK1 and BRK are activated by MERTK, a key receptor that mediates the recognition of apoptotic cells. Our studies also show that wt -but not variants- activate RAC1 which is necessary for engulfment and phosphorylate AKT and STAT3 which are involved in the anti-inflammatory response to PtdSer recognition.</p>
<p>The TAM family receptor MERTK mediates recognition of PtdSer on apoptotic cells via GAS6 and Protein S 10,15,32 leading to their engulfment, which involves activation of RAC1 for actin reorganization and the formation of a phagocytic cup 9,33. Using IP kinase assays we show that MERTK and GAS6 can activate the kinase activity of wild-type ACK1 8 or BRK but not of the patient’s ACK1 or BRK variant alleles (Figure 4D). To further support the role of ACK1 and BRK downstream from PtdSer recognition and uptake of apoptotic cells, we show that reference ACK1 and BRK alleles, in contrast to the patient variant alleles, can activate RAC1 to generate RAC-GTP which is necessary for engulfment 9,33 (Figure 4C).</p>
<p>PtdSer recognition also typically stimulates an anti-inflammatory process mediated in part via AKT 34 and STAT3 and their target genes such as SOCS3 35-41 and results in the inhibition of LPS-mediated production of inflammatory mediators such as TNF and IL-1b, and the production of cytokines such as IL-10, TGFb 11,25-27,42. Consistent with this literature and the findings of the paper, we show that reference ACK1 and BRK, unlike the patient’s variant alleles, can phosphorylate AKT and STAT3 (Figure 4A, B). The role of ACK1 and BRK in these signaling pathways is further supported by our transcriptomics data comparing the response of controls, patients, and inhibitor-treated iPSC-derived macrophages to apoptotic thymocytes by RNA-seq. Specifically, we show Transcriptional repressors including the AKT targets ATF3, TGIF1, NFIL3, and KLF4, the STAT3 targets SOCS3 and DUSP5, as well as CEBPD and the inhibitor of E-BOX DNA Binding ID3 were among the top-ten genes which expression is induced by apoptotic cells in WT macrophages (Figure 4F), but this regulation was lost in mutant and inhibitor-treated macrophages (Figure 4F).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For some transcriptional repressors mentioned in their studies, the authors should check whether there is clear experimental evidence. If not, it is recommended to supplement the experimental verifications for clarity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Transcriptional repressors including the AKT targets ATF3, TGIF1, NFIL3, and KLF4, the STAT3 targets SOCS3 and DUSP5, as well as CEBPD and the inhibitor of E-BOX DNA Binding ID3 were among the top-ten genes which expression is induced by apoptotic cells in WT macrophages (Figure 4F), but this regulation was lost in mutant and inhibitor-treated macrophages (Figure 4F).</p>
<p>In the manuscript we cited published evidence, to the best of our knowledge, for the role of these genes in the regulation of inflammatory responses. Specifically we state: “ATF3, TGIF1, NFIL3, and KLF4 are involved in the negative regulation of inflammation in macrophages 35-38, SOCS3 is an inhibitor of the macrophage inflammatory response and DUSP5 is a negative regulator of ERK activation 39,40,43. These data suggest that the kinase domain of ACK1 and BRK contribute to the macrophage anti-inflammatory gene expression program driven by apoptotic cells.”</p>

<p>In Figures 4C and 4D, it is seen that the usage of inhibitors causes cytoskeletal changes, however this reviewer would not have expected such large change. Did the authors check whether the cells die after heavy treatment by the inhibitors?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We carefully examine the viability of Isogenic WT, BRK and ACK1 mutant macrophages (left panel) and of WT macrophages treated with ACK1 or BRK inhibitors and we did not observed changes in viability (Figure 4-figure supplement 2).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>A crucial step in the development of SLE is the production of autoantibodies. It is shown in Figure 2F that inhibitors of ACK1/BRK enhanced the production of autoantibodies against histones and SSA in a pristane-induced SLE model, which is a significant result that could support the authors' claim. Strangely, this autoantigen panel does not include double-stranded DNA, RNP, or Sm, which should be presented regarding antibody production.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In the revised manuscript (Revised Figure 3 – Supplement 1) we added the remainder of the autoantibody panel, which includes double-stranded DNA, RNP, and Sm autoantibody levels. We also added the results for serum IgG autoantibody levels in BALB/cByJ mice treated for three months with DMSO, ACK1, or BRK inhibitors but did not receive a pristane injection (Revised Figure 3A). This data shows that mice which received ACK1 or BRK inhibitors had increased serum IgG autoantibodies in comparison to DMSO treated controls.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, if there is information that inhibitors of ACK1/BRK promote the differentiation of follicular helper T cells, memory B cells, and plasma cells in a pristane-induced SLE model, it could be considered indirect evidence supporting the authors' claims.</p>

<p>These are not available at present to the best of our knowledge.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>* In the literature, unpaired t-tests and ordinary one-way ANOVA (Tukey's multiple comparisons test) were used for statistical analysis, which requires data to be normally distributed. This part of the proposal is reflected in the text, and the non-conforming results need to be statistically analyzed using the non-parametric test of graphpad prism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out this oversight. In the revised manuscript, for all applicable datasets, we tested whether the data was normally distributed using a Shapiro-Wilk normality test. For datasets that were normally distributed statistical significance was determined by a Student t test or ordinary one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test depending on the number of conditions being compared and the experimental setup. In contrast, for datasets that were not normally distributed statistical significance was determined using a Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparisons tests, or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test depending on the experimental setup. P values below 0.05 were considered significant for all statistical tests.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors used different methods to represent the level of significant difference. Therefore, it is suggested that the significance level should be expressed by letters.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by the reviewer, in the revised manuscript we have designated the significance level throughout all figures using letters (p, or q values).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For RNA-seq, more information should be provided in the paper. For example, the correlation between sample biological replicates, the total number of differentially expressed genes, and randomly selected genes for qRT-PCR results verification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out this oversight. In the revised manuscript we provided more information regarding the RNA-seq dataset, including a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showing correlation between sample replicates (Revised Figure 4-figure supplement 1A), as well as a table indicating the number of upregulated and downregulated genes between relevant datasets (Revised Figure 4-figure supplement 1B).</p>
<p>The results of the RNA-seq analysis indicated that ACK1 and BRK contribute to the macrophage anti-inflammatory gene expression program driven by apoptotic cells. MERTK-dependent anti-inflammatory program elicited by apoptotic cells on macrophages is best evidenced by the reduction of LPS-mediated production of inflammatory mediators such as TNF or IL1b 25-27,34,44. Therefore, to validate the RNA-seq results in a functional manner we tested the decrease of LPS-induced production of TNF and IL1b by apoptotic cells in isogenic WT, ACK1 deficient, and BRK deficient macrophages. Consistent with the RNA-seq data, the functional assays indicated that ACK1 and BRK kinase activities are required for the decrease of TNF and IL1b production induced by LPS in response to apoptotic cells (Revised Figure 4H,I).</p>
<p>The raw data files for the RNA-seq analysis have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GEO: GSE118730.</p>
