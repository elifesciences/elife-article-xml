<title>Abstract</title><p>Repression of retrotransposition is crucial for the successful fitness of a mammalian organism. The domesticated transposon protein L1TD1, derived from LINE-1 ORF1p, is an RNA-binding protein that is expressed only in some cancers and early embryogenesis. In human embryonic stem cells it is found to be essential for maintaining pluripotency. In cancer, L1TD1 expression is highly correlative with malignancy progression and as such considered a potential prognostic factor for tumors. However, its molecular role in cancer remains largely unknown. Our findings reveal that DNA hypomethylation induces the expression of L1TD1 in HAP1 human tumor cells. L1TD1 depletion significantly modulates both the proteome and transcriptome and thereby reduces cell viability. Notably, L1TD1 associates with LINE-1 transcripts and interacts with LINE-1 ORF1p protein, thereby facilitating LINE-1 retrotransposition. Our data suggest that L1TD1 collaborates with its ancestral LINE-1 ORF1p as an RNA chaperone, ensuring the efficient retrotransposition of LINE-1 retrotransposons, rather than directly impacting the abundance of L1TD1 targets. In this way, L1TD1 might have an important role not only during early development but also in tumorigenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Molecular domestication of transposable elements (TEs) or TE-derived sequences give rise to novel genes and regulatory sequences in the genome contributing to both genetic and epigenetic variation in an organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jangam <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Miller <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Smit, 1999</xref>). TEs are key drivers of genome instability and thus are constantly exposed to silencing mechanisms by the host. Yet, co-option of TEs thorough evolution has created so-called domesticated genes beneficial to the gene network in a wide range of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Modzelewski et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jangam <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). One example of such domesticated gene is LINE-1 type transposase containing domain 1 (<italic>L1TD1</italic>), which is the only domesticated protein-coding gene that originated from LINE-1 (McLaughlin <italic>et al</italic>, 2014). L1TD1 shares sequence resemblance with LINE-1 ORF1 protein (L1 ORF1p) that is required for retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Martin, 2006</xref>) and L1TD1 was recently shown to facilitate the dissolution of stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>). L1 ORF1p acts as nucleic acid chaperone with binding capacity to both RNA and DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Martin, 2006</xref>) and contributes to forming L1 ribonucleoproteins (L1-RNPs), key factors for retrotransposition of LINE-1 elements, but its co-factors are yet to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wallace <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>L1TD1, also named Embryonic Stem Cell Associated Transcript 11 (<italic>ECAT11</italic>), is expressed predominantly only in early embryogenesis and germ cells and gets rapidly downregulated upon the exit from pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Iwabuchi <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mitsui <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Although it is dispensable for mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Iwabuchi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), L1TD1 is essential for the maintenance of human pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Narva <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Emani <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). In the context of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), L1TD1 regulates translation of a distinct set of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>), including core pluripotency factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Emani <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). It has been proposed, that during mammalian evolution the <italic>L1TD1</italic> gene was under positive selection due to the function in the maintenance of pluripotency in some species (McLaughlin <italic>et al</italic>., 2014). Apart from early development, L1TD1 is expressed in germ cell tumors and colorectal cancers. In this context, L1TD1 was identified as a possible prognostic marker for medulloblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Santos <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) and colorectal tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chakroborty <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>), where its expression is highly correlative with malignancy progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Urh <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors are successfully used as anti-cancer drugs and two recent reports suggest that the lethal response of human tumor cells to these compounds is based to a large extent on the activation of an anti-viral immune response to endogenous retroviral transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chiappinelli <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Roulois <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). DNMT inhibitor treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patient-derived cells resulted in up-regulation of L1TD1 and reduced cell viability indicating an epigenetic control of L1TD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Altenberger <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Accordingly, xenograft tumors with NSCLCs overexpressing L1TD1 showed decreased tumor growth suggesting a negative impact of L1TD1 expression on tumor viability. In contrast, L1TD1 was shown to be required for cell viability in medulloblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Santos <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Hence, the exact mechanistic function of this domesticated transposon protein in human tumor cells is still unrevealed.</p>
<p>Here, we aimed at elucidating the molecular function of L1TD1 and its potential role for the control of viability in human tumor cells. To this end, we activated L1TD1 expression by inducing DNA hypomethylation <italic>via</italic> deletion of the DNA maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 in the nearly haploid human cancer cell line HAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Carette <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). First, we found that L1TD1 expression and LINE-1 activation correlate with local DNA hypomethylation. Next, we identified L1TD1-associated RNAs by RIP-seq, which revealed transcripts and proteins with differential expression in the absence of L1TD1 by transcriptome and proteome analyses. We showed that L1TD1 protein binds to L1-RNPs. Importantly, L1TD1 facilitated LINE-1 retrotransposition in HAP1 cells. Our results demonstrated that upon DNA hypomethylation L1TD1 affects gene expression and cell viability and cooperates with its ancestor protein L1 ORF1p in the control of LINE-1 retrotransposition.</p>

<title>Cell lines and cell culture</title>
<p>HAP1 is a near-haploid human cell line derived from the KBM-7 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andersson <italic>et al</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Carette <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). HAP1 cells were cultured in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco Medium (IMDM, Sigma Aldrich, I3390) supplement with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Sigma Aldrich, F7524) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma Aldrich, P4333).</p>
<p>The human malignant papillary serous carcinoma cell line OV-90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gralewska <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) was cultured in MCDB 105 (Sigma Aldrich, 117) and Medium 199 (Sigma Aldrich, M4530) in a 1:1 ratio supplemented with 15% Fetal Bovine Serum (Sigma Aldrich, F7524) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma Aldrich, P4333). The cells were kept in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<title>Gene editing</title>
<p>DNMT1 knockout (KO) HAP1 cells harboring a 20 bp deletion in the exon 4 of the <italic>DNMT1</italic> gene were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. DNMT1/L1TD1 double knockout (DKO) HAP1 cells were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing resulting in a 13 bp deletion in exon 4 of the L1TD1 gene. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was performed by Horizon Genomics (Horizon Discovery).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Viability and Apoptosis Assay</title>
<p>Both assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hess <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). For the viability assay 2x10<sup>3</sup> cells of each cell line were seeded in triplicates in solid white 96-well plates and allowed to attach to the plates overnight. Cell viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo Luminiscent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, G7571) and Glomax Discover plate reader (Promega). The measurement was performed every 24 hours starting from the day after seeding (24h, 48h, 72h). For the apoptosis assay 5x10<sup>6</sup> cells were collected 48hours after seeding, fixed for 20 min 2% paraformaldehyde (Merck Life Science) and for 30 min in 75% ethanol. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% TritonX100 (Merck Life Science) for 10 min and blocked in 10% donkey serum (Merck Life Science) for 30 min and then incubated with 1:50 diluted anti-cleaved caspase 3 antibody in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Cell Signaling, 9661) for 1 hour. Cells were washed and incubated with 1:400 Alexa 488 anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno Research, 751-545-152). Samples were acquired using FACSCelesta flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) and the data were analyzed using FlowJo software 10.6.1 (BD Bioscience)</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>HAP1 cells pellets harvested from 15-cm culture plates were lysed in Hunt Buffer (20mM Tris/HCl ph 8.0, 100mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40) supplemented with Complete Protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 11697498001), Complete Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 11836145001), 10mM sodium fluoride, 10mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1mM sodium molybdate and 0.1mM PMSF. The lysis was achieved by repeating freeze-thaw three times followed by centrifugation 12.000g for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell lysate was collected and the protein concentration was measured using Bradford assay. 40ul of Dynabeads<sup>TM</sup> Protein G beads (ThermoFisher Scientific, 10004D) was blocked with 10% BSA in a rotor at 4°C for 1 hour. 1mg of cell lysate was incubated with blocked Protein G beads and monoclonal L1 ORF1p antibody (EMD Millipore, MABC1152) at 12 rpm at 4°C overnight. The next day, the beads were washed 3 times with Hunt buffer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Western Blot Analysis</title>
<p>Immunoprecipitated complex was eluted from the beads with 1x SDS loading dye followed by heat-incubation at 95 °C for 5 minutes for detection of proteins. For input samples, 20µg whole cell lysate was similarly denatured as IP samples. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Protran, GE10600001, Sigma Aldrich) by wet transfer method. The membrane was blocked with the blocking solution (1x PBS, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 3% non-fat dried milk, 0.1% tween-20, 0.01% sodium azide, pH 7.4) and incubated with the corresponding antibodies listed in <bold>Supplementary Table 6</bold>. To detect the protein of interest, ECL Western blotting detection reagents were used with a FUSION FX chemiluminescence imaging system.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Mass spectrometry analysis</title>
<p>Proteomes of DNMT1 KO and DNMT1/L1TD1 DKO cells were analyzed by quantitative TMT (Tandem Mass Tag) multiplex mass spectrometry analysis. Proteins were precipitated from cell extracts with acetone. After reduction and alkylation of Cys under denaturing conditions, proteins were digested with LysC/trypsin overnight. Peptides were cleaned-up using Oasis MCX (Waters) and labeled with TMT6plex (Thermo Fisher) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Equal amounts of each channel were mixed, desalted and fractionated by neutral pH reversed phase chromatography. Equal interval fractions were pooled and analysed by LC-MS3 on an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano LC coupled to an Orbitrap Eclipse™ Tribrid™ mass spectrometer via a FAIMS Pro ion mobility interface (all Thermo Fisher). Data were analyzed with MaxQuant 1.6.7.0. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tyanova <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Differentially enriched proteins were determined with LIMMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ritchie <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Workflow and analysis are described in detail in the <bold>Supplementary information</bold>.</p>

<title>RNA Immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>The native RIP protocol was followed as previously described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yang <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). In brief, cells were resuspended in 1ml Polysomal Lysis Buffer (100mM KCl, 5mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 0.5% NP-40, 1mM DTT) supplemented with Protector RNase inhibitor (Sigma Aldrich, 3335399001) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 11697498001). Cell lysis was facilitated with 27G needle and syringe at least 7 times. The lysates were centrifuged at 12.000g for 15 min at 4 °C. 1% input was taken from the cell lysate for RIP-seq experiment. The supernatant was cleared via pre-incubation with Dynabeads<sup>TM</sup> Protein G beads (ThermoFisher Scientific, 10004D) rotating for 1h at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation 1mg of pre-cleaned cell lysate was incubated with 4µg mouse monoclonal L1TD1 antibody (R&amp;D systems, MAB8317) at 4 °C at 20rpm on the rotor overnight. 40ul Dynabeads<sup>TM</sup> Protein G beads per IP was blocked with 10 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1h at 4 °C. Blocked beads were added to the lysate and antibody mixture rotating for 1h at 4 °C. Next, the beads were pelleted and washed 3 times with polysomal lysis buffer. 20% of the RIP was used for Western blot analysis to confirm immunoprecipitation of L1TD1. 1% of the RIP was saved as input. All experiments were performed in biological triplicates.</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>RNA isolation</title>
<p>To extract total RNA, immunoprecipitated RNA and 1% input RNA Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit (New England Biolabs, T2047L) was used according to the manufacturers’ instructions. In the case of RIP samples, the beads were first treated with DNase I (New England Biolabs, M0303S) at 37 °C for 15 minutes and 1ml TRIzol (Thermo Fischer Scientific, 15596018) was directly added on. Upon addition of 150 µl chloroform the mixture was vortexed vigorously for 15 sec and centrifuged for at 12.000g for 15 minutes at 4 C° . Aqueous phase was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and mixed with 1 volume of EtOH (&gt;95%). The mixture was loaded on the RNA columns and spun for 1 minute. The columns were washed 2 times with the washing buffer (supplemented with the kit) and eluted in 20ul nuclease free water. RNA concentration was measured using the Qubit RNA High Sensitivity kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Q32852)</p>

<p>Genomic DNA was extracted from DNMT1 KO, DNMT1/L1TD1 DKO and WT HAP1 cells using the Wizard Genomic DNA isolation kit (Promega) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Next, 1 µg of genomic DNA per sample was subjected to bisulfite conversion using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo research Cat. no. D5001) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Bisulfite-treated DNA was eluted in ddH<sub>2</sub>O to a final concentration of 10 ng/μL and stored at -20°C until further use. The MethyLight method was performed as previously described by Campan <italic>et al</italic>.

Each reaction contained 7.5 μL of 2X TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Cat. No. 4324018), 300 nM of each primer and 100 nM of probe. For the <italic>L1TD1</italic> reactions 50ng and for the <italic>LINE-1</italic> reactions 20 ng of bisulfite-converted DNA were used in a total volume of 15 μL.

<title>L1TD1 expression is activated through DNA hypomethylation in HAP1 cells</title>
<p>To address the function of L1TD1 in human tumor cells, we generated a defined cellular model by using the nearly haploid tumor cell line HAP1 cells. By CRISPR/Cas-9 mediated gene editing, we deleted <italic>DNMT1</italic> in these cells resulting in HAP1 DNMT1 knock-out (KO) cells. As shown in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>, DNA methylation-specific PCR (MethyLight) analysis revealed significantly reduced DNA methylation at the <italic>L1TD1</italic> promoter in DNMT1 KO cells. DNA hypomethylation at the <italic>L1TD1</italic> gene correlated with a strong induction of L1TD1 mRNA and protein expression in DNMT1 KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref></bold>). To analyze the role of L1TD1 in a DNMT1 null background, we ablated L1TD1 in KO cells by gene editing resulting in HAP1 DNMT1/L1TD1 double knock-out (DKO) cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). Knowing that L1TD1 is highly expressed in human germ cell tumors, we used the ovarian cancer cell line OV-90 as a positive control (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref></bold>). In accordance with previously published data with human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), indirect immunofluorescence analysis revealed that L1TD1 was preferentially localized in the cytosol of HAP1 DNMT1 KO cells and OV-90 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). L1TD1 was reported to localize in P-bodies in hESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Narva <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). We detected a similar granular localization of L1TD1 in HAP1 DNMT1 KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). DNMT1 depletion did not affect cell proliferation but additional loss of L1TD1 in DNMT1/L1TD1 DKO cells led to a significant reduction in the number of viable cells, and increased apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3) and DNA damage (γ-H2AX) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-H</xref></bold>). These results suggest that L1TD1 expression is regulated by DNA methylation and its depletion affects cell viability in DNMT1-deficient HAP1 cells.</p>

<p>To validate the RIP-seq results, individual transcripts selected from a list of top hits were amplified by gene-specific qRT-PCR analysis after repeating the RIP. Transcripts of <italic>L1TD1</italic>, <italic>ARMC1</italic> and <italic>SYNJ2BP</italic> were specifically enriched in L1TD1-RNPs obtained from DNMT1 KO cells when compared to DNMT1/L1TD1 DKO cells.

Gene Ontology analyses of 228 common hits indicated enriched groups in cell division and cell cycle and, in accordance with a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>), enriched transcripts encoding zinc finger and in particular KRAB domain proteins which have been implicated in the restriction of endogenous retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rosspopoff &amp; Trono, 2023</xref>) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Suppl.

<title>Loss of L1TD1 modulates the proteome and transcriptome of HAP1 cells</title>

<p>Interestingly, we discovered that the L1 transposon protein ORF1p was up-regulated in the absence of L1TD1 (<bold>Suppl. Table S3</bold>). Western blot analysis confirmed the increased expression of L1 ORF1p in HAP1 DNMT1/L1TD1 DKO cells when compared to DNMT1 KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>), while LINE-1 transcript levels showed no significant change (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Suppl. Figure S3A</xref></bold>). This indicates that L1TD1 attenuates the expression of L1 ORF1p suggesting a potential regulatory crosstalk between L1TD1 with its ancestor protein.</p>
<p>To investigate a potential effect of L1TD1 on the expression levels of associated RNAs, comparative RNA-seq analysis was performed with DNMT1 KO and DNMT1/L1TD1 DKO cells. Upon loss of L1TD1, we identified 323 up-regulated and 321 down-regulated transcripts, respectively (log<sub>2</sub>-fold change ≥ 1; adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold> and <bold>Suppl. Table S4</bold>). About 25% of the differentially expressed proteins (35% of upregulated and 21% of downregulated proteins) identified in the proteome analysis were also significantly deregulated at the RNA level (<bold>Suppl. Table S3</bold>). However, none of the deregulated transcripts, except <italic>L1TD1</italic>, was detected in L1TD1-RNPs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold> and <bold>Suppl.

Figure S3B</xref></bold>) suggesting that the cellular function of L1TD1 might be independent of a deregulation of its associated mRNAs.</p>
<p>Based on our observations implying that L1TD1 does not exert its cellular function as translational regulator while being associated with transposon RNAs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>), we used TEtranscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>) to identify differentially expressed TE-derived sequences transcriptome-wide.

An average of 506 colonies were observed in DNMT1 KO cells in three independent experiments whereas DNMT1/L1TD1 DKO cells yielded over 5-fold fewer colonies when transfected with the retrotransposition-competent reporter construct (86 colonies on average) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C-D</xref></bold>). No blasticidin resistant clones were obtained for the negative controls, but comparable retrotransposition rates were observed for retrotransposition-competent reporter constructs in three independent retrotransposition assays (<bold>Suppl. Figures S5A-B</bold>). Combined, these data suggest that L1TD1 enhances LINE-1 retrotransposition in DNMT1-deficient HAP1 cells and this effect is mediated through the association with ORF1p and LINE-1 RNA.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we show that the domesticated transposon protein L1TD1 promotes LINE-1 retrotransposition. Numerous cellular factors have been shown in the past to affect retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ariumi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Goodier, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pizarro &amp; Cristofari, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Protasova <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). However, many of these proteins are part of host defense mechanisms and restrict retrotransposition, and it was speculated that L1TD1 also limits L1 retrotransposition (McLaughlin <italic>et al</italic>., 2014). Unexpectedly, we identified L1TD1 as one of the cellular factors that has a positive impact on L1 retrotransposition, most likely by interacting with L1 RNPs and acting as RNA chaperone. L1TD1 deletion resulted in reduced L1 retrotransposition despite upregulation of ORF1p indicating that the upregulation of the transposon protein cannot fully compensate the loss of L1TD1. Interestingly, a similar effect has been previously described for the nonsense-mediated decay factor UPF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Taylor <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). UPF1 knockdown increased the amount of L1 mRNA and proteins but simultaneously reduced the effectiveness of the retrotransposition. A positive effect of L1TD1 on retrotransposition was recently observed upon L1TD1 overexpression in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). However, the authors considered this as artefact of ectopic L1TD1 expression. L1TD1 was lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution and has evolved under positive selection during primate and mouse evolution suggesting an important function during development (McLaughlin <italic>et al</italic>., 2014). L1 elements can retrotranspose in the germline, in embryonic stem cells and in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ariumi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Goodier, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pizarro &amp; Cristofari, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Protasova <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Mouse embryos with repressed LINE-1 expression show impaired embryonic development, suggesting that LINE-1 is part of the developmental program of early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jachowicz <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). The simultaneous L1TD1 expression during early embryogenesis might ensure activation of L1 retrotransposition at this developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Iwabuchi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>To gain insight into the regulatory function of L1TD1 in tumor cells, we performed RIP-seq, transcriptome and proteome analyses in HAP1 cells. The RIP-seq approach identified, in addition to the known associated <italic>L1TD1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Narva <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), a defined set of transcripts comprising mRNAs, lncRNAs and transposable elements including <italic>LINE-1</italic> transcripts. These findings indicate that L1TD1 has not only inherited its function as RNA-binding protein but also its affinity for transposon transcripts. Recently, Jin <italic>et al</italic>. published a study on the impact of L1TD1 on the translation in hESCs and identified L1TD1-bound RNAs by CLIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). Interestingly, the majority of L1TD1-associated transcripts in HAP1 cells (69%) identified in our study were also reported as L1TD1 targets in hESCs suggesting a conserved binding affinity of this domesticated transposon protein across different cell types.</p>
<p>The same study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>) showed that L1TD1 localizes to high-density RNP condensates and enhances the translation of a subset of mRNAs enriched in the condensates. Our mass spectrometry data showed that L1TD1 ablation leads to a significantly changed proteome. However, none of the proteins encoded by the mRNAs associated with L1TD1 showed significantly changed abundance in the absence of L1TD1 suggesting that this is not a direct effect of L1TD1 association with the respective mRNAs. The different outcomes might be due to different cell types and methods used in the two studies. Similarly, and in accordance with the hESC study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>), we did not find an overlap between RNAs associated with L1TD1 and their deregulation at the RNA level. This suggests that in HAP1 cells L1TD1 does not have a global effect on RNA stability and translation of its associated RNAs. This is consistent with a recent study on L1 bodies, where RNA processing association of L1 body components did not correlate with RNA stability or translational control of the RNA targets of L1 bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">De Luca <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Of note, L1TD1 associated with <italic>SINE</italic> transcripts such as AluY and L1TD1 ablation positively affected AluY transposon expression. This relatively young subfamily of SINE elements is still retrotransposition-competent and their mobilization depends on the activity of LINE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Roy-Engel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Styles &amp; Brookfield, 2009</xref>). These observations suggest that L1TD1 has not only inherited its function as an RNA-binding protein but also the affinity to <italic>LINE-1</italic> and <italic>SINE</italic> transcripts. L1TD1 association with <italic>AluY</italic> transcripts could potentially be connected to modulation of LINE-1 and SINE-1 transposon activities.</p>
<p>LINE-1 is the only protein-coding transposon that is active in humans and LINE-1 overexpression and retrotransposition are hallmarks of cancers (Kazazian &amp; Moran, 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mendez-Dorantes &amp; Burns, 2023</xref>). Similarly to the epigenetic control of the ancestral LINE-1 elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sanchez-Luque <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>), L1TD1 expression in HAP1 cells is restricted by DNA methylation and DNA hypomethylation induced by DNMT1 ablation results in robust L1TD1 RNA and protein expression. This observation is in line with the findings in the NSCLC cancer model, where pharmacological DNMT inhibition resulted in L1TD1 induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Altenberger <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). In contrast to the negative effect of L1TD1 on cell viability and tumor growth in the NSCLC xenograft model, we report that L1TD1 deletion in DNMT1-deficient cells led to reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis in HAP1 cancer cells. This is in accordance with the observation that L1TD1 has a positive impact on cell viability in medullablastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Santos <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>) and suggests a (cancer) cell type-specific effect of L1TD1 that might be related to the DNA methylation state of the tumors.</p>
<p>Taken together we present here a novel cellular function for a domesticated transposon protein by showing that L1TD1 associates with L1-RNPs and promotes LINE-1 retrotransposition. This function might have a beneficial effect during early development but could also impact on tumorigenesis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their manuscript entitled 'The domesticated transposon protein L1TD1 associates with its ancestor L1 ORF1p to promote LINE-1 retrotransposition', Kavaklıoğlu and colleagues delve into the role of L1TD1, an RNA binding protein (RBP) derived from a LINE1 transposon. L1TD1 proves crucial for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and is linked to cancer progression in germ cell tumors, yet its precise molecular function remains elusive. Here, the authors uncover an intriguing interaction between L1TD1 and its ancestral LINE-1 retrotransposon.</p>
<p>The authors delete the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 in a haploid human cell line (HAP1), inducing widespread DNA hypo-methylation. This hypomethylation prompts abnormal expression of L1TD1. To scrutinize L1TD1's function in a DNMT1 knock-out setting, the authors create DNMT1/L1TD1 double knock-out cell lines (DKO). Curiously, while the loss of global DNA methylation doesn't impede proliferation, additional depletion of L1TD1 leads to DNA damage and apoptosis.</p>
<p>To unravel the molecular mechanism underpinning L1TD1's protective role in the absence of DNA methylation, the authors dissect L1TD1 complexes in terms of protein and RNA composition. They unveil an association with the LINE-1 transposon protein L1-ORF1 and LINE-1 transcripts, among others.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the authors note fewer LINE-1 retro-transposition events in DKO cells than in DNMT1 KO alone.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors present compelling data suggesting the interplay of a transposon-derived human RNA binding protein with its ancestral transposable element. Their findings spur interesting questions for cancer types, where LINE1 and L1TD1 are aberrantly expressed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Suggestions for refinement:</p>
<p>The initial experiment, inducing global hypo-methylation by eliminating DNMT1 in HAP1 cells, is intriguing and warrants a more detailed description. How many genes experience misregulation or aberrant expression? What phenotypic changes occur in these cells? Why did the authors focus on L1TD1? Providing some of this data would be helpful to understand the rationale behind the thorough analysis of L1TD1.</p>
<p>The finding that L1TD1/DNMT1 DKO cells exhibit increased apoptosis and DNA damage but decreased L1 retro-transposition is unexpected. Considering the DNA damage associated with retro-transposition and the DNA damage and apoptosis observed in L1TD1/DNMT1 DKO cells, one would anticipate the opposite outcome. Could it be that the observation of fewer transposition-positive colonies stems from the demise of the most transposition-positive colonies? Further exploration of this phenomenon would be intriguing.</p>

<p>In this study, Kavaklıoğlu et al. investigated and presented evidence for the role of domesticated transposon protein L1TD1 in enabling its ancestral relative, L1 ORF1p, to retrotranspose in HAP1 human tumor cells. The authors provided insight into the molecular function of L1TD1 and shed some clarifying light on previous studies that showed somewhat contradictory outcomes surrounding L1TD1 expression. Here, L1TD1 expression was correlated with L1 activation in a hypomethylation-dependent manner, due to DNMT1 deletion in the HAP1 cell line. The authors then identified L1TD1-associated RNAs using RIP-Seq, which displays a disconnect between transcript and protein abundance (via Tandem Mass Tag multiplex mass spectrometry analysis). The one exception was for L1TD1 itself, which is consistent with a model in which the RNA transcripts associated with L1TD1 are not directly regulated at the translation level. Instead, the authors found the L1TD1 protein associated with L1-RNPs, and this interaction is associated with increased L1 retrotransposition, at least in the contexts of HAP1 cells. Overall, these results support a model in which L1TD1 is restrained by DNA methylation, but in the absence of this repressive mark, L1TD1 is expressed and collaborates with L1 ORF1p (either directly or through interaction with L1 RNA, which remains unclear based on current results), leads to enhances L1 retrotransposition. These results establish the feasibility of this relationship existing in vivo in either development, disease, or both.</p>

<p>The transcriptome analysis of DNMT1 KO cells showed hundreds of deregulated genes upon DNMT1 ablation. As expected, the majority were up-regulated and gene ontology analysis revealed that among the strongest up-regulated genes were gene clusters with functions in “regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter” and “cell differentiation” and genes encoding proteins with KRAB domains. In addition, the de novo methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B were up-regulated in DNMT1 KO cells suggesting the set-up of compensatory mechanisms in these cells. We will include this data set in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>

<p>We have previously discovered that conditional deletion of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 in the murine epidermis results not only in the up-regulation of mobile elements, such as IAPs but also the induced expression of L1TD1 ((Beck et al, 2021), Suppl. Table 1 and Author response image 1). Similary, L1TD1 expression was induced by treatment of primary human keratinocytes or squamous cell carcinoma cells with the DNMT inhibitor aza-deoxycytidine (Author response image 2 and 3). These finding are in accordance with the observation  that inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity by azadeoxycytidine in human non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLCs) results in upregulation of L1TD1 (Altenberger et al, 2017). Our interest in L1TD1 was further fueled by reports on a potential function of L1TD1 as prognostic tumor marker. We will include this information in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>The finding that L1TD1/DNMT1 DKO cells exhibit increased apoptosis and DNA damage but decreased L1 retro-transposition is unexpected. Considering the DNA damage associated with retro-transposition and the DNA damage and apoptosis observed in L1TD1/DNMT1 DKO cells, one would anticipate the opposite outcome. Could it be that the observation of fewer transposition-positive colonies stems from the demise of the most transposition-positive colonies? Further exploration of this phenomenon would be intriguing.</p>

<p>This is an important point and we were aware of this potential problem. Therefore, we calibrated the retrotransposition assay by transfection with a blasticidin resistance gene vector to take into account potential differences in cell viability and blasticidin sensitivity. Thus, the observed reduction in L1 retrotransposition efficiency is not an indirect effect of reduced cell viability.</p>
<p>Based on previous studies with hESCs, it is likely that, in addition to its role in retrotransposition, L1TD1 has additional functions in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. L1TD1 might therefore attenuate the effect of DNMT1 loss in KO cells generating an intermediate phenotype (as pointed out by Reviewer 2) and simultaneous loss of both L1TD1 and DNMT1 results in more pronounced effects on cell viability.</p>

<p>In this study, Kavaklıoğlu et al. investigated and presented evidence for the role of domesticated transposon protein L1TD1 in enabling its ancestral relative, L1 ORF1p, to retrotranspose in HAP1 human tumor cells. The authors provided insight into the molecular function of L1TD1 and shed some clarifying light on previous studies that showed somewhat contradictory outcomes surrounding L1TD1 expression. Here, L1TD1 expression was correlated with L1 activation in a hypomethylation-dependent manner, due to DNMT1 deletion in the HAP1 cell line. The authors then identified L1TD1-associated RNAs using RIP-Seq, which displays a disconnect between transcript and protein abundance (via Tandem Mass Tag multiplex mass spectrometry analysis). The one exception was for L1TD1 itself, which is consistent with a model in which the RNA transcripts associated with L1TD1 are not directly regulated at the translation level. Instead, the authors found the L1TD1 protein associated with L1-RNPs, and this interaction is associated with increased L1 retrotransposition, at least in the contexts of HAP1 cells. Overall, these results support a model in which L1TD1 is restrained by DNA methylation, but in the absence of this repressive mark, L1TD1 is expressed and collaborates with L1 ORF1p (either directly or through interaction with L1 RNA, which remains unclear based on current results), leads to enhances L1 retrotransposition. These results establish the feasibility of this relationship existing in vivo in either development, disease, or both.</p>
