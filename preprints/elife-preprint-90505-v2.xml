<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The paramount importance of mechanical forces in morphogenesis and embryogenesis is widely recognized, but understanding the mechanism at the cellular and molecular level remains challenging. Because of its simple internal organization, Caenorhabditis elegans is a rewarding system of study. As demonstrated experimentally, after an initial period of steady elongation driven by the actomyosin network, muscle contractions operate a quasi-periodic sequence of bending, rotation and torsion, that leads to the final 4-fold size of the embryo before hatching. How actomyosin and muscles contribute to embryonic elongation is investigated here theoretically. A filamentary elastic model that converts stimuli generated by biochemical signals in the tissue into driving forces, explains embryonic deformation under actin bundles and muscle activity, and dictates mechanisms of late elongation based on the effects of energy conversion and dissipation. We quantify this dynamic transformation by stretches applied to a cylindrical structure that mimics the body shape in finite elasticity, obtaining good agreement and understanding for both wild-type and mutant embryos at all stages.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mechanical stresses play a critical role during embryogenesis, affecting complex biological tissues such as the skin, the brain, and the interior of organs. There are many studies in recent decades, for example, the pattern of the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Coulombre and Coulombre (1958</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hannezo et al.

The superposition of mechanical stresses, cellular processes (e.g., division, migration), and tissue organization is often too complex to identify and quantify. For example, independent of growth, stresses can be generated by different molecular motors, among which myosin II, linked to actin filaments, is the most abundant during epithelial cell morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Vicente-Manzanares et al. (2009</xref>)) and cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cowan and Hyman (2007</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Olson and Sahai (2009</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Palumbo et al. (2022</xref>)). Spatial distribution and dynamics of myosin II strongly influence the morphogenetic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Levayer and Lecuit (2012</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lv et al. (2022</xref>)), as demonstrated for Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bertet et al. (2004</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blankenship et al. (2006</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Saxena et al. (2014</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shindo and Wallingford (2014</xref>)) and also for <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Priess and Hirsh (1986</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gally et al. (2009</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben Amar et al. (2018</xref>)).</p>
<p>Embryonic elongation of C. elegans before hatching provides an attractive model of matter reorganization in the absence of growth. It occurs after ventral enclosure and takes about 240 minutes to transform the lima bean-shaped embryo into the final elongated worm form: the embryo elongates four times along the anterior/posterior axis by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">McKeown et al. (1998</xref>)). The short lifespan of the egg before hatching and its transparency make this system ideal for studying the forces that exist at or near the cortical epithelium. However, in contrast to Drosophila and zebrafish embryonic development, there is no cell migration, cell division, or significant change in embryonic volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sulston et al. (1983</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Priess and Hirsh (1986</xref>)), only remarkable epidermal elongation drives the entire morphogenetic process of <italic>C. elegans</italic> in the post-enclosure period. There are two experimentally identified driving forces for the elongation: the actomyosin contractility in the seam cells of the epidermis, which appears to persist throughout the whole elongation process, and the muscle activity beneath the epidermis, which begins after the 1.7 ∼ 1.8-fold stage. The transition is well defined, because the muscle involvement makes the embryo rather motile, and any physical experiments such as laser fracture ablation of the epidermis, which could be performed and achieved in the first period (<bold><italic>Vuong-Brender et al. (2017a</italic></bold>)), become difficult. Consequently, the elongation process of <italic>C. elegans</italic> could be divided into two stages: the early elongation and the late elongation, depending on the muscle activation, and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1(A)</xref> shows the whole elongation process (<bold><italic>Vuong-Brender et al. (2017a</italic></bold>)). Previously, the role of the actomyosin network in the seam cells during the <italic>C. elegans</italic> early elongation was investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben Amar et al. (2018</xref>)). Based on the geometry of a hollow cylinder composed of dorsal, ventral and seam cells, a model including the pre-stress responsible for the enclosure, the active compressive ortho-radial stress combined with the passive stress quantitatively predicts the elongation, but only up to ∼ 70% of the initial length.</p>

</fig>
<p>For the late elongation phase, the actomyosin network and the muscles together drive the full elongation during this phase (<bold><italic>Vuong-Brender et al. (2017a</italic></bold>)). The muscles play an important role and mutants with muscle defects are unable to complete the elongation process, even though the actomyosin network functions normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lardennois et al. (2019</xref>)). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1(B)</xref> shows a schematic image of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al. (2011</xref>)) with four rows of muscles, two of which are under the dorsal epidermis and the other two are under the ventral epidermis. As observed <italic>in vivo, C. elegans</italic> exhibits systematic rotations accompanying each contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yang (2017</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yang Xinyi et al. (2023</xref>)), and deformations such as bending and twisting. Eventually, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo will undergo an elongation of 1.8-fold to 4-fold. As the activated muscle contracts on one side, the contractile forces are transmitted to the epidermis on that side. Since striated muscles can only perform cycles of contraction and relaxation, their action will tend to reduce the length of the embryo. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how the embryo elongates during each contraction and how the muscle contractions are coupled to the actomyosin activity. This work aims to answer this paradox within the framework of finite elasticity without invoking cellular plasticity and stochasticity, which cannot be considered as driving forces. In addition, several important questions remain unanswered at the late stage of elongation. First of all, we may also observe a torsion of the embryo, but if the muscle activity suggests a bending, this alone cannot explain alone a substantial torsion. Second, a small deviation of the muscle axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Moerman and Williams (2006</xref>)) is responsible for a number of rotations, how to relate these rotations to the muscle activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yang (2017</xref>)). Since any measurement on a motile embryo at this scale is difficult, it is useful to explore the mechanism of late elongation theoretically. Furthermore, muscle contraction is crucial for both biological development and activities and has been extensively studied by researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tan and De Vita (2015</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">De Vita et al. (2017</xref>)), but how it works at small scales remains to be understood.</p>
<p>Using a finite elasticity model and assuming that the embryonic body shape is cylindrical, we can evaluate the geometric bending deformation and the energy released during each muscle contraction on one side since after each contraction, the muscles relax and then the muscles on the opposite side undergo a new contraction. This cyclic process results in a tiny elongation of the cylinder along its axis of symmetry with each contraction. Each of these contractions correlates with the rotational movements of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yang (2017</xref>)). By repeating these pairs of contractions more than two hundred times, a cumulative extension is achieved, but it must be reduced by friction mechanisms, also evaluated by the model. Furthermore, the mechanical model explains the existence of a torque acting on the position of the head or tail by the coupling of the muscle contraction with the orthoradial actomyosin forces. Finally, the small deviation between the muscles and the central axis experimentally detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Moerman and Williams (2006</xref>)) induces cyclic rotations and possibly torsions leading to fluid viscous flow inside the egg. The quantification of all these processes allows the evaluation of physical quantities of the embryo, such as the shear modulus of each component, the interstitial fluid viscosity and the active forces exerted by the actomyosin network and the muscles, which are poorly y known in the embryonic stages.</p>
<p>Our mechanical model accounts for the dynamic deformations induced by the internal stimuli of a layered soft cylinder, allowing us to make accurate quantitative predictions about the active networks of the embryo. Furthermore, our model accounts for the dissipation that occurs in the late period just before the embryo hatches. Our results are consistent with observations of actomyosin and muscle activity (<bold><italic>Vuong-Brender et al. (2017a</italic></bold>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben Amar et al. (2018</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lardennois et al. (2019</xref>)). The architecture of our work is illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>It is widely recognized that <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a well-established model organism in the field of developmental biology. However, it is less well known that its internal striated muscles share similarities with vertebrate skeletal muscles in terms of both function and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lesanpezeshki et al. (2021</xref>)). Since they are contractile, the role of the four axial muscles (as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>) in the final shaping of the embryo is almost counterintuitive. In this section, we aim to elucidate the action of these muscles when coupled to the actomyosin network, using a purely mechanical approach. To achieve a quantitative understanding, our method requires a detailed description of the deformation geometry of the embryo, where the body shape is represented by a fully heterogeneous cylinder.</p>
<sec id="s3">
<title>Geometric and strain deformations of the embryo</title>
<p>The early elongation of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo has been previously studied, which is characterized by an inner cylinder surrounded by epithelial cells located in the cortical position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben Amar et al. (2018</xref>)). The cortex is composed of three distinct cell types - the seam, dorsal, and ventral cells - that exhibit a unique cytoskeletal organization and actin network configuration. Among these, only the seam cells possess active myosin motors that function in the ortho-radial direction, allowing for the circumferential contraction and thereby triggering the early elongation process. In this study, we simplify the cylindrical geometry of the body and treat the epidermis as a unified whole with effective activity localized along the circumference, supported by four muscles distributed beneath the epidermis. The muscles do not play a role in the early elongation phase and have therefore not been considered previously (<bold><italic>Vuong-Brender et al. (2017a</italic></bold>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben Amar et al. (2018</xref>)). After this period of approximately a 1.8-fold increase in length, muscles parallel to the main axis and actin bundles organized along the circumference will cooperate to drive further elongation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table. 1</xref> provides the size parameters of <italic>C. elegans</italic> that will be used hereafter.</p>

<p>We focus on the total deformation of a full cylinder or a thin rod with a length <italic>L</italic> greater than the radius <italic>R</italic> and a central vertical axis along the <italic>Z</italic> direction. Contrary to previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ciarletta et al. (2009</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben Amar et al. (2018</xref>)), here we decide to simplify the geometrical aspect due to the mechanical complexity. The biological activity induced by the actomyosin network and muscles is represented by active strains, and the global shape is the result of the coupling between elastic and active strains, modulated by dissipation. Active strains are generated by non-mechanical processes (e.g., biochemical processes): myosin motors and striated muscles derive their energy from ATP hydrolysis, which is converted into mechanical fiber contractions. Due to the significant deformation observed, the central line is distorted and becomes a curve in three-dimensional space, represented by a vector <bold>r</bold> (<bold>Z</bold>), as depicted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3(A)</xref>. Along this curve, perpendicular planar sections of the embryo can be defined, and the deformation in each section can be quantified since the circular geometry is lost with the contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kaczmarski et al. (2022</xref>)). The geometric mapping is as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="553194v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where the <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> represents the deformation in each direction of the section with <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> (0, Θ, <italic>Z</italic>) = 0 so that the <italic>Z</italic>-axis is mapped to the centerline <bold>r</bold> (<italic>Z</italic>). The small quantity <italic>ε</italic> is the ratio between the radius <italic>R</italic> and the length <italic>L</italic> of the cylinder. The axial extension <italic>ζ</italic> is given by <bold>r</bold>′ (<italic>Z</italic>) = <italic>ζ</italic> <bold>d</bold><sub>3</sub>, where′ denotes the first derivative with respect to the material coordinate <italic>Z</italic>. From the director basis, the Darboux curvature vector reads: <bold>u</bold> = <italic>u</italic><sub>1</sub><bold>d</bold><sub>1</sub> +<italic>u</italic><sub>2</sub><bold>d</bold><sub>2</sub> +<italic>u</italic><sub>3</sub><bold>d</bold><sub>3</sub>, this vector gives the evolution of the director basis along the filamentary line as: <bold>d</bold><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>′ (<italic>Z</italic>) = <italic>ζ</italic> <bold>u</bold> × <bold>d</bold><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3(A)</xref>. Based on the model proposed by B. Kaczmarki <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kaczmarski et al. (2022</xref>)), we define the initial configuration ℬ<sub>0</sub> with material points (<italic>R</italic>, Θ, <italic>Z</italic>), and the mapping function <italic>χ</italic> (<bold>X</bold>) connects the initial configuration ℬ<sub>0</sub> to the current configuration ℬ. The geometric deformation gradient is <bold>F</bold> = Grad<italic>χ</italic> = <bold>F</bold><sub><bold>e</bold></sub><bold>G</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nardinocchi and Teresi (2007</xref>)), where <bold>G</bold> is the active strain generated by the actomyosin or the muscles, and <bold>F</bold><sub><bold>e</bold></sub> is the elastic strain tensor.</p>

</fig>
<p>Because of the two stages through which the <italic>C. elegans</italic> elongates, we need to evaluate the influence of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> actin network during the early elongation before studying the deformation at the late stage. Thus, the deformation gradient can be decomposed into: <bold>F</bold> = <bold>F</bold><sub><italic>e</italic></sub><bold>G</bold><sub>1</sub><bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Goriely and Ben Amar (2007</xref>)) where <bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub> refers to the pre-strain of the early period and <bold>G</bold><sub>1</sub> is the muscle supplementary active strain in the late period. Actin is distributed in a circular pattern in the outer epidermis, see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3(B)</xref>, so the finite strain <bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub> is defined as <bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub> = <italic>Diag</italic> (1, <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>t</italic>), 1), where 0 &lt; <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub> &lt; 1 is the time-dependent decreasing eigenvalue, operating in the actin zone and is equal to unity in the other parts: <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub>(0) = 1.

Additional calculation details are provided in Section Methods and Materials.</p>
<p>To relate the deformations to the active forces induced by the muscles and the actomyosin network, we assume that the embryo can be represented by the simplest nonlinear hyperelastic model, called Neo-Hookean, with a strain energy density given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="553194v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. In cylindrical coordinates, the total energy of the system and the associated energy density is:

</disp-formula>
where <italic>J</italic> = det <bold>F</bold><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>, <italic>p</italic> is a Lagrange multiplier that ensures the incompressibility of the sample, a physical property assumed in living matter. If the cylinder contains several layers with different shear modulus <italic>μ</italic> and different active strains, the integral over <italic>S</italic> covers each layer. To minimize the energy over each section for a given active force, we take advantage of the small value of <italic>ε</italic> and expand the inner variables <italic>a, p</italic>, and the potential <italic>V</italic> to obtain the associated strain-energy density. Since the Euler-Lagrange equations and the boundary conditions are satisfied at each order, we can obtain solutions for the elastic strains at zero order <bold>a</bold><sup>(<bold>0</bold>)</sup> and at first order <bold>a</bold><sup>(<bold>1</bold>)</sup>. Finally, these solutions which will represent a combination of bending and torsional deformation, will last for the duration of a muscle contraction as the actomyosin continues its contractile activity. The evaluation of the elastic energy under actomyosin muscle activity of order <italic>ε</italic><sup>4</sup> can be compared with the equivalent energy of an extensible elastic rod and any fundamental deformation will be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kirchhoff and Hensel (1883</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mielke (1988</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mora and Müller (2002</xref>, 2004); <bold><italic>Moulton et al.

<p>Here, we must first accurately determine <bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub> by analyzing the experimental data (<bold><italic>Vuong-Brender et al. (2017a</italic></bold>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben Amar et al. (2018</xref>)). The cylinder can be divided into three distinct sections: the outer layer is the actin cortex, the thin ring where actin bundles concentrate and work, located within a radius range between <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>′ and <italic>R</italic><sub>3</sub> (as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5(A)</xref>); the middle layer (<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> &lt; <italic>R</italic> &lt; <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>′), which is the epidermis but without actin; and the inner part (0 &lt; <italic>R</italic> &lt; <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>), where the muscle is located, along with some internal organs, tissues, and fluids. So, we treat the outer and middle layers as incompressible, but the inner part as a compressible material, except for the muscles. The initial deformation gradient: <bold>F</bold><sub>0</sub> =Diag(<italic>r</italic>′(<italic>R</italic>), <italic>r</italic>(<italic>R</italic>)/<italic>R, λ</italic>), and <bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub> = Diag(1, <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub>, 1) with 0 &lt; <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub> &lt; 1 in the actin layer, but with <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1 in the part without actin. <bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub> represents the circumferential strain exerted by actin during the early elongation and is a slowly varying function of time. By applying the principles of radius continuity, radial stress continuity, and incorporating the zero traction condition on the face of the cylinder, we can determine that <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.88 when the elongation <italic>λ</italic> = 1.8, at the end of the early elongation. As illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5(B)</xref>, the results of our model and the experimental data are in good agreement, demonstrating the consistency of the geometric and elastic modeling together with the choice of a pre-strain represented by <bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub> which gives a good prediction of the early elongation. More details can be found in the appendix 3.</p>
<p>From the first stage elongation represented by the blue dots and the blue dashed line in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5(C)</xref> we can extract the time evolution of the contractile pre-strain <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) derived from our elastic model. To explain <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) quantitatively, we propose a phenomenological dynamical approach for the population of active myosin motors. This equation takes into account the competition between the recruitment of new myosin proteins from the epidermal cytoskeleton, which is necessary to elongate the embryo, and the detachment of these myosins from the actin cables, which is damped by the compressive radial stress. It reads:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">

where <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> = 1 − <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>t</italic>), <italic>p</italic><sub>1</sub> is the ratio of the freely available myosin population to the attached ones divided by the time of recruitment (given in minutes), while <italic>p</italic><sub>2</sub> is the inverse of the debonding time of the myosin motors from the cable: <italic>p</italic><sub>2</sub> = 6 min<sup>−1</sup>. The debonding time increases (or decreases) when the actin cable is under radial compressive (or tensile) stress, see Appendix 3, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn35">Eq.(35)</xref>. <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>ν</italic></sub> is the viscoelastic time estimated from laser ablation fracture operated in the epidermis (<bold><italic>Vuong-Brender et al.

<title>Shape of the embryo under muscles and actomyosin contraction</title>
<p>The experimental regulation of muscle contraction in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yang (2017</xref>)) suggests a cyclic process in which two muscles on one side of the embryo contract quite at the same time and then stop, while on the opposite side the two muscles begin to contract, but with a delay. Let us first consider that only the muscles are active (see the schematic <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6(A)</xref> for the structure, then (B) and (C) for the bending). In this case, due to the geometry, bending to the left occurs when the left muscles are activated and then to the right for the symmetrical right muscles.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="553194v2_fig6.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>To be more quantitative, we assume that the left side muscles are activated during a short period with an active constant strain value <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> in the region <italic>M</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>M</italic><sub>2</sub>, as shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6(A)-(B)</xref>; if the muscles are perfectly vertical, <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 0 in the initial configuration. In fact, the two muscles on the same side are not always completely in phase, and one may have a small delay. For simplicity, we assume that they contract simultaneously. During the entire initial period when the muscles are not activated, the actin fibers are distributed in a horizontal loop on the outer surface of the epidermis, but as soon as the muscle starts to contract, the actomyosin network will be reoriented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lardennois et al. (2019</xref>)). The fibers are then distributed in an oblique pattern, which eventually causes the twisting of the embryo, see the schematic diagram in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6(D)-(F)</xref>. When this region is activated with a constant strain value, <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>, the angle of the actin fibers will change according to the amplitude of the bending caused by the muscle contraction. In this situation, the angle of the actin fibers may change from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="553194v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, but <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> is not changed and <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> = 0.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire process, the muscle and actomyosin activities are assumed to operate simultaneously. Our modeling allows us to evaluate the bending and torsion generated independently by muscles and actin bundles, culminating in a complete deformation under coupling. Furthermore, the angle of the actomyosin fibers varies during muscle contraction. We maintain a constant activation of the actomyosin network and gradually increase the muscle activation.</p>
<p>As a result, the structure will be bent, causing a change in the angle of the actin fibers, ultimately yielding a deformation map that is presented in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7(A)-(C)</xref>. As myosin activation increased, we observed a consistent torsional deformation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7(E)</xref>) that agrees with the patterns seen in the video (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7(D)</xref>). However, significant torsional deformations are not always present. In fact, other sources can induce torsion as a default symmetry of the muscle axis. We will now discuss torsion due to muscle contraction and the angle of deviation from the axis. In <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7(F)-(G)</xref>, we demonstrate that the curvature provided by the model increases with increasing muscle activation increases and that the torsion is not simply related to the activation amplitude, as it also depends on the value of the angle <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>, reaching a maximum at about <italic>π</italic>/4.

<title>Energy transformation and Elongation</title>
<p>During the late elongation process, the four internal muscle bands contract cyclically in pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yang (2017</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Williams and Waterston (1994</xref>)). Each contraction of a pair increases the energy of the system under investigation, which is then rapidly released to the body. This energy exchange causes the torsional bending energy to be converted into elongation energy, leading to an increase in length during the relaxation phase, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref> of the Appendix 5. With all the deformations obtained, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq.(2)</xref> can be used to calculate the accumulated energy <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> produced by both the muscle and the actomyosin activities during a contraction. Subsequently, when the muscles on one side relax, the worm body returns to its original shape but with a tiny elongation corresponding to the transferred elastic energy. In this new state, the actin network assumes a ‘loop’ configuration with a strain of <italic>εg</italic><sub><italic>a</italic>1</sub> once relaxation is complete. If all the accumulated energy from the bending-torsion deformation is used to elongate the worm body, the accumulated energy <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> and the energy <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> after muscle relaxation are equivalent. The activation of actin fibers <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>a</italic>1</sub> after muscle relaxation can be calculated and determined by our model.</p>
<p>Once the first phase is well characterized, we can quantify the total energy resulting from both muscle and actomyosin after each contraction. We then used our model to predict elongation in wild type <italic>C. elegans</italic>, unc-112(RNAi) mutant and spc-1(RNAi) pak-1(tm403) mutant and further compared the results with experimental observations. The wild-type length increases from about 90 <italic>μm</italic> to 210 <italic>μm</italic> during the muscle-activated phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lardennois et al. (2019</xref>)), the phase lasts about 140 minutes, and the average time interval between two contractions is about 40 seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yang (2017</xref>)), so the number of contractions can be estimated to be about 210 times. Unfortunately, due to the difficulty of performing quantitative experiments on an embryo that is constantly moving in the egg shell between bending, torsion, and even rotations around its central axis, one can hypothesize this scenario: at each step <italic>i</italic> between the state <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,0</sub> to <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,1</sub> and then <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,2</sub>, the whole mechanical muscle-myosin energy is transferred to the elongated step <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,2</sub>, resulting a small <italic>δζ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>.</p>
<p>Considering the experimental results shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8(B)</xref>, we determine the optimal values for the activation parameters: <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = −0.15 and <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> = −0.01 assuming that all the energy accumulated during the muscle activation is transferred to the elongation process (<italic>W</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> = <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>). The elementary elongation <italic>δζ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is gradually increased over time, which is shown as the black line in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8(A)</xref>. At the beginning, <italic>δζ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is about 0.5<italic>μm</italic>, but at the end of this process, <italic>δζ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is about 1.5<italic>μm</italic>, indicating that the worm will grow up to 290<italic>μm</italic>. The result is significantly larger than our actual size 210<italic>μm</italic>. As the elongation progresses, we assume that there is an energy transfer between bending-torsion-contraction and elongation but it may not be fully effective, meaning that a significant part of the energy is lost. From the experimental data, we estimate that the energy loss gradually increases, from full conversion at the beginning to only 40% of the accumulated energy used for elongation at the end of the process (<italic>W</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> = 0.4<italic>W</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>). For <italic>δζ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> it induces a first increase and then a decrease, which is shown as the blue line in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8(A)</xref> and is responsible for the slowdown around 200 mins. This possibility, which may be not the only possible one, leads to the estimated elongation being in good agreement with the experimental data (see the blue-dashed curve in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8(B)</xref>). Indeed it is possible that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> elongation requires other transformations that cost energy. As the embryo gradually elongates, energy dissipation and the biomechanical energy required to reorganize the actin bundles may be two factors contributing to the increased energy loss underlying the hypothesis.</p>

<p>In addition, it has been reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Norman and Moerman (2002</xref>)) that the knockdown of unc-112(RNAi), known the to affect muscle contractions, leads to the arrest of elongation of the embryos at the twofold stage, indicating that the muscles have no activation, <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 0 in our model, and no accumulated energy can be converted into elongation. Another mutation affecting the embryos consisting of mutant cells with pak-1(tm403), known to regulate the activity of myosin motors leads to a retraction of the embryo, so that the pre-stretch caused by myosin is not maintained and decreases. The results are fully consistent with a number of experimental observations and are shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8(B)</xref>.</p>

<title>Embryo rotations and dissipation</title>
<p>The main manifestation of the muscle activity, independent of the elongation, is probably the constant rotation of the embryo despite its confinement in the egg. This can be explained by a small angular deviation of the muscle sarcomeres from the central axis due to their attachment to the inner boundary of the cell epidermis, the so-called “dense bodies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Moerman and Williams (2006</xref>)). Since they cross the horizontal plane at about ±45° and the deviation <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> from the anterior-posterior axis is estimated to be about 6° each active muscle on the left (or on the right) contributes to the torque via a geometric factor of about <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> = sin(6<italic>π</italic>/180) cos(<italic>π</italic>/4). Then a simple estimate of muscle activity in terms of torque is Λ<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> ∼ <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub><italic>πR</italic><sup>3</sup><italic>S</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub><italic>p</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub><italic>a</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>(<italic>εg</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>) where <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> is the area of the left or right muscle pair compared to the section of the cylinder: <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 0.025 and <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> is the distance of the muscles from the central axis of the embryo: <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 0.75 while <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 0.15 according to the elongation analysis. So the muscles on one side contribute to a torque Λ<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> along the symmetry axis, given by Λ<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 4.657<italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub><italic>πR</italic><sup>3</sup> · 10<sup>−5</sup>.</p>
<p>Let us now consider the dissipative torque, assuming that the rotational dynamics are stopped by friction after a bending event. Two cases can be considered: either the dissipation comes from the viscous flow or from the rubbing of the embryo when it folds. The fluid dissipation results from the rotations in the interstitial fluid inside and along the eggshell as the anterior-posterior axis remains parallel to the eggshell (<bold><italic>Bhatnagar et al. (2023</italic></bold>)) The interstitial fluid, of viscosity <italic>η</italic> contains a significant amount of sugars and other molecules necessary for embryo survival and that is more viscous than water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Labouesse (2023</xref>)). However, values for sucrose or sorbitol at the concentration of 1 mole/liter indicate a viscosity on the order of a few times the viscosity of water, which is 1 mPas. For example at 0.9 mole/liter and temperature of 20°, an aqueous solution of sorbitol has a viscosity of 1.6 mPas, which can be extrapolated to <italic>η</italic> = 1.9 mPas at 1.2 mole/liter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jiang et al. (2013</xref>)). The estimate given by an embryo located in the middle of the egg shell, gives a weaker viscous torque once evaluated by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="553194v2_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> according to a classical result reported by Landau <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Landau and Lifshitz (1971</xref>, 2013)).</p>
<p>It should be noted that this estimation assumes that the two cylinders: the egg shell and the embryo have the same axis of symmetry and concerns the beginning of the muscle activity where the radius is about 8.2 <italic>μm</italic>, the length is 90 <italic>μm</italic>, the radius of the shell is about <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>egg</italic></sub> = 15<italic>μm</italic> and the length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>egg</italic></sub> = 54<italic>μm</italic>, see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7(D)</xref>. The angular velocity Ω<sub><italic>e</italic></sub> is more difficult to evaluate but it is about 90° per two seconds deduced from videos. As the embryo approaches the eggshell, the friction increases, and two eccentric cylinders of different radii must be considered with the two symmetry axes separated by a distance <italic>d</italic>. The hydrodynamic study in this case is far from being trivial, and seems to have been first initiated by Zhukoski (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zhukoski (1887</xref>)), who proposed the use of bipolar coordinates for the mathematical treatment. Many subsequent papers were published after, using barious simplified assumptions, and the study was completely revisited by Ballal and Rivlin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ballal and Rivlin (1976</xref>)). Here we focus on the limit of a small gap <italic>δ</italic> between the rotating body shape and the egg and by considering an asymptotic analysis at small <italic>δ</italic> of the general result derived in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ballal and Rivlin (1976</xref>)). Thus, the viscous torque reads <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="553194v2_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> where <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> is the zone of contact with the egg and <italic>d</italic> = <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>egg</italic></sub> −<italic>δ</italic> −<italic>R</italic>. This approach is an approximation since the embryo is more toroidal than cylindrical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yang Xinyi et al. (2023</xref>)), but the evaluation of the dissipation is satisfactory for <italic>δ</italic> = 0.5<italic>μm</italic>, Ω<sub><italic>e</italic></sub> ∼ <italic>π</italic>/4 <italic>S</italic><sup>−1</sup> and <italic>μ</italic> = 10<sup>5</sup><italic>P a</italic>. Going back back to the first model of dissipation with the same data, the ratio between the dissipative viscous torque and the active one gives: Λ<sub><italic>ν</italic></sub>/Λ<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 0.02, which is obviously unsatisfactory. Finally, the dissipative energy ℰ<sub><italic>diSS</italic></sub> during one bending event leading to an angle of <italic>π</italic>/2 is ℰ = 1/2Λ<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> ×(<italic>π</italic>/2)<sup>2</sup> which represents 4% of the muscle elastic energy during the bending so at the beginning of the muscle activity (Appendix 5, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn45">Eq.(45)</xref>), the dissipation is present but is negligible. At the very end of the process, this ratio becomes 60% but as already mentioned, our estimate for the dissipation becomes very approximate, increases a lot due to the embryo confinement, and does not include the numerous biochemical steps necessary to reorganize the active network: actomyosin and muscles.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Since the discovery of the pre-embryonic muscle activity in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo, it has become critical to explain the role of mechanical forces generated by muscle contraction on the behavioral and functional aspects of the epidermis. We provide a mechanical model in which the <italic>C. elegans</italic> is simplified as a cylinder, and the muscle bands and actin that drive its elongation are modeled as active structures in a realistic position. We determine the fiber orientation from experimental observations and then calculate the deformation by tensorial analysis using the strains generated by the active components. Although a special focus is given to late elongation, its quantitative treatment cannot avoid the influence of the first stage of elongation due to the actomyosin network, which is responsible for a pre-strain of the embryo. In a finite elasticity formalism, the deformations induced by the muscles in a second step are coupled to the level of strains of the initial elongation period. For this, we must revisit the theory of the actomyosin contraction and previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ciarletta et al. (2009</xref>); <bold><italic>Vuong-Brender et al. (2017a</italic></bold>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ben Amar et al. (2018</xref>)) to unify the complete treatment. In particular, a model for the recruitment of active myosin motors under forcing is presented that recovers the experimental results of the first elongation phase</p>
<p>The elongation process of <italic>C. elegans</italic> during the late period is much more complex than the early elongation stage which is caused by actin contraction alone. During late elongation, the worm is deformed by the combined action of muscle and actomyosin, resulting in an energy-accumulating process. Bending deformation is a phenomenon resulting from unilateral muscle contraction, and during the late elongation, significant torsional deformation is observed, indicating that the bending process induces a reorientation of the actin fibers. It should be noted that the embryo always rotates in parallel to the muscle activity, which makes any experimental measurements difficult. However, our model can predict that if the muscles are not perfectly vertical,a torque is generated that causes rotation and eventually torsion. The accumulated energy is then partially converted into energy for the ongoing action of actin, allowing the embryo to elongate when the muscle relaxes. Both sides of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> muscles contract in a sequential cycle, repeating the energy conversion process, and eventually completing the elongation process. However, the energy exchange between bending and elongation is limited, among other factors, by the viscous dissipation induced by rotation, which is also evaluated in this study. The necessary reorganization of the active networks (actomyosin and muscles) due to this enormous shape change of the embryo is not investigated here in detail. Parallel to the elongation, the cuticle is built around the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Page and Johnstone (2007</xref>)). This very thin and stiff membrane provides protection and locomotion after hatching. Obviously, these processes will interfere with muscle activity. These two aspects, which intervene in the final stage of the worm’s confinement, play a very important role at the interface between genetics, biochemistry, and mechanics.</p>
<p>Finally, the framework presented here not only provides a theoretical explanation for embryonic elongation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but can also be used to model other biological behaviors, such as plant tropism (<bold><italic>Moulton et al. (2020b</italic></bold>)) and elephant trunk elongation (<bold><italic>Schulz et al. (2022b</italic></bold>,a)) and bending. Our ideas could potentially be used in the emerging field of soft robotics, such as octopus leg inspired robots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kang et al. (2012</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nakajima et al. (2013</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Calisti et al. (2015</xref>)), which are soft and their deformation is induced by muscle activation. We can reliably predict the deformation by knowing the position of activation and the magnitude of fthe orces in the model. In addition, residual stresses can be incorporated into our model to achieve design goals.</p>

<title>Methods and Materials</title>
<p>The model has been presented in a series of articles by A. Goriely and collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Goriely and Tabor (2013</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Moulton et al.

As one can imagine, this is far from trivial, and most of the literature on the subject concerns either full cylinders or cylindrical shells in torsion around the axis of symmetry, the case of bending is far from trivial. However, the geometry of the muscles in <italic>C. elegans</italic> automatically leads to a bending process that cannot be discarded. We take advantage of these previous works and apply the methodology to our model.</p>

<p>The finite deformation gradient: <bold>F</bold><sub>0</sub> = <italic>Diag</italic>(<italic>r</italic>′(<italic>R</italic>), <italic>r</italic>(<italic>R</italic>)/<italic>R, λ</italic>), and <bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub> = <italic>Diag</italic>(1, <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub>, 1), 0 &lt; <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub> &lt; 1 in the actin layer, and <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1 in the part without actin bundles. To determine the finite strain <bold>G</bold><sub>0</sub>, we converted the four muscle parts into thin layers attached to the epidermis in equal proportions to ensure the continuity of the model, and divided our model into four parts, see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>. The actin layer(<italic>R</italic><sub>3</sub> &lt; <italic>R</italic> &lt; <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>′), epidermis layer(<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> &lt; <italic>R</italic> &lt; <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>′) and muscle layer(<italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>′ &lt; <italic>R</italic> &lt; <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>) are considered as incompressible materials, and the inner part(0 &lt; <italic>R</italic> &lt; <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>′) is compressible. The Neo-Hookean energy function is used for the incompressible parts:

<p>Finally, by prescribing a zero traction condition on the top of the cylinder, the muscle part was noticeably considered inextensible, so there was no stress on the top:

<title>Time-scale for myosin detachment</title>
<p>The time required for non-muscle myosin detachment is estimated to be <italic>τ</italic><sub>0</sub> = 10<italic>S</italic> for free actomyosin filaments. If the actin filament is subjected to an external load perpendicular to its axis, detachment can be facilitated, or on the contrary, inhibited, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Howard and Clark (2002</xref>)), page 169-170. In the present case, the stresses acting in the radial direction of an actin bundle are compressive and thus will retard the detachment. This energy must be compared to the energy of detachment of all myosin motors from the bundle. The corresponding elastic energy associated with the radial deformation for an actin cable of length <italic>l</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> with radius <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> = 0.05<italic>μm</italic> estimated from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lardennois et al.

This result must be compared to the individual energy of detachment times the number of myosin motors on a cable. This number is difficult to determine but an estimate is given by the length of the cable <italic>l</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> divided by the distance between 2 myosin anchoring sites, which is about 5<italic>nm</italic> while the attachment energy per motor is about 6<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub><italic>T</italic>. These values are for skeletal muscle myosins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Howard and Clark (2002</xref>)) and must be taken with caution. Nevertheless, the order of magnitude of the detachment energy for a collection of myosin heads from actin cable can be estimated to be 4.8<italic>l</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>10<sup>−12</sup><italic>J</italic>. Then the ratio between the two quantities is of the order 4(1 −<italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>t</italic>)), which explains that the time scale of debonding for a cable under compressive stress in the direction orthogonal of its axis is then:

<p>The authors have made a novel and important effort to distinguish and include different sources of active deformations for fitting C elegans embryo development: cyclic muscle contractions and actomyosion circumferential stresses. The combination and synchronisation of both contributions are, according to the model, responsible for different elongation rates, and can induce bending and torsion deformations, which are a priori not expected from purely contractile forces. The model can be applied to other growth processes in initially cylindrical shapes.</p>
<p>The tilt of the fibers is an important assumption of the model. However, fiber direction in Figure 3B is not fully clear for explaining the tilting. The fiber in 3B has not very much in common with the fibers in the color part of the figure. Also, is vector m supposed to be tangent to the fiber? In the figure does not seem to be so. It should be expected that alpha is a consequence of the deformation, not as an input parameter, as it seems in the tests of Figure 6A. How is the value of alpha chosen? According to Figure 6, torsion is expected for alpha&gt;0, but for beta=pi/2 and alpha&gt;0 no torsion may be obtained. In fact, it seems that torsion should appear when cos(beta)*sin(alpha)&gt;0. As a consequence, value of beta should be given in Figure 6. Can the amount of torsion be tested as a function of alpha and beta?</p>
<p>The transfer of energy and deformation is a very interesting aspect of the paper, and also crucial for the model and predicting elongation. However, the modelling of this transfer remains very obscure and only explained in the Appendix. Some more details on how the transfer is selected should be given in the main text. Can the transfer of energy interpreted as a change of the relaxed reference configuration? Once a ratio of the energy transferred is fixed, the assumption on elongation distribution should be stated. (Uniformly? ) The authors should also define in the main text the factor g_a1, and explain how this value is computed from condition W_c=W_r .</p>
<p>Given the convoluted shape of the embryo in the egg, contact may be a crucial mechanism for determining growth and torsion. The model does not include this contact, and this limitation should be reflected in the article.</p>
<p>Minor comment:</p>
<p>
-Line 300: &quot;we determine the optimal values for the activation parameters&quot;. the optimal with respect to which objective? Norm of difference between experimental and computational displacements? How this is quantified needs to be specified.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>During C. elegans development, embryos undergo elongation of their body axis in absence of cell proliferation or growth. This process relies in an essential way on periodic contractions of two pairs muscles that extend along the embryo's main axis. How contraction can lead to extension along the same direction is unknown.</p>
<p>To address this question, the authors use a continuum description of a multicomponent elastic solid. The various components are the interior of the animal, the muscles, and the epidermis. The different components form separate compartments and are described as hyperelastic solids with different shear moduli. For simplicity, a cylindrical geometry is adopted. The authors consider first the early elongation phase, which is driven by contraction of the epidermis, and then late elongation, where contraction of the muscles injects elastic energy into the system, which is then transferred into elongation. The authors get elongation that can be successfully fitted to the elongation dynamics of wild type worms and two mutant strains.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work proposes a physical mechanism underlying a puzzling biological phenomenon. The framework developed by the authors could be used to explain phenomena in other organisms and could be exploited in the design of soft robots.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript is hard to read without being very familiar with continuum descriptions of elastic media. This might make the work difficult to access for biologists. This is a real pity because the findings are potentially of great interest to developmental biologists and engineers alike.</p>
<p>(2) The discussion of the worm's mechanical properties could go deeper. The authors hardly justify their assumptions.</p>

<p>(1) To mimic the embryo, we consider a multi-layered cylindrical body so that the shear modulus of each layer is different. The continuity of both deformations and stresses is imposed (see Eq.(26)-Eq.(30). This is the usual treatment for complex morpho-elastic systems. Obviously, $g_0$ originates from  the actomyosin cortex so it appears only in the corresponding layer. Finally, all physical quantities such as deformations and stresses must be continuous.</p>
<p>(2) The final outer radius is R_3, which represents the outer radius of C. elegans embryos. In addition to R_3, what we need to consider in this model are R_1’=0.7, R_1’=0.768, R_2=0.8 and R_2’=0.96, these definitions have been added in the caption of Appendix 2—figure 1.</p>

<p>These two different ways of expressing the energy function will ultimately affect the value of p, but the two p are not the same quantities, so they will not affect our results. To avoid misunderstandings, we will replace p in equation (19) with q.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>As mentioned in my public summary, I find the writing really not adequate. I provide here a list of specific points that the authors should in my opinion address. As a general comment, I would delete many instances of 'the'.</p>
<p>First, here are figures and whole paragraphs that do not seem to bring anything to the understanding of the phenomenon of C. elegans elongation, notably, Figs. 2, 3C-H, 5m, and 6. Figures 6G and 7 are the only figures containing results it seems. Some elements of the figures are repeated, for example, the illustration of the system's cross-section in Figs 3 and 5.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion, we have made some adjustments to our images to remove some of the duplicate information.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Second, and this is my most important criticism: the mechanism of elongation by releasing elastic stress introduced by muscle contraction is not explained in clear terms anywhere in the text. At least, I was unable to understand it. On p 10 you write &quot;This energy exchange causes the torsion-bending energy to convert into elongation energy, (...)&quot; How this is done is not explained. I assume that the reference state is somehow changed through muscle contraction. The new reference state probably has a longer axis than the one before, but this would then be a plastic deformation and not purely elastic as claimed by the authors (ll 76: &quot;This work aims to answer this paradox within the framework of finite elasticity without invoking cell plasticity (...)&quot;). Is torsion important for this process or is it 'just' another way to store elastic energy in the system?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We perfectly explain most of the exchange of energy between bending, torsion and elongation: indeed, we quantify all aspects of this transformation as the elastic elongation energy, and the dissipation processes which will cost energy. The dissipation evaluated here concerns the rotation of the worm due to the muscle geometry and the viscous friction at the inner surface of the egg.  Torsion seems to appear in the late stages and only in some cases. As we show, it comes from a torque induced by the muscles which are not vertical. vertical. Finally, our quantitative predictions of the modelling which recovers most of the experimental published results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Third, there are a number of strange phrasings and the notation is not helpful in places.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We feel sorry for that, the manuscript is now more precise.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Fourth, the title promises to explain how cyclic muscle contractions reinforce acto-myosin motors. I can't see this done in this work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The fact that the acto-myosin is reorganized between two sequences of contraction justifies the title. The complete reorganization of the actomyosin network would require a chemico-mechanical model that is not achieved here, perhaps in future work as data become available.</p>

<p>(1) The caption for Fig.1 is revised.</p>
<p>(2) From a mechanical point of view, actomyosin bundles in C elegans are orthoradial, whereas muscles are essentially parallel to the main axis of the body are essentially parallel to the main axis of the body, so the geometry is completely different and of extreme importance for deformation. Muscle contractions are quasi-periodic, we do not know the dynamics of the attached molecular motor of myosin.

<p>We have modified this figure, and the original Figure 3 now corresponds to Figures 3 and 4.</p>
<p>(1) The dashed line is the centerline after deformation.</p>
<p>(2) The referee is wrong: our model represents the fibers by a higher shear modulus for the actomyosin cortex and for the muscles (see Table Appendix 1) and G_1 reflects the activities of the muscle and actin fibers.</p>
<p>(3) The cube in Figure 3 is a mathematical 3D volume element that is subjected to stresses. Hyperelasticity modelling is based on such a representation.</p>
<p>(4) C-H(new version: Fig.4 A-F): These images show similar deformations: bending and torsion as our C. elegans study. These figures indicate that such deformations are quite common in nature, even if the underlying mechanism is different.</p>
<p>(5) This is a point we have already mentioned: we ignore the difference between the different types of epidermal cells and average their role in the early and second stages of elongation.</p>
<p>(6) The plant vine is the 'botanical vine', see Goriely's article and book.</p>
<p>(7) F-H(new version: Fig.4 D-F) do not have fixed rods, we set a curvature and torsion to fit the actual biological behavior.</p>

<p>Discussions concerning the biological referee questions:</p>
<p>Ll 75: “how the muscle contractions couple to the acto-myosin activity&quot; Again I find this misleading because muscle contraction relies on auto-myosin activity. Probably, you can find a better expression to refer to the activity of the actomyosin network in the epidermis. Do you propose any mechanism for how muscle contraction increases epidermal contractility? This does not seem to be the mechanism that you propose for elongation, is it?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The actomyosin activity will not stop because of the muscle contraction. Obviously, these two processes cannot be independent. The energy released by a muscle contraction event can and must contribute to the reorganization of the actomyosin network that occurs during the elongation process.  Indeed, despite the fact that the embryo elongates, the density of actin cables appears to be maintained, which automatically requires a redistribution of actin monomers. We propose a scenario in which muscle contraction increases actomyosin contractility via energy conversion. We show that after unilateral contraction there is an energy release for this once all dissipation factors are eliminated.  We invite the reviewer to re-examine Figure 2 and invite biologists to seriously evaluate the density of molecular motors attached to the circumferential actin cable throughout the stretch process.</p>

<p>Major criticism</p>
<p>Eq. 3 and Ll 227: &quot;𝑝1 is the ratio between the free available myosin population and the attached ones divided by the time of recruitment&quot; Why is the time of recruitment the same for all motors? &quot;inverse of the debonding time&quot; Is it the same as the unbinding rate? Why use the symbol p_2 for it? What is p_3?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The model proposed to justify the increase in the activity of the actomyosin motors during the first phase is a mean-field model: thus all quantities are averaged: we are not considering the theory of a single molecular motor, but a collection in a dynamic environment, so we do not need stochasticity here. Equation (3) concerns the compressive pre-strain, which by definition is a quantity varying between $0$ and $1$ and $X_g=1-G$. ... The debonding time is not the same as the debonding rate. The term $p_3$ indicates saturation and is derived from the law of mass action. The good agreement with the experimental data is shown in Fig.5 (A) and (B). An equivalent model has been developed by (M. Serra et al.).</p>

<p>Ll 275: &quot;This energy exchange causes the torsion-bending energy to convert into elongation energy, leading to a length increase during the relaxation phase, as shown in Fig.1 of Appendix 5.&quot; You have posed the puzzle of how contraction leads to elongation, and now that you resolve the puzzle, you simply say that torsion and bending energy are converted into elongation. How? Usually, if I deform an elastic object, it will return to its original configuration after releasing the external forces. Why is this not the case here?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the central result of your work is presented in an Appendix!?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the referee that an elastic object will return to its initial configuration by releasing stress, i.e. by giving up its accumulated elastic energy to the environment. But the elastic energy has to go somewhere, such as heat. We do not dare to say that the temperature of the worm increases during the muscle contractions.</p>
<p>In fact, the referee's comment also assumes that full relaxation of the stresses is possible, so the object is not a multi-layered specimen and/or it is not enclosed in a box.   Most living species are under stress, usually called residual stress.  Our skin is under stress. Our fingerprints result from an elastic instability of the epidermis, occurring on foetal life as our brain circumvolutions or our vili. .  So, it is obvious that stresses are maintained in multilayered living systems. Closer to the case of C. elegans, the existence of stresses has been demonstrated by experiments with laser ablation fractures in the first stage. The fact that the fractures open proves the existence of stress: if not, there is no opening and only a straight line.</p>
