<title>Abstract</title><p>Mouse oocytes undergo drastic changes in organellar composition and their activities during maturation from the germinal vesicle (GV) to meiosis II (MII) stage. After fertilization, the embryo degrades parts of the maternal components via lysosomal degradation systems, including autophagy and endocytosis, as zygotic gene expression begins during embryogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that endosomal-lysosomal organelles form large spherical assembly structures, termed ELYSAs, in mouse oocytes. ELYSAs are observed in GV oocytes, attaining sizes up to 7–8 μm in diameter in MII oocytes. ELYSAs comprise tubular-vesicular structures containing endosomes, lysosomes, autophagosome-like membranes in the outer layer, with cytosolic components contained within. The V1-subunit of vacuolar ATPase tends to localize to the periphery of ELYSAs in MII oocytes. After fertilization, the V1-subunit is recruited to immature endosomes and lysosomes as ELYSAs are gradually disassembled at the 2-cell stage, which leads to further acidification of endosomal-lysosomal organelles. These findings suggest that the ELYSAs maintain endosomal-lysosomal activity in a static state in oocytes for timely activation during early development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fertilization triggers the dynamic remodeling of cellular components via zygotic gene expression following the degradation of the cellular components of each maternal and paternal gamete. After fertilization, maternal cytosolic proteins and RNAs are selectively degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> and specific RNA degradation systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, respectively. Treatment with a proteasome inhibitor or knockdown of the zygote-specific proteasome assembly chaperone gene inhibits cytokinesis in zygotes, suggesting an essential role for the UPS in early development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Membrane components derived from each gamete are degraded by the lysosomal degradation system via autophagy and endocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In mice, autophagic activity is relatively low in meiosis II (MII) oocytes, whereas it is rapidly upregulated approximately 4 h after fertilization, and LC3-positive structures appear throughout the cytoplasm. Autophagic activity decreases slightly before and after the 2-cell stage but remains high from the 4- to 8-cell stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Loss of Atg5 causes embryonic lethality at the 4- to 8-cell stages, suggesting that autophagy is essential for early mouse development. In contrast, some maternal plasma membrane (PM) proteins are internalized from the PM at the late 2-cell stage and are selectively degraded by lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Endocytosis inhibitors prevent cell division in 2-cell embryos, suggesting that endocytosis plays a pivotal role in early development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Although lysosomal degradation systems are drastically upregulated after fertilization, their regulation remains unknown.</p>
<p>In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, lysosomal activity in oocytes is upregulated by sperm-derived factors as the oocytes grow and mature. In this process, translational arrest of mRNA coding the V1-subunits of vacuolar ATPase in oocytes is released by the stimulation of sperm-derived factors. Consequently, the V1-subunits are recruited to the V0-subunits in the lysosomal membrane, enhancing lysosomal acidification. This process is known as lysosomal switching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In mouse embryos, LysoTracker staining analysis suggests that lysosomal acidification is prominent at the 2-cell stage but not in MII oocytes and zygotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, raising the possibility that lysosomal switching takes place during mouse embryogenesis.</p>
<p>In this study, we aimed to investigate the dynamics of the endolysosomal system during mouse oocyte maturation and embryogenesis. We found that endosomes and lysosomes assembled to form spherical structures in germinal vesicle (GV)-stage oocytes, which became larger as they matured into MII oocytes. Ultrastructural analysis showed that these structures were large spherical membrane assemblies, including endosomes, lysosomes, and tubulo-vesicular structures located in the periphery of the PM. We refer to this structure as the <underline>E</underline>ndosomal-<underline>LYS</underline>osomal<underline> organellar A</underline>ssembly (ELYSA). The ELYSA contains several cytosolic constituents. While ELYSAs are disassembled in late-stage zygotes, immature endosomes and lysosomes gradually appear in the cytoplasm of early 2-cell stage embryos. Live imaging analysis showed that the V1-subunit of V-ATPase is targeted to the endolysosomal membrane, resulting in further acidification of lysosomal compartments during embryogenesis. These findings suggest that the ELYSA maintains low endosomal and lysosomal activities and acts as a waiting place for endolysosomal organelles to undergo fertilization-triggered activation toward embryogenesis.</p>

<title>Endosomes and lysosomes coordinately form giant structures in MII oocytes</title>
<p>To examine the localization of endosomes and lysosomes in mouse MII oocytes, early or late endosomes were stained with anti-RAB5 or RAB7 antibody, respectively, and their localization was compared with that of lysosomes stained with anti-LAMP1 antibody. Giant structures harboring lysosomes with early and late endosomes were detected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="figv1" ref-type="fig">Video 1</xref>). Each giant structure in the MII oocytes was spherical, ellipsoidal, or concatenated with small spheres. These structures were located in the peripheral region just beneath the PM, excluding the metaphase plate region in proximity to the metaphase chromosomes. These structures were observed from the GV stage to the pronuclear-zygote (PN-zygote) stage but were mostly disassembled at the 2-cell stage. Dispersion and separation of RAB5 and LAMP1 signals after the first division indicated that these giant structures were transiently formed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p>

<p>Analyses of the number, size, and distribution of LAMP1-positive organelles were carried out by reconstituting three-dimensional objects using LAMP1-positive signals in immunocytochemically stained oocytes and embryos (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Although the LAMP1 signals on the PM increased in the 2-cell stages, reconstitution of the objects was carried out only for the cytoplasmic fraction. The total number of the LAMP1-positive objects was highest at the GV stage, and it decreased toward the late 2-cell stage, with a significant difference compared to that in MII oocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Sorting of the objects based on their sizes (indicated with the diameters when converting the volume of each object to the corresponding sphere) revealed that the LAMP1-positive structures with diameters of 0.2–0.8 μm, which were prominent in GV oocytes, significantly decreased toward the MII stage, while the number of giant LAMP1-positive structures with diameters of 3–7 μm decreased during the post-fertilization changes at the early and late 2-cell stage relative to that in MII (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The transiently increased LAMP1-positive structures with 9–10 μm diameter at the early 2-cell stage were observed as concatenated spheres that gathered upon cellular division; concurrently, prominent signals on the PM appeared, especially at the cleavage furrow (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>). The total volume of LAMP1-positive objects was highest in MII, and it decreased over the early and late 2-cell stages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). LAMP1-positive structures with diameters of &gt;3 μm were also observed in GV oocytes, but those larger than 5 μm in diameter were rarely detected, and the total volume of LAMP1-positive structures larger than 3 μm in diameter in MII oocytes accounted for 51.3% of the total volume. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). The large population of the LAMP1-positive structures with diameters larger than 3 μm in MII transitioned to structures with diameters of 1–3 μm during the 2-cell stages, as indicated by the percentage of the volume of each object size relative to the total volume (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>).</p>

<p>Germinal vesicle (GV) oocyte, MII oocyte, early 2-cell (E2C: 24 hpf), and late 2-cell (L2C: 40 hpf) embryos were fixed and stained with anti-LAMP1 antibody.

<p>Furthermore, the analysis of object distribution for GV and MII oocytes indicated that MII oocytes had a greater number of LAMP1-positive structures with &gt;4 μm diameter in the cellular periphery, whereas GV oocytes had a greater number of these structures in the cellular medial regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H, I</xref>). These results suggest that the giant LAMP1-positive structures are enlarged and migrate to the cellular periphery during oocyte maturation.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Endosomes, lysosomes, and tubulo-vesicular structures form an ELYSA</title>
<p>To clarify the internal structure of this giant structure containing lysosomes and endosomes in the MII oocytes, we observed these in MII oocytes with in-resin correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) using immunological reaction (immune in-resin CLEM) with anti-RAB7 and -LAMP1 antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. RAB7- and LAMP1-signals were well detected even in the ultrathin section (100 nm thickness) of the Epon-embedded MII oocyte, fixed with the mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.025% glutaraldehyde (GA), which showed similar distribution as that shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>. Toluidine blue staining in adjacent ultrathin sections revealed that the RAB7/LAMP1-double positive structures in the fluorescence observation were also positive for toluidine blue, with interspaces were often found in the center of spheres (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Confocal fluorescent images of the ultrathin sections clarified that RAB7-positive signals were frequently observed on the periphery of these LAMP1-positive signals. Electron microscopic analysis of the RAB7/LAMP1-double positive region in the ultrathin sections revealed that the RAB7/LAMP1-double positive structures are assemblies of tubulo-vesicular structures, with either vacuolated or filled interiors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The toluidine blue stain-positive structures were confirmed to match in size and peripheral distribution with those identified via RAB7/LAMP1 immunostaining, except for the metaphase plate, even under 2.5% GA conditions for precise ultrastructural observation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="figv2" ref-type="fig">Video 2</xref>). Therefore, we examined the ultrastructural morphology of toluidine blue-positive giant structures in MII oocytes fixed with 2.5% GA. The results showed that tubular membrane vesicles with a short diameter of approximately 60.5 ± 15.9 nm assembled in the structure, with gaps in the cytoplasm of approximately 24.0 ± 6.7 nm. Some of the vesicles also harbored lysosome-like electron-dense contents, while others displayed multilamellar or multivesicular body-like structures, and mitochondria appeared to be absent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Based on these observations, we termed this membrane assembly the <underline>E</underline>ndosomal-<underline>LYS</underline>osomal<underline> organellar A</underline>ssembly (ELYSA).</p>

<title>An autophagosome marker, LC3, also accumulated in ELYSA</title>
<p>Decreased autophagic activity in MII oocytes is suggested by the fact that puncta formation of transgenically expressed GFP-LC3, an autophagosome marker, disappeared at the MII stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Since GFP fluorescence may be quenched under acidic conditions, we examined the localization of LC3 in GV and MII oocytes by immunostaining with an anti-LC3 antibody. We found that LC3 hardly formed puncta in the cytoplasm, but part of the LC3 signal overlapped with the ELYSA in both GV and MII oocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, B</xref>), suggesting that LC3-positive membrane structures were also present in the ELYSA.</p>

<title>ELYSA enlargement and migration proceed actin dependently</title>
<p>The migration from the perinuclear (medial region) to the peripheral region during oocyte maturation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H, I</xref>) is similar to the redistribution of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the formation of cortical ER clusters. Fitzharris et al. showed that the inhibition of actin cytoskeleton polymerization disturbs ER migration and cortical ER cluster formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Therefore, we added latrunculin A (LatA) or cytochalasin B (CCB) as inhibitors of actin polymerization, and nocodazole (Noco) as an inhibitor of microtubule formation, to examine whether these affect ELYSA formation after <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation (IVM). While all the drugs inhibited polar body extrusion and metaphase plate formation as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, co-immunostaining of LC3- or RAB5-antibody with LAMP1-antibody revealed their persistent colocalization in ELYSAs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

<p>Analysis of LAMP1-positive organelles via three-dimensional object analysis indicated that the actin polymerization inhibitors increased the organelle number, particularly those with diameters in the range of 0.8–2 μm, but the tubulin inhibitor Noco did not have the same effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, C</xref>). The total volume of the objects was largely unchanged by the inhibitors. However, treatment with an actin polymerization inhibitor increased the percentage of total volume occupied by the structures with diameters of 1–2 μm, while conversely decreasing that of the structures with diameters of 4–7 μm that correspond to the enlarged ELYSAs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D, E</xref>). Further examination of the distribution of the LAMP1-positive structures in IVM oocytes indicated that only actin polymerization inhibitors reduced the number of objects larger than 4 μm in diameter at the cell periphery but not that in the cellular medial region (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F, G</xref>).</p>

<title>V1 component of V-ATPase partially localizes to the periphery of ELISAs in oocytes</title>
<p>We studied the relationship between ELYSA formation and endosomal/lysosomal acidification in oocytes. V1A is a component of the V1 subunit of V-ATPase, which is associated with the outer lysosomal membrane and drives endosomal/lysosomal acidification. We used LAMP1-EGFP mRNA to observe ELYSA behaviors during oocyte maturation, with ATP6V1A-mCherry mRNA (V1A-mCherry: a core component of V-ATPase fused with the mCherry marker) to further examine whether the V1 subunit is targeted to ELYSAs. The mRNAs were injected into GV oocytes, and the oocytes were applied to IVM.</p>
<p>Live-cell imaging of LAMP1-EGFP fluorescence captured the dynamics of LAMP1-positive organelles during oocyte maturation, notably demonstrating its stable expression after germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD, 2–3 h after initiation of IVM), and revealed that the enlargement of ELYSAs larger than 5 μm in diameter occurred through the sequential assembly of smaller ELYSAs that constantly migrated and contacted each other (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref rid="figv3" ref-type="fig">Video 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Acidification of lysosomes is facilitated as ELYSA disassembly proceeds in embryos</title>
<p>We examined the relationship between ELYSA disappearance and the emergence of acidic membrane compartments during early development. LysoSensor probes exhibit increased fluorescence in a pH-dependent manner upon acidification and enable the semi-quantitative analysis of cellular acidic compartments, whereas LysoTracker probes exhibit non-pH-dependent fluorescence. We first co-stained oocytes and embryos at various stages with LysoTracker Red and LysoSensor Green (in the same medium drop). LysoTracker showed a pronounced puncta-like signal after the 2-cell stage, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In contrast, the ELYSAs in GV and MII oocytes were clearly identified by LysoSensor, whereas LysoTracker only produced a very dim signal. Thus, the ratio of LysoTracker/LysoSensor fluorescent intensities in the cytoplasm of each stage embryo indicated that ELYSAs were present at a low ratio, while embryos at the 4-cell stage and beyond displayed small punctate signals with a higher ratio (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). A comparison between LysoTracker and V1A-mCherry signals showed that these fluorescent signals colocalized well on small bright vesicles but not on the ELYSA, and both LysoTracker and V1A-mCherry puncta were reduced in embryos cultured in the presence of bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>, which inhibits the H⁺ translocation of V-ATPase (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). This suggests that LysoTracker detects membrane compartment acidification, but it may not sufficiently capture this process within the ELYSA. In contrast, the results using LysoSensor suggest that lysosomes within the ELYSA were not completely neutralized and remained acidic at a lower level, even though V1A was difficult to localize.</p>

In this process, targeting of V1A to lysosomes was rarely observed until ELYSA disappearance or disassembly throughout the PN-zygote stage, but the targeting was rapidly enhanced in the early 2-cell embryo stage. LysoSensor-positive punctate structures, where V1A-mCherry accumulated, increased in number during the transition from early to late 2-cell stage, indicating that lysosomal acidification is promoted after ELYSA disappearance (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>, <xref rid="figv5" ref-type="fig">Video 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we identified a large spherical structure, the ELYSA, consisting of endosomes, lysosomes, LC3-positive vesicles, and various vesicular-tubular structures in mouse oocytes. Small ELYSAs are formed in GV oocytes and become larger (3 to 7 μm in diameter) through assembly, migrating to the cellular periphery, in an actin-dependent manner during oocyte maturation and occupy more than half the volume of the LAMP1-positive fraction in MII oocytes. After fertilization, as ELYSAs gradually disassemble in zygotes, punctate structures positive for either RAB5- or LAMP1-signal alone appear in the cytoplasm of embryos at the early 2-cell stage. The V1-subunit of V-ATPase is targeted to these structures, leading to further acidification of the endosomal/lysosomal compartments. These results suggest that the ELYSA functions as a reservoir that accumulates endosomal and lysosomal compartments in the periphery of the cell cortex and maintains their activities in a static state until embryogenesis following fertilization.</p>
<p>We have studied the dynamics and activity of endosomes and lysosomes in mouse oocytes and embryo and have found that some oocyte PM proteins are internalized from the PM at the late 2-cell stage and are selectively degraded in lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In this process, we noted that lysosomes were not well stained by LysoTracker until the early 2-cell stage, but their signals became stronger from the late 2-cell stage, suggesting the existence of a mechanism underlying developmentally regulated endosomal/lysosomal activation during embryogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Notably, ELYSAs were stained with toluidine blue and LysoSensor, suggesting that these structures were acidified to some extent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). In addition, Magic Red, which reflects cathepsin B activity, weakly stained ELYSAs (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). These observations indicate that lysosomes in ELYSAs have some activity, albeit at low levels. Mouse oocytes accumulate several maternal constituents, including proteins, lipids, and mRNA, and grow to approximately 75 μm in diameter. In addition, oocytes must remain at the GV and MII stages for an extended period to maintain their quality until fertilization. In such situations, lysosomal degradation activity may be suppressed to a relatively low level by the ELYSA, whereas nutrient uptake, storage, and protein synthesis are predominantly upregulated in growing oocytes. Furthermore, we found that the V1-subunits were largely detected on the periphery of ELYSAs but not in their interior in oocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Thus, it is possible that ELYSA formation prevents V1-subunits from targeting the lysosomal membrane inside the ELYSA.</p>
<p>Ultrastructural analysis revealed that the ELYSA consists of outer and inner membrane assembly layers that contain several endosomes and lysosomes, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Upon disassembly of the ELYSA, endosomes in the outer layer and lysosomes in the inner layer are expected to be released from the ELISA earlier and later, respectively. This may explain the time lag between fertilization and lysosomal acidification beginning at the early-2-cell stage. Since the ELYSA appears to contain cytosolic constituents, it may accommodate some cytosolic constituents as a capsule to provide nutrition or signaling factors for development.</p>
<p>ELYSAs were gradually distributed from the perinuclear region to the periphery of the oocyte cell cortex, except in the MII cell plate, from the GV to the MII stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This movement is reminiscent of that of the ER and cortical ER clusters, whose distribution is regulated by the actomyosin system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In fact, the treatment of actin cytoskeleton polymerization inhibitors, but not a tubulin polymerization inhibitor, prevented the redistribution of ELYSAs from the cell cortex to the cytoplasm in oocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The former treatment increased the number of small LAMP1-positive organelles but reduced the size of ELYSAs in oocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). These results suggest that actin cytoskeleton is involved in the assembly of smaller (&lt;2 μm in diameter) LAMP1-positive organelles for the enlargement of ELYSAs and also in the redistribution of ELYSAs to the cell periphery.</p>
<p>Our detailed imaging analysis showed that lysosomal acidification is promoted by the accumulation of the V1-subunits on lysosomes during ELYSA disassembly in late zygotes and is further facilitated from the 2- to 4-cell stage and is enhanced after the morula stage (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). These findings suggest that lysosomal acidification and maturation are linked to the ELYSA disassembly. Notably, minor and major zygotic gene activation in mouse embryos occur at the 1- and 2-cell stages, respectively, implying that lysosomal degradation of maternal components is coupled with zygotic gene expression to promote embryogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Fertilization appears to trigger ELYSA disassembly, but the downstream signaling pathways remain to be identified and warrant further research.</p>
<p>Very recently, after sharing this ELYSA paper as a preprint in 2023<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, Zaffagnini et al. reported the endolysosomal vesicular assemblies (ELVAs), which resemble with ELYSAs, in mouse oocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Consistencies between the ELVA and ELYSA in their contents and actin-dependent dynamics during oocyte maturation/embryogenesis strongly suggests that ELYSAs and ELVAs are identical structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, assuring the solidity of these findings in this paper. Zaffagnini et al. also observed the accumulation of proteasomes and ubiquitinated proteins in ELVAs and demonstrated that the depletion of a RUN and FYVE domain-containing protein 1 (RUFY1) protein from oocytes by the Trim-Away method causes disappearance of ELVAs, suggesting that RUFY1 is involved in the ELVA assembly. Analysis of <italic>Rufy1</italic>-knockout ELVA/ELYSA free oocytes is awaited to elucidate the physiological role of ELVAs or probably ELYSAs. They also suggested that ELVAs sequester and degrade specific proteins that is known to be aggregate and cause diseases, including proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase KIT, upon oocyte maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Complementally to their findings, our study revealed that the recruitment of the V1-subunit is limited on ELYSAs in oocytes but enhanced on the isolated LAMP1-positive vesicles after late 2-cell stage. These findings support a hypothesis that ELYSA has a multimodal function, keeping endosomal and lysosomal compartments at a relatively static state and supplying these membrane compartments as a reservoir for embryogenesis.</p>
<p>Inhibition of lysosomal acidification by bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub> treatment arrests embryogenesis at the 4–8-cell stage, while inhibition of cathepsin activity using a mixture of E64d and pepstatin A blocks embryogenesis at the 8-cell or morula stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In contrast, the inhibition of endocytosis by Pitstop2 treatment causes arrest at the 2-cell stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. These differences may imply that at the 2-cell stage, the endocytic activity is more important than the lysosomal degradation activity, which is essential at later stages. However, insights from this study shed light on the correlation between increased endocytic/autophagic activity and lysosomal maturation through ELYSA disassembly and the potential significance of minor lysosomal maturation in the early phase of embryogenesis.</p>
<p>The relationship between such endocytic/autophagic activities in early-stage embryos and the embryonic developmental potential have been recently studied. Using GFP-LC3 as an indicator of autophagic activity, Tsukamoto et al. found that aged oocytes from 14- to 15-month-old mice had lower autophagic activity than those from younger mice, probably due to decreased lysosomal activity. Females transplanted with embryos with high autophagic activity at the 4-cell stage have a significantly higher litter size ratio than that of control females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Analysis of ELYSA formation and disassembly in aged oocytes and embryos may be a useful tool for determining oocyte quality by examining appropriate regulation of endosomal/lysosomal activities.</p>

Briefly, oocytes were fixed in 4% PFA and 0.025% glutaraldehyde (GA). After permeabilization with 50 μg/mL digitonin (Nacalai Tesque) and 0.02% Triton X-100, oocytes were washed with PVA/PBS three times and incubated with PBS containing 10% (w/v) FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature. Thereafter, oocytes were incubated with PVA/PBS containing primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with a secondary antibody in PVA/PBS for 2 h, oocytes were fixed in 4% PFA and 2.5% GA, embedded in 1.5% agarose, stained with osmium tetroxide, dehydrated with graded ethanol solutions (QY1), and embedded in epoxy resin (Oken Shoji, Tokyo, Japan). Ultrathin sections of Epon-embedded oocytes (100-nm thickness) were prepared using a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica, Nussloch, Germany) and placed on glass coverslips. Subsequently, fluorescence microscopy images of the sections were obtained using a Nikon A1RHD25 confocal laser scanning microscope with a NIS-Elements software (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Electron microscopic images were observed using a Helios Nanolab 660 FIB-SEM instrument (FEI Company, Hillsboro, USA).</p>
<p>For conventional electron microscopy, the oocytes were fixed in the presence of 2% PFA and 2.5% GA and stained with osmium tetroxide. After dehydration with ethanol, the oocytes were embedded in epoxy resin, as described above. Sections were cut at a thickness of 100 nm using a UC6 ultramicrotome, mounted on glass coverslips, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed under a Regulus8240 scanning electron microscope (Hitachi High-Tech Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).</p>

<title>Serial semi-thin sections and 3D reconstruction of toluidine blue-positive structures</title>
<p>Serial semi-thin sections were cut at a thickness of 300 nm using a UC6 ultramicrotome and mounted on glass slides. Next, the sections were stained with 1% toluidine blue/0.1 M PB, and images were obtained using a BX50 light microscope (Olympus Corporation). Serial toluidine blue-stained images were aligned using FIJI (National Institutes of Health, MD, USA) with plugin-linear stack alignment using SIFT (LSAS), and 3D reconstruction was performed using Amira software (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>

<title>Microinjection into the oocytes</title>
<p>Microinjection of mRNA into GV oocytes was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Briefly, antral follicles were harvested in FHM medium containing 250 μM of dbcAMP using 26G needles (Terumo). After dissociating the cumulus cells by pipetting, the oocytes were transferred to medium supplemented with 250 μM of dbcAMP and 10 μM of cytochalasin B (Sigma-Aldrich). Thereafter, mRNA injection into the oocytes was performed using a piezo-micromanipulator (Primetech, Tokyo, Japan) with a glass capillary needle. The mRNA concentrations were 50 and 100 ng/μL for <italic>V1A-mCherry</italic> and <italic>Lamp1-EGFP</italic>, respectively. The oocytes were washed three times and used for IVM. Microinjection of mRNA into zygote stage embryo (at 3–4 hpf) was carried out as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The concentration of mRNA was the same as that in the GV oocytes.</p>

<title>Time-lapse confocal imaging of oocytes/embryos</title>
<p>Low-invasive confocal fluorescence imaging of oocytes/embryos was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> with slight modifications. Briefly, on an inverted microscope IX-71 (Olympus Corporation) equipped with a CSU W-1 confocal scanner unit (Yokogawa Electric Corporation), an incubation chamber (Tokai Hit, Fujinomiya, Japan) was set at 37 °C on the microscope stage, with a gas mixture of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> introduced into the chamber at 150 mL/min. Oocytes/embryos were placed in 8 μL of IVM medium or KSOM drops covered with liquid paraffin (Nacalai Tesque) in 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek Corporation). Subsequently, confocal images at 41 <italic>z</italic>-axis planes with 2-μm increments for excitation lasers of 470- and 555-nm from an LDI-7 Laser Diode Illuminator (89North, Williston, VT, USA) were obtained every 30 or 60 min during IVM or embryonic culture observation, respectively, through optimized band-pass filters using 30× silicone immersion lens UPLSAPO30XS (Olympus Corporation).</p>

<sec id="s4m">
<title>Three-dimensional object analysis</title>
<p>Series of confocal images with 81 z-axis planes with 1-μm increments for LAMP1 immunostaining were used for 3D object analysis. Fields to analyze were cropped for each oocyte/embryo, and the upper and lower end of LAMP1 fluorescent signals in the cytosol were examined to determine the center plane (middle height) of the cell. The cellular region in the center plane was used for masking and determination of the geometric center (as a 3D center) of each oocyte. Deletion of the signals from the polar body or zona pellucida was carried out manually. Objects were profiled using the 3D object counter plugin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> of Fiji software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, to measure the number, volume, geometric center of each object, and mean distance from the geometrical center of the object to its surface. Thresholding was carried out after background subtraction using the Fiji software, manually applying intensities of 600–1200 as threshold to recognize objects separately. Signals on PM were eliminated both via size filtering (0–5000 μm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>) of the 3D object counter plugin and manual erasing. The distal distance of each object from the 3D center of the oocyte was used for distribution analysis to avoid underestimation of the distance of large ELYSA. This was calculated by adding the distance from the 3D center of the oocyte to the geometric center of each object and the mean distance from the geometrical center of the object to its surface. Distance calculation and generation of bar graphs were carried out using Excel 2016 software (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA).</p>

<sec id="s4n">
<title>Analysis of microscopic images and movies</title>
<p>Analysis of the acquired images, including the generation of a line plot of intensity, adjustment of intensity, and generation of montage images at a uniform intensity, was performed using Fiji software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. To enhance the images, a Gaussian Blur filter (at a sigma radius of 1) and auto-adjustment of the intensity were applied to the stack of images. To adjust the intensity, auto-adjustment of the intensity was applied to each image. The movies were concatenated using Premiere Pro software (Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA).</p>

<sec id="s4o">
<title>Statistics and reproducibility</title>
<p>Sample sizes were estimated based on previous studies using similar experiments, and results from preliminary experiments were examined to ensure statistical power more than 0.8 using statistical power analysis in the G*Power software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Statistical analyses and generation of dot plot graphs were performed using Graph-Pad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Boston, MA, USA). The significance of difference among groups were compared using one-way ANOVA. The experimenters were not blinded because of a limitation in the availability of experienced personnel.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Satouh et al. report giant organelle complexes in oocytes and early embryos. Although these structures have often been observed in oocytes and early embryos, their exact nature has not been characterized. The authors named these structures &quot;endosomal-lysosomal organelles form assembly structures (ELYSAs)&quot;. ELYSAs contain organelles such as endosomes, lysosomes, and probably autophagic structures. ELYSAs are initially formed in the perinuclear region and then migrate to the periphery in an actin-dependent manner. When ELYSAs are disassembled after the 2-cell stage, the V-ATPase V1 subunit is recruited to make lysosomes more acidic and active. The ELYSAs are most likely the same as the &quot;endolysosomal vesicular assemblies (ELVAs)&quot;, reported by Elvan Böke's group earlier this year (Zaffagnini et al. doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.01.031). However, it is clear that Satouh et al. identified and characterized these structures independently. These two studies could be complementary. Although the nature of the present study is generally descriptive, this paper provides valuable information about these giant structures. The data are mostly convincing, and only some minor modifications are needed for clarification and further explanation to fully understand the results.</p>

<p>Satouh et al report the presence of spherical structures composed of endosomes, lysosomes, and autophagosomes within immature mouse oocytes. These endolysosomal compartments have been named as Endosomal-LYSosomal organellar Assembly (ELYSA). ELYSAs increase in size as the oocytes undergo maturation. ELYSAs are distributed throughout the oocyte cytoplasm of GV stage immature oocytes but these structures become mostly cortical in the mature oocytes. Interestingly, they tend to avoid the region which contains metaphase II spindle and chromosomes. They show that the endolysosomal compartments in oocytes are less acidic and therefore non-degradative but their pH decreases and becomes degradative as the ELYSAs begin to disassemble in the embryos post-fertilization. This manuscript shows that lysosomal switching does not happen during oocyte development, and the formation of ELYSAs prevents lysosomes from being activated. Structures similar to these ELYSAs have been previously described in mouse oocytes (Zaffagnini et al, 2024) and these vesicular assemblies are important for sequestering protein aggregates in the oocytes but facilitate proteolysis after fertilization. The current manuscript, however, provides further details of endolysosomal disassembly post-fertilization. Specifically, the V1-subunit of V-ATPase targeting the ELYSAs increases the acidity of lysosomal compartments in the embryos. This is a well-conducted study and their model is supported by experimental evidence and data analyses.</p>

<p>Fertilization converts a cell defined as an egg to a cell defined as an embryo. An essential component of this switch in cell fate is the degradation (autophagy) of cellular elements that serve a function in the development of the egg but could impede the development of the embryo. Here, the authors have focused on the behavior during the egg-to-embryo transition of endosomes and lysosomes, which are cytoplasmic structures that mediate autophagy. By carefully mapping and tracking the intracellular location of well-established marker proteins, the authors show that in oocytes endosomes and lysosomes aggregate into giant structures that they term Endosomal LYSosomal organellar Assembl[ies] (ELYSA). Both the size distribution of the ELYSAs and their position within the cell change during oocyte meiotic maturation and after fertilization. Notably, during maturation, there is a net actin-dependent movement towards the periphery of the oocyte. By the late 2-cell stage, the ELYSAs are beginning to disintegrate. At this stage, the endo-lysosomes become acidified, likely reflecting the activation of their function to degrade cellular components.</p>
<p>This is a carefully performed and quantified study. The fluorescent images obtained using well-known markers, using both antibodies and tagged proteins, support the interpretations, and the quantification method is sophisticated and clearly explained. Notably, this type of quantification of confocal z-stack images is rarely performed and so represents a real strength of the study. It provides sound support for the conclusions regarding changes in the size and position of the ELYSAs. Another strength is the use of multiple markers, including those that indicate the activity state of the endo-lysosomes. Altogether, the manuscript provides convincing evidence for the existence of ELYSAs and also for regulated changes in their location and properties during oocyte maturation and the first few embryonic cell cycles following fertilization.</p>
<p>At present, precisely how the changes in the location and properties of the ELYSAs affect the function of the endo-lysosomal system is not known. While the authors' proposal that they are stored in an inactive state is plausible, it remains speculative. Nonetheless, this study lays the foundation for future work to address this question.</p>
<p>Minor point: l. 299. If I am not mistaken, there is a typo. It should read that the inhibitors of actin polymerization prevent redistribution from the cytoplasm to the cortex during maturation.</p>
<p>
Minor point: A few statements in the Introduction would benefit from clarification. These are noted in the comments to the authors.</p>
