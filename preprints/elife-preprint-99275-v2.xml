<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>The intuitive manipulation of specific amino acids to alter the activity or specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 has been a topic of great interest. As a large multi-domain RNA-guided endonuclease, the intricate molecular crosstalk within the Cas9 protein hinges on its conformational dynamics, but a comprehensive understanding of the extent and timescale of the motions that drive its allosteric function and association with nucleic acids remains elusive. Here, we investigated the structure and multi-timescale molecular motions of the recognition (Rec) lobe of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, a thermophilic Cas9 from <italic>Geobacillus stearothermophilus.</italic> Our results provide new atomic details about the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec subdomains (<italic>Geo</italic>Rec1, <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2) and the full-length domain in solution. Two rationally designed mutants, K267E and R332A, enhanced and redistributed micro-millisecond flexibility throughout <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, and NMR studies of the interaction between <italic>Geo</italic>Rec and its guide RNA showed that mutations reduced this affinity and the stability of the ribonucleoprotein complex.</p>
<p>Despite measured biophysical differences due to the mutations, DNA cleavage assays reveal no functional differences in on-target activity, and similar specificity. These data suggest that guide RNA interactions can be tuned at the biophysical level in the absence of major functional losses, but also raise questions about the underlying mechanism of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, since analogous single-point mutations have significantly impacted on- and off-target DNA editing in mesophilic <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> Cas9. A K267E/R332A double mutant did also did not enhance <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 specificity, highlighting the robust tolerance of mutations to the Rec lobe of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and species-dependent complexity of Rec across Cas9 paralogs. Ultimately, this work provides an avenue by which to modulate the structure, motion, and guide RNA interactions at the level of the Rec lobe of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, setting the stage for future studies of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 variants and their effect on its allosteric mechanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The vast majority of Cas systems explored as genome editors originate from mesophilic hosts. The emergence of the thermophilic <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, with DNA cleavage function up to 85°C, can expand CRISPR technology to higher temperature regimes and stabilities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> but its regulatory mechanism relative to canonical Cas9s must be established. The <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9, which originates from the mesophilic <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, as well as <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, are both effectors of Type-II CRISPR systems. Interestingly, the Type II-A <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 has been by far the most used Cas enzyme, including in ongoing clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> But Cas9 homologs of the Type II-C class, such as <italic>Neisseria meningitis</italic> (<italic>Nme</italic>Cas9) and <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> (<italic>Cje</italic>Cas9), to which <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 belongs, have been validated for mammalian genome editing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> reinforcing the need to better understand this CRISPR class.</p>
<p>The similar domain arrangements of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 led us to initially speculate that these could share atomic level mechanistic similarities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 utilizes a guide RNA (gRNA) to localize and unwind a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) target after recognition of its 5’NNNNCRAA-3’ protospacer adjacent motif (PAM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> Upon recognition of the PAM sequence by the PAM-Interacting domain (PI), Cas9-bound guide (gRNA) forms an RNA:DNA hybrid with the target DNA strand. Initially thought to be part of the PI domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, the wedge (WED) domain recognizes the repeat:anti-repeat region of the gRNA and the dsDNA upstream of the target region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> The Rec lobe of Cas9 is responsible for orienting the RNA:DNA hybrid, as well as the adjacent nuclease domains, into their active conformations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Coordinated cleavage of the target and non-target DNA strand then occurs via the HNH and RuvC nucleases, respectively. The <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 nuclease active sites within HNH and RuvC are spatially distinct from the PAM recognition site in the PI domain, necessitating structural and dynamic changes that allosterically couple dsDNA binding to cleavage. Biochemical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and structural<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> experiments using the extensively studied <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 have revealed that its function is governed by a sophisticated allosteric mechanism that transfers gRNA and dsDNA binding information from the Rec lobe to the distal catalytic sites. A dynamically driven allosteric signal spans the HNH domain of <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9, enabled by the plasticity of the Rec lobe, which orchestrates the conformational activation required for DNA cleavage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> Our prior work revealed a divergence in the timescales of allosteric motions in the <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 and <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 HNH domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> suggesting an unusually flexible HNH and unique allosteric mode of regulation for <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. It is therefore also possible that docking of the gRNA with <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, and thus its interaction with the RNA:DNA hybrid, may differ from the <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 system, as <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 contains a truncated Rec lobe with only two of the three canonical subdomains.</p>
<p>The high thermal stability and more compact size of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (it is 281 residues shorter than <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9) can be especially important for <italic>in vivo</italic> delivery applications, since promising viral vectors (<italic>i.e.</italic> adeno-associated virus, AAV) have cargo capacities of ∼4.7kb,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> which prevents <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9-gRNA packaging into a single AAV vector but permits “all-in-one” delivery of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9-sgRNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Until the very recent cryo-EM structures of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> little was known about specific residues that influence its structure, gRNA binding, or function. Our recent NMR work with <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 uncovered pathways of micro-millisecond timescale motions that propagate chemical information related to allostery and specificity through <italic>Sp</italic>Rec and its RNA:DNA hybrid,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> prompting us to investigate this phenomenon in <italic>Geo</italic>Rec.</p>
<p>An atomic-level structural understanding of specificity in large multi-domain protein-nucleic acid complexes like Cas9 is often difficult to address by NMR spectroscopy. Although dynamic ensembles in DNA repair enzymes have provided some insight,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> many efforts to improve Cas9 specificity and reduce off-target activity have relied on large mutational screens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> or error-prone PCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, which are less intuitive. Inter-subunit allosteric communication between the catalytic HNH domain and the Rec lobe is critical to Cas9 specificity, as the binding of off-target DNA sequences at Rec alter HNH dynamics to affect DNA cleavage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> To further probe the fundamental role of protein motions in the function and specificity of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, as well as the effect of protein-nucleic acid interactions on its structural signatures, we engineered two mutations in <italic>Geo</italic>Rec (K267E and R332A, housed within <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2). We hypothesized that these variants could enhance <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 specificity (<italic>i.e.</italic> limit its off-target cleavage) for two reasons. First, the chosen mutation sites are homologous to those of specificity-enhancing variants of <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Second, altered Cas9-gRNA interactions have been shown to be a consequence of specificity-enhancement and these charged residues appear to directly interact with the gRNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> Balancing these two points is the fact that Type-II Cas systems generally have conserved nuclease domains, but are delineated by highly varied Rec lobes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> This implies that the structural and dynamic properties of Rec may play an outsized role in differentiating the functions of <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 and <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, which may not be identical. Nevertheless, our work provides new insight into the biophysical, biochemical, and functional role of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe and how mutations modulate the domain itself and its interaction with gRNA in full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9.</p>

<title>The structural similarity of GeoRec1, GeoRec2, and GeoRec facilitates NMR analysis of protein dynamics and RNA affinity</title>
<p><italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 is a 1087 amino acid polypeptide, thus we employed a “divide and concur” approach for NMR studies, which we previously showed to be useful for quantifying allosteric structure and motion in <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> The <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe is comprised of subdomains <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, which likely work together to recognize nucleic acids. We engineered constructs of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 (136 residues, 16 kDa) and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 (212 residues, 25 kDa) subdomains and solved the X-ray crystal structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 at 1.49 Å, which aligns remarkably well with the structure of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 domain within the AlphaFold model (RMSD 1.03 Å) and new cryo-EM structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (RMSD 1.10 Å, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We were neither able to crystallize <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 nor full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 in the apo state, but our <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 crystal structure represents the structure of the subdomain within the full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 protein quite well. Our previous studies of <italic>Geo</italic>HNH also show identical superpositions of X-ray crystal structures with full-length Cas complexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> In addition to the individual subdomains, we also generated an NMR construct of the intact <italic>Geo</italic>Rec (370 residues, 43 kDa).</p>

<p>Despite only 22% sequence identity, the structure of <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 are highly similar (RMSD 2.00 Å, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1</xref>). The structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1, in contrast, does not align perfectly with <italic>Sp</italic>Rec1, instead, it partially aligns with both <italic>Sp</italic>Rec1 and <italic>Sp</italic>Rec2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, the nearly identical <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 architectures and their intrinsic dynamics may be a common thread among Type II Cas9s of different size and PAM preference. To capture atomic-level signatures of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, we obtained well-resolved <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N NMR fingerprint spectra for all three protein constructs and assigned the amide backbones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2</xref>). <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N amide and <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub> Ile, Leu, and Val (ILV)-methyl NMR spectra (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S3</xref>) of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec overlay very well with those of its individual subdomains, suggesting that the linkage of subdomains within the full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Rec polypeptide does not alter their individual folds. Consistent with this observation, circular dichroism (CD) thermal unfolding profiles of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> ∼ 34 °C) and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 61.50°C) are distinct and occur as separate events in the unfolding profile of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4</xref>). The dumbbell shape of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, with its two globular subdomains connected by a short flexible linker, is a likely contributor to these biophysical properties.</p>

<title>Rationally designed GeoRec2 mutants do not substantially impact the GeoRec structure</title>
<p>To understand how the structure and gRNA interactions of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 can be modulated at the level of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, we engineered two charge-altering point mutants in the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 subdomain, K267E and R332A. Based on the AlphaFold2 model of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, both of these residues are &lt; 5Å from the bound RNA:DNA hybrid and were predicted to interface with the nucleic acids directly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A/B</xref>). A new experimental cryo-EM structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 confirmed the interaction between K267 and the gRNA, but does not report a &lt; 5Å interaction of R332 with the gRNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> The rationale for our designed mutations was also that removal of positive charge would weaken the interactions between <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and the gRNA, affecting <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> via the electrostatics or dynamics of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe. Studies of <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 revealed that interaction of <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 (analogous to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2) with its RNA:DNA hybrid triggers conformational rearrangements that allow the catalytic HNH domain to sample its active conformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Thus, <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 acts as an allosteric effector that recognizes the RNA:DNA hybrid to activate HNH. Mismatches (<italic>i.e.</italic> off-target DNA sequences) in the target DNA generally prevent <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 from undergoing the full extent of its required conformational rearrangements, leaving HNH in a “proofreading” state with its catalytic residues too far from the DNA cleavage site.

<title>Mutations enhance and redistribute molecular motions within GeoRec2</title>
<p>Due to the high molecular weight of the intact <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe, decays in NMR signal associated with spin relaxation experiments were significant and hampered data quality. Thus, we focused on quantifying the molecular motions of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 subdomain, where the K267E and R332A mutations reside, and the chemical shift perturbations are most apparent.

<p>Since <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 have similar structures and μs-ms flexibility, we speculated that charge-altering mutations would modulate the biophysical properties of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec and the function of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, as observed for <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9.

<title>Mutations within GeoRec alter its affinity for guide RNA</title>
<p>The role of the Rec lobe in orienting the RNA:DNA hybrid within Cas9 is crucial to its function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Thus, the structure, motions, and nucleic acid interactions of Rec represent a critical piece of the Cas9 signaling machinery. Previous studies of <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 revealed that gRNA binding to the Rec lobe induces a global structural rearrangement of the protein that positions the adjacent HNH into its “proofreading” state,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> after which target DNA binding positions the nucleases into active conformations for cleavage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> We wondered if the atomistic details of the apo <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9-to-RNP transition could be captured by NMR using the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec construct. In our previous studies, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA cleavage assay with <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and a 141nt gRNA containing a 21nt spacer targeting the mouse <italic>Tnnt2</italic> gene locus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Since this assay was already established, we utilized the same gRNA sequence. However, truncating this gRNA was necessary to optimize binding studies for NMR analysis. We focused on the 5’ end of the gRNA, which includes the spacer sequence, based on the <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 AlphaFold2 model and structural data from <italic>Nme</italic>Cas9 and <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 showing interactions between the Rec lobe and this region of the gRNA. The subsequent cryo-EM structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 corroborated this interaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> Initial attempts using a truncated 101nt gRNA resulted in poor NMR spectra. An overlay of the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC NMR spectra of apo <italic>Geo</italic>Rec and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec-RNP at a 1:1 molar ratio showed extensive line broadening (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S11</xref>), likely due to the large size of the complex (75.5 kDa). To mitigate this issue, a 39nt gRNA containing the 21bp spacer sequence was selected for its ability to maintain the NMR signal while being long enough to interact fully with the Rec lobe, as suggested by prior structures. When bound to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, this complex is 55.6 kDa and a <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N NMR spectral overlay of apo <italic>Geo</italic>Rec and the domain bound to 39nt gRNA shows clear, resolved resonances with significant chemical shift perturbations and line broadening (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A/B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S11</xref>). The strongest chemical shift perturbations are localized to the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 subdomain that interfaces with the RNA:DNA hybrid at the PAM distal end, where previous studies of specificity-enhancing variants of <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 have identified alterations in nucleic acid binding to <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> It is not known whether specific residues at the PAM distal binding interface of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 play a similar role.

<p>To understand how the K267E and R332A mutants impact gRNA binding to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, we conducted gRNA titration experiments via NMR and observed that chemical shift perturbations were attenuated in both variants, relative to WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec. Despite this muted structural effect, the impact from gRNA-induced line broadening remains substantial in the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 subdomain. Our NMR data revealed that a three-fold greater concentration of gRNA was required to induce the maximal structural and dynamic effects in the variants than is required for WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A/C</xref>), suggesting that the variants have a reduced gRNA affinity. MST experiments showed statistically significant reductions in gRNA affinity for the K267E and R332A constructs, relative to WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, where K267E <italic>Geo</italic>Rec produced a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 7.2 ± 1.0 µM and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec produced a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 7.2 ± 1.5 µM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The ∼3-fold decrease in <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> may also be due, in part, to a change in the binding mode of the gRNA, such as a faster <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>. Collectively, these data reveal that mutations within <italic>Geo</italic>Rec primarily alter its structure around the mutation site with weaker distal effects, but more significantly impact protein dynamics and in turn, the gRNA interaction. NMR experiments also demonstrate that the presence of gRNA impacts both subdomains of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, providing a significant structural interface for additional molecular tuning of nucleic acid binding.</p>
<p>To investigate the impact of gRNA binding on <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 in greater detail, we conducted NMR titration experiments using the isolated domain, which yielded even clearer NMR spectra. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S12</xref> shows NMR spectra of WT, K267E, and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 overlaid with their corresponding gRNA-bound spectra (39nt Tnnt2 RNA). At protein:RNA molar ratios used for full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Rec studies, the WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 spectrum exhibited significant line broadening across the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 sequence. Plots of NMR peak intensities (I<sub>bound</sub>/I<sub>free</sub>) show substantial resonance intensity losses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S12</xref>), with many residues likely in the intermediate exchange regime, in addition to the assumed changes in rotational correlation of the domain. In comparison, spectra of the gRNA-bound K267E and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 variants showed less pronounced signal decay at the same levels of titrant, retaining nearly double the I<sub>bound</sub>/I<sub>free</sub> ratio across these spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S12</xref>). These data are consistent with the results of NMR experiments with the 43 kDa <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, supporting the premise that <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 mutations weaken its interaction with gRNA. The less crowded NMR spectrum of isolated <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 facilitated the resolution of distinct structural features that explain the impact of the mutations on gRNA binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S9</xref>). For example, residue I53 adopts a similar conformation in gRNA-bound WT and K267E <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 but assumes a different structural state in R332A. Conversely, residue R25 populates a WT-like structure in gRNA-bound R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, unlike K267E. Additionally, two resonances are observed for residue K71 in the gRNA-bound R332A NMR spectrum, indicating real-time equilibration between two structural states. This effect is unique to the R332A variant and underscores subtle structural and dynamic changes to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec during gRNA binding.</p>
<p>We further examined the NMR data to attempt to identify residues most critical for gRNA binding to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec. In an overlay of the WT and mutant gRNA-induced chemical shift perturbations (Δδ, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S13</xref>), it became clear that the effect of gRNA binding to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec variants was muted, where even at saturating concentrations, the chemical shift perturbations across the K267E and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 sequences were weaker than those of same residues in WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec. The residual Δδ (WT - mutant) was plotted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S13</xref>), where positive values indicate that residues in a <italic>Geo</italic>Rec variant are weakly affected by gRNA, relative to WT. Negative residual Δδ denote sites where <italic>Geo</italic>Rec variants experience a greater structural impact from gRNA than corresponding sites in WT. Of particular interest are the positive residuals that hint at the sites in <italic>Geo</italic>Rec most critical for tight gRNA binding. These residues were mapped onto the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S13</xref>) and termed allosteric hotspots, as many are not at the RNA interface. Mutations of these hotspots in future studies offers a potential means of precisely tuning the affinity of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec to gRNA. Notably, residues with positive residual Δδ (suggested as critical for tight RNA binding) largely overlap in the analysis of both variants. Specifically, residues F170, R192, H264, R269, L270, L279, H300, D301, E368, D376, D403, E405, E408, and I429 appear as allosteric hotspots (with CPMG relaxation dispersion) critical to WT-like gRNA interaction.</p>
<p>Having observed a reduced affinity of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec variants for gRNA by NMR and MST, we next quantified the impact of the K267E and R332A mutations on RNP formation and stability in full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. The thermal unfolding midpoint of full-length WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 determined by CD is ∼60 °C and the K267E and R332A mutations do not change the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of the apo protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S14</xref>). Upon formation of an RNP, the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 increases to 73°C. K267E <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 retains a similar <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> increase to 70 °C, while R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 forms a less stable RNP with <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 61 °C. The trend of these data is consistent with NMR and MST, which highlight that although K267E and R332A mutations within <italic>Geo</italic>Rec have somewhat muted structural effects, these changes alter protein dynamics and the interaction with gRNA.</p>

<title>Mutations in full-length GeoCas9 alter its structural dynamics and interaction with gRNA</title>
<p>To further investigate the effects of mutations on protein dynamics, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on the cryo-EM structure of full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (PDB: 8UZA) in complex with gRNA and target DNA. We simulated the full-length WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and its K267E and R332A mutants as well as a double mutant combining K267E and R332A (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), in three replicates of approximately 2 μs each. Multi-microsecond simulations revealed substantial changes in the dynamics of the GeoCas9 mutants compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S15</xref>). Specifically, we observed that mutations in the REC domain significantly altered the dynamics of both the Rec and the adjacent HNH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S15</xref>). Differential root-mean-square fluctuations (ΔRMSF) analysis of protein residues between the WT and variants further highlighted these alterations, showing increased dynamics in the HNH and Rec domains induced by the mutations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). To quantify the impact of these mutations, we analyzed protein-RNA interactions by calculating the number of contacts between <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and gRNA in the WT and mutant systems. A contact was defined as a distance between two atoms of ≤ 4.5 Å. The number of contacts was significantly reduced in all variants compared to the WT, with the most pronounced reduction observed in the K267E variant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). We next quantified gRNA-Rec domain binding by calculating the binding free energy using the MM-GBSA method over ∼200 ns of stable simulation trajectories (details in Materials and Methods). Consistent with a reduction in gRNA contacts, variants with the K267E mutation exhibited a substantial reduction in binding free energy (&gt;60 kcal mol<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>) relative to the WT, whereas the R332A variant displayed a smaller reduction (&lt;20 kcal mol<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).

<p>Additionally, we simulated a novel variant, i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (PDB: 8UZB), containing mutations in the Rec1 and WED domains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, mutations highlighted in lime green). This variant was recently demonstrated to have enhanced specificity in genome-editing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> Intriguingly, i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 exhibited increased dynamics in the HNH and Rec domains, along with a reduction in gRNA binding free energy similar to the K267E and R332A mutants. These results suggest a distinct allosteric pathway involving additional residues that enables i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 to maintain improved DNA cleavage activity despite reduced gRNA binding affinity. In fact, i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 samples the greatest conformational space of any variant tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S15</xref>), suggesting a high level of flexibility is critical to enhanced specificity in <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. Collectively, our simulations reveal that mutations K267E and R332A destabilize the <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 interaction with gRNA, consistent with NMR observations. Furthermore, the enhanced dynamics and altered binding affinities observed in i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 indicate potential allosteric mechanisms that optimize its genome-editing functionality, where K267E and R332A evoke a similar, but lesser degree of biophysical change.</p>

<title>DNA cleavage assays suggest the highly stable GeoCas9 is resistant to functional changes by K267E or R332A mutations</title>
<p>The dynamic impact of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec mutations and their altered gRNA interactions at the biophysical level led us to speculate that either mutation incorporated into full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 would also alter its DNA cleavage function, especially at elevated temperatures where WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 is most active. Temperature-dependent functional alterations were previously observed for single-point mutations within <italic>Geo</italic>HNH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Although the K267E and R332A mutations slightly diminished on-target DNA cleavage by <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, the effect was very subtle and these overall cleavage activities followed the temperature dependence of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 quite closely (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S16</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess the impact of the K267E and R332A mutations on <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 specificity, we assayed the propensity for off-target cleavage using DNA substrates with mismatches 5-6 or 19-20 base pairs from the PAM site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S17, Table S2</xref>). As a control for on- and off-target activity, we assayed WT <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 alongside the widely used high-specificity HiFi-<italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S17, Table S3</xref>) and found a lower percent of digested off-target (mismatched) DNA sequences when compared to WT <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9. As expected, WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 was increasingly sensitive to mismatched target sequences closer to the seed site, which has been demonstrated with <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 and other Cas systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> No significant differences in activity were observed with digestion durations ranging from 1-60 minutes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> implying that a 1-minute digestion is sufficient for <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 with the target DNA template. While these findings generally align with prior investigations of off-target DNA cleavage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> there are nuanced differences. Specifically, a previous study reported ∼10% cleavage of off-target DNA with a mismatch 5-6 base pairs from the PAM by WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Our results showed nearly 50% cleavage for the same off-target mismatch, but still a significant decrease in cleavage from on-target or 19-20 base pair distal mismatches. This could be due to the relatively high RNP concentrations (600-900 nM) in our assay (for clear visibility on the gel), compared to prior studies with RNP concentrations σ; 500 nM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Our results corresponded closely to those of prior studies with a 19-20 base pair mismatch, where off-target cleavage is tolerated by WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Single-point mutants K267E and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 have negligible impact on <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 specificity (both variants follow the trend of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S17</xref>), which contrasts prior work with <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 that demonstrated robust specificity enhancement with single-point mutations in Rec.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Additionally, a <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 double mutant K267E/R332A exhibits decreased on-target cleavage efficiency, which has been noted in high-specificity Cas systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> However, the additive effect of the K267E/R332A double mutant still does not enhance <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 specificity in our assay. MST-derived binding affinities using full-length Tnnt2 gRNA and full-length WT, K267E, or R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 indicate that all three proteins have similar affinities for the gRNA used in the functional assays (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, mutations do not substantially alter full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 binding to Tnnt2 gRNA, supporting similar cleavage activities for these proteins. We repeated the MST experiments using a different gRNA sequence derived from the new cryo-EM structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (PDB:8UZA), which has a different spacer sequence. We observed a similar trend, as all <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 variants exhibited comparable affinities for this gRNA. Our functional studies illustrate an apparent resilience of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 to major functional changes at the level of Rec, despite comparable mutations having profound functional impacts in mesophilic Cas9s.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful tool for targeted genome editing with high efficiency and modular specificity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Allosteric signals propagate DNA binding information to the HNH and RuvC nuclease domains, facilitating their concerted cleavage of double-stranded DNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> The intrinsic flexibility of the nucleic acid recognition lobe plays a critical role in this information transfer, exerting a measure of conformational control over catalysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> This study provides new insights into the structural, dynamic, and functional role of the thermophilic <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 recognition lobe. Novel constructs of subdomains <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, as well as intact <italic>Geo</italic>Rec show a high structural similarity to the domains in full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, facilitating solution NMR experiments that captured the intrinsic allosteric motions across <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2. These studies revealed the existence of μs-ms timescale motions that are classically associated with allosteric signaling and enzyme function, which span the entire <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 domain to its interfaces with <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 and the adjacent <italic>Geo</italic>HNH domain.</p>
<p>Based on homology to specificity-enhancing variants of the better studied <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9, the biophysical and biochemical consequences of two mutations were tested in <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, the larger <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe, and full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. We speculated that removing positively charged residues with potential to interact with negatively charged nucleic acids could disrupt <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9-gRNA complex formation, stability, and subsequent function by altering the protein or nucleic acid motions. Indeed, CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments revealed that mutations enhanced and reorganized the μs-ms flexibility of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2. Further, NMR titrations showed the affinity of K267E and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec for gRNA to be weaker than that of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, consistent with MST-derived <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values using the isolated domain. The mutations also diminished the stability of the full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 RNP complex.</p>
<p>The collective changes to protein dynamics, gRNA binding, and RNP thermostability suggested that mutations could modulate <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 function, as observed in similar studies of <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 reporting that gRNA dynamics, affecting the potential for the RNA:DNA hybrid to dissociate, have affected function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> Yet, the functional impact of single-point and double mutations in this work were negligible, despite homologous K-to-E and R-to-A single point mutations enhancing specificity of the mesophilic <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9. The biophysical impact of mutations within <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec may be tempered by its evolutionary resilience and the highly stable neighboring domains in the context of full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, reflected in an unchanged affinity for target DNA once the RNP was formed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> Thus, a greater number of additive (or synergistic) mutations within <italic>Geo</italic>Rec would be required to fine-tune activity or specificity to a large degree.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the effects of these and other <italic>Geo</italic>Rec mutations may vary <italic>in vivo</italic> or with alternative target cleavage sites and cell types. Such studies will be the subject of future work, as will biochemical assays of homologous mutations across diverse Cas9s, which have contributed to the wide use of CRISPR technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> We also note that despite the homology between <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 and <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 and the latter’s role in evo- and HiFi-<italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 variants that inspired the K267E and R332A mutations, the maximally enhanced <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 variants contain four mutations each. Presumably each individual substitution plays a small role modulating specificity. However, there is no consistent pattern that discerns whether multiple mutations will have additive or synergistic impacts on Cas9 function. NMR and MD studies of high-specificity <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 variants (HF-1, Hypa, and Evo, each with distinct mutations in the <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 domain) reveal universal structural and dynamic variations in regions of <italic>Sp</italic>Rec3 that interface with the RNA;DNA hybrid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> Notably, a recently published variant, i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> demonstrated enhanced genome-editing capabilities in HEK293T cells with eight mutations, though none in the Rec2 subdomain. This study highlighted the functional adaptability of i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 under low magnesium conditions, a trait beneficial in mammalian cells, distinguishing it from WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. These very recently published data, as well as the findings reported here still advance our molecular understanding of the functional handles in <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, relevant to the design of new enhanced variants.</p>
<p>This study marks the first phase of mapping allosteric motions and pathways of information flow in the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe with solution NMR experiments. Such information transfer is critical to the crosstalk between Rec and HNH in several Cas9s. Despite NMR advancements in perdeuteration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and sparse isotopic labeling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> per-residue dynamics underlying allosteric signaling in large multi-domain proteins such as <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (∼126 kDa) have remained challenging to characterize. Novel cryo-EM structures of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> will facilitate the merging of future NMR and MD simulation studies to report on RNP dynamics and atomic level networks of communication. The identification of additional (or synergistic) allosteric hotspots within <italic>Geo</italic>Rec using an integrated workflow will help to further resolve the balance between structural flexibility and the unusually high stability of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, leading to new insight into targeted manipulation of RNA affinity and enhanced variants.</p>
<p>Here, we set out to biophysically characterize the Rec lobe of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 to obtain new understanding of its function (in the context of well-studied mesophilic Cas9s). Using an AlphaFold2 model, and later a cryo-EM structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, we introduced mutations based on proximal gRNA interactions and homology to specificity-enhancing sites in <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9. However, the mutations did not affect <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 function as expected, highlighting the complicated interplay between the biophysics of mesophilic and thermophilic Cas enzymes and the difficulty of applying universal functional predictions to Cas9. The very recent report of the i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 variant further reinforces this point.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> While high-specificity <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 variants are heavily mutated in Rec3 (analogous to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2), i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 lacks mutations in Rec2 entirely, raising new questions about the functional role of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec. MD simulations of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, and the Rec variants revealed that while K267E and R332A induce dynamic effects on a similar trajectory to i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, a true high-specificity variant samples a very wide conformational space with displacements of both Rec and HNH (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S15</xref>). Through further study of the fundamental mechanism of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, it remains possible that engineering of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec may produce high-specificity variants.</p>

<title>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations</title>
<p>Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were based on the cryo-EM structure of full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (PDB: 8UZA, resolution 3.17 Å) in complex with gRNA and target DNA with two mutations in <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (at residues 8 and 582). Four systems were considered for the MD studies: WT, K267E, R332A, K267E/R332A and i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. We generated the WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 by back-mutating A8D and A582H from the cryo-EM structure (PDB: 8UZA), followed by introducing the mutations K267E, R332A, or a double mutation (with both K267E and R332A) for the variant systems. Subsequently, we performed MD simulation of i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (PDB: 8UZB, resolution 2.63 Å) consisting of 10 mutations (D8A, E149G, T182I, N206D, P466Q, H582A, Q817R, E843K, E854G, K908R). All systems were solvated with explicit water in a periodic box of ∼ 134 Å x ∼ 154 Å x ∼ 151 Å resulting in ∼ 276,000 atoms. Counter ions were added to neutralize the systems. MD simulations were performed using a protocol tailored for protein-nucleic acid complexes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> previously applied in studies of CRISPR-Cas systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> All the simulations were performed by using Amber ff19SB force field for protein,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> ff99bsc1 corrections and χOL3 corrections for DNA and RNA, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> Water molecules were described by TIP3P model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> All bonds involving hydrogens were constrained using the LINCS algorithm. A particle mesh Ewald method (PME) with a 10 Å cutoff was used to calculate electrostatics. Energy minimization was performed to relax the water molecules and counterions, keeping the protein-nucleic acid complex fixed with harmonic potential restraints of 100 kcal/mol Å<sup>2</sup>. Equilibration was performed by gradually increasing the temperature from 0 to 100 K and then to 200 K in canonical NVT ensemble and isothermal-isobaric NPT ensemble. A final temperature of 300 K was maintained via Langevin dynamics with a collision frequency γ = 1/ps and a reference pressure of 1 atm was achieved through Berendsen barostat. Production runs were carried out in NVT ensemble for 2 µs for each system in three replicates, resulting in 6 µs per system (totaling 30 µs for all systems). The equations of motion were integrated with the leapfrog Verlet algorithm with a time step of 2 fs. All simulations were conducted using the GPU-empowered version of AMBER 22.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> Analysis was performed on the aggregate ensemble (i.e., ∼6 μs per system).</p>
<p>To characterize the protein-nucleic acid interactions in all the systems under investigation, we performed contact analysis. A contact was considered to form between two atoms within a cutoff distance of ≤4.5 Å. The binding free energy of gRNA and DNA with <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 was calculated using the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> This approach was used to compare the Rec-gRNA binding affinity of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 with its mutants. For each system, the binding energies were calculated over the ∼200 ns ensemble of the stable trajectories at an interval of ∼20 ns.</p>

<title>DNA cleavage assays</title>
<p><italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 gRNA templates containing 21-nt spacers targeting the mouse <italic>Tnnt2</italic> gene locus were introduced into EcoRI and BamHI sites in pUC57 (Genscript). The plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (New England BioLabs) and subsequent restriction digest of the plasmid DNA was carried out using the BamHI restriction enzyme (New England BioLabs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Linearized plasmid DNA was immediately purified using the DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA transcription was performed <italic>in vitro</italic> with the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England BioLabs). DNA substrates containing the target cleavage site (479 base pairs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S13</xref>) were produced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using mouse genomic DNA as a template and primer pairs 5’CAAAGAGCTCCTCGTCCAGT3’ and 5’ ATGGACTCCAGGACCCAAGA3’ followed by a column purification using the NucleoSpinⓇ Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit (Macherey-Nagel). For the <italic>in vitro</italic> activity assay, RNP formation was achieved by incubating 3 µM <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (WT, K267E, R332A, or K267E/R332A mutant) and 3 µM gRNA at either 37 °C, 60 °C, 75 °C, or 85 °C for 30 minutes in a reaction buffer of 20 mM Tris, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, and 5% glycerol at pH 7.5. The 10 µL cleavage reactions were set up by mixing RNP at varying concentrations with 149 nanograms of PCR products on ice followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 minutes. The reaction was quenched with 1 µL of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) and subsequent incubation at 56 °C for 10 minutes. 6x DNA loading buffer was added to each reaction and 10 µL of reaction mixture per lane was loaded onto an agarose gel. DNA band intensity measurements were carried out with ImageJ.</p>
<p>For <italic>in vitro</italic> off-target activity assays, RNP formation was achieved by incubating 10 µM <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (WT, K267E, R332A, or K267E/R332A mutant) and 10 µM gRNA at 37 °C for 30 minutes in the reaction buffer described above. The 10 µL cleavage reactions were set up by mixing 1 µM RNP with 150 nanograms of PCR products (off-target DNA sequences listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S2</xref>) on ice followed by incubation at 37 °C for varying time points. The reaction was quenched with 1 µL of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) and subsequent incubation at 56 °C for 10 minutes. 6x DNA loading buffer was added to each reaction and 10 µL of reaction mixture per lane was loaded onto an agarose gel. DNA band intensity measurements were carried out with ImageJ. WT and HiFi <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 control proteins were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, cat. No. 108158 and No. 108160, respectively), as was the associated <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 gRNA, Alt-R™ CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA, with an RNA spacer sequence complementing 5’-TGGACAGAGCCTTCTTCTTC-3’. The on-target and off-target DNA sequences used for the <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage assay can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S3</xref>.</p>

<p>This study offers <bold>valuable</bold> insights into the conformational dynamics of the nucleic acid recognition lobe of GeoCas9, a thermophilic Cas9 from Geobacillus stearothermophilus.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study from Belato, Knight and co-workers, the authors investigated the Rec domain of a thermophilic Cas9 from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (GeoCas9). The authors investigated three constructs, two individual subdomains of Rec (Rec1 and Rec2) and the full Rec domain. This domain is involved in binding to the guide RNA of Cas9, as well as the RNA-DNA duplex that is formed upon target binding. The authors performed RNA binding and relaxation experiments using NMR for the wild-type domain as well as two-point mutants. They observed differences in RNA binding activities as well as the flexibility of the domain. The authors also performed molecular dynamics and functional experiments on full-length GeoCas9 to determine whether these biophysical differences affect the RNA binding or cleavage activity. Although the authors observed some changes in the thermal stability of the mutant GeoCas9-gRNA complex, they did not observe substantial differences in the guide RNA binding or cleavage activities of the mutant GeoCas9 variants.</p>
<p>Overall, this manuscript provides a detailed biophysical analysis of the GeoCas9 Rec domain. The NMR assignments for this construct should prove very useful, and can serve as the basis for future similar studies of GeoCas9 Rec domain mutants. While the two mutants tested in the study did not produce significant differences from wild-type GeoCas9, the study rules out the possibility that analogous mutations can be translated between type II-A and II-C Cas9 orthologs. Together, these findings may provide the grounds for future engineering of higher fidelity variants of GeoCas9</p>

<p>The manuscript from Belato et al., used advanced NMR approaches and a mutagenesis campaign probe the conformational dynamics of the recognition lobe (Rec) of the CRISPR Cas9 enzyme from G. stearothermophilus (GeoCas9). Using truncated and full-length constructs they assess the impacts of two different point mutations have on the redistribution and timescale of these motions and assess gRNA recognition and specificity. Single point mutations in the Rec domain in a Cas9 from a related species had profound impacts on- and off-target DNA editing, therefore the authors reasoned analogous mutations in GeoCas9 would have similar effects. However, despite a redistribution of local motions and changes in global stability, their chosen mutations had little impact on DNA editing in the context of the full-length enzyme.</p>
<p>In their revised manuscript, the authors were highly responsive to the reviewer's comments incorporating new experimental results including molecular dynamics simulations and RNA binding data using full-length GeoCas9, as well as reframing their discussion and conclusions in consideration of the new data. They were receptive to suggestions for clarification in both the text and methods section. With these changes, the manuscript has been significantly improved.</p>
<p>Their studies highlight the species-specific complexity of interdomain communication and allosteric mechanisms used by these multi-domain endonucleases. The noted strengths of the article remain, and despite the negative results, their approach will garner interest from investigators interested in understanding how the activity and specificity of these enzymes can be engineered to tune activity and limit off-target cleavage by these enzymes. Generally, the manuscript highlights the challenges of studying the effect of allosteric networks on protein function, particularly in multidomain proteins, and thus will be of broad interest to the community.</p>

<p>The authors explore the role of Rec domains in a thermophilic Cas9 enzyme. They report on the crystal structure of part of the recognition lobe, its dynamics from NMR spin relaxation and relaxation-dispersion data, its interaction mode with guide RNA, and the effect of two single-point mutations hypothesised to enhance specificity. They find that mutations have small effects on Rec domain structure and stability but lead to significant rearrangement of micro- to milli-second dynamics which does not translate into major changes in guide RNA affinity or DNA cleavage specificity, illustrating the inherent tolerance of GeoCas9. The work can be considered as a first step towards understanding motions in GeoCas9 recognition lobe, although no clear hotspots were discovered with potential for future rational design of enhanced Cas9 variants.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Detailed biophysical and structural investigation, despite a few technical limitations inherent with working with complex targets, provides converging evidence that molecular dynamics embedded in the recognition lobes allow GeoCas9 to operate on a broad range of substrates.</p>
<p>
- Since the authors and others have shown that substrate specificity is dictated by equivalent hotspot mutations in other Cas9 variants, we are one step closer to understanding this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Since the mutations investigated here do not significantly affect substrate binding or enzymatic activity, it is difficult to rationalize anything for enzyme engineering at this point.</p>
<p>
- Further investigation of the determinants of the observed dynamic modes, and follow-up with rationally designed mutations would hopefully allow to create a real model of the mechanism, but I do understand that this goes beyond the scope of this study.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study from Belato, Knight, and co-workers, the authors investigated the Rec domain of a thermophilic Cas9 from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9). The authors investigated three constructs, two individual subdomains of Rec (Rec1 and Rec2) and the full Rec domain. This domain is involved in binding to the guide RNA of Cas9, as well as the RNA-DNA duplex that is formed upon target binding. The authors performed RNA binding and relaxation experiments using NMR for the wild-type domain as well as two-point mutants. They observed differences in RNA binding activities as well as the flexibility of the domain. The authors also performed experiments on fulllength <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 to determine whether these biophysical differences affect the RNA binding or cleavage activity. Although the authors observed some changes in the thermal stability of the mutant <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9-gRNA complex, they did not observe substantial differences in the cleavage activities of the mutant <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 variants.</p>
<p>Overall, this manuscript provides a detailed biophysical analysis of the <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 Rec domain. The NMR assignments for this construct should prove very useful, and the results may provide the grounds for future engineering of higher fidelity variants of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. While the NMR results are generally well presented, it is unclear how the results on the isolated Rec domain related to the overall function of full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. In addition, some conclusions are overstated and not fully supported by the evidence provided. The following major points should be addressed by the authors.</p>
<p>(1) Many of the results rely on the backbone resonance assignments of the three constructs that were used, and the authors have done an excellent job of assigning the Rec1 and Rec2 constructs. However, it is unclear from the descriptions in the text how the full-length Rec construct was assigned. Were these assignments made based on assignments for the individual domains? The authors state that the spectra of individual domains and RecFL overlay very well, but there appear to be many resonances that have chemical shift differences or are only present in one construct. As it stands, it is unclear how the resonances were assigned for residues whose chemical shifts were perturbed, making it difficult to interpret many of the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer raises an important oversight. In Lines 491-493, we clarify that we were able to transfer the assignments using spectral overlays of the individual domains with <italic>Geo</italic>Rec (i.e. careful analysis of the data in Figure S3). We also cite two new references where a similar approach was applied to Cas9.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The minimal gRNA that was used for the Rec-gRNA binding experiments is unlikely to be a good mimic for the full-length gRNA, as it lacks any of the secondary structure that is most specifically recognized by the REC lobe and the rest of the Cas9 protein. The majority of this RNA is a &quot;spacer&quot; sequence, but spacers are variable, so this sequence is arbitrary. Thus, the interactions that the authors are observing most likely represent non-specific interactions between the Rec domains and RNA. The authors also map chemical shift perturbations and line broadening on structural models with an RNA-DNA duplex bound, but this is not an accurate model for how the Rec domain binds to a single-stranded RNA (for which there is no structural model). Thus, many of the conclusions regarding the RNA binding interface are overstated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer again raises an important point. We have added a section of text explaining the rationale for truncating the gRNA for binding experiments with NMR (Lines 223-235). We chose the 5’end of the gRNA containing the spacer sequence based on crystal structures of <italic>Nme</italic>Cas9 and <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 that show the Rec lobe interacting with this section of nucleic acid. The newly published <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 cryo-EM structure bound to gRNA, which overlaid well with the <italic>Nme</italic>Cas9 structure, also suggested that this portion of the gRNA could interact with Rec.</p>
<p>Figures S11 and S12 show our gradual truncation of the gRNA and Rec construct to achieve useful atomic detail. Ultimately, a 39nt gRNA containing a 23 base pair spacer sequence was chosen for this study to retain the NMR signal of the complex and because several structures suggested this 39nt sequence would be long enough to interact with the entire Rec lobe.</p>
<p>To investigate the effect of the spacer sequence, we have now measured binding affinities via MST between <italic>Geo</italic>Rec and a 39nt Tnnt2 gRNA and a 39nt gRNA from PDB: 8UZA, containing a different spacer sequence used in the very recent <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 cryo-EM structure. The observed trends for each gRNA are consistent across the samples. We also measured WT, K267E, and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 affinity for the full-length Tnnt2 and PDB:8UZA gRNAs.</p>
<p>Lastly, we used a new cryo-EM structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 bound to gRNA (PDB: 8JTR) to better define the interface for NMR CSPs and line broadening and have adjusted the language in this section.</p>

<p>(3) The authors include microscale thermophoresis (MST) data for the Rec constructs binding to the minimal gRNA. These data suggest that all three Rec variants have very similar Kd's for the RNA. Given these similarities, it is unclear why the RNA titration experiments by NMR yielded such different results. Moreover, in the Discussion, the authors state that the NMR titration data are consistent with the MST-derived Kd values. This conclusion appears to be overstated given the very small differences in affinities measured by MST.</p>

<p>MST and NMR experiments describing the weakened binding affinity of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 for the Tnnt2 gRNA agree with each other (Figure 5). However, additional MST experiments with a different gRNA sequence (from PDB: 8UZA) and with fulllength <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (new Figure 7) have provided new insight for us to soften and reframe the Discussion to avoid overstatement.

<p>(4) While the authors have performed some experiments to help place their findings on the isolated Rec domain in the context of the full-length protein, these experiments do not fully support the conclusions that the authors draw about the meaning of their NMR results. The two Cas9 variants that were explored via NMR have no effect on Cas9 cleavage activity, and it is unclear from the data provided whether they have any effect on <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 binding to the full sgRNA. This makes it difficult to determine whether the observed differences in RNA binding and dynamics of the isolated Rec domain have any consequence in the context of the full protein.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have since measured the binding affinities of full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 to full-length gRNA. (new Figure 7) We have also added a comment in the Discussion section describing how both <italic>Geo</italic>Rec and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 domain variants bind the truncated RNA with weaker affinity than the WT, but this biophysical effect does not translate to <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 with its full-length gRNA. We describe this finding as an explanation for why the single-point mutants have minimal effect of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 cleavage activity. See Lines 375-385.</p>

<p>(5) The authors state in multiple places that the K267E/R332A mutant enhanced <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 specificity. Improved specificity refers to a situation in which the efficiency of cleavage of a perfectly matched target improves in comparison to a mismatched target. This is not what the authors observed for the double mutant. Instead, the cleavage of the perfect target was drastically reduced, in some cases to a larger degree than for the mismatched target. The double mutant does not appear to have improved specificity, it has simply decreased cleavage efficiency of the enzyme.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The conclusion has been reframed to suggest that the K267E/R332A double mutant has decreased cleavage efficiency of the enzyme but does not enhance <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 specificity. We discuss an interesting contrast, namely that mutations in the <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9 Rec lobe alter its specificity, which is at times accompanied by a loss of overall activity. We also speculate on why this may not be the case in <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, considering some very recent (unpublished at the time of initial submission) structural and biochemical data.

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript from Belato et al. used advanced NMR approaches and a mutagenesis campaign to probe the conformational dynamics of the recognition lobe (Rec) of the CRISPR Cas9 enzyme from G. stearothermophilus (<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9). Using truncated and full-length constructs they assess the impacts of two different point mutations have on the redistribution and timescale of these motions and assess gRNA recognition and specificity. Single point mutations in the Rec domain in a Cas9 from a related species had profound impacts on- and off-target DNA editing, therefore the authors reasoned analogous mutations in <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 would have similar effects. However, despite a redistribution of local motions and changes in global stability, their chosen mutations had little impact on DNA editing in the context of the full-length enzyme. Their studies highlight the species-specific complexity of interdomain communication and allosteric mechanisms used by these multi-domain endonucleases. Despite these negative results, their study is highly rigorous, and their approach will broadly support understanding how the activity and specificity of these enzymes can be engineered to tune activity and limit off-target cleavage by these enzymes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Atomistic investigation of the conformational dynamics of the <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 gRNA recognition lobe (<italic>Geo</italic>Rec), probing dynamics on a broad range of timescales from ps to ms using advanced NMR approaches will be broadly interesting to both the structural biology and CRISPR engineering communities.</p>
<p>(2) Highly rigorous biophysical studies that push the boundaries of current techniques, provide insight into local dynamics of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec domain that serve to propagate allosteric information and potentially regulate enzymatic activity.</p>
<p>(3) The study highlights the complexities of understanding interdomain communication in Cas9 enzymes since analogous mutations in different species have different effects on target recognition and cleavage.</p>
<p>(4) The type of structural and dynamic insights derived from this study design could serve as foundational information to guide a rational design strategy aimed at improving the selectivity and reducing the off-target effects of Cas9 enzymes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Despite the rigor of the experiments, the mutations chosen by the authors do not have a profound effect on the overall substrate affinity or activity of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 rendering little mechanistic insight into allosteric communication in this particular Cas9. However, the double mutant K267E/R332A has a more pronounced effect on the cleavage of WT and mismatched (at nucleotides 19 and 20) DNA substrates while minimally affecting the cleavage of mismatched (at nucleotides 5 and 6), suggesting more could be learned about the allosteric mechanism from the detailed characterization of this mutant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment. While we have included new binding experiments with full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and gRNAs (new Figure 7), the addition of new MD simulations (new Figure 6) better address this point. MD examined our single and double mutants, as well as the recently published high-specificity i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, and reported the degree of conformational sampling and nucleic acid contacts and binding energies.</p>
<p>The simulations show that our mutations induce some, but not the full extent of the effect of i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (with one mutation in <italic>Geo</italic>Rec and many others in the adjacent WED domain), implying that further engineering of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec to mimic i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9’s properties can have profound functional outcomes. Future efforts to mutate <italic>Geo</italic>Rec will be leverage this strategy. See Lines 309-342.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Follow-up experiments with other residues that were identified as being highly dynamic might affect substrate recognition and cleavage activity in different ways providing additional insight.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer is correct. While beyond this initial scope, new MD simulations (see the response directly above) and NMR resonances distally affect by gRNA (via CSP or relaxation dispersion) will be used identify the primary targets for this analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Details regarding the authors' experimental approach are incomplete such as a description of the model used to fit the CD data, a detailed explanation of the global fitting of the relaxation dispersion data describing how the best-fit model was selected, and the description of the ModelFree fitting of fast timescale dynamics is incomplete.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing out these oversights. We have now included the fitting equation in the CD Methods section.</p>
<p>We included new Figures S8-S10 with the individual relaxation dispersion curves and note in the Methods that global fits were deemed superior based on the Akaike Information Criterion. For WT, the AIC showed the global fit to be ~10-fold better. For K267E, the global model was 4-fold better, and for R332A, the global model was 6-fold better.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors explore the role of Rec domains in a thermophilic Cas9 enzyme. They report on the crystal structure of part of the recognition lobe, its dynamics from NMR spin relaxation and relaxation-dispersion data, its interaction mode with guide RNA, and the effect of two single-point mutations hypothesised to enhance specificity. They find that mutations have small effects on Rec domain structure and stability but lead to significant rearrangement of micro- to milli-second dynamics which does not translate into major changes in guide RNA affinity or DNA cleavage specificity, illustrating the inherent tolerance of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. The work can be considered as a first step towards understanding motions in <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 recognition lobe, although no clear hotspots were discovered with potential for future rational design of enhanced Cas9 variants.</p>

<p>(1) Please update the sentences on lines 100-105 and the Methods to clarify how the RecFL assignments were obtained. If RecFL was assigned based on the assignments for Rec1 and Rec2, please describe in the Methods how the shifted resonances were handled. Please also provide chemical shift perturbation profiles for the truncated constructs versus the full-length Rec construct.</p>
<p>We have now added text (Lines 491-493) and two new references explaining the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec (full-length) assignment.</p>
<p>We appreciate this point. We have now provided a new Figure S9 with analysis of CSPs and line broadening in truncated constructs (<italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 only). See also Lines 263-282. We also show a similar structural response to mutation in full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Rec and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 NMR CSPs (Figure 2 and Figure S5).</p>
<p>We have provided the CSPs for each construct, relative to the full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Rec domain, Author response image 1. In most cases, the largest CSPs occur at resonances on the periphery of the spectra, retaining the ability to unambiguously assign it.</p>

<p>(2) It is unclear whether the differences in Kd's for the Rec-gRNA interactions are statistically significant, given the errors associated with the values. Can the authors further analyze these data to determine statistical significance? If they are not found to be significantly different, the authors should soften all conclusions related to the observed differences.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Statistical significance was calculated for all MST data and Figures 5 and 7 have been updated to reflect this</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) As mentioned above, it seems likely that the Rec-RNA binding that is observed is non-specific. Have the authors tried MST with another 39 nt RNA? Are there differences in affinities for the Rec constructs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have done MST with another 39nt RNA. The affinity for each gRNA (Tnnt2 vs 8UZA) is similar for WT and K267E, and a factor of ~4 weaker for R332A with 8UZA gRNA. The trend is the same, that WT Rec has a (statistically significant) stronger affinity for the gRNA compared to the mutants.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Have the authors tried MST with full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and the sgRNA? The current data on the thermal stability of the RNP's is interesting, but a more direct measurement of the affinity of the Cas9-sgRNA complexes would provide stronger evidence of the effects of the mutations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer makes an excellent suggestion. We have now generated Cy5-labeled full-length gRNAs and conducted MST with full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (new Figure 7). The binding affinities to multiple guides do not vary significantly. We have discussed this, and its implications, in Lines 376-385.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) One potential issue with not observing differences between the three Cas9 variants' cleavage activity is that the activity of these purified proteins appears to be very low in comparison to previous studies of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. There are significant differences in the expression protocol used by the authors of the current study and previous studies. Have the authors attempted to replicate the expression and purification protocol of previous reports? This may improve the enzymatic activity and allow for a more detailed investigation of cleavage between the three variants (e.g. by performing time-course cleavage assays).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The expression protocol of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 is identical to those of previous studies. This was a written mistake on our part, which has now been corrected in the methods section. We apologize for this oversight.</p>

<p>Recommendations for improving the writing and presentation</p>
<p>The introduction of the manuscript is reasonable for specialists who are very familiar with Cas9 function, but it does not contain important details that may be unknown to most readers. The authors do not introduce the domains of Cas9 in the Introduction section. A brief description of the domains that are important to this work should be provided. For example, what is the role of the Rec lobe? This is not introduced until lines 110-111, after some discussion of the authors' initial work on these domains. For a broad audience, it would also be helpful to define the two catalytic domains of the protein. A paragraph describing the general architecture of Cas9 and the overall mechanism of Cas9, including allostery and domain movement, would be very helpful to a general audience. There are elements of this throughout the manuscript, but it would be better to have everything described in a single location at the beginning of the Introduction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer makes an excellent point. We have added significant clarifying text to the Introduction (Lines 42-47, 52-58, and 61-66). We have also amended Figure 1 to highlight the domain arrangement of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and construct domain boundaries.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript is well-written and generally clear and concise. The following recommendations will help improve the readability and include details important for interpreting the results.</p>
<p>(1) In general, the figures are too small and difficult to interpret, it was hard to discern the differences described in the text (e.g. Figure 1A, E, 4A, etc.), the text labels are illegible in several panels (e.g. Figure 4A, S8B, C, etc.), the chosen colors were difficult to interpret in the structures (Figure 4C, S8G, H, etc.), as well as residues with motion (as balls) were difficult to make out due to size and color usage. Similar story for the dispersion curves (Fig 3A), the plots are chaotically crowded, and it is impossible to interpret (or see) the undelaying data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for these difficulties. We have now revised the Figures in several ways. First, we greatly simplified Figure 1, such that it now includes only the domain arrangement, structure, and initial NMR details for <italic>Geo</italic>Rec (essentially A-B of the old Figure 1).</p>
<p>Second, we have reformatted Figure 3 to make the structure maps a bit easier to see.</p>
<p>We certainly appreciate the point made by the Reviewer about the dispersion curves. Our intent here is to illustrate the number of curves that can be fit globally, which substantially increase for K267E and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec3, versus WT. As a compromise, we have included the individual dispersion curves in the SI for each variant. We have also thinned the line weights for each fit, and added NMR order parameters to the main figure to round out the discussion of dynamics.</p>
<p>Third, we have compiled the gRNA titration into Figure 4, removing the CD analysis (to SI), MST data (new Fig 5), and unclear structure maps to focus only on the NMR spectra here.</p>
<p>Fourth, we have created a new Figure 5 focusing on MST studies of two gRNAs with <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, which now include bar charts of affinities with appropriate statistics.</p>
<p>Much of the data trimmed from the prior version of the manuscript figures has been moved to Supporting Information. We have also created two new main text Figures (6 &amp; 7) based on MD simulations and MST studies of full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and gRNAs to provide additional context for interpreting the results in prior figures.</p>

<p>(5) There is significant line broadening that occurs during the titration, not all line broadening is due to changes in rotational correlation time, and differential line broadening may reveal interactions of residues that are in the intermediate regime, certainly, uM affinities measured by the authors, would suggest this, therefore, a plot of I/Io might inform on binding sites, and it might be useful to look at differential broadening as a function of titrant added.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer makes a very good point. In addition to the data in Figure 4, which show a clear reduction in gRNA-induced line broadening in larger <italic>Geo</italic>Rec constructs, we included new titration data on smaller <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 domains (Figure S12).

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) In Figure S6, chemical shifts are observed at the distal site away from the mutations, could the authors discuss?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer makes an important observation. Indeed, the CSPs caused by K267E and R332A extend beyond the mutation site. These shifts are mostly close in 3D space to the mutation, and consistent in Figures 2 and S5. New titrations of gRNA into isolated <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 also activate some distal sites, and new MD simulations suggests the mutations disrupt RNA and DNA contacts, where these distal effects may play a role with full-length gRNAs.</p>
<p>We agree it would be worth mutating distal sites undergoing CSPs to examine their impact on function, but two complicating factors are 1) the lack of substantial gRNA affinity differences in experiments with full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and 2) the lack of functional changes in the mutants. In this initial study, it appears difficult to assign an effect to these distal sites in <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (beyond speculation). We do have a brief discussion of the distal sites (Lines 293-298) and will follow up this work with more comprehensive mutagenesis studies of these sites.</p>

<p>(12) Details of the ModelFree fitting are needed, how many residues fit with the minimal models, and how many invoked Rex and other terms?

<p>We have included an expanded description of the Model-free protocol (Lines 521-527). The best diffusion tensor was an ellipsoid model. The number of residues utilizing Rex was 81, though Rex contribution was very small.

<p>R2/R1 ratios for each of the samples (relaxation conducted on <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 in isolation) corresponded to an estimated tc of 16.3 ns for all data sets.

<p>(17) Line 253 - the authors are discussing regions of allosteric hotspots, how do the motions of these predicted hotspots compare with the relaxation dispersion data? There seems to be some overlap.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer makes a keen observation. Yes, there is overlap in these data. For example, hotspot residue R269 is bracketed by L268 and L270 with relaxation dispersion. Also, hotspot L279 surrounded by C275, A276, R277, and D281 with dispersion in both variants. Further, D403 and E408 reside in a stretch of ms timescale flexibility comprised of N404, L406, N412, and L413. We have yet to fully understand the functional significance of this overlap, but have added a note in Line 298 to draw the reader’s attention to it.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Although the scope of the manuscript is rather limited due to the minor effects observed for the selected mutations, it is clear that a lot of work was done in spearheading the investigation of dynamic modes in <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 Rec2. In my view, the data will still be of relevance and interest to the general structural and chemical biology communities.</p>
<p>However, there are a few technical shortcomings that need to be addressed and some statements that are poorly supported by data, necessitating either more experimental proofs or rephrasing of the conclusions.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>X-ray structure - No PDB ID, structural statistics, or validation report is given for the structure, so it is impossible to judge of the quality. Please provide these. Furthermore, it would be commendable to determine the structure of the point mutant Rec2 domains, this would greatly strengthen the claim that mutations affect only dynamics and do not change structure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for this oversight. We absolutely had these data at the time of submission but must have forgotten to upload them. The validation report is now attached.</p>
<p>Regarding the mutant structures, the Reviewer’s point is well taken. In the absence of these structures, we have adjusted the language to include the possibility of structural change. We have also included new MD simulations (new Figure 6 and associated text) that provide comment on possible structural and dynamic changes due to mutation. We note that NMR spectral changes are quite modest, beyond the site of mutation. Further, the new binding data with full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (new Figure 7) shows very little change in gRNA affinity with mutations, implying that a profound structural rearrangement does not take place.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Translating isolated Rec2 findings to FL <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 - This is an important point and I do appreciate that the authors discuss this. I agree that working on FL samples for NMR would not be feasible, but I am not convinced by the statement that &quot;<italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 in isolation represents the structure of the subdomain within full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 very well&quot;. The chemical shift perturbations observed between isolated Rec2 and FL Cas9 are relatively sizable. This should be discussed in further detail. Figure 1B should showcase peaks having the highest perturbations. Are they located at termini or interaction interfaces?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have provided the combined <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N combined CSPs for each construct, relative to the full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Rec domain, Author response image 1. In most cases, the largest CSPs occur at resonances on the periphery of the spectra, retaining the ability to unambiguously assign it. The largest CSPs do appear to exist at the termini.</p>
<p>The Rec1 and Rec2 subdomains are connected by a short, but flexible unstructured linker in full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Rec. Thus, the two subdomains do not form a particularly tight non-covalent interface and behave somewhat independently (see Figure S4, for example).</p>
<p>Regarding the statement of “<italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 in isolation...,” we apologize for this confusion.</p>
<p>We were referring to our solved crystal structure in relation to the AlphaFold model. With the new cryo-EM structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 having been recently published, our X-ray structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 is still in excellent agreement, but we have clarified our intent on Line 111.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Dynamics and effect of mutations - K267E is more destabilizing and leads to more spread chemical shift perturbations throughout Rec2 and to faster-correlated dynamics but not in significantly lower affinity or cleavage. How do the authors explain this?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer raises an interesting question. Regarding the impact of the K267E mutation, new MD simulations also suggest K267E to be quite disruptive of the <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 structure and dynamics, modulating contacts with the nucleic acids. However, further MD analysis of the recently published (<italic>bona fide</italic> high specificity) i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 variant shows that K267E only imparts a portion of the effect of i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, suggesting that even further modulation of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec would be require for substantial functional impact. In addition, new MST binding studies with full-length variants and gRNAs show K267E does not dramatically alter gRNA binding, suggesting that the lack of functional impact, despite biophysical change, is suppressed by the surrounding <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 domains. We comment on this in the Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Moreover, the time regime for the fit of the CPMG curves is surprisingly slow given the profiles, how were the minor state populations? Were the dynamics really correlated? Please provide numbers (also see minor points below). In that regime CEST experiments should work, was that done?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The minor state populations were very low in the analysis, &lt;1%.</p>
<p>To examine the correlated dynamics, we compared the global fits to those of the individual fits for each residue and found them to be better for the global fit, based on the Akaike Information Criterion. For WT, the AIC showed the global fit to be ~10-fold better. For K267E, the global model was 4-fold better, and for R332A, the global model was 6-fold better. We have added language clarifying the use of AIC to the Methods section.</p>
<p>We have done CEST experiments on _Geo_HNH (we did not see overly clear evidence for a minor state), but we did not perform these experiments on <italic>Geo</italic>Rec. However, we strongly agree that a detailed follow-up study focusing on CEST and new <italic>Geo</italic>Rec variants should investigate this further.</p>
<p>Since the binding effects with gRNAs differ in the isolated domain and the full-length protein, we have tried not to over-analyze the impact of the relaxation data in this specific context. These data still provide useful information regarding the impact of point mutants on <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 domain biophysics, and MD simulations support the enhanced dynamics seen in CPMG and other relaxation data. However, the functional implication is clearly more complicated and requires further study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Mutations affect gRNA affinity - I am not convinced that affinity itself is significantly affected based on the MST data. This data could be reproduced as technical replicates to reduce the error bars, or another technique with less intrinsic noise (ITC, SPR) could be used to better support this claim. However, a 3-fold difference seen from NMR titrations could indicate a change in binding mode, for instance in koff. It would be interesting to obtain SPR or BLI data quantifying the kinetics of the interactions. Anyhow, this point should be more carefully discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer on this point. We conducted additional replicates of MST trials, as well as new MST with a different gRNA sequence. Our updated analysis, including statistics, provides a better measure for “significance” in these data, which is now reported. We have also added some text discussing a possible change in binding mode, see Lines 256-259.</p>
<p>We also carried out MST on full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 with full-length gRNAs (the same two RNAs used as truncated constructs). We report these data in new Figure 7 and note there is essentially no difference between the gRNAs or the <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 variants under these conditions.</p>
<p>Further, MD simulations suggest a change in binding energy associated with the gRNA interaction in the context of full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. Since experimental studies are not able to parse these differences, collectively, we describe a scenario where the highly stable structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 resists substantial mutation-induced change seen for analogous perturbations in <italic>Sp</italic>Cas9. See Lines 309-342, 414-418, and 448-461.</p>

<p>• Some fits of the CPMG curves look strange, e.g. R343 in Fig. 3B WT definitely does not contain significant us-ms dynamics and should be excluded from the analysis. Please double-check each profile. Were other models besides CR72 not providing better fits?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer has made a very careful observation. Our intent was to highlight these sites on purpose to show differences in CPMG relaxation dispersion between WT and variant samples. This was provided as some evidence for the redistribution of dynamics between samples, as many different sites found to be “rigid” on the ms timescale in WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 were flexible in <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 variants. We agree, however, that this Figure panel was confusing and have therefore removed it in favor of simple discussion in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• To what degree are the CPMG dynamics correlated, can you provide statistical measures for the global fits?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We compared the global fits to those of the individual fits for each residue and found them to be better for the global fit, based on the Akaike Information Criterion. For WT, the AIC showed the global fit to be ~10-fold better. For K267E, the global model was 4fold better, and for R332A, the global model was 6-fold better.</p>
<p>We have added language clarifying the use of AIC to the Methods section.</p>
