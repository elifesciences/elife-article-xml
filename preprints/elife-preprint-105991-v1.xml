<title>Abstract</title><p>Fecal virome transfer (FVT) shows promise in reducing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), likely due to donor bacteriophages preventing the gut dysbiosis preceding disease. However, concurrent transfer of eukaryotic viruses may carry a risk of infection for the recipient. To increase safety, we investigated chemostat propagation as a method to eliminate eukaryotic viruses from donor feces while maintaining a diverse and reproducible bacteriophage community. Donor feces was collected from healthy suckling piglets and inoculated into a fermenter containing growth media supplemented with lactose and milk oligosaccharides (MOs). During continuous medium exchange (20% volume/h), dilution significantly reduced eukaryotic viruses. Viral richness was concurrently reduced although still preserving a stable community of 200-250 bacteriophages. Inclusion of MOs in the medium ensured higher bacterial richness and a bacterial community closer resembling donor feces. Fecal <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> bacteria were lost during cultivation but partially replaced by members of the <italic>Bacteroidota</italic> phylum in MO-supplemented cultures, accompanied by phages predicted to have <italic>Parabacteroides</italic> as host. After cultivation, virus-like particles (VLPs) were isolated, and their ability to reduce NEC incidence tested <italic>in vivo</italic>. Preterm piglets were delivered by cesarean section and received either the lactose- or MO-propagated viromes by oral route (<italic>n</italic> = 14-15/group). These were compared with groups receiving the same dose of donor fecal virome (10<sup>10</sup> VLPs/kg) or vehicle control. The piglets were subsequently fed infant formula for 96 hours followed by euthanasia and tissue sampling. Both chemostat-propagated viromes effectively mitigated diarrhea compared to the donor virome. The donor virome partially engrafted in recipients and led to higher levels of <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> bacteria and <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> targeting phages. However, these signatures were lost in recipients of chemostat-propagated viromes, and only minor microbiome effects and no NEC prevention were observed. To conclude, we provide <italic>in vivo</italic> proof-of-concept for chemostat propagation of fecal viruses as a means to deplete eukaryotic viruses and in turn reduce side effects in newborn virome recipients. However, chemostat culture conditions need further optimization to preserve the donor phageome.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Immediately after birth, microorganisms colonize the gastrointestinal tract, thereby establishing the gut microbiome (GM). Non-digestible milk oligosaccharides (MOs) present in breast milk strongly influence GM assembly by acting as highly specific microbial substrates to promote the growth of bifidobacteria and <italic>Bacteroides</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Preterm birth (&lt; 37 weeks of gestation) is often accompanied by GM perturbations due to factors such as cesarean section, early antibiotic use, immature gastrointestinal tract, and partial formula feeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. These disturbances inhibit beneficial anaerobes like bifidobacteria and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> whereby facultative pathobionts like <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> members may take over and initiate disease processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. This can ultimately lead to the severe intestinal disorder necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), characterized by inflammation and necrosis of intestinal tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. With global mortality rates ranging from 20-50%, NEC is considered a critical medical and surgical emergency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in studying the gut virome alongside gut bacteria, particularly in the context of severe inflammatory gut disorders like NEC and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Specifically, bacteriophages (phages for short) are abundant gut viruses that function to modulate bacterial growth through host-specific lysis or lysogeny<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. This dynamic interaction and additional preference for intestinal mucosal sites enable phages to alter bacterial compositions and protect the host from bacterial invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Several studies have associated virome alterations with IBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and recently, the link was discovered in a small cohort of NEC patients as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Thus, the virome may be a novel target for modulating the early life GM and preventing intestinal inflammation in neonates.</p>
<p>Fecal virome transfer (FVT) shows potential for restoring gut health by introducing viruses from donor feces to patients of gut dysbiosis. A recent preclinical study demonstrates that FVT can modify the gut virome of preterm piglets, reducing mucosa-associated <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> levels and providing significant protection against NEC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. However, during FVT, fecal eukaryotic viruses are transferred alongside phages, introducing a risk of infections. While screening programs exclude fecal donors with known viral pathogens, many eukaryotic viruses in the gut have unknown functions that could affect neonatal health, potentially leading to both immediate and long-term consequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. A follow-up study using the piglet model found that, while a prescreened FVT indeed offered protection against NEC, it was also linked to adverse events, namely an earlier onset of diarrhea, which also led to significant weight loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Fecal phages and eukaryotic viruses are highly similar in size and structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. As a result, phages will be damaged if traditional methods for eliminating eukaryotic viruses, such as chemicals or irradiation, are applied to FVT preparations. However, both types of viruses rely on host cells for propagation but have very distinct host specificities (bacterial vs. mammalian cells). This distinction can be leveraged in a <italic>chemostat</italic>: a bioreactor system designed to cultivate microorganisms in a controlled environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Here, a continuous fecal culture is maintained by continually adding fresh medium, providing nutrients for bacterial growth, and thus continuously generating hosts for phage propagation. Concurrently, equivalent volumes of spent media containing microorganisms and metabolic by-products are removed, leading to a gradual dilution of eukaryotic viruses, whose host cells are unable to propagate in the chemostat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Thus, the method has the potential to create a steady-state fecal culture from which the phage communities can be extracted and used for FVT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Insights from traditional fecal microbiota transplantations (FMT) for IBD in humans or experimental NEC suggest that treatment efficacy can vary depending on the donor, a phenomenon that likely applies to FVT as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. In the previous NEC studies, feces from suckling term-born pigs were used as FVT donor material to best match the preterm piglet recipients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Although this donor-recipient matching approach seems promising, the use of young donors limits the amount of fecal matter available for donation. The chemostat method overcomes these limitations by generating a mass-reproducible fecal phage community, potentially providing both a safer and donor-independent FVT strategy.</p>
<p>To propagate bacteria and phages from young donors, the medium composition should replicate the nutrients reaching the gut during nursing. Thus, we tested if adding medium MOs would increase the microbial similarity between the donor feces and chemostat culture. Subsequently, native fecal virome transfer (FVT) was compared with the chemostat virome transfer propagated without MOs (CVT) and with MOs (CVT-MO) in the preterm piglet model. We hypothesized that chemostat-propagated viromes could modulate the GM and reduce NEC lesions while avoiding potential side effects, such as earlier onset of diarrhea.</p>

<title>Donor feces collection</title>
<p>Gut content was collected from four 10-day-old healthy-appearing piglets from four different conventional farms. After euthanasia, the cecum, colon, and rectum were isolated, and the content was emptied and processed under anaerobic conditions. After diluting 1:1 in 2 × SM buffer (400 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgSO4, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 20% sterile glycerol, the content from each pig was homogenized, divided into smaller fecal aliquots, and stored at −70°C.</p>

<p>A rich tryptone and yeast extract based medium supplemented with mineral salts and vitamins was prepared as described by Pham et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> with the following modifications: lactalbumin concentration 6 g/L and 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer were used. Additionally, carbohydrate content varied as follows: In one setup, a mixture of MOs was added (7 g/L, LAC-MO medium) along with the original content of lactose (6.4 g/L) and mucin (4 g/L porcine gastric type II mucin, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). The total MO level was adjusted to quantities reported in mature porcine milk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. This consisted of 3.5 g/L 3’-sialyllactose (3’SL), 2.8 g/L lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT), and 0.7 g/L 2’-fucosyllactose (2’FL), chosen to match porcine milk levels of sialylated-, neutral-, and fucosylated MOs, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. All MOs were donated by DSM-Firmenich (Switzerland). In another setup, the MO fraction was substituted with lactose, balanced by equimolar levels of C6 monosaccharides. This resulted in 12.5 g/L lactose (LAC medium) in addition to the 4 g/L mucin.</p>

<title>Cultivation system and culture conditions</title>
<p>The previously described chemostat system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> was used for cultivation of the collected pig feces. Briefly, the cultivation system consisted of an anaerobic fermenter equipped with sensors for pH, pO2, and temperature control. The culture volume (V) was kept constant (800 mL) as well as the temperature (39°C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> and pH (6.5). The pH was controlled by adding 3 M NaOH according to the setpoint. Variable speed pumps enabled a controlled inflow and outflow of medium during continuous cultivation. The collected fecal aliquots were thawed and processed under anaerobic conditions where all four donors were pooled in equal amounts and further diluted 1:1 in sterile 0.9% saline (resulting in four times diluted feces). To start the experiments, 4 mL of diluted fecal pool was inoculated into the fermenter (0.125% w/v raw feces in fermenter volume) and allowed growth for 24 hours in a fixed medium volume, which corresponds to the end of the exponential growth phase of the fecal culture (batch phase). Hereafter, continuous medium inflow/outflow was started (chemostat phase) at a feeding rate (F) of 160 mL per h, resulting in a dilution rate (D) of 0.2 h<sup>-1</sup> (D=F/V). This phase continued until 75 h, during which the chemostat volume was exchanged 10 times (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Two and four replicates were carried out with LAC and LAC-MO medium, respectively. Samples from the outflow were collected on ice three times during the batch phase and four times during the chemostat phase as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>. On-line and at-line parameters used for experiment control are depicted in Supplementary Fig. S1.</p>

<p>The composition of the gas outflow, including H₂, CO₂, H₂S, CH₄, and N₂, was evaluated using an Agilent 490 Micro GC Biogas Analyzer (Agilent 269 Technologies Ltd., USA) connected to a thermal conductivity detector. Gas flow volume was monitored regularly using a MilliGascounter (RITTER Apparatebau GMBH &amp; Co, Germany). The redox potential of both the growth medium and culture supernatant was measured with a pH/Redox meter and an InLab® Redox electrode (Mettler Toledo, USA).

<title>Milk oligosaccharides preserved the bacterial richness of a stable fecal chemostat culture</title>
<p>A mix of anaerobically collected fecal samples from four healthy suckling pigs was inoculated into batch cultures with or without an MO blend representing the major MOs in porcine milk to supplement lactose as the major carbohydrate source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Continuous exchange of medium was initiated after 24 hours of incubation and a constant target pH of 6.5 (mean 6.55 ± 0.04 at 50-75 hours for all chemostats) was maintained by base titration. To check the stability of the chemostat cultures, base titration curves were inspected (Suppl. Fig. S2). In the batch phase, lactose conversion to lactic acid resulted in a peak titration at 4-5 hours with a higher peak in the pure lactose (LAC) cultures. A later pattern of small but prolonged titration occurred only in the MO (LAC-MO) cultures, indicating a slower utilization of MOs. After initiation of continuous volume exchange, titration patterns quickly stabilized with marginally higher acid production/base consumption in the LAC cultures.</p>
<p>We assessed the bacterial composition of the cultures at seven time points throughout the experiment to assess culture dynamics (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). Whereas all cultures lost a significant proportion of bacterial richness already in the early batch phase, supplementing the growth medium with MOs preserved the richness of the culture throughout the following chemostat phase to a greater extent than pure lactose (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Taxonomically, donor feces showed &gt;50% relative abundance of bacteria from the <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> family. During the early batch phase, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> expanded rapidly, contributing to the fast lactose consumption and acid production. Hereafter, both <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> were replaced mainly by <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> spp. Importantly, in the chemostat phase a significant proportion of these were replaced by different species of the <italic>Bacteroidota</italic> phylum only in the MO cultures indicating that these taxa had a competitive advantage due to MO utilization capabilities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Consequently, in the MO-supplemented end culture we found a relative enrichment of several taxa, all of which were obligate anaerobes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>Compositional analysis using Bray-Curtis ordination revealed an abrupt change in the early batch phase, with a partial restoration towards the composition of the fecal inoculum occurring throughout the chemostat phase visualized along the second principal coordinate. Notably, MO supplementation augmented this restoration. After five volume exchanges, the bacterial composition had stabilized and did not develop further for the remainder of the experiment. However, using the current fermentation conditions including a relatively high medium exchange rate, the chemostat end culture did not fully approximate the composition of the fecal inoculum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>Metabolically, the culture dynamics throughout the experiment corroborated the bacterial compositional analysis. As such, high production of lactate, formate, ethanol, succinate, H2, and CO2 in the early batch phase indicated mixed-acid fermentation mainly by <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). As the cultures entered the chemostat phase, lactate was gradually consumed, and short-chain fatty acid levels (e.g. propionate, butyrate) increased. In the stable end cultures, butyrate levels were equally high, but importantly, propionate was a major fermentation product only in the MO cultures. Other short-chain fatty acids (e.g. valerate, isovalerate) were also increased by MOs despite lower concentrations. Taken together, the increased proportion of obligate anaerobes in the MO-supplemented chemostat cultures greatly increased the production of propionate and other short-chain fatty acids.</p>

<title>Fecal chemostat cultivation established a stable phage community devoid of eukaryotic viruses</title>
<p>When bacteria grow in a bioreactor inoculated with fecal matter, they engage in a dynamic interaction with the vast number of both virulent and temperate fecal phages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. To investigate the viral community fluctuations during fermentation, we isolated virus-like particles from the cultures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) at each sample point followed by metagenomics sequencing. Relative to the fecal inoculum, the viral richnes decreased by 50% during the batch phase and further decreased during the chemostat phase, resulting in an overall decrease to 25% of the initial level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). The dilution occuring at inoculation (1:800 w/v) may explain the initial loss, as it might reduce low-abundant viruses to levels below the sequencing depth. In the chemostat phase, most phages with non- or slow-growing bacterial hosts were likely reduced alongside the eukaryotic viral elimination. This resulted in a final conserved community of around 200-250 viruses with similar levels for pure lactose cultures and MO-supplemented cultures. The community compositions changed dramatically during fermentation until reaching a stable level from five volume exchanges and onwards with high similarity between replicates (50-75 h, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), closely resembling the bacterial dynamics although without an obvious MO effect. When examining relative abundances, the majority of viruses were either classified as <italic>Caudoviricetes</italic> (class of tailed phages), <italic>Microviridae</italic> (family of small, non-tailed phages), or unknown viruses (Suppl. Fig. S3A). When predicting bacterial hosts, the fecal inoculum mainly harbored viruses infecting unknown bacteria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Phages targeting <italic>Escherichia</italic> began to increase after 8 hours, suggesting the induction of coli-phages in response to the <italic>Escherichia</italic> expansion seen at 3 hours (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). In the chemostat phase, phages targeting <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and <italic>Parabacteroides</italic> started to emerge. These communities were best maintained during MO supplementation, where especially <italic>Parabacteroides</italic> phages reached relatively higher levels in end cultures. Interestingly, lifestyle prediction showed that the fecal inoculum mainly consisted of potential virulent phages, whereas the relative abundance of temperate phages steadily increased over time in the chemostat with no obvious effect of MO supplementation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Consequently, the transferred phages differed in terms of lifestyle between FVT and chemostat-propagated virome. DESeq2 analysis after 10 volume exchanges (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>) revealed that adding MOs generally entailed a larger upregulation of specific viral OTUs compared to lactose only (134 vs. 27 vOTUs, respectively).</p>

<p>To uncover the success of eukaryotic viral elimination, eukaryotic vOTU members were manually identified and assessed in relative abundances over time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). A total of five eukaryotic viral families were present in the fecal inoculum and batch phases. After five volume exchanges (50 h), four of these families were successfully eliminated, however, <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic> gradually increased during chemostat mode. Conflicting with our dilution hypothesis, we subsequently removed all viral contigs present in the medium and repeated the analysis. Here <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic> disappeared, suggesting that this particular virus was continuously introduced via the medium rather than propagation. Hence, viral contigs present in the medium were deducted prior to all the <italic>in vitro</italic> viral analyses presented (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Conclusively, although less diverse than the native fecal virome, both chemostat settings created stable cultures of phages with an undetectable level of known eukaryotic viruses. The pronounced level of <italic>Bacteroidota-</italic>specific phages in MO-supplemented cultures revealed substrate-driven differences in phage host-specificities, worthy of further investigation.</p>

<title>Fecal and chemostat-propagated viromes exhibit similar immunogenic potential</title>
<p>Virus-like particles (VLPs) were isolated from the feces (fecal virome transfer, FVT) and the 75-hour chemostats. CVT comprised of VLPs isolated from chemostats with lactose medium, and CVT-MO comprised of VLPs isolated from chemostats with lactose and MO medium (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Any medium residuals including MOs were removed during this procedure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Chemostats with MOs produced end cultures with similar levels of VLPs compared to propagation with lactose (1.1-1.7×10<sup>9</sup> and 1.1-1.2×10<sup>9</sup> VLPs/mL, respectively). These liquid cultures had a more than 10-fold lower VLP level than raw feces (3.7×10<sup>10</sup> VLPs/g). When preparing the intervention inocula, the dose was therefore adjusted to match similar absolute VLP levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) while carrying different levels of viral diversity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Aerobic and anaerobic cultivation showed no bacterial growth and nucleic acid extraction yielded extremely low DNA levels (0.0-0.4 ng/µl), with no amplification of 16S rRNA gene segments. Therefore, the inocula were considered bacteria-free.</p>

<p>A human monocyte cell line was employed to investigate the immunological impact of stimulation with the chemostat viromes. These responses were compared with the dose-adjusted native fecal virome (which includes eukaryotic viruses) and a dose-adjusted pure phage solution (free of eukaryotic viruses). Interestingly, chemostat viromes induced a lower expression of toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 compared to the native fecal virome (Suppl. Fig. S4). Since TLR-7 recognizes single-stranded RNA, this could reflect the reduced eukaryotic viral load in chemostat viromes. However, the significant expression mounted by the phage solution, consisting of double-stranded DNA phages, complicates the interpretation. Moreover, the typical virus-associated interferons were not markedly affected by the type of viral solution. Surprisingly, the chemostat viromes produced a higher expression of various pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, compared to the native fecal virome and with levels similar to the phage solution. This included tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF) β. Given the obvious eukaryotic viral elimination, these data suggest that this innate immune cell line cannot fully distinguish between eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses. Since fecal-derived eukaryotic viruses mainly infect intestinal cells, an <italic>in vivo</italic> stimulation may reveal a different response pattern.</p>

<title>Chemostat-propagation mitigated side effects after virome transfer into preterm piglets</title>
<p>Previous studies revealed a good NEC protective effect of FVT but with simultaneous induction of early-onset diarrhea and weight loss in recipients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Suspecting eukaryotic viruses to be the main driver, the chemostat method was applied. In <italic>Piglet Experiment 1</italic>, preterm piglets received a total dose of 10<sup>10</sup> VLPs from feces or chemostat-propagated inoculums (FVT, CVT, CVT-MO) or a control solution shortly after birth (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Three animals were euthanized early due to apnea or hindleg issues and were subsequently excluded from the experiment (1 CON, 1 FVT, and 1 CVT-MO). The remaining piglets (<italic>n</italic>=14-15/group) were followed for five days and displayed similar survival rates across groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Upon euthanasia, gastrointestinal necropsy revealed an unusually low occurrence of NEC-like lesions in the control group as well as intervened animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-D</xref>). When investigating pathology incidences, the level of stomach necrosis was reduced in FVT pigs relative to controls (Suppl. Fig. S5A). Apart from this, incidences of hyperemia, hemorrhage, pneumatosis intestinalis, and necrosis were low and comparable between groups within each intestinal segment. Similarly, the histopathological assessment and tissue cytokine levels revealed no obvious differences (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref> and Suppl. Fig. S5B). Collectively, neither the FVT nor chemostat viromes appeared different from controls regarding NEC. However, the unfortunate lack of NEC-afflicted animals in the control group makes it impossible to draw firm conclusions in terms of treatment efficacy.</p>

<p>The clinical monitoring, however, revealed clear differences in the side effect pattern throughout the study. Replicating previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, FVT animals debuted with earlier diarrhea, leading to a reduced weight gain on day four (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F-G</xref>). Both chemostat viromes were statistically similar to controls regarding diarrhea onset, suggesting the method successfully alleviated the effect of the diarrhea-inducing agent (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). By visual inspection, the diarrhea incidence of piglets receiving lactose or MO-propagated viromes appeared slightly accelerated, resulting in a decline in body weight by study termination in the CVT group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). By day five, circulating neutrophil levels were trending higher in FVT animals compared to controls (<italic>P</italic> = 0.08, Suppl. Fig. S6A). On the contrary, FVT lymphocyte levels remained lower from day three and onwards. Although speculative, this implies that FVT may induce migration of lymphocytes to the intestines as well as granulopoiesis, resulting in a subsequent increase in circulating neutrophils. This response was mitigated by chemostat propagation. Consistent with previous findings, the FVT side effects were linked to small intestinal atrophy and reduced lactase activity in the proximal small intestine (Suppl. Fig. S6B-C). Here, the lactose-propagated virome entailed atrophy while the MO-propagated virome reduced lactase activity. Additionally, the lactulose-to-mannitol ratio increased only significantly in FVT animals, suggesting increased intestinal permeability by this treatment alone (Suppl. Fig. S6D). Conclusively, the side effects associated with fecal virome transfer were significantly improved, but not fully abolished, using the <italic>in vitro</italic> propagated chemostat viromes.</p>

<title>Gut virus engraftment following fecal virome transfer is lost after chemostat propagation</title>
<p>Having demonstrated a difference in the clinical response to exogenous native and chemostat-propagated fecal viruses, we next investigated the changes to the newborn recipient gut virome using viral metagenomics sequencing. We observed a modest increase in viral richness in FVT recipients relative to those receiving lactose-propagated fecal virome (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). However, changes to viral richness did not appear related with the occurrence of NEC (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Interestingly, Bray-Curtis ordination plot clearly showed an alteration of the gut viral composition of the FVT group relative to all remaining groups, which were not different from one another (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). The binned taxonomic annotation showed mainly <italic>Caudoviricetes</italic> and a significant proportion of unannotated viruses across all groups (Suppl. Fig. S3B). In pairwise comparisons of single viral OTU relative abundances between treatment groups and control by DESeq2 analysis, we found a pattern of modest virus enrichment (32 enriched vs. 16 depleted) in the FVT group but neither of the chemostat virome groups (CVT: 9 vs. 16; CVT-MO: 17 vs. 15). All of these were annotated as unknown viruses or the class <italic>Caudoviricetes</italic>. Based on this viral enrichment analysis, we found no clear evidence of eukaryotic virus shedding to explain the clinical side effects of FVT as virus-induced. Importantly, when binning the predicted bacterial hosts, gut phages of the FVT recipients had a much greater specificity for <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> accounting for up to 50% relative abundance, whereas the remaining groups had hardly any <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> phages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Recipients of FVT had the highest relative abundance of virulent phages, which was in accordance with their inoculum consisting mostly of virulent phages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Moreover, when looking into the engraftment potential of the transferred phages, assessed as the percentage of viral OTUs shared between group inoculum and recipient gut sample, only the FVT group showed an increase, whereas recipients of both chemostat-propagated viromes had levels similar to controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). Taken together, we documented that transfer of fecal virome leads to a significant engraftment of viruses short-term and that most of these are phages with specificity for bacteria in the <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> family. Chemostat propagation of fecal viruses prior to transplantation disrupted this engraftment.</p>

<p>To investigate a potential link between gut microbes and mammalian host response further, we performed bulk RNA-Seq on mesenteric lymph nodes. We observed no major shifts in global gene expression patterns based on a principal component analysis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). Gene set enrichment analyses did however identify a list of Gene Ontology pathways almost exclusively involved in immune cell activation. Contrary to expectations, these were all enriched in both groups receiving chemostat-propagated virome relative to FVT (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F-G</xref>). As such, this finding does not support a eukaryotic viral infection by the transferred native fecal virome as an explanation for the observed side effects. However, the collected lymph nodes were draining more distal intestinal segments (near the ileocolic artery), far from the site where donor viruses were first introduced by oral gavage. Since FVT affects the small intestine (Suppl. Fig. S6B-D), sampling from more proximal regions (near the superior mesenteric artery) may have revealed different treatment responses. Additionally, sampling at the time of FVT-associated diarrhea acceleration (48 hours) might uncover group differences not apparent at euthanasia (96 hours), when all groups displayed similar diarrhea levels.</p>

<p>Transfer of fecal phages has shown promise in modulating the preterm gut microbiome and reducing NEC under experimental settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, as diarrhea occurs simultaneously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, this highlights a need for further refinements to increase the level of safety while maintaining efficacy. Expanding on previous research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, we investigated whether the elimination of eukaryotic viruses during chemostat processing could reduce potential side effects of fecal virome transfers for preterm neonates while preserving a phage composition capable of correcting GM dysbiosis and preventing NEC.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Choice of parameters for chemostat propagation</title>
<p>We have previously demonstrated the anaerobic chemostat setup as a method to cultivate stable fecal bacterial and viral communities from adult human and murine donors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. To adapt this for cultivating colon and cecal content from 10-day-old suckling piglets, several adjustments were required. First and foremost, the growth medium substrates were adjusted to closely resemble a chemostat setup mimicking the proximal colon of breastfed neonates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, which contained lactose as the main carbohydrate source along with gastric mucin. However, since most lactose is absorbed before reaching the colon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, we considered it important to investigate the effect of MOs as an additional substrate for cultivation of a milk-shaped fecal microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Despite being less diverse than human milk, porcine milk contains 30-50 different MOs, several of which are also found in human milk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. For simplicity, we selected three key MOs found in both species (2’FL, 3’SL, and LNnT) and known to be degradable by piglet fecal bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Opposite to infants, young pigs harbor very few bifidobacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Therefore, the gradual emergence of fecal <italic>Bacteroidota</italic> species during chemostat effectively demonstrated the MO-utilizing potential of these gut bacteria inhabiting healthy suckling piglets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. MOs allowed the cultivation of around 150 additional bacterial species and increased the bacterial similarity to better resemble the donor. Optimizing the MO composition may promote the dominance of more favorable MO-degrading <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp. over <italic>B. pyogenes</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Together, this provides a strong proof-of-concept for using MOs to culture neonatal fecal bacteria <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>Despite the restorative effect of MO supplementation, the bacterial composition of the end culture was fundamentally different from the donor feces, which was primarily due to losing virtually all lactobacilli. As lactobacilli are fast-growing bacteria that primarily utilize lactose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, which was present in ample amounts in both chemostats (especially LAC), the growth inferiority is unlikely due to substrate limitations. Instead, it may be due to suboptimal pH levels. Studies report varying colonic pH levels in suckling pigs ranging from 6.3 to 7.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> and thus an intermediate level of 6.5 was chosen for the experiment. The study by Pham <italic>et al</italic>. investigated pH levels ranging from 5 to 7 and found infant lactobacilli showed optimal growth at pH 5, whereas <italic>Bacteroides</italic> preferred pH 6-7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Alongside the current findings, this suggests that lower pH levels are needed to support the growth of both <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> (and bifidobacteria) in future neonatal chemostats.</p>
<p>Chemostat culturing of neonatal feces using the presented parameters resulted in a significant loss in viral richness, which was not remedied by the addition of MO. Our previous study using adult fecal material indicated higher phage preservation at slower dilution rates (0.05 h<sup>-1</sup>) for murine, but not for human fecal cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. As the pig GIT resembles humans more than mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, we thus decided on the higher dilution rate (0.2 h<sup>-1</sup>) to ensure a significant eukaryotic viral elimination. Albeit, the current study suggests that slower dilution may be required for proper <italic>in vitro</italic> phage propagation of a neonatal gut virome.</p>

<title>Correction of preterm gut dysbiosis</title>
<p>Although the chemostats poorly resembled the piglet gut microbiome, the MO-induced increase in <italic>Bacteroidota</italic>-specific phages could beneficially modulate the recipient gut microbiome. Indeed, we found that a significant proportion of phages in the chemostat virome including those targeting <italic>Bacteroidota</italic> were induced prophages, as opposed to the fecal inoculum containing almost exclusively virulent phages. Although less abundant in human infants compared to piglets, <italic>Bacteroides</italic> is a part of the normal developing microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> and is positively linked to intestinal health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. FVT has repeatedly been shown to increase the similarity between donor and recipient bacterial compositions, without administering the actual donor bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. We have previously observed increased levels of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp. in piglet colons after receiving NEC-reducing FMT or FVT treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. However, the MO-propagated chemostat virome did not increase <italic>Bacteroides</italic> or <italic>Parabacteroides</italic> spp. in the recipient’s gut, nor did it provide NEC protection. We find it likely that this lack of engraftment could be due to an absence of bacterial hosts in the preterm piglet recipients.</p>
<p>As <italic>Experiment 1</italic> piglets had unusually low levels of intestinal lesions, the NEC-reducing capacity of this particular donor fecal virome remains unknown, although the FVT concept has been proven efficacious on previous occasions using similar donor material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Importantly, the virome transfer was capable of reducing <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> while increasing the abundance of <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> members. Although NEC cases were sparse, these showed the opposite trend regarding these bacteria, thus indicating a restorative effect of FVT on NEC-associated dysbiosis. Peculiarly, viral metagenomics data indicated that mainly virulent phages from the FVT inoculum engrafted in recipients and that these had <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> as hosts. This contrasts a simple lytic predation of target bacteria as an explanatory mechanism. Regardless, the lack of <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> in chemostats could potentially explain the lack of recipient gut engraftment of the chemostat-propagated viromes despite transferring similar numbers of virus-like particles. As we have previously seen <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> abundance linked to NEC protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, this again highlights a target for optimizing chemostat conditions to maintain this bacterial family, thereby enabling efficacy of chemostat propagated feces. Moreover, whether the reduction of <italic>C. perfringens</italic> was due to transferred lytic phages or as a result of competitive exclusion by other bacteria remains unknown.</p>

<title>Transfer of chemostat viromes entails later diarrhea</title>
<p>We have previously demonstrated the use of chemostat viromes to improve the health status of mice during metabolic syndrome and <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. This initiative aimed to 1) overcome variations in efficacy between FVT donors and 2) enhance safety by removing donor-derived eukaryotic viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Since the existing studies showed no side effects, the importance of eukaryotic virus removal for improved FVT safety has remained a theoretical concern. The present study, however, showed that FVT induces diarrhea consistently and that chemostat propagation delayed diarrhea onset. Regardless, since the viral metagenomics analysis did not identify a specific eukaryotic viral agent, the exact mechanism for how chemostat propagation reduces side effects remains elusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. The four eukaryotic viral families found in feces or batch cultures (<italic>Smacoviridae, Genomoviridae, Picobirnaviridae</italic>, and <italic>Astroviridae</italic>) were not found upregulated in FVT recipients, nor was any inflammatory signal detected in mesenteric lymph nodes on day five. As diarrhea appeared on days 2-3 alongside reduced systemic lymphocyte counts, earlier analyses may have revealed different trends between groups.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, we show that chemostat propagated fecal virome reduces eukaryotic virus abundance drastically and minimizes gastrointestinal side effects when transferred into newborn recipients. Chemostat cultivation is a promising method to generate complex but reproducible fecal viromes, and supplementing the culture with MOs shows promise for approximating milk-shaped fecal microbiomes. However, MO composition, pH, and dilution rate need optimization for better virus engraftment, recipient microbiome restoration, and NEC protection.</p>

<p>In this <bold>valuable</bold> study, the authors report on an innovative chemostat propagation system to reduce eukaryotic viruses while retaining phages in mixtures used for FVTs (fecal virome transplant). The authors hypothesized that chemostat-propagated viromes could modulate the gut microbiota and reduce necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) lesions while avoiding potential side effects, such as earlier onset of diarrhea. The study is <bold>solid</bold> in that it integrates in vitro fermentation, high-resolution metagenomics, immunogenicity assays, and in vivo validation, demonstrating the potential of FVT using eukaryotic-free virome-based therapeutics. However, the study overall has some conceptual and technical limitations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Fecal virome transfer (FVT) has the potential to take advantage of microbiome-associated phages to treat diseases such as NEC. However, FVT is also associated with toxicity due to the presence of eukaryotic viruses in the mixture, which are difficult to filter out. The authors use a chemostat propagation system to reduce the presence of eukaryotic viruses (these become lost over time during culture). They show in pig models of NEC that chemostat propagation reduces the incidence of diarrhea induced by FVTs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors report an innovative yet simple approach that has the potential to be useful for future applications. Most of the experiments are easy to follow and are performed well.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The biggest weakness is that the authors show that their technique addresses safety, but they are unable to demonstrate that they retain efficacy in their NEC model. This could be due to technical issues or perhaps the efficacy of FVT reported in the literature is not robust. If they cannot demonstrate the efficacy of the chemostat-propagated virome mixture, the value of the study is compromised.</p>
<p>The above issue is especially concerning because the chemostat propagation selected for bacteria that may not necessarily be the ones that harbor the beneficial phages. Without an understanding of exactly how FVT works, is it possible to make any conclusion about the usefulness of the chemostat approach?</p>
<p>Finally, can the authors rule out that their observations in THP-1 cells are driven by LPS or some other bacterial product in the media?</p>

<p>The authors hypothesized that chemostat propagated viromes could modulate the GM and reduce NEC lesions while avoiding potential side effects, such as the earlier onset of diarrhea. This is interesting.</p>
<p>Major Comments:</p>
<p>(1) As the authors state that the aim of the research is 'We hypothesized that chemostat propagated viromes could modulate the GM and reduce NEC lesions while avoiding potential side effects, such as earlier onset of diarrhea'.</p>
<p>
a) For the efficacy, in Figure 5, there is no significance in stomach pathology and enterocolitis between groups, even between the control group and experimental groups, is it because of the low incidence of NEC? This may affect the statistical power of the conclusions. Therefore, it is unclear how one can draw the conclusion that chemostat can reduce NEC lesions?</p>
<p>
b) Convincing pathology images would be helpful.</p>
<p>
c) For the safety, such as body weight development, FVT had no statistical significance difference from control, CVT, and CVT-MO. So how can the authors draw the conclusion that chemostat can avoid potential side effects?</p>
<p>
d) There is a lack of evidence to convince the reader that there is a decrease in eukaryotic viruses. More quantitative data here would be useful.</p>
<p>(2) Questions regarding Figure 3F:</p>
<p>
a) How can the medium have 'the baseline viral content'?</p>
<p>
b) What is the statistical significance of the relative abundance of specific eukaryotic viruses?</p>
<p>
c) The hosts for some of the listed eukaryotic viruses are neither pigs or humans, as such, the significance of a decrease in these viruses to humans is unclear.</p>
<p>(3) In this study, pH 6.5 was selected as the pH value for chemostat cultivation, but considering the different adaptability of different bacteria to pH, it is recommended to further explore the effect of pH on bacteria and virus groups. In particular, it was optimized to maintain the growth of beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillaceae and Bacteroides in order to improve the effect of chemostat cultivation.</p>
<p>(4) Please improve the quality of the images, charts, error bars, and statistical significance markers throughout and mark the n's. used in each experiment.</p>

<p>This study investigated the in vitro amplification of donor fecal virus using chemostat culturing technology, aiming to reduce eukaryotic virus load while preserving bacteriophage community diversity, thereby optimizing the safety and efficacy of FVT. The research employed a preterm pig model to evaluate the effects of chemostat-propagated viromes (CVT) in preventing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and mitigating adverse effects such as diarrhea.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Enhanced Safety Profile:</p>
<p>
Chemostat cultivation effectively reduced eukaryotic virus load, thereby minimizing the potential infection risks associated with virome transplantation and offering a safer virome preparation method for clinical applications.</p>
<p>(2) Process Reproducibility:</p>
<p>
The chemostat system achieved stable amplification of bacteriophage communities (Bray-Curtis similarity &gt;70%), mitigating the impact of donor fecal variability on therapeutic efficacy.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Loss of Phage Functionality:</p>
<p>
The chemostat cultivation resulted in a reduction in phage diversity (e.g., the loss of Lactobacillaceae phages), which may compromise their protective effects against NEC (potentially linked to the immunomodulatory functions of Lactobacilli). The authors should explicitly address this limitation in the discussion section, particularly if additional experiments cannot be conducted to resolve it within the current study.</p>
<p>(2) Limitations in Experimental Design:</p>
<p>
The low incidence of NEC lesions in the control group reduced the statistical power of the study. This limitation undermines the ability to conclusively evaluate the efficacy and safety of the chemostat-propagated virome as a novel intervention for NEC. Future studies should optimize experimental conditions (e.g., using a more NEC-susceptible model or diet) to ensure adequate disease incidence for robust statistical comparisons.</p>
