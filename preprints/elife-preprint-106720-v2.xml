<abstract><p>Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (SVD) is a leading cause of stroke and dementia and yet is often an incidental finding in aged patients due to the inaccessibility of brain vasculature to imaging. Animal models are important for modelling the development and progression of SVD across the lifespan. In humans, reduced <italic>FOXF2</italic> is associated with an increased stroke risk and SVD prevalence in humans. In the zebrafish, <italic>foxf2</italic> is expressed in pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells and is involved in vascular stability. We use partial <italic>foxf2</italic> loss of function (<italic>foxf2a</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) to model the lifespan effect of reduced Foxf2 on small vessel biology. We find that the initial pool of pericytes in developing <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants is strongly reduced. The few brain pericytes present in mutants have strikingly longer processes and enlarged soma. <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant pericytes can partially repopulate the brain after ablation suggesting some recovery is possible. Despite this capacity, adult <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant brains show regional heterogeneity, with some areas of normality and others with severe pericyte depletion. Taken together, <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants fail to generate a sufficient initial population of pericytes. The pericytes that remain have abnormal cell morphology. Over the lifespan, initial pericyte deficits are not repaired and lead to severely abnormal cerebrovasculature in adults. This work opens new avenues for modeling progressive genetic forms of human Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Brain microvessels supply billions of neurons and other brain cells with the oxygen and nutrients they need. Pathologies affecting brain microvasculature progress slowly and silently over a lifetime but have devastating consequences from decreased perfusion and vascular destabilization. Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) encompasses progressive heterogeneous changes in brain microvessels; it is the most common cause of vascular dementia and a significant contributor to stroke and cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Østergaard et al., 2016</xref>). 25% of all strokes are the result of CSVD, yet effective targeted treatments remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Østergaard et al., 2016</xref>). This is in part due to the inability to both detect and assess progressive damage in the brain.</p>
<p>While there are several genes implicated in familial CSVD (i.e., <italic>NOTCH3</italic>, <italic>HTRA1</italic>, <italic>FOXC1</italic>, <italic>COL4A1</italic> and <italic>COL4A2</italic>), there is a lack of suitable <italic>in vivo</italic> models for studying disease development and progression. Research has predominantly focused on <italic>NOTCH3</italic>, but over the last decade, <italic>FOXF2</italic> has emerged as a risk locus for CSVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chauhan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Duperron et al., 2023</xref>). SNPs in the intergenic region between <italic>FOXF2</italic> and <italic>FOXQ1</italic> decrease <italic>FOXF2</italic> expression and significantly increase stroke risk due to the variant decreasing the efficiency of <italic>ETS1</italic> binding to a novel <italic>FOXF2</italic> enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ryu et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Foxf2 promotes mural cell differentiation and vascular stability in the zebrafish brain and is expressed highly in brain pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahuja et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chauhan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Reyahi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ryu et al., 2022</xref>). Brain pericytes interact closely with endothelial cells, contributing to extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and blood-brain barrier (BBB) formation, in addition to providing vasoactivity and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bahrami and Childs, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Daneman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dave et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Stratman et al., 2009</xref>). In animal models, an absence of brain pericytes results in hemorrhages and accelerates vascular-mediated neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Foxf2 is clearly important for vascular stability across species, as loss of Foxf2 in mice and zebrafish leads to increased brain hemorrhage and alterations in brain pericyte numbers and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chauhan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Reyahi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ryu et al., 2022</xref>). Brain tissue from patients with aging-related dementias (i.e. post-stroke dementia, vascular dementia, Alzheimer’s disease) has reduced deep white matter pericytes and associated BBB disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ding et al., 2020</xref>) suggesting that pericytes should be examined as mediators of CSVD progression in patients with FOXF2 deficiency.</p>
<p>We previously showed that complete loss of <italic>foxf2</italic> in <italic>foxf2a</italic><sup>ca71</sup>; <italic>foxf2b</italic><sup>ca21</sup> double- homozygous mutants in late embryogenesis leads to reduced brain pericyte numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ryu et al., 2022</xref>). However, stroke susceptibility in humans is associated with reduced, but not absent, FOXF2 expression. Genome-wide association (GWA) indicates that carrying a minor allele of an SNP in a <italic>FOXF2</italic> enhancer leads to reduced, but not absent, FOXF2 and is associated with stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ryu et al., 2022</xref>). For this reason, we model CSVD using a zebrafish with reduced Foxf2 dosage using single homozygous <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants. Zebrafish <italic>foxf2a</italic> and <italic>foxf2b</italic> genes are the result of genome duplication in zebrafish ∼430 million years ago, and have similar gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arnold et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chauhan et al., 2016</xref>). We have detected no difference in function between the two genes, and therefore <italic>foxf2a</italic> loss of function may be similar to human heterozygous loss of FOXF2 function, a state that is observed in the population in GnomAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Strikingly, while pericytes in embryonic <italic>foxf2</italic> mutants are clearly affected, <italic>foxf2</italic> mutants can survive until adulthood, albeit with a reduced lifespan. How pericytes change across the lifespan while CSVD progresses is unknown.Here we find that <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants have significantly reduced brain pericyte numbers as embryos that do not recover over time. Pericytes in mutant embryos and larvae exhibit morphological abnormalities, including increased soma size, longer processes, and degeneration. We show that processes and soma in the adults are also abnormal, though their morphology differs over the lifespan. Although the initial pool of pericytes is smaller, mutants can regenerate pericytes after ablation. Our analysis suggests that <italic>foxf2</italic> is required within pericytes to modulate numbers but also has a strong effect on morphology. We show that brain pericytes may contribute to the pathological progression of genetic CSVD, starting in embryonic development and continuing across the lifespan. Understanding the early developmental aspects of late-onset vascular conditions like CSVD will aid in the development of effective therapeutic strategies.</p>

<title>Pericyte number is consistently lower in foxf2 mutant embryos and larvae</title>
<p>Embryonic phenotypes can lead to lifelong consequences. We have previously studied <italic>foxf2a;foxf2b</italic> double mutants only at a single embryonic stage at 3 days post fertilization (dpf). To understand how a pericyte and cerebrovascular phenotype evolves and/or resolves over development, we conducted serial imaging of individual brains of <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants at embryonic stages (3 and 5 dpf), and at larval stages (7 and 10 dpf). Mutants were live imaged using endothelial <italic>(kdrl:mCherry)</italic> and pericyte <italic>(pdgfrβ:Gal4, UAS:GFP)</italic> transgenic lines.</p>
<p>Embryonically, brain pericytes have a thin-strand morphology and are closely associated with, and extend processes over, the endothelium in the midbrain and hindbrain of zebrafish (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-A</xref>’’). In wildtype embryos, the number of pericytes increases progressively from 3 through 10 dpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants show significantly fewer pericytes on brain vessels at 3 dpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>; mean 21 in wildtype and 10 in mutants) and this pericyte deficiency persists through 5, 7, and 10 dpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-D</xref>). The reduction in pericyte numbers shows variable penetrance, with some <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants having pericyte numbers only slightly reduced from wildtype, and others that are severely diminished. The same pattern of pericyte reduction is seen with <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants from a homozygous or heterozygous incross, suggesting there is no maternal effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-F</xref>). Serial imaging of mutants with regional absence in earlier stages shows that defects in pericyte coverage persist into later stages, suggesting that the size of the initial pericyte population is a key determinant of later coverage (Fig. S1). Double <italic>foxf2a;foxf2b</italic> mutants have a fully penetrant phenotype with significantly fewer brain pericytes in mutants than wildtype at every stage (Fig. S2; mean 19 in the wildtype and 9 in mutants at 3 dpf). Incomplete penetrance in <italic>foxf2a</italic> single mutants could be due to genetic compensation from <italic>foxf2b</italic>. While <italic>foxf2b</italic> is not significantly upregulated in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants on average, individual embryos have highly variable <italic>foxf2b</italic> expression (Fig. S3).</p>

<p>Since <italic>Foxf2</italic> conditional knockout mice show reduced expression of the pericyte marker <italic>Pdgfrβ</italic>, we tested whether <italic>pdgfrβ</italic> expression is <italic>reduced</italic> in <italic>foxf</italic>2a mutants, as this might introduce inaccuracies in pericyte counting. We used two methods, quantitative hybridization chain reaction (HCR) <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and integrated density of the <italic>pdgfrβ</italic> transgene expression in wildtypes and mutants carrying only a single copy of the transgene. We show that <italic>pdgfrβ</italic> mRNA nor transgene expression is not reduced in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants (Fig. S3). Further, we show that <italic>pdgfrβ</italic> has complete overlap in expression with other brain pericyte markers such as <italic>ndufa4l2</italic> and <italic>foxf2b</italic> using HCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-D</xref>). Thus, <italic>pdgfrβ</italic> transgene or mRNA expression can reliably be used to count zebrafish brain pericytes in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants.</p>

<p>Although we focus on mural cells, Foxf2 is expressed in adult mouse brain endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>). We assessed <italic>foxf2a</italic> and <italic>foxf2b</italic> mRNA expression patterns using HCR <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. At 3 dpf, <italic>foxf2a</italic> is co-localized with the pericyte marker <italic>ndufa4l2a</italic> in brain pericytes and shows low level co-localized expression with the blood vessel marker <italic>kdrl</italic> in brain endothelium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The expression pattern of <italic>foxf2b</italic> is similar. It is expressed in pericytes (<italic>pdgfrβ</italic>) and only weakly in endothelial cells (<italic>kdrl</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). This is supported by the DanioCell atlas of single-cell sequencing of multiple embryonic stages that shows expression of both genes is strongest in mural cells, pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells and low in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sur et al., 2023</xref>) (Fig. S4). Thus, while <italic>foxf2a</italic> and <italic>foxf2b</italic> are principally expressed in pericytes they are lowly expressed in endothelium during brain development.</p>
<p>Pericyte loss or impairment leads to alterations in vascular patterning in the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Eilken et al., 2017</xref>). To assess if the endothelial network is affected in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants, we employed a Python workflow using Vessel Metrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">McGarry et al., 2024</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). We found no statistical difference in total network length between wildtype and mutants at 3 dpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>) or hindbrain central artery diameter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). However, pericyte density (number of pericytes divided by the total network length) is reduced by 40% in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>), reflecting the loss of pericytes with no change in vessel network length. Similarly, pericyte coverage of vessels (total process coverage from brain pericytes divided by the total network length) is reduced by 39% in mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>). Our data suggest that during early development, <italic>foxf2a</italic> depletion primarily affects pericytes.</p>

<title>Early defects in brain vessel development have lifelong consequences</title>
<p><italic>foxf2</italic> mutant animals can survive to adulthood, albeit with a reduced lifespan (∼1 year vs. &gt;2 years). Are early pericyte deficiencies repaired, or is loss of pericytes unimportant to survival to adulthood? To understand how brain pericyte phenotypes evolve over the lifespan, we dissected adult wildtype and <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant brains on pericyte and endothelial double transgenic backgrounds and imaged after iDISCO clearing. Gross measurements of standard length of the fish (snout to tail) show no significant differences between wildtype and mutants, except that female mutant brain length and width are significantly smaller at 11 months post fertilization (mpf) (Fig. S5). However, there is no significant difference in the proportional brain length/standard length ratio in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants vs. wildtype.</p>
<p>Projected 3D views of light sheet images of the whole brain show striking defects in pericyte density, coverage and vascular pattern in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants vs. wildtype adults (Movie 1-2; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). Pericyte distribution is irregular, and blood vessel density is visibly reduced in mutant brains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-D</xref>). Using a machine learning workflow (Fig. S6), we segmented pericyte soma, or the vessel backbone for the entire adult brain to count the total pericyte number in comparison to the total endothelial network length. We find a significant reduction in pericyte numbers in 3 mpf <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant brains, which have only 45% of the pericytes of a wildtype brain (average of 24567 pericytes/brain vs. wildtype 54833 pericytes/brain; n=3 of each genotype; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). However, at this stage, the vessel network length is not statistically different (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). The density of pericytes on vessels is significantly decreased from 0.01 pericyte/µm to 0.006 pericytes/µm in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants showing a clear deficit (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). In contrast, the mean vessel diameter across vessel segments is not significantly different at 3 mpf when all diameters are considered, nor when vessel diameters are grouped in 5 µm bins (n=522037 wildtype and 381544 <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant diameters; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H-I</xref>).</p>

<p>Similarly, cleared dissected brains at 11 mpf were imaged and show similarly striking vascular defects (Fig. S7). Adult pericytes have a clear, oblong cell body with long, slender primary processes that extend from the cytoplasm, and secondary processes that wrap around the circumference of the blood vessel (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>). These pericytes form a continuous network of processes to cover the blood vessels in the brain. In <italic>foxf2a</italic> 11 mpf brains, pericyte somas lose their oblong shape, and cell bodies cannot be easily distinguished from processes. Mutant cells also extend thickened linear processes, with no secondary processes encircling the vessels.</p>
<p>Mutant pericytes do not form an extensive network with other neighbouring pericytes. We note that there is variable phenotypic penetrance in <italic>foxf2a</italic> adults at 3 mpf that is reflective of the incomplete penetrance in <italic>foxf2a</italic> embryos (Fig. S7).</p>
<p>To view cellular morphology, we sectioned adult brains and immunolabeled pericytes and endothelium. In wildtype adult brains, we identified three subtypes of pericytes, ensheathing, mesh and thin-strand, previously characterized in murine models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berthiaume et al., 2018a</xref>) (Fig. S8). In comparing brain sections from both wildtype and <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants, on smaller vessels, mutant pericytes exhibit more linear processes with barely distinguishable soma, markedly differing from the characteristic appearance of wildtype adult pericytes (Fig. S9). Similarly, <italic>pdgfrβ</italic>-expressing cells on large-calibre vessels (mural cells, likely vascular Smooth Muscle cells (vSMCs)) show alterations in morphology and coverage (Fig. S9).</p>
<p>Although mutant embryos do not exhibit apparent abnormalities in their endothelium, large aneurysm-like structures are evident in the adult brain (Fig. S10). These structures also appear to have decreased <italic>kdrl</italic> expression. Thus, both whole-mount and sectioned tissue show that brain vascular mural cell number and morphology are severely impacted in adult <italic>foxf2a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant brains, with increasing involvement of the endothelium, suggesting a worsening phenotype throughout life.</p>
<p>As <italic>foxf2a</italic> is expressed in vSMCs, we tested the effect of loss of <italic>foxf2a</italic> on vSMCs using confocal imaging of larvae and light sheet microscopy of cleared dissected 6 mpf adult wildtype and <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant brains stained for transgenic endothelial (<italic>kdrl</italic>) and vSMC (<italic>acta2</italic>) markers. <italic>acta2</italic>-positive vSMCs are present on brain vessels around the Circle of Willis at embryonic (5 dpf) and larval (10 dpf) stages in both mutant and wildtype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,C</xref>). Further, the number of vSMCs does not differ between mutant and wildtype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,D</xref>). In adult brains, we find no significant difference in the total length of vSMCs in the brain, or in vSMC coverage (proportion of vessels covered by vSMCs) (n=3 of each genotype; Movie 3-4; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-H</xref>).

<p>The low number of brain pericytes in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants means that distinct pericyte processes can be distinguished and measured. However, in wildtypes, pericyte processes are not easily distinguished. For accurate process length measurements in wildtype we used multispectral labelling with a pericyte-specific Zebrabow transgenic line <italic>(pdgfrβ:Gal4, UAS:Zebrabow)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Whitesell et al., 2019</xref>). Cre mRNA was injected at the one- cell stage to activate random recombination, allowing us to visualize individual neighbouring pericytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Wildtype processes have a mean length of 81.3 µm vs 102.9 in the mutant at 3 dpf and 96.3 µm vs 147.6 in the mutant at 10 dpf (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Thus, the pericyte process lengths are significantly increased in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants at 3 and 10 dpf (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>Through study of wildtype processes using multispectral labelling, we observed some differences in the behaviour of adjacent pericyte processes from that published in the adult mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berthiaume et al., 2018b</xref>). While direct contact with no overlap between pericytes is the most common interaction in developing zebrafish, similar to mouse adult brain pericytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>), we also see some overlap (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). The average overlap between wildtype pericyte processes at 10 dpf was 5.9 µm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). Together, our data show overlap in brain pericyte processes in wildtype animals.</p>
<p>To further explore mutant pericyte behaviour, we conducted serial imaging during larval development. Over time, some mutant pericyte processes form disconnected bead-like blebs with cell bodies that disappear over time (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). This pericyte phenotype can occur on vessels with full patency and is not associated with endothelial regression. The bead-like remnants are highly prevalent during larval development in <italic>foxf2a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants but not present in wildtype (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). To visualize process degeneration in real-time, we time-lapse imaged from 4- 5 dpf (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). The pericyte can undergo a process reminiscent of cell death with soma blebbing and process degeneration phenotypically resembling neural dendrite degeneration or pruning (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>).</p>

<title>Foxf2a mutants do not have an impaired capacity to repopulate brain pericytes</title>
<p>Zebrafish have regenerative capacity in various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Becker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lepilina et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Otteson and Hitchcock, 2003</xref>), yet <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant embryos that are pericyte-deficient maintain strong brain pericyte defects through aging which suggests that either they may not be able to replenish absent/damaged pericytes, or that the smaller size of the initial pool in embryogenesis limits repair such that numbers never can catch up to wildtype. To differentiate these hypotheses, we tested whether <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants lack the capacity to regenerate pericytes. We reduced pericyte numbers in a <italic>foxf2a</italic> heterozygous incross using a cell ablation strategy.</p>
<p>Zebrafish expressing <italic>pdgfrβ:Gal4, UAS:NTR-mCherry</italic> and <italic>flk:GFP</italic> transgenes were treated with 5 mM metronidazole (MTZ) at 50 hpf for 1 hour which ablates most pericytes. MTZ is a prodrug substrate that elicits cell death in nitroreductase (NTR)-expressing cells due to its cytotoxic derivatives. We then imaged and counted brain pericytes at 3 dpf (a day after treatment) and 10 dpf (recovery).</p>
<p>At 3 dpf, in the vehicle (DMSO) control group there is the expected significant difference between wildtype and mutant pericyte numbers (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-B</xref>). When treated with metronidazole, both mutants and wildtypes both have a similar, severe reduction in pericytes at 3 dpf post- ablation, and are not significantly different from each other (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). By 10 dpf, pericytes are partially repopulated in both wildtype and mutant ablated groups (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Surprisingly, given the initial pericyte number defects in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant embryos, we find no significant difference between any groups (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>; mean 70 in wildtype DMSO treated, 53 in mutant DMSO treated, 43 in wildtype MTZ treated, 33 in mutant MTZ treated). This shows that <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants retain their ability to repopulate pericytes following ablation. This data is important to distinguish the timing and mechanism of pericyte reduction in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants. While <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant pericytes can regenerate following induced catastrophic loss, it cannot compensate for the initially smaller pool of pericytes during embryogenesis. This data suggests that <underline>foxf2a</underline> plays a critical role in the establishment of a properly sized initial pericyte pool during early development. Regeneration mechanisms, although intact, cannot fully compensate for this initial reduction in pericytes.</p>

<title>Dosage sensitivity of Foxf2</title>
<p>The logic for using a reduced dosage of Foxf2 in our studies is to better match the effect of common population variants leading to CSVD. We previously modelled the effect of a high-risk CSVD and stroke-associated SNV on the expression of FOXF2 in human cells, showing that it can reduce expression by ∼50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ryu et al., 2022</xref>). Since zebrafish have two FOXF2 orthologs (foxf2a and foxf2b), foxf2a homozygotes have equivalent FOXF2 dosage as human heterozygotes, assuming that foxf2a and foxf2b not only exhibit similar expression but also share similar functions. Foxf2 is a dosage sensitive gene as zebrafish <italic>foxf2a</italic> hets show a significant reduction in brain pericytes. Similarly, mouse Foxf2 is also dosage sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Reyahi et al., 2015</xref>). We find that <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants are variably penetrant, while <italic>foxf2a;foxf2b</italic> double mutants are fully penetrant. Genetic compensation is common with gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kok et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Rouf et al., 2023</xref>) and would explain variability in disease phenotypes in different individuals with the same mutation.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Impaired embryonic pericyte coverage in Foxf2 deficiency</title>
<p>We show that numbers of brain pericytes are reduced at multiple developmental and adult stages when <italic>foxf2a</italic> and/or <italic>foxf2a;foxf2b</italic> are lost. The deficiency is significant at every stage, including 3 dpf, the earliest time point that pericytes are robustly observed in development. Deficient numbers could be due to a reduction in the pericyte precursor population (i.e. <italic>nkx3.1</italic> positive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahuja et al., 2024</xref>)), or to an inability of <italic>foxf2a</italic>-deficient cells to differentiate into <italic>pdgfrβ</italic>-positive pericytes. Our data does not allow us to distinguish these, although <italic>pdgfrβ</italic> expression in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants is transcriptionally unchanged, suggesting that pericyte number in early development is the primary phenotype. Additional evidence for pericytes being the primary cells affected is that there is no difference in total vessel network length or hindbrain CtA diameter at 3 dpf in <italic>foxf2a</italic> heterozygotes or mutants when pericyte numbers are reduced. A reduction in pericytes is expected to have early consequences, as pericytes provide signals to the endothelium for quiescence and arterial-venous identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mäe et al., 2021</xref>), as well as allowing contractility of cerebral blood vessels in early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bahrami and Childs, 2020</xref>). Fewer pericytes distributed on a normal-sized endothelial network length results in reduced vessel coverage. It is intriguing therefore, that pericyte process length is increased at both 3 and 10 dpf, potentially to compensate for low pericyte density. A similar elongated pericyte phenotype and reduced coverage is seen in mice with constitutive <italic>Pdgfβ<sup>ret</sup></italic> knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mäe et al., 2021</xref>). The convergent phenotypes after manipulation of two genes (<italic>foxf2a</italic> in fish and <italic>Pdgfβ <sup>ret</sup></italic> in mice) that reduce pericyte number suggest that the intrinsic pericyte response to depletion of pericyte density is to elongate, perhaps to attempt to cover ‘naked’ vessels. We note that previous mouse <italic>Foxf2</italic> knockouts using a conditional Wnt1-Cre driver saw contrasting results to ours, with increased pericyte numbers, although a similar loss of vascular stability is seen in both models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Reyahi et al., 2015</xref>). The reason for the difference in the direction in pericyte number may be experimental due to the different knockout technique (conditional in mice which only removes neural crest-derived pericytes vs. full knockout which removes mesodermal, neural crest-derived and endothelial <italic>foxf2a</italic> in fish) or the difference could reflect a species- specific difference.</p>

<title>Insights on fundamental pericyte process properties</title>
<p>The reasons behind the hypergrowth of pericyte processes in <italic>foxf2a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant brains is unclear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berthiaume et al (2018a)</xref> propose that repulsive interactions among pericytes in the adult brain establish boundaries between adjacent pericytes, preventing their processes from overlapping. In this case, one might hypothesize that <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant pericytes, which are less dense along vessels, would lack feedback from adjacent pericytes, leading to uncontrolled growth.</p>
<p>In mice, adult brain pericytes form a non-overlapping network along capillaries, although their processes occasionally approach each other without overlapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berthiaume et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hill et al., 2015</xref>). Overlap between pericyte processes have not been well studied the developing brain, but <italic>pdgfrb</italic><sup>+ve</sup> cells in developing zebrafish fin also overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Leonard et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Strikingly, using multispectral (Zebrabow) labelling, we find processes overlap in the developing zebrafish brain. Overlaps occur on capillary segments and at branch points. Previous studies in mice were conducted in the adult brain, and it is possible that overlapping processes in the developing brain are transient, zebrafish-specific, or were potentially overlooked in the mouse experiments.</p>
<p>We have also observed forked extensions at the tips of some pericyte projections at 10 dpf in wildtype embryos, where pericytes are not in contact. Whether these unique structures are involved in attractive/repulsive signals between pericytes or help determine the direction and extent of process growth is unclear, but understanding the fundamental mechanisms governing pericyte-pericyte process interactions would yield valuable insights into development and disease, as well as into how pericyte depletion results in abnormally long processes.</p>

<sec id="s3d">
<title>Morphological abnormalities in pericyte soma in foxf2a mutants</title>
<p>A second morphological abnormality of <italic>foxf2a</italic> deficient pericytes is that their soma size is increased at 10 dpf, which may also be a compensatory change. Pathological changes in soma size have not been observed in brain pericytes. However, increased neuronal soma size is observed in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or Lhermitte-Duclos disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dukkipati et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kwon et al., 2001</xref>) and is linked to mTor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kwon et al., 2003</xref>). In neuronal populations, moderate soma swelling can be an adaptation for survival, while rapid, drastic swelling indicates imminent death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Rousseau et al., 1999</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that we observe degeneration of pre-existing pericytes in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant but not wildtype animals. This degeneration phenotypically resembles neuronal dendrite remodelling and pruning during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fukui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Greenwood et al., 2007</xref>). Further work to test whether pericytes share similar mechanisms of degeneration in response to stress or cellular damage may provide further insight into phenotypic progression.</p>

<title>Changes in foxf2a mutants across the lifespan</title>
<p>For the first time, we have examined how vascular phenotypes change in the adult brain using iDISCO clearing. We find that adult soma take on very unusual, ‘stiff’ shapes and become almost indistinguishable from processes. The adult processes are shorter and more linear than the embryonic processes. Hypertrophic embryonic pericytes either do not survive to adulthood or undergo morphological changes over time. Given the limited knowledge in this area, the underlying factors driving this shift in pericyte morphology are unclear. Actin is present near the plasma membrane of cells, where it provides structural and mechanical support, enabling motility and determining cell structure. Given the abnormal shapes of adult pericytes, alterations in actin may contribute to their irregular morphology.</p>
<p>In the adult <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant brain, abnormal <italic>pdgfrβ</italic>-expressing cells are observed on large-calibre vessels and likely represent vSMCs. We observed large-calibre aneurysm-like vessels, suggesting that vSMCs may lose functionality over time, thereby increasing the vulnerability of underlying vessels to dilation and weakening. Loss of <italic>acta2</italic> and, subsequently, vSMCs, has been associated with conditions such as thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Guo et al., 2009</xref>). However, we found no significant change in either vSMC cell number in embryonic development or in network length of vSMCs in the adult brain suggesting that the primary phenotype in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants is in pericyte cells, and that any changes to vSMCs are likely secondary.</p>
<p>Similarly, brain vessel diameter and network length are not significantly altered in embryonic <italic>foxf2</italic> mutants, but in 6-month-old adults, the vessel network length is significantly decreased. Our data suggests that <italic>foxf2</italic> deficiency contributes to cumulative vascular defects. Adult endothelial defects may be secondary to pericyte defects, although <italic>foxf2a</italic> is expressed in both pericytes and endothelial cells, and both cell types may be affected autonomously.</p>

<title>The initial pericyte pool is critical for lifelong vascular health</title>
<p>To understand the mechanism by which foxf2a influences pericyte numbers, we needed to distinguish between its role in early development and later roles. Our lab recently demonstrated that pericyte precursors express <italic>nkx3.1</italic> and <italic>foxf2a</italic> before pericyte differentiation and prior to expression of canonical markers such as <italic>pdgfrβ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahuja et al., 2024</xref>). Here we show that the pericyte pool in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants is reduced at the earliest embryonic stage that it can be measured. Zebrafish are remarkably regenerative and able to repair cardiac, retinal, spinal cord and pancreatic damage among other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Poss and Tanaka, 2024</xref>). We therefore anticipated that <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants might be able to regenerate new pericytes to replace lost pericytes. This was tested using genetic ablation of pericytes. Ablation is very efficient in mutants and wildtype. Surprisingly, 7 days after ablation, <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants show recovery of pericyte numbers. Thus, when placed under extreme stress, embryonic <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants can regenerate pericytes; yet, under baseline conditions, <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant pericytes do not replenish. This experiment is important to distinguish an underlying mechanism of the <italic>foxf2a</italic> pericyte phenotype. Our data suggests that the earliest and most important difference in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant pericytes is their low initial number. Even though some repair is possible, it is not enough to compensate. Reduced pericyte density is associated with elongated processes, enlarged soma, and degeneration in mutants, which are likely signs of cellular stress. Over a lifetime, the deficiency leads to progressive damage to the vascular network. Determining that there is a critical embryonic window for developing a robust pericyte precursor pool helps us focus on early interventions to mitigate these deficits before damage over the lifespan worsens. The necessity of Foxf2 during development for the establishment of proper brain vasculature was also seen in a mouse Foxf2 knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Reyahi et al., 2015</xref>). Further research into the early role of foxf2a in establishing initial pericyte specification/differentiation, and the impact of early vascular defects on disease progression, will be crucial for developing strategies to prevent and treat cerebrovascular conditions.</p>

<title>Zebrafish Husbandry and Strains</title>
<p>All procedures were conducted in compliance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care, and ethics approval was granted by the University of Calgary Animal Care Committee (AC21-0169). Embryos were maintained in E3 medium (5mM NaCl, 0.17mM KCl, 0.33mM CaCl2, 0.33mM MgSO4, pH = 7.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Westerfield, 2007</xref>) at 28°C. Larvae up to 10 dpf were maintained in an incubator with a light cycle (14 hours light, 10 hours darkness), with daily water changes and feeding. As zebrafish sex is not determined until 28 dpf, sex is not considered in embryo and larval experiments. For adult experiments, results were compared by sex where sufficient n’s were available. Results from the progeny of het in-crosses were blinded in that they were quantified before genotyping. All reagents and strains are listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> (Key Resources Table). All experiments included wildtype as a comparison group, and developmental stages, n’s, and genotypes are noted for each experiment (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Genotyping</title>
<p>Adult fish were anesthetized in 0.4% Tricaine (Sigma) and placed on a cutting surface. A small portion of the tip of the fin was clipped using a razor blade, and the fish were returned to the system to recover. For developmental DNA isolation, whole embryos, or larvae (up to 10 dpf) were anesthetized in 0.4% Tricaine prior to sampling.</p>
<p>Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using the HotSHOT DNA isolation protocol, adapted from Kosuta et al., 2018. To isolate gDNA, tissue or embryo was placed in 50 μL of Base Solution and incubated at 95°C for 30 minutes. 5 μL of Neutralization Solution was added to neutralize the reaction. Samples were spun down in a mini centrifuge, and DNA was sampled from the top portion of the solution to avoid undigested samples.</p>
<p>Zebrafish were genotyped for target genes or the presence of transgenes using the KAPA2G Fast HotStart Genotyping Mix as per the manufacturer’s instructions. <italic>foxf2</italic> mutants were genotyped using <italic>foxf2a</italic> primers (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A custom TaqMan probe for <italic>foxf2b<sup>ca22</sup></italic> (ANAACEC) was obtained from Applied Biosystems.

<title>Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted using the Research RNA Clean &amp; Concentrator-5 Kit (Zymo Research, R1015) with some modifications. 50 dechorionated embryos were collected at 48 hpf, and homogenized in TRIZOL (Ambion, 15596026) reagent with a syringe needle. Briefly, samples were centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 2 minutes to remove pigment. After separating the solution from the precipitate, chloroform was added, and the mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C. The aqueous layer containing nucleic acids was removed, and an equal volume of 95-100% ethanol was added, then mixed well. The rest of the protocol followed the manufacturer’s instructions using the Zymo-spin IC column. After eluting RNA with RNase/DNase-free water, samples were quantified using a Nanodrop to evaluate RNA quality. For cDNA synthesis, qSCRIPT cDNA Supermix (QuantaBio, 95048-100) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions and stored at -20°C.</p>

<title>RT-qPCR</title>
<p>To assess relative gene expression, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was carried out using custom-designed primers. PowerUP SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, A25742) was utilized on a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Cycle conditions followed the protocol of a PowerUP SYBR Green standard reaction: 50°C for 2 minutes, 95°C for 2 minutes, and 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 60 seconds. To calculate the fold change in gene expression, mutants were compared to wildtype using ΔΔCT calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Livak and Schmittgen, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Brain Dissection</title>
<p>Zebrafish were first euthanized in Tricaine and mounted on a Sylgard gel plate with dissection pins to stabilize them. Scissors were used to sever the brain stem entirely at the base of the head, posterior to the hindbrain. The eyes were removed with forceps/micro-scissors, and the optic stalks were cut. An incision was then made at the posterior portion of the skull plate anteriorly. Forceps were used to pull back the skull plate and orbital bones. Any nerve connections were severed, and the brains were removed and immediately fixed in ice-cold 4% PFA overnight at 4°C.</p>

<sec id="s4h">
<title>Brain Tissue Clearing</title>
<p>Whole zebrafish brains were cleared by either CUBIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Susaki et al., 2015</xref>), or a modified iDISCO+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Renier et al., 2016</xref>) protocol. For CUBIC, samples were incubated in 1:1 ratio of Reagent 1 (25% Quadrol (Sigma, 122262), 25% Urea, and 15% TritonX-100):H2O overnight at 37°C. Next, brains were incubated in 100% Reagent 1 at 37°C until the tissue was transparent. Finally, brains were rinsed in PBS, mounted in 2% low melting point agarose and re-placed in 100% Reagent 1 at 37°C until the tissue was transparent.</p>
<p>For iDISCO, the samples were first dehydrated in methanol:H<sub>2</sub>O dilution series for 30 minutes each, then chilled at 4°C. Next, samples were incubated overnight in a 1:3 ratio of dichloromethane (DCM; Sigma, 270997):methanol at room temperature. The following day, samples were washed in methanol and then chilled at 4°C before bleaching in fresh 5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in methanol overnight at 4°C. Then, samples were rehydrated in methanol:H2O dilution series for 30 minutes each, then washed in PTx.2 (0.2% TritonX-100 in PBS) twice over two hours at room temperature. Next, samples were incubated in permeabilization solution (0.3 M glycine, 20% DMSO in 400 mL PTx.2) at 37°C for up to two days, after which the samples were rinsed in PBS twice over one hour. Samples were then washed three times over two hours in 0.5 mM SDS/PBS at 37°C for three days before being incubated in primary antibody (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) in 0.5 mM SDS/PBS at 37°C for two more days. The primary antibodies were refreshed in PTx.2 and left for another 4 days before overnight washing in PTwH (10 μg/ml heparin and 0.2% Tween-20 in PBS) at 37°C. Samples were left in secondary antibodies (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) in PTwH/3% NSS at 37°C for 3 days, refreshed and left for another 3 days before washing overnight in PTwH. After immunolabeling, brains were mounted in 2% low melting agarose (LMA) and dehydrated in methanol:H<sub>2</sub>O dilution series for 30 minutes each and left overnight at room temperature. Next, brains were incubated in a 1:3 ratio of DCM: methanol at room temperature for three hours before washing in 100% DCM for 15 minutes twice.

<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>Sections for immunofluorescence were briefly washed in PBS, followed by 2% TritonX-100 in PBS for permeabilization. Sections were moved from the permeabilization solution into blocking buffer (5% Goat serum, 3% BSA, 0.2% TritonX-100 in PBS) for 1 hour before incubation in primary antibody.

<title>Drug Treatments</title>
<p>Embryos were dechorionated prior to treatment, and all drug treatments included DMSO at an equivalent concentration to the drug solution as a control (Sigma, D8418). Treatments were performed in a 24-well plate with approximately 15 embryos per well. For pericyte ablation experiments, 5 mM Metronidazole (MTZ; Sigma, M3761) was applied at 50 hpf for 1 hour with a DMSO control.</p>

<sec id="s4m">
<title>Microscopy</title>
<p>Imaging fluorescent transgene expression in live embryos, antibody staining, and fluorescent staining were completed using an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM900; Zeiss) with a 10X (0.25 NA), 20X (0.8 NA), 40X water (1.1 NA) or 60X (1.4 NA) oil objectives. Laser wavelengths included blue (405 nm), green (488 nm), red (561 nm), and far red (640 nm).</p>
<p>Embryos were maintained in Phenylthiourea (PTU) from 24 hpf onwards to prevent pigment development, anesthetized in 0.4% tricaine and mounted in 0.8% LMA dissolved in E3, on a clear imaging dish. In some cases, live samples were retrieved from the agarose following imaging for further imaging at later time points, genotyping, or other data collection. Images were processed using Zen Blue and Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) software.</p>
<p>Imaging of whole adult brains was completed using the Light-sheet microscope (Ultramicroscope II equipped with a SuperPlan module; Miltenyi Biotec) with a 4X (0.35 NA) objective at 1.0 zoom. Laser wavelengths included green (488 nm) and red (561 nm). Images were processed using Zen Blue, Fiji and Imaris software.</p>

<title>Vessel network quantitation</title>
<p>Confocal images from embryos were analyzed using the Python-based software tool Vessel Metrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">McGarry et al., 2024</xref>). The total vessel network length was measured starting from below the middle cerebral vein and dorsal longitudinal vein until the emergence of the basal communicating artery. Vessels included in measurements are as follows: middle mesencephalic central arteries, posterior mesencephalic central arteries, the primordial hindbrain channels and the posterior region of the basilar artery. The forebrain vessels (i.e. anterior cerebral veins) were not included. Blood vessel diameter was restricted to the horizontal hindbrain central arteries, which were comparable between all images.</p>
<p>Adult vessel network length was measured using Ilastik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berg et al., 2019</xref>) and Imaris (version 10.2.0; Bitplane AG, Oxford Instruments) software. Vessels were annotated in Ilastik to obtain a probability map. The probability map was imported into Imaris as a new channel for each image. The surface tool with machine learning was then used to annotate the vessels a second time, using the Ilastik map as the training guide. A mask was created from this surface. The filament tool was then used to create a 3D network of the vessel, using the surface mask as a training guide. The total network length and the diameter of each vessel segment were exported from the filament statistics tab.</p>
<p>Smooth muscle cell coverage was measured using the same pipeline; however, the raw channel was used for the surface tool annotation without using Ilastik. Total network length was exported from the filament statistics tab.</p>

<sec id="s4o">
<title>Pericyte quantitation</title>
<p>Embryonic pericytes were manually counted using the Fiji counting or tracing tool on flattened Z-stacks from confocal images of the whole zebrafish head. Pericyte counting and analysis were restricted to the mid and hindbrain regions for all metrics. For pericyte process lengths, individual processes extending from a single soma were measured and summed to determine the total process length per pericyte (µm). In instances where two processes appeared to merge or cover the same blood vessel, half of the total length was added to each pericyte. For Zebrabow images, only pericytes with processes distinguishable from neighbouring pericytes were measured. For soma size, individual cell bodies were traced, and the area was determined by the software in µm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Adult pericytes were counted using the spot tool in Imaris. Using the raw channel, the spot tool was trained to identify pericyte cell bodies. The total spot number, equivalent to the number of pericyte cell bodies, was exported from the spot statistics tab. A mask of the spot tool was created to better visualize pericytes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper by Graff et al. investigates the function of foxf2 in zebrafish to understand the progression of cerebral small vessel disease. The authors use a partial loss of foxf2 (zebrafish possess two foxf2 genes, foxf2a and foxf2b, and the authors mainly analyze homozygous mutants in foxf2a) to investigate the role of foxf2 signaling in regulating pericyte biology. The find that the number of pericytes is reduced in foxf2a mutants and that the remaining pericytes display alterations in their morphologies. The authors further find that mutant animals can develop to adulthood but that in adult animals, both endothelial and pericyte morphologies are affected. They also show that mutant pericytes can partially repopulate the brain after genetic ablation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper is well written and easy to follow. The authors now include pericyte marker gene analysis and solid quantifications of the observed phenotypes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates the developmental and lifelong consequences of reduced foxf2 dosage in zebrafish, a gene associated with human stroke risk and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). The authors show that a ~50% reduction in foxf2 function through homozygous loss of foxf2a leads to a significant decrease in brain pericyte number, along with striking abnormalities in pericyte morphology-including enlarged soma and extended processes-during larval stages. These defects are not corrected over time but instead persist and worsen with age, ultimately affecting the surrounding endothelium. The study also makes an important contribution by characterizing pericyte behavior in wild-type zebrafish using a clever pericyte-specific Brainbow approach, revealing novel interactions such as pericyte process overlap not previously reported in mammals.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work provides mechanistic insight into how subtle, developmental changes in mural cell biology and coverage of the vasculature can drive long-term vascular pathology. The authors make strong use of zebrafish imaging tools, including longitudinal analysis in transgenic lines to follow pericyte number and morphology over larval development and then applied tissue clearing and whole brain imaging at 3 and 11 months to further dissect the longitudinal effects of foxf2a loss. The ability to track individual pericytes in vivo reveals cell-intrinsic defects and process degeneration with high spatiotemporal resolution. Their use of a pericyte-specific Zebrabow line also allows, for the first time, detailed visualization of pericyte-pericyte interactions in the developing brain, highlighting structural features and behaviors that challenge existing models based on mouse studies. Together, these findings make the zebrafish a valuable model for studying the cellular dynamics of CSVD.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I originally suggested quantifying pericyte coverage across brain regions to address potential lineage-specific effects due to the distinct developmental origins of forebrain (neural crest-derived) and hindbrain (mesoderm-derived) pericytes. However, I appreciate the authors' response referencing recent work from their lab (Ahuja, 2024), which demonstrates that both neural crest and mesoderm contribute to pericyte lineages in the midbrain and hindbrain. The convergence of these lineages into a shared transcriptional state by 30 hpf, as shown by their single-cell RNA-seq data, makes it unlikely that regional quantification would provide meaningful lineage-specific insight. I agree with the authors that lineage tracing experiments often suffer from low sample sizes, and their updated findings challenge earlier compartmental models of pericyte origin. I therefore appreciate their rationale for not pursuing regional quantification and consider this concern addressed. Furthermore, my other two points regarding quantification of foxf2 levels and overall vascular changes have been thoroughly addressed in the revised manuscript. These additions significantly strengthen the paper's conclusions and improve the overall rigor of the study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The goal of the work by Graff, et al. is to model CSVD in the zebrafish using foxf2a mutants. The mutants show loss of cerebral pericyte coverage that persists through adulthood, but it seems foxf2a does not regulate the regenerative capacity of these cells. The findings are interesting and build on previous work from the group. Limitations of the work include little mechanistic insight into how foxf2a alters pericyte recruitment/differentiation/survival/proliferation in this context, and the overlap of these studies with previous work in fox2a/b double mutants. However, the data analysis is clean and compelling and the findings will contribute to the field.</p>

<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>This study presents valuable findings that advance our understanding of mural cell dynamics and vascular pathology in a zebrafish model of cerebral small vessel disease. The authors provide compelling evidence that partial loss of foxf2 function leads to progressive, cell-intrinsic defects in pericytes and associated endothelial abnormalities across the lifespan, leveraging powerful in vivo imaging and genetic tools. The strength of evidence could be further improved by additional mechanistic insight and quantitative or lineage-tracing analyses to clarify how pericyte number and identity are affected in the mutant model.</p>

<p>Thank you to the reviewers for insightful comments and for the time spent reviewing the manuscript. We have strengthened the data through responding to the comments.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>The paper by Graff et al. investigates the function of foxf2 in zebrafish to understand the progression of cerebral small vessel disease. The authors use a partial loss of foxf2 (zebrafish possess two foxf2 genes, foxf2a and foxf2b, and the authors mainly analyze homozygous mutants in foxf2a) to investigate the role of foxf2 signaling in regulating pericyte biology. They find that the number of pericytes is reduced in foxf2a mutants and that the remaining pericytes display alterations in their morphologies. The authors further find that mutant animals can develop to adulthood, but that in adult animals, both endothelial and pericyte morphologies are affected. They also show that mutant pericytes can partially repopulate the brain after genetic ablation.</p>
<p>(1) Weaknesses: The results are mainly descriptive, and it is not clear how they will advance the field at their current state, given that a publication on mice has already examined the loss of foxf2 phenotype on pericyte biology (Reyahi, 2015, Dev. Cell).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reyahi paper was the earliest report of foxf2 mutant brain pericytes and remains illuminating. The work was very well technically executed. Our manuscript expands and at times, contradicts, their findings. We realized that we did not fully discuss this in our discussion, and this has now been updated. The biggest difference between the two studies is in the direction of change in pericytes after foxf2 knockout, a major finding in both papers. This is where it is important to understand the differences in methods. Reyahi et al., used a conditional knockout under Wnt1:Cre which will ablate pericytes derived from neural crest, but not those derived from mesoderm, nor will it affect foxf2 expression in endothelial cells. Our model is a full constitutive knockout of the gene in all brain pericytes and endothelial cells. For GOF, Reyahi used a transgenic model with a human FOXF2 BAC integrated into the mouse germline.</p>
<p>Both studies are important. We do not know enough about human phenotypes in patients with strokeassociated human FOXF2 SNVs to know the direction of change in pericyte numbers. We showed that the SNVs reduce FOXF2 gene expression in vitro (Ryu, 2022). Here we demonstrate dosage sensitivity in fish (showing phenotypes when 1 of 4 foxf2a + foxf2b alleles are lost, Figure 1F), supporting that slight reductions of FOXF2 in humans could lead to severe brain vessel phenotypes. For this reason, our work is complementary to the previously published work and suggests that future studies should focus on understanding the role of dosage, cell autonomy, and human pericyte phenotypes with respect to FOXF2. While some experiments are parallel in mouse and fish, we go further to look at cell death and regeneration, and to understand the consequences on the whole brain vasculature.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Reyahi et al. showed that loss of foxf2 in mice leads to a marked downregulation of pdgfrb expression in perivascular cells. In contrast to expectation, perivascular cell numbers were higher in mutant animals, but these cells did not differentiate properly. The authors use a transgenic driver line expressing gal4 under the control of the pdgfrb promoter and observe a reduction in pericyte (pdgfrb-expressing) cells in foxf2a mutants. In light of the mouse data, this result might be due to a similar downregulation of pdgfrb expression in fish, which would lead to a downregulation of gal4 expression and hence reduced labelling of pericytes. The authors show a reduction of pdgfrb expression also in zebrafish in foxf2b mutants (Chauhan et al., The Lancet Neurology 2016).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reyahi detected more pericytes in the Wnt1:Cre mouse, while we detected fewer in the foxf2a (and foxf2a;foxf2b) mutants. This may be because of different methods. For instance, because the mouse knockout is not a constitutive Foxf2 knockout, the observed increase in pericytes may be because mesodermal-derived pericytes proliferate more highly when the neural crest-derived pericytes are absent. Or does endothelial foxf2 activate pericyte proliferation when foxf2 is lost in some pericytes? It is also possible that mouse foxf2 has a different role from its fish ortholog. Despite these differences, there are common conclusions from both models. For instance, both mouse and fish show foxf2 controls capillary pericyte numbers, albeit in different directions. Both show hemorrhage and loss of vascular stability as a result. Both papers identify the developmental window as critical for setting up the correct numbers of pericytes.</p>
<p>As the reviewer suggested, it was important to test whether pdgfrb is downregulated in fish as it is in mice. To do this, we measured expression of <italic>pdgfrb</italic> in <italic>foxf2</italic> mutants using hybridization chain reaction (HCR) of <italic>pdgfrb</italic> in <italic>foxf2</italic> mutants. The results show no change in <italic>pdgfrb</italic> mRNA in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants at two independent experiments (Fig S3). Independently, we integrated <italic>pdgfrb</italic> transgene intensity (using a single allele of the transgene so there are no dose effects) in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants vs. wildtype. We found no difference (Fig S3) suggesting that <italic>pdgfrb</italic> is a reliable reporter for counting pericytes in the foxf2a knockout. The reviewer is correct that we previously showed downregulation of <italic>pdgfrb</italic> in <italic>foxf2b</italic> mutants at 4 dpf using colorimetric ISH. <italic>foxf2a</italic> and <italic>foxf2b</italic> are unlinked, independent genes (~400 M years apart in evolution) and may have different regulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It would be important to clarify whether, also in zebrafish, foxf2a/foxf2b mutants have reduced or augmented numbers of perivascular cells and how this compares to the data in the mouse.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We discuss methodological differences between Reyahi and our work in point (1) above. The reduction in pericytes in foxf2a;foxf2b mutants has been previously published (Ryu, 2022, Supplemental Figure 1) and shown again here in Supplemental Figure 2). Numbers are reduced in double mutants up to 10 dpf, suggesting no recovery. Further, in response to reviewer comments, we have quantified pericytes in the whole fish brain (Figure 3E-G) and show reduced pericytes in the adult, reduced vessel network length, and importantly that the pericyte density is reduced. In aggregate, our data shows pericyte reduction at 5 developmental stages from embryo through adult. The reason for different results from the mouse is unknown and may reflect a technical difference (constitutive vs Wnt1:Cre) or a species difference.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors should perform additional characterization of perivascular cells using marker gene expression (for a list of markers, see e.g., Shih et al. Development 2021) and/or genetic lineage tracing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a good point. We have added HCR analysis of additional markers. Results show co-expression of foxf2a, foxf2b, nduf4la2 and pdgfrb in brain pericytes (Fig 2, Fig S3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors motivate using foxf2a mutants as a model of reduced foxf2 dosage, &quot;similar to human heterozygous loss of FOXF2&quot;. However, it is not clear how the different foxf2 genes in zebrafish interact with each other transcriptionally. Is there upregulation of foxf2b in foxf2a mutants and vice versa? This is important to consider, as Reyahi et al. showed that foxf2 gene dosage in mice appears to be important, with an increase in foxf2 gene dosage (through transgene expression) leading to a reduction in perivascular cell numbers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that dosage is a very important concept and show phenotypes in foxf2a heterozygotes (Fig 1F). To test the potential compensation from foxf2b, we have added qPCR for foxf2b in foxf2a mutants as well as HCR of foxf2b in foxf2a mutants (Fig S3C,D). There is no change in <italic>foxf2b</italic> expression in foxf2a mutants. We discuss dosage in our discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Figures 3 and 4 lack data quantification. The authors describe the existence of vascular defects in adult fish, but no quantifiable parameters or quantifications are provided. This needs to be added.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This query was technically challenging to address, but very worthwhile. We have not seen published methods for quantifying brain pericytes along with the vascular network (certainly not in zebrafish adults), so we developed new methods of analyzing whole brain vascular parameters of cleared adult brains (Figure S6) using a combination of segmentation methods for pericytes, endothelium and smooth muscle. We have added another author (David Elliott) as he was instrumental in designing methods. We find a significant decrease in vessel network length in foxf2a mutants at 3 month and 6 months (Figures 3F and 4G). Similarly, we show a lower number of brain pericytes in foxf2a mutants (Figure 3E). Finally, we added whole brain analysis of smooth muscle coverage (Figure 4) and show no change in vSMC number or coverage of vessels at 5 and 10 dpf or adult, respectively, pointing to pericytes being the cells most affected. Thank you, this query pushed us in a very productive direction. These methods will be extremely useful in the future!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The analysis of pericyte phenotypes and morphologies is not clear. On page 6, the authors state: &quot;In the wildtype brain, adult pericytes have a clear oblong cell body with long, slender primary processes that extend from the cytoplasm with secondary processes that wrap around the circumference of the blood vessel.&quot; Further down on the same page, the authors note: &quot;In wildtype adult brains, we identified three subtypes of pericytes, ensheathing, mesh and thin-strand, previously characterized in murine models.&quot; In conclusion, not all pericytes have long, slender primary processes, but there are at least three different sub-types? Did the authors analyze how they might be distributed along different branch orders of the vasculature, as they are in the mouse?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have reworded the text on page 5/6 to be clearer that embryonic pericytes are thin strand only. Additional pericyte subtypes develop later are seen in the mature vasculature of the adult. We could not find a way to accurately analyze pericyte subtypes in the adult brain. The imaging analysis to count pericytes used soma as machine learning algorithms have been developed to count nuclei but not analyze processes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Which type of pericyte is affected in foxf2a mutant animals? Can the authors identify the branch order of the vasculature for both wildtype and mutant animals and compare which subtype of pericyte might be most affected? Are all subtypes of pericytes similarly affected in mutant animals? There also seems to be a reduction in smooth muscle cell coverage.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see the response to (7) about pericyte subtypes. In response to the reviewer’s query, we have now analyzed vSMCs in the embryonic and adult brain. In the embryonic brain we see no statistical differences in vSMC number at 5 and 10 dpf (Figure 4). In the adult, vSMC length (total length of vSMCs in a brain) and vSMC coverage (proportion of brain vessels with vSMCs) are not significantly different. This data is important because it suggests that foxf2a has a more important role in pericytes than in vSMCs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Regarding pericyte regeneration data (Figure 7): Are the values in Figure 7D not significantly different from each other (no significance given)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Any graphs missing bars have no significance and were left off for clarity. We have stated this in the statistical methods.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) In the discussion, the authors state that &quot;pericyte processes have not been studied in zebrafish&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Ando et al. (Development 2016) studied pericyte processes in early zebrafish embryos, and Leonard et al. (Development 2022) studied zebrafish pericytes and their processes in the developing fin. We apologize, this was not meant to say that pericyte processes had not been studied before, we have reworded this to make clear the intent of the sentence. We were trying to emphasize that we are the first to quantify processes at different stages, especially  in foxf2 mutants. Processes change morphology over development, especially after 5 dpf, something that our data captures. Our images are of stages that have not been previously characterized. We added a reference to Mae et al., who found similar process length changes in a mouse knockout of a different gene, and to Leonard who previously showed overlap of processes in a different context in fish.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates the developmental and lifelong consequences of reduced foxf2 dosage in zebrafish, a gene associated with human stroke risk and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). The authors show that a ~50% reduction in foxf2 function through homozygous loss of foxf2a leads to a significant decrease in brain pericyte number, along with striking abnormalities in pericyte morphologyincluding enlarged soma and extended processes-during larval stages. These defects are not corrected over time but instead persist and worsen with age, ultimately affecting the surrounding endothelium. The study also makes an important contribution by characterizing pericyte behavior in wild-type zebrafish using a clever pericyte-specific Brainbow approach, revealing novel interactions such as pericyte process overlap not previously reported in mammals.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work provides mechanistic insight into how subtle, developmental changes in mural cell biology and coverage of the vasculature can drive long-term vascular pathology. The authors make strong use of zebrafish imaging tools, including longitudinal analysis in transgenic lines to follow pericyte number and morphology over larval development, and then applied tissue clearing and whole brain imaging at 3 and 11 months to further dissect the longitudinal effects of foxf2a loss. The ability to track individual pericytes in vivo reveals cell-intrinsic defects and process degeneration with high spatiotemporal resolution. Their use of a pericyte-specific Zebrabow line also allows, for the first time, detailed visualization of pericytepericyte interactions in the developing brain, highlighting structural features and behaviors that challenge existing models based on mouse studies. Together, these findings make the zebrafish a valuable model for studying the cellular dynamics of CSVD.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(11) While the findings are compelling, several aspects could be strengthened. First, quantifying pericyte coverage across distinct brain regions (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) would clarify whether foxf2a loss differentially impacts specific pericyte lineages, given known regional differences in developmental origin, with forebrain pericytes being neural crest-derived and hindbrain pericytes being mesoderm-derived.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In recently published work from our lab, we published that both neural crest and mesodermal cells contribute to pericytes in both the mid and hindbrain, and could not confirm earlier work suggesting more rigid compartmental origins (Ahuja, 2024). In the Ahuja, 2024 paper we noted that lineage experiments are often limited by n’s which is why this may not have been discovered before. This makes us skeptical that counting different regions will allow us to interpret data about neural crest and mesoderm. Further, Ahuja 2024 shows that pericyte intermediate progenitors from both mesoderm and neural crest are indistinguishable at 30 hpf through single cell sequencing and have converged on a common phenotype.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) Second, measuring foxf2b expression in foxf2a mutants would better support the interpretation that total FOXF2 dosage is reduced in a graded fashion in heterozygote and homozygote foxf2a mutants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have done both qPCR for foxf2b in foxf2a mutants and HCR (quantitative ISH). This is now reported in Fig S3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) Finally, quantifying vascular density in adult mutants would help determine whether observed endothelial changes are a downstream consequence of prolonged pericyte loss. Correlating these vascular changes with local pericyte depletion would also help clarify causality.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added this data to Figure 3 and 4. Please also see response (6).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(15) I'm not sure this reviewer totally agrees with the assessment that foxf2a loss of function, while foxf2b remains normal, is the same as FOXF2 heterozygous loss of function in humans. The discussion of the gene dosage needs to be better framed, and the authors should carry out qPCR to show that foxf2b levels are not altered in the foxf2a mutant background.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added data on foxf2b expression in foxf2a mutants to Fig S3. We have updated the results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(16) Figure 4/SF7- is the aneurysm phenotype derived from the ECs or pericytes? Cell-type-specific rescues would be interesting to determine if phenotypes are rescued, especially the developmental phenotypes (it is appreciated that carrying out rescue experiments until adulthood is complex). When is the earliest time point that aneurysm-like structures are seen?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a fascinating question, especially as we show that endothelial cells (vessel network length) are affected in the adult mutants. The foxf2a mutants that we work with here are constitutive knockouts. While a strategy to rescue foxf2a in specific lineages is being developed in the laboratory this will require a multi-generation breeding effort to get drivers, transgenes and mutants on the same background, and these fish are not currently available. Thank you for this comment- it is something we want to follow up on.</p>
