<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Enhanced protein synthesis is a crucial molecular mechanism that allows cancer cells to survive, proliferate, metastasize, and develop resistance to anti-cancer treatments, and often arises as a consequence of increased signaling flux channeled to mRNA-bearing eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F). However, the post-translational regulation of eIF4A1, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase and subunit of the eIF4F complex, is still poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that IBTK, a substrate-binding adaptor of Cullin 3-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) complex, interacts with eIF4A1. The non-degradative ubiquitination of eIF4A1 catalyzed by CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex promotes cap-dependent translational initiation, nascent protein synthesis, oncogene expression, and tumor cell growth both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, we show that mTORC1 and S6K1, two key regulators of protein synthesis, directly phosphorylate IBTK to augment eIF4A1 ubiquitination and sustained oncogenic translation. This link between the CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex and the mTORC1/S6K1 signaling pathway, which is frequently dysregulated in cancer, represents a promising target for anti-cancer therapies.</p>
<p><bold>Statement of Significance:</bold> Overexpression of IBTK contributes to the process of tumorigenesis by amplifying translation, and represents a promising target for anti-cancer therapies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Enhanced protein synthesis is a critical process that allows cancer cells to survive, multiply, metastasize, and resist anti-cancer treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. This process typically results from increased signaling through the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), which binds to mRNAs. eIF4F complex is composed of four proteins: eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4B, and eIF4A. Of these, eIF4A is responsible for unwinding the secondary structure in the 5’-UTR region of the mRNA, allowing the ribosomal subunit to bind and begin translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. The eIF4A protein family consists of three paralogs, eIF4A1, eIF4A2, and eIF4A3. Although eIF4A1 and eIF4A2 have similar roles in translation initiation, eIF4A3 is not involved in translation control but an important component of the exon junction complex (EJC) and plays a critical role in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Increased eIF4F activity promotes the translation of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation and survival, and tumor immune evasion, which are hallmarks of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Several eIF4A inhibitors, such as eFT226, silvestrol, hippuristanol, and pateamine A, have demonstrated promising anti-tumor activities in various cancer types conducted <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. In particular, eFT226 is currently being evaluated in multiple clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>].</p>
<p>The mTORC1 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in promoting cell growth and anabolism while inhibiting catabolism. It integrates various signals from nutrients, cellular energy levels, growth factors, and environmental stimuli to regulate this process. Translation is a highly energy-intensive process and tightly regulated by the mTORC1 signaling. Ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6Ks) and 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) are two major downstream targets of mTORC1 signaling. They regulate various aspects of mRNA translation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. For example, S6Ks phosphorylate ribosomal protein S6, which promotes translation initiation and elongation. 4E-BPs, on the other hand, bind to eIF4E and inhibit its activity, preventing the translation of specific mRNAs. In addition, mTORC1 coordinates translation by phosphorylating other components of the translational machinery, such as eEF2K, eIF2B, and LARP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>The Cullin 3-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) complex subfamily is composed of a catalytic core made up of RBX1 and CUL3, and a substrate-binding adaptor that contains an interchangeable BTB domain. The CRL3 complex plays a role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell division, differentiation, and signaling. Through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, the CRL3 complex promotes the degradation of specific proteins by marking them with ubiquitin. However, the CRL3 complex can also facilitate non-degradative ubiquitination, which can modulate protein activity, localization, or interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Initially characterized as an inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), the Inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (IBTK) contains two BTB domains and can assemble an active CRL3 complex[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. The downstream targets and biological processes of the CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex are still poorly understood, but a limited number of studies suggest that IBTK plays a pro-survival role in cells. IBTK is preferentially translated in response to eIF2α phosphorylation during endoplasmic reticulum stress. Knockdown of IBTK expression reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. A genome-wide RNAi screen identified IBTK as a synthetic lethal partner of the Ras oncogene in colorectal cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. In Eμ-myc transgenic mice, <italic>Ibtk</italic> gene knockout delayed the onset of pre-B/B lymphoma and improved animal survival due to increased apoptosis of pre-cancerous B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. The expression of IBTK was significantly increased in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) progression, but decreased in remission following chemotherapy. Knockdown of IBTK expression increased spontaneous and chemotherapy agent-induced apoptosis and impaired cell cycle progression in CLL cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. To date, only two substrates of CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> have been reported. CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> targets PDCD4, an eIF4A1 inhibitor, for proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Another study showed that CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> activates β-Catenin-dependent transcription of MYC by promoting GSK-3β degradation in cancerous B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. These findings suggest that CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> may play a crucial role in cancer development and progression, as well as in the regulation of cell survival and apoptosis.</p>
<p>Through a variety of biochemical and cell biology approaches, we have identified eIF4A1 as a non-degradative ubiquitination substrate of the CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex. Our findings also suggest that a mTORC1/S6K1-IBTK-eIF4A1 signaling axis mediates cap-dependent translation, facilitates oncoprotein expression, and promotes tumor cell growth.</p>

<title>Identification of eIF4A family proteins as IBTK interacting proteins</title>
<p>Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and proximity-dependent biotinylation identification (BioID) methods are powerful tools for interrogating protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Using these techniques, we sought to comprehensively characterize the interaction partners of IBTK in living cells. To accomplish this, we developed a tag workflow that enabled simultaneous AP-MS and BioID analysis with a single construct, pcDNA5/FRT vector containing FLAG-BirA*-IBTK. This construct was stably transfected into Flp-In T-REx 293 cells, resulting in inducible expression of IBTK (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 1A</bold>). We observed that levels of doxycycline (DOX)-induced FLAG-BirA*-IBTK protein were comparable to those of endogenous IBTK (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). Through our AP-MS and BioID analysis, we identified multiple potential IBTK interactors (<bold>Supplementary Table. 1, 2</bold>). One notable finding was the presence of multiple eIFs in the purified IBTK complexes, including the subunits of eIF2, eIF3, and eIF4 complex (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, C</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 1B</bold>). Of particular interest, eIF4A1 is a crucial subunit of the eIF4F complex and a promising therapeutic target for cancer. Previous large-scale interactome mapping datasets have also revealed a potential interaction between IBTK and eIF4A1, though it had not been analyzed for its biological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Therefore, we performed additional analyses to explore the pathophysiological significance of the eIF4A1-IBTK interaction.</p>

<p>To validate the interaction between IBTK and eIF4A1, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays. Our results demonstrated that ectopically expressed IBTK and eIF4A1 interacted with each other (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>). Moreover, two eIF4A1 paralogs, eIF4A2 and eIF4A3, also interacted with IBTK (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E, F</xref></bold>). Using FLAG-IBTK as an immunoprecipitation agent, we were able to confirm that endogenous eIF4A1/2/3 and CRL3 subunits (RBX1 and CUL3) associated with IBTK, but not other eIF4 complex subunits (eIF4B, eIF4E, and eIF4G) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref></bold>). Additionally, we detected endogenous interactions between IBTK and eIF4A1/2/3 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H-K</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these data indicate that IBTK specifically interacts with three members of the eIF4A protein family in cells.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>IBTK mediates non-degradative ubiquitination of eIF4A1</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that the protein stability of eIF4A1 can be regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and that the deubiquitinase USP9X promotes eIF4A1 stability by facilitating its deubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. However, the specific E3 ubiquitin ligase (s) responsible for eIF4A1 proteolysis remain elusive. Given that IBTK is involved in the assembly of a CRL3 ubiquitin ligase complex, we hypothesized that IBTK may target eIF4As for degradation. Nevertheless, exogenous overexpression of IBTK did not influence the protein levels of endogenous eIF4A1/2/3 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout (KO) (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2A-C</bold>) or shRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of IBTK in multiple cell lines did not alter the levels of eIF4A1/2/3 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, C</xref></bold>). Furthermore, the depletion of IBTK did not result in any changes to the protein half-life of eIF4A1/2/3 (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2D, E</bold>). Surprisingly, the protein levels of PDCD4, a reported proteolytic substrate of the CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex, remained unchanged in IBTK-KO or -KD cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, C</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We observed that IBTK-WT co-expression effectively ubiquitinated eIF4A1 and eIF4A2, while the ΔBTB mutant did not exhibit such effect (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>). This mutant lacks the BTB1 and BTB2 domains (deletion of aa 554–871), which have been previously demonstrated to be essential for binding to CUL3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Consistently, endogenous eIF4A1/2 ubiquitination was reduced upon IBTK KO (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>), and we further demonstrated that the CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex catalyzed eIF4A1 ubiquitination <italic>in vitro</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref></bold>). Intriguingly, neither overexpression nor IBTK KO had any impact on eIF4A3 ubiquitination (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, E</xref></bold>), despite a strong interaction between these two proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J, K</xref></bold>). It is worth noting that eIF4A1 and eIF4A2 have highly similar protein sequences (&gt;90% identity), but eIF4A1 tends to be more abundant than eIF4A2 in most tissues. Furthermore, eIF4A2 KO did not affect cell viability or global protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Therefore, this study primarily focused on investigating the functional consequences of IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination.</p>
<p>After identifying that IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination is non-degradative, we explored the specificity of polyubiquitin chain linkage on eIF4A1 catalyzed by CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup>. To do this, we conducted ubiquitination assays using a panel of ubiquitin mutants with a single lysine-to-arginine (KR) mutation at seven lysine residues or only one lysine present with the other six lysine residues mutated to arginine (KO). Additionally, we included a ubiquitin mutant in which all lysine residues were replaced with arginine (K-ALL-R). Strikingly, co-expression of any Ub-KR or -KO mutants did not significantly impact IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination, whereas co-expression of the Ub K-ALL-R mutant, which is unable to form polyubiquitin chains, caused only a moderate reduction in IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref></bold>). The C-terminal glycine-glycine (GG) residues are essential for Ub conjugation to targeted proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Indeed, co-expression of the Ub-ΔGG mutant totally abolished IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref></bold>). At last, we aimed to identify the specific lysine sites on eIF4A1 where ubiquitin was attached. Using MS to analyze the immunoprecipitated eIF4A1-Ub conjugates, we found that eIF4A1 was ubiquitinated at twelve lysine residues (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2F, Supplementary Table. 3</bold>). By introducing mutations that replaced all of these lysine residues to arginine, we observed that the IBTK-mediated ubiquitination of eIF4A1 was completely abolished (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2G</bold>). This suggests that some, if not all, of these lysine residues may function as target sites for ubiquitin attachment by the CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex.</p>
<p>Collectively, these data indicate that the CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex mainly catalyzes multi-mono-ubiquitination on eIF4A1, which does not lead to degradation.</p>

<title>IBTK promotes nascent protein synthesis and cap-dependent translation initiation</title>
<p>Given the significance of eIF4A1 in translational regulation, we conducted puromycin incorporation assays to assess the impact of IBTK depletion on global protein synthesis. We observed a noticeable decrease in nascent protein synthesis in IBTK-KO or -KD cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref></bold>). However, this effect was reversed by reintroducing IBTK into IBTK-KO cells (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 3A</bold>). Remarkably, the eIF4A1 inhibitor silvestrol also led to a considerable reduction in nascent protein synthesis, particularly in IBTK-KD or KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref></bold>). Silvestrol treatment still decreased nascent protein synthesis in IBTK-KO cells overexpressing FLAG-IBTK as well (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 3B</bold>). Although eIF4A1 appears to function as a major downstream target of IBTK, overexpressing eIF4A1 was unable to overcome the reduction in puromycin incorporation caused by IBTK KO (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 3C</bold>).</p>

<p>A decline in translation initiation is often associated with the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs), which are aggregates resulting from the phase separation of stalled mRNAs and related factors from the surrounding cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. We treated cells with sodium arsenite (AS), a conventional SG inducer that produces oxidative stress, and examined SG assembly using eIF4A1 or Caprin1 staining as a surrogate. We found that IBTK-KO cells exhibited significantly higher levels of AS-induced SGs compared to parental cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, D</xref></bold>). Conversely, overexpression of IBTK-WT resulted in a marked reduction in AS-induced SG assembly, while the ΔBTB mutant had no such effect (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E, F</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 3D</bold>). In contrast, IBTK overexpression had no influence on P-body assembly, as assessed by EDC4 staining (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 3E,F</bold>).</p>
<p>We aimed to determine whether IBTK plays a regulatory role in the cap-dependent translation initiation. In mammalian cells, two mechanisms of translation initiation exist: 5’ cap-dependent translation initiation and internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated initiation. To evaluate the effect of IBTK on both mechanisms, we performed dual-luciferase assays. The upstream reporter (Renilla luciferase) of the bicistronic mRNA was translated via a cap-dependent mechanism, whereas the downstream reporter (Firefly luciferase) was under the control of internal initiation from the hepatitis C virus (HCV)-IRES or (EMCV)-IRES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. The dual-luciferase assay results showed that IBTK depletion caused a significant decrease of Renilla signals by approximately 60% in both systems (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref></bold>), indicating that IBTK has a direct effect on cap-dependent translation initiation. Additionally, we noted that IBTK deficiency diminished the interaction between eIF4A1 and eIF4 subunits (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref></bold>), as well as the interaction between capped mRNAs and the eIF4 complex, as indicated by m<sup>7</sup>GTP-Sepharose pull-down assays (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>IBTK deficiency reduces the expression of oncogenes that are dependent on eIF4A1 and mitigates neoplastic phenotypes in cancer cells</title>

Similar results were observed in IBTK-KO H1299 cells and IBTK-KD CT26 cells (derived from a murine colon adenocarcinoma) (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 4A-D</bold>). Importantly, the mRNA levels of eIF4A1-regulated oncogenes were largely unaffected by IBTK KO (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>), implying that IBTK exerts a post-transcriptional regulation. Additionally, IBTK overexpression only marginally affected the protein levels of eIF4A1-regulated oncogenes (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>), likely as a result of the consistently high activity of the eIF4 complex in immortalized cell lines. We also showed that the effects of IBTK KO in reducing protein expression of eIF4A1 targets were unable to be reversed by eIF4A1 overexpression (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 4E</bold>).</p>

<p>Given the crucial role of eIF4A1 in cancer biology, we conducted additional investigations to determine if IBTK promotes neoplastic phenotypes in cancer cells. We observed that IBTK KO significantly decreased SiHa cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent cell growth (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-G</xref></bold>). IBTK depletion reduced xenograft tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref></bold>).

<title>IBTK facilitates IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression and tumor immune escape</title>
<p>A control mechanism of tumor immune evasion was recently demonstrated at the translational level through the eIF4F-STAT1-IRF1-PD-L1 pathway. The eIF4F complex regulates the translation of transcription factor STAT1 and promotes IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. As IBTK-KO cells showed compromised eIF4F-initiated translation activity and downregulated STAT1 protein levels, we investigated the potential impact of IBTK on IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression and tumor immune escape. We found that the expression of STAT1, IRF1, and PD-L1 induced by IFN-γ was markedly reduced in both IBTK-KO H1299 cells (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 6A-C</bold>) and IBTK-KD CT26 cells (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 6D-F</bold>). To further investigate the effects of IBTK in tumor growth in the presence of a functional immune system, we used a CT26 xenograft tumor model and found that immunocompetent mice implanted with IBTK-KD CT26 cells exhibited reduced tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 6G-I</bold>). CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a crucial role in antitumor immunity by secreting granzyme B, which triggers apoptosis.

<title>IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination is regulated by the mTORC1/S6K1 signaling</title>
<p>We investigated whether the upstream mTORC1/S6K1 signaling has any impact on IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination. Three quantitative phosphoproteomic studies revealed that treatment with mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin or Torin 1) resulted in a significant reduction in the phosphorylation levels at seven Ser/Thr sites on IBTK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Intriguingly, these sites cluster within a narrow region (990-1068 aa) proximate to the second BTB domain of IBTK (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>). We confirmed the interaction of IBTK with the mTORC1 complex and S6K1 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-E</xref></bold>). Subsequently, we examined the impact of mTORC1 signaling on IBTK phosphorylation. For this purpose, we generated an IBTK deletion mutant (900-1150 aa) encompassing the putative phosphorylation sites regulated by mTOR. Phos-tag gels were employed to detect changes in the electrophoretic mobility of phosphorylated proteins. The findings indicated a marked decrease in phosphorylated forms IBTK<sub>900-1150aa</sub>, while the non-phosphorylated form exhibited a simultaneous increase in cells deprived of amino acids or treated with rapamycin (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref></bold>). we also treated FLAG-IBTK<sub>900-1150aa</sub> overexpressed cells with lambda phosphatase. As shown in <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref></bold>, lambda phosphatase treatment completely abolished the mobility shift of phosphorylated FLAG-IBTK<sub>900-1150aa</sub>. Additionally, the lowest band displayed an abundant accumulation of the non-phosphorylated form of FLAG-IBTK<sub>900-1150aa</sub>. These findings confirmed that the mobility shift observed in WB analysis corresponds to phosphorylated forms of this deletion mutant. Moreover, the phosphorylation levels of IBTK<sub>900-1150aa</sub> were markedly downregulated in cells deficient in Raptor, an essential subunit of mTORC1 but not mTORC2 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref></bold>), indicating that the mTORC1 signaling plays a predominant role in mediating IBTK phosphorylation. To investigate whether mTOR or S6K1 directly phosphorylates IBTK, we conducted <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays using recombinant IBTK<sub>900-1150aa</sub> segment as a substrate. The analysis of the phospho-peptides via MS revealed that mTOR phosphorylates residues S911/999/1004/1039/1045/1069/1089/1141, while S6K1 phosphorylates residues S971/990/993/1033/1045/1096 and T1101 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I, J</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 7A, B, Supplementary Table. 4, 5</bold>). Thus, four out of seven sites (excluding S992, T1008, and T1068) were confirmed as mTOR/S6K1 phosphorylation sites <italic>in vitro</italic>, thereby confirming that IBTK is an authentic mTORC1/S6K1 substrate. We generated an IBTK mutant (IBTK-7S/TA) in which seven Ser/Thr residues were replaced with Ala residues to abolish phosphorylation regulated by mTORC1/S6K1. Simultaneous mutation of seven Ser/Thr sites to Ala nearly abolished the mobility shift of IBTK<sub>900-1150aa</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K</xref></bold>), indicating that most, if not all, mTOR-regulated sites are localized in this region. Recognizing that S990/992/993 are three adjacent sites, we deemed it appropriate to generate a single antibody to recognize the phospho-S990/992/993 epitope. Using this antibody, we observed a marked decrease in the phosphorylation levels of three adjacent Ser residues in IBTK upon AA deprivation or rapamycin treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L</xref></bold>). Furthermore, IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination was considerably decreased upon AA deprivation or rapamycin treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M</xref></bold>). This decrease was also evident in Raptor-KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5N</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Oncogenic signaling appears to dominate translation control at nearly all stage of cancer propagation for very specific and distinct cellular phenotypes. In general, cancer cells upregulate eIF4F activity to promote cap-dependent translation and oncogene expression, leading to rapid cell growth. Our study reveals an uncharacterized signaling axis involving mTORC1/S6K1-IBTK-eIF4A1 that promotes cap-dependent translation and oncoprotein expression, contributing to tumor cell growth. Additionally, we demonstrate that mTORC1 and S6K1 phosphorylate IBTK at multiple sites to boost CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup>-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination under nutrient-rich conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref></bold>). Overall, our study adds to our understanding of how cancer cells hijack protein synthesis machinery to promote their survival and proliferation, and provides potential avenues for developing new cancer treatments.</p>
<p>The development of eIF4A inhibitors as therapeutic agents for cancer patients is an exciting area of research. However, the emergence of resistance to these inhibitors highlights the need for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance. The recent genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen has identified three negative NRF2 regulators (KEAP1, CUL3, CAND1) whose inactivation can confer resistance to the silvestrol analogue, providing insights into potential pathways that may contribute to drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Additionally, our study shows that IBTK overexpression suppresses AS-induced SG assembly and that depletion of IBTK sensitizes cancer cells to eIF4A inhibitor-induced cell death, making IBTK a potential therapeutic target to overcome intrinsic resistance to eIF4A inhibitors. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of continued research in the development of eIF4A inhibitors and the identification of new therapeutic targets to combat drug resistance in cancer cells.</p>
<p>We observed that IBTK depletion indeed led to a substantial reduction in the protein levels of most detected eIF4A1-regulated oncogenes, but there were exceptions. For instance, IBTK KO in H1299 cells exerted minimal influence on the protein levels of ROCK1 (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 4A</bold>). Several possible explanations might account for this observation: firstly, given that our list of eIF4A1 target genes collected from previous studies conducted using distinct cell lines, it is not unexpected for different cell lines to exhibit subtle differences in regulation of eIF4A1 target genes. Secondly, as a CRL3 adaptor, IBTK potentially performs other biological functions via ubiquitination of multiple substrates; dysregulation of these could buffer the impact of IBTK KO on the protein expression of specifical eIF4A1 targets.</p>
<p>The tumor suppressor PDCD4 inhibits translation by binding directly to eIF4A. Pisano et al. reported that PDCD4 is the first CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> substrate and that CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> targets PDCD4 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Although this study highlighted the potential involvement of IBTK in translation regulation, we did not observe any changes in protein levels of PDCD4 in IBTK-KD or -KO cells. Instead, our study showed that eIF4A1 is a major downstream effector of IBTK, which has been previously observed to regulate several well-characterized eIF4A targets, such as MYC and MCL-1, in Eμ-myc mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Our results also indicate that IBTK may play a role in tumor immune escape through modulating the eIF4F-STAT1-IRF1-PD-L1 axis. This finding is in line with a recent study that eIF4A1 promotes PD-L1-mediated tumor immune escape by facilitating the translation of STAT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>In contrast to eIF4A1/2, IBTK does not possess the ability to ubiquitinate eIF4A3, despite a robust interaction between these two proteins. It remains unclear whether IBTK can facilitate eIF4A3 ubiquitination under specific conditions or merely modulate eIF4A3 activity through direct binding. eIF4A3 is an essential subunit of EJC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. The role of IBTK in post-transcriptional gene regulation through modulation of EJC activity is an area that warrants further investigation, particularly given that eIF4A3 or IBTK knockdown all had an impact on alternative splicing in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Alongside its interaction with eIF4A1/2, IBTK may also play diverse roles in different stages of the translation process. The AP-MS analysis and biochemical validation provide strong evidence for the interaction between IBTK and eIF2α (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref></bold>). A previous study showed that a functional uORF in the 5’-UTR sequence allows for preferential translation of IBTK in response to p-eIF2α and ER stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Our findings suggest that IBTK may interact with eIF2α and modulate its activity, either positively or negatively, through direct binding in response to p-eIF2α and ER stress. Furthermore, the identification of IBTK interacting with multiple subunits of eIF3 complex (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, G</xref></bold>), which plays key roles in different stages of translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], highlights the potential role of IBTK in modulating translation through eIF3 complex. Taken together, these findings provide a basis for comprehensive investigations into the precise roles of IBTK in controlling the efficiency and fidelity of protein synthesis.</p>
<p>Several quantitative phosphoproteomic studies have used mTOR inhibitors coupled with MS to demonstrate that mTOR modulates the phosphorylation of thousands of currently uncharacterized mTOR substrates, either directly or indirectly through its downstream kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. One such potential mTOR substrate is IBTK. We observed that seven mTOR-regulated Ser/Thr sites are clustered in a short region of IBTK and hyperphosphorylation of IBTK<sub>900-1150aa</sub> mutant was abolished when mTOR activity was inhibited. In particular, using <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays combined with MS, we have identified S999/S1004 as sites phosphorylated by mTOR, and S990/993 as sites phosphorylated by S6K1. However, the kinases responsible for the remaining three phosphorylation sites are still unidentified, necessitating further investigation. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which mTOR regulates IBTK phosphorylation and activity could offer insights into the broader functions of mTOR signaling in protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis.</p>

<p>This study reports a novel substrate and a mediator of oncogenesis downstream of mTORC1, a <bold>fundamental</bold> advance in our understanding of the mechanistic basis of mTORC1-regulated cap-dependent translation and protein synthesis. Using an array of biochemical, proteomic and functional assays, the authors provide <bold>compelling</bold> evidence for a novel mTORC1/S6K1-IBTK-eIF4A1 signaling axis that promotes cancer pathogenic translation. This work is of broad interest and significance, given the importance of aberrant protein synthesis in cancer.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors examined the role of IBTK, a substrate-binding adaptor of the CRL3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in modulating the activity of the eiF4F translation initiation complex. They find that IBTK mediates the non-degradative ubiquitination of eiF4A1, promotes cap-dependent translational initiation, nascent protein synthesis, oncogene expression, and tumor cell growth. Correspondingly, phosphorylation of  IBTK by mTORC1/ S6K1 increases eIF4A1 ubiquitination and sustains oncogenic translation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study utilizes multiple biochemical, proteomic, functional and cell biology assays to substantiate their results.  Importantly, the work nominates IBTK as a unique substrate of mTORC1, and further validates eiF4A1 ( a crucial subunit of the ei44F complex) as a promising therapeutic target in cancer. Since IBTK interacts broadly with multiple members of the translational initial complex- it will be interesting to examine its role in eiF2alpha-mediated ER stress as well as eiF3-mediated translation. Additionally, since IBTK exerts pro-survival effects in multiple cell types, it will be of relevance to characterize the role of IBTK in mediating increased mTORC1 mediated translation in other tumor types, thus potentially impacting their treatment with eiF4F inhibitors.</p>
<p>Limitations/Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The findings are mostly well supported by data, but some areas need clarification and could potentially be enhanced with further experiments:</p>
<p>(1) Since eiF4A1 appears to function downstream of IBTK1, can the effects of IBTK1 KO/KD in reducing puromycin incorporation ( in Fig 3A),  cap-dependent luciferase reporter activity (Fig 3G), reduced oncogene expression ( Fig 4A) or 2D growth/ invasion assays (Fig 4) be overcome or bypassed by overexpressing eiF4A1? These could potentially be tested in future studies.</p>
<p>
(2) The decrease in nascent protein synthesis in puromycin incorporation assays in Figure 3A suggests that the effects of IBTK KO are comparable to and additive with silvesterol. It would be of interest to examine whether silvesterol decreases nascent protein synthesis or increases stress granules in the IBTK KO cells stably expressing IBTK as well.</p>
<p>
(3) The data presented in Figure 5 regarding the role of mTORC1 in IBTK-mediated eiF4A1 ubiquitination needs further clarification on several points:</p>
<p>
- It is not clear if the experiments in Figure 5F with Phos-tag gels are using the FLAG-IBTK deletion mutant or the peptide containing the mTOR sites as it is mentioned on line 517, page 19 &quot;To do so, we generated an IBTK deletion mutant (900-1150 aa) spanning the potential mTORC1-regulated phosphorylation sites&quot; This needs further clarification.</p>
<p>
-It may be of benefit to repeat the Phos tag experiments with full length FLAG-IBTK and/or endogenous IBTK with molecular weight markers indicating size of migrated bands.</p>
<p>
-Additionally, torin or Lambda phosphatase treatment may be used to confirm the specificity of the band in separate experiments.</p>
<p>
-Phos-tag gels with the IBTK CRISPR KO line would also help confirm that the non-phosphorylated band is indeed IBTK.</p>
<p>
-It is unclear why the lower, phosphorylated bands seem to be increasing ( rather than decreasing) with AA starvation/ Rapa in Fig 5H.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Sun et al. identifies a novel role for IBTK in promoting cancer protein translation, through regulation of the translational helicase eIF4A1. Using a multifaceted approach, the authors demonstrate that IBTK interacts with and ubiquitinates eIF4A1 in a non-degradative manner, enhancing its activation downstream of mTORC1/S6K1 signaling. This represents a significant advance in elucidating the complex layers of dysregulated translational control in cancer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A major strength of this work is the convincing biochemical evidence for a direct regulatory relationship between IBTK and eIF4A1. The authors utilize affinity purification and proximity labeling methods to comprehensively map the IBTK interactome, identifying eIF4A1 as a top hit. Importantly, they validate this interaction and the specificity for eIF4A1 over other eIF4 isoforms by co-immunoprecipitation in multiple cell lines. Building on this, they demonstrate that IBTK catalyzes non-degradative ubiquitination of eIF4A1 both in cells and in vitro through the E3 ligase activity of the CRL3-IBTK complex. Mapping IBTK phosphorylation sites and showing mTORC1/S6K1-dependent regulation provides mechanistic insight. The reduction in global translation and eIF4A1-dependent oncoproteins upon IBTK loss, along with clinical data linking IBTK to poor prognosis, support the functional importance. Finally, the impact of IBTK on eIF4A1 target gene expression in colon and lung cancer cell lines, strengthens these findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the effects of IBTK knockout/over-expression on bulk protein synthesis are shown, the expression of several eIF4A1 target oncogenes remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Overall, this study significantly advances our understanding of how aberrant mTORC1/S6K1 signaling promotes cancer pathogenic translation via IBTK and eIF4A1. The proteomic, biochemical and phosphorylation mapping approaches established here provide a blueprint for interrogating IBTK function. These data should galvanize future efforts to target the mTORC1/S6K1-IBTK-eIF4A1 axis as an avenue for cancer therapy, particularly in combination with eIF4A inhibitors.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this study, the authors examined the role of IBTK, a substrate-binding adaptor of the CRL3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in modulating the activity of the eiF4F translation initiation complex. They find that IBTK mediates the non-degradative ubiquitination of eiF4A1, promotes cap-dependent translational initiation, nascent protein synthesis, oncogene expression, and tumor cell growth. Correspondingly, phosphorylation of IBTK by mTORC1/ S6K1 increases eIF4A1 ubiquitination and sustains oncogenic translation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study utilizes multiple biochemical, proteomic, functional, and cell biology assays to substantiate their results. Importantly, the work nominates IBTK as a unique substrate of mTORC1, and further validates eiF4A1 (a crucial subunit of the ei44F complex) as a promising therapeutic target in cancer. Since IBTK interacts broadly with multiple members of the translational initial complex - it will be interesting to examine its role in eiF2alpha-mediated ER stress as well as eiF3-mediated translation. Additionally, since IBTK exerts pro-survival effects in multiple cell types, it will be of relevance to characterize the role of IBTK in mediating increased mTORC1 mediated translation in other tumor types, thus potentially impacting their treatment with eiF4F inhibitors.</p>
<p>Limitations/Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The findings are mostly well supported by data, but some areas need clarification and could potentially be enhanced with further experiments:</p>
<p>(1)    Since eiF4A1 appears to function downstream of IBTK1, can the effects of IBTK1 KO/KD in reducing puromycin incorporation (in Fig 3A), cap-dependent luciferase reporter activity (Fig 3G), reduced oncogene expression (Fig 4A) or 2D growth/ invasion assays (Fig 4) be overcome or bypassed by overexpressing eiF4A1? These could potentially be tested in future studies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point. As per the reviewer's suggestion, we conducted experiments where we overexpressed Myc-eIF4A1 in IBTK-KO SiHa cells. Our findings indicate that increasing levels of eIF4A1 through ectopic overexpression is unable to reverse the decrease in puromycin incorporation (Fig. S3C) and protein expression of eIF4A1 targets caused by IBTK ablation (Fig. S4E). These results clearly demonstrate that IBTK ablation-induced eIF4A1 dysfunctions cannot be rescued by simply elevating eIF4A1 protein levels. Given the above results are negative, the impacts of eIF4A1 overexpression on the 2D growth/invasion capacities of IBTK-KO cells were not further examined. We sincerely appreciate the reviewer's understanding regarding this matter.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2)    The decrease in nascent protein synthesis in puromycin incorporation assays in Figure 3A suggest that the effects of IBTK KO are comparable to and additive with silvesterol. It would be of interest to examine whether silvesterol decreases nascent protein synthesis or increases stress granules in the IBTK KO cells stably expressing IBTK as well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point. We have showed that silvestrol treatment still decreased nascent protein synthesis in IBTK-KO cells overexpressing FLAG-IBTK as well (Fig. S3B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3)    The data presented in Figure 5 regarding the role of mTORC1 in IBTK- mediated eiF4A1 ubiquitination needs further clarification on several points:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>It is not clear if the experiments in Figure 5F with Phos-tag gels are using the FLAG-IBTK deletion mutant or the peptide containing the mTOR sites as it is mentioned on line 517, page 19 &quot;To do so, we generated an IBTK deletion mutant (900-1150 aa) spanning the potential mTORC1-regulated phosphorylation sites&quot; This needs further clarification.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point. The IBTK deletion mutant used in Fig. 5F is FLAG-IBTK900-1150aa. We have annotated it with smaller font size in the panel (red box) in Author response image 1.</p>

<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>It may be of benefit to repeat the Phos tag experiments with full-length FLAG- IBTK and/or endogenous IBTK with molecular weight markers indicating the size of migrated bands.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point. We attempted to perform Phos-tag assays to detect the overexpressed full-length FLAG-IBTK or endogenous IBTK. However, we encountered difficulties in successfully transferring the full-length FLAG-IBTK or endogenous IBTK onto the nitrocellulose membrane during Phos-tag WB analysis. This is likely due to the limitations of this technique. Based on our experience, phos-tag gel is less efficient in detecting protein motility shifts with large molecular weights. As the molecular weight of IBTK protein is approximately 160 kDa, it falls within this category. Considering these technical constraints, we did not include Phos-tag assay results for full-length IBTK in our study. We sincerely appreciate the reviewer's understanding regarding this matter.</p>
<p>The binding of Phos-tag to phosphorylated proteins induces a mobility shift during gel electrophoresis or protein separation techniques. This shift allows for the visualization and quantification of phosphorylated proteins separately from non-phosphorylated proteins. It's important to note that these mobility shifts indicate phosphorylation status, rather than actual molecular weights. pre- stained protein markers are typically used as a reference to assess the efficiency of protein transfer onto the membrane [Ref: 1]. Considering the aforementioned reasons, we did not add molecular weights to the WB images.</p>

<list-item><p>Additionally, torin or Lambda phosphatase treatment may be used to confirm the specificity of the band in separate experiments.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point. Torin1 is a synthetic mTOR inhibitor by preventing the binding of ATP to mTOR, leading to the inactivation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2, whereas rapamycin primarily targets mTORC1 activity and may inhibit mTORC2 in certain cell types after a prolonged treatment. We have identified that the predominant mediator of IBTK phosphorylation is the mTORC1/S6K1 complex. Therefore, in this context, we think that rapamycin is sufficient to inactivate the mTORC1/S6K1 pathway. As shown in Fig. 5F, the phosphorylated IBTK900-1150aa was markedly decreased while the non-phosphorylated form was simultaneously increased in rapamycin- treated cells. As per the reviewer's suggestion, we treated FLAG-IBTK900-1150aa overexpressed cells with lambda phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 5G, lambda phosphatase treatment completely abolished the mobility shifts of phosphorylated FLAG-IBTK900-1150aa. Additionally, the lowest band displayed an abundant accumulation of the non-phosphorylated form of FLAG-IBTK900-1150aa. These findings confirm that the mobility shifts observed in WB analysis correspond to the phosphorylated forms of FLAG-IBTK900-1150aa.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Phos-tag gels with the IBTK CRISPR KO line would also help confirm that the non-phosphorylated band is indeed IBTK.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point. As we state above, we performed Phos-tag assays to detect the mobility shifts of phosphorylated FLAG-IBTK900-1150aa. Anti-FLAG antibody, but not the anti-IBTK antibody was used for WB detection. This antibody does not exhibit cross-reactivity with endogenous IBTK.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>It is unclear why the lower, phosphorylated bands seem to be increasing (rather than decreasing) with AA starvation/ Rapa in Fig 5H.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point. We think the panel the reviewer mentioned is Fig. 5F. According to the principle of Phos-tag assays, proteins with higher phosphorylation levels have slower migration rates on SDS-PAGE, while proteins with lower phosphorylation levels have faster migration rates.</p>
<p>As shown in Author response image 2, the green box indicates the most phosphorylated forms of FLAG-IBTK900-1150aa, the red box indicates the moderately phosphorylated forms of FLAG-IBTK900-1150aa, and the yellow box indicates the non-phosphorylated forms of FLAG-IBTK900-1150aa. AA starvation or Rapamycin treatment reduced the hyperphosphorylated forms of FLAG-IBTK900-1150aa (green box), while simultaneously increasing the hypophosphorylated (red box) and non- phosphorylated (yellow box) forms of FLAG-IBTK900-1150aa. Thus, we conclude that AA starvation or Rapamycin treatment leads to a marked decrease in the phosphorylation levels of FLAG-IBTK900-1150aa.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1)    Certain references should be provided for clarity. For e.g.,: Page 15, line 418 &quot; The C-terminal glycine glycine (GG) amino acid residues are essential for Ub conjugation to targeted proteins&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point. We have taken two fundamental review papers (PMID: 22524316, 9759494) on the ubiquitin system as references in this sentence.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2)    Please describe the properties of the ΔBTB mutant on page 15 when first describing it. What motifs does it lack and has it been described before in functional studies?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point. We added a sentence to describe the properties of the ΔBTB mutant. This mutant lacks the BTB1 and BTB2 domains (deletion of aa 554–871), which have been previously demonstrated to be essential for binding to CUL3. The original reference has been added to the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3)    In Figure 2G how do the authors explain the fact that co-expression of the Ub K-ALLR mutant, which is unable to form polyubiquitin chains, formed only a moderate reduction in IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point. The Ub K-ALLR mutant can indeed conjugate to substrate proteins, but it cannot form chains due to its absence of lysine residues, resulting in mono-ubiquitination. Multi- mono-ubiquitination refers to the attachment of single ubiquitin molecules to multiple lysine residues on a substrate protein. It's worth noting that a poly- ubiquitinated protein and a multi-mono-ubiquitinated protein appear strikingly similar in Western blot. Our findings demonstrated that the co-expression of the Ub K-ALL-R mutant resulted in only a modest reduction in IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination (Fig. 2G), and that eIF4A1 was ubiquitinated at twelve lysine residues when co-expressed with IBTK (Fig. S2F). As such, we conclude that the CRL3IBTK complex primarily catalyzes multi-mono-ubiquitination on eIF4A1.

<p>(4)    In Figure 5, The identity of the seven sites in the IBTK 7ST A mutants should be specified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point. We have specified the seven mutation sites in the IBTK-7ST A mutant (Fig. 6A).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5)    In Figure 5, the rationale for generating antibodies only to S990/992/993, as opposed to the other mTORC1/S6K motifs should be specified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point. Upon demonstrating that IBTK can be phosphorylated—with evidence from positive Phos-tag and in vitro phosphorylation assays—we sought to directly detect changes in the phosphorylation levels using an antibody specific to IBTK phosphorylation. However, the expense of generating seven phosphorylation- specific antibodies for each site is significant. Recognizing that S990/992/993 are three adjacent sites, we deemed it appropriate to generate a single antibody to recognize the phospho-S990/992/993 epitope. Moreover, out of the seven phosphorylation sites, S992 perfectly matches the consensus motif for S6K1 phosphorylation (RXRXXS). Utilizing this antibody allowed us to observe a substantial decrease in the phosphorylation levels of these three adjacent Ser residues in IBTK following either AA deprivation or Rapamycin treatment (Fig. 5L). We have specified these points in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The following suggestions would strengthen the study:</p>
<p>(1)    Directly examine the effects of IBTK modulation (knockdown/knockout/ overexpression) on eIF4A1 helicase activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point. We agree with the reviewer's suggestion that evaluating IBTK's influence on eIF4A1 helicase activity directly would enhance the strength of our conclusion. However, the current eIF4A1 helicase assays, as described in previous publications [Ref: 1, 2], can only be conducted using in vitro purified recombinant proteins. For instance, it is feasible to assess the varying levels of helicase activity exhibited by recombinant wild-type or mutant EIF4A1 proteins [Ref: 2]. Importantly, there is currently no reported methodology for evaluating the helicase activity of EIF4A1 in vivo, as mentioned by the reviewer in gene knockdown, knockout, or overexpression cellular contexts. Therefore, we have not performed these assays and we sincerely appreciate the reviewer's understanding in this regard. We sincerely appreciate the reviewer's understanding regarding this matter.</p>

<p>(2)    Justify why the expression of some but not all eIF4A1 target oncogenes is affected in IBTK-depleted/overexpressing cells. This is important if IBTK should be considered as a therapeutic target. The authors should consider which of the eIF4A1 targets are most impacted by IBTK KO. This would provide a more focused therapeutic approach in the future.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point. As the reviewer has pointed out, we assessed the protein levels of ten reported eIF4A1 target genes across three cancer cell lines (Fig.4, Fig. S4A, C）. We observed that IBTK depletion led to a substantial reduction in the protein levels of most eIF4A1- regulated oncogenes upon IBTK depletion, although there were some exceptions. For instance, IBTK KO in H1299 cells exerted minimal influence on the protein levels of ROCK1 (Fig. S4A). Several possible explanations might account for this observation: firstly, given that our list of eIF4A1 target genes collected from previous studies conducted using distinct cell lines, it is not unexpected for different lines to exhibit subtle differences in regulation of eIF4A1 target genes. Secondly, as a CRL3 adaptor, IBTK potentially performs other biological functions via ubiquitination of specific substrates; dysregulation of these could buffer the impact of IBTK KO on the protein expression of some eIF4A1 target genes. We added these comments to the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3)    Expand mTOR manipulation experiments (inhibition, Raptor knockout, activation) and evaluate impacts on IBTK phosphorylation, eIF4A1 ubiquitination, and translation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The mTORC1 signaling pathway is constitutively active under normal culture conditions. In order to inhibit mTORC1 activation, we employed several approaches including AA starvation, Rapamycin treatment, or Raptor knockout. Our results have demonstrated that both AA starvation and rapamycin treatment led to a reduction in eIF4A1 ubiquitination (Fig. 5M). Moreover, we have included new findings in the revised manuscript, which highlight that Raptor knockout specifically decreases eIF4A1 ubiquitination (Fig. 5N). It is worth mentioning that the impacts of mTOR inhibition or activation on protein translation have been extensively investigated and documented in numerous studies. Therefore, in our study, we did not feel it necessary to examine these treatments further.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4)    Although not absolutely necessary, it would be nice to see if some of these findings are true in other cancer cell types.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point. We concur with the reviewer's suggestion that including data from other cancer cell types would enhance the strength of our conclusion. While the majority of our data is derived from two cervical cancer cell lines, we have corroborated certain key findings— such as the impact of IBTK on eIF4A1 and its target gene expression—in H1299 cells (human lung cancer) (Fig. 2C, Fig. S4A, B) and in CT26 cells (murine colon adenocarcinoma) (Fig. S4C, D). Additionally, we demonstrated that IBTK promotes IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression and tumor immune escape in both the H1299 and CT26 cells (Fig. S6A-K).</p>
