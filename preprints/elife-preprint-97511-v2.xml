<title>Abstract</title><p>Protein N<sup>Ɛ</sup>-lysine acetylation (Kac) modifications play crucial roles in diverse physiological and pathological functions in cells. In prokaryotic cells, there are only two types of lysine deacetylases (KDACs) that are Zn<sup>2+</sup>- or NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent. In this study, we reported a protein, AhCobQ, in <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> ATCC 7966 that presents NAD<sup>+</sup>- and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-independent KDAC activity. Furthermore, its KDAC activity is located in an unidentified domain (from 195–245 aa). Interestingly, AhCobQ has no homology with current known KDACs, and no homologous protein was found in eukaryotic cells. A protein substrate analysis showed that AhCobQ has specific protein substrates in common with other known KDACs, indicating that these KDACs can dynamically co- regulate the states of Kac proteins. Microbiological methods employed in this study affirmed AhCobQ’s positive regulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD) enzymatic activity at the K388 site, implicating AhCobQ in the modulation of bacterial enzymatic activities. In summary, our findings present compelling evidence that AhCobQ represents a distinctive type of KDAC with significant roles in bacterial biological functions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, due to the development of specific antibody enrichment technologies and high-resolution mass spectrometry, the research on protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) is increasing dramatically, and it provides a new platform for the study of bacterial function and regulation. PTMs refer to small molecular moieties that dynamically affect the structure and function of proteins through chemical modification of specific amino acid residues, so as to regulate many important biological processes, including cell metabolism, DNA transcription and replication, host infection, and stress resistance, and therefore play an important role in almost all physiological functions (Carabetta et al, 2007). Among them, the N<sup>Ɛ</sup>-lysine acetylation (Kac) modification on protein is widely found in bacteria and participates in almost all key biological processes in bacterial life activities and is attracting the attention of microbiologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yu et al, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there are many reports on the identification of acetylation modification patterns of bacterial protein lysine residues in recent years, two fundamental questions have not been solved: how do these acetylation modifications arise (acetylation modifiers; writers) and how are they removed (deacetylation modifiers; erasers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang et al, 2020</xref>). On the one hand, acetyl groups can be transferred to the target protein by acetyltransferases or non-enzymatic (chemical) mechanisms (VanDrisse &amp; Escalante- Semerena, 2019); on the other hand, proteins need to remove acetyl groups from modified proteins to reversibly regulate the function of target proteins. At present, the research on the functions and types of lysine deacetylases (KDACs) has been well documented in eukaryotes, and most of them are histone deacetylases (HDACs). There are currently at least 18 types of HDACs in four classes (I–IV) in mammals and four plant-specific histone deacetylase 2 (HD2) members in plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yoshida et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al, 2020</xref>). Of these, HDAC types I, II, and IV are Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, while type III deacetylases are NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent sirtuins. Moreover, sirtuins can be divided into seven types (SIRT 1–7), which are distributed in different compartments of eukaryotic cells and perform important biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Narita et al, 2019</xref>). Beside these, ABHD14B, a novel KDAC, was reported to deacetylate non-histone substrates and influences glucose metabolism in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Rajendran et al, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Rajendran et al, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The currently known KDACs in bacteria include Zn<sup>2 +</sup>-dependent RpLdaA or Kdac1 (homologous to eukaryotic type II KDACs), Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent AcuC (homologous to type I), and NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent sirtuin (homologous to type III) family proteins (Watson et al, 2023). Sirtuins, represented by <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> CobB, are the most widely distributed KDACs in many bacterial species and are involved in the regulation of a variety of important physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Burckhardt et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Liu et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang et al, 2020</xref>). However, since the first report of the deacetylase function of CobB in <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> in 1998, only two types (three classes) of KDACs have been confirmed in bacteria (Tsang &amp; Escalante-Semerena, 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Macek et al, 2019</xref>). The reasons that hinder new KDAC discovery in bacteria may be the following: (1) due to the in-depth study of KDACs in eukaryotes, almost all the current research on bacterial deacetylases are based on the characteristics of their homologous proteins in eukaryotes, but less attention is paid to bacteria-specific KDACs; and (2) the deacetylation process between protein substrates and KDACs may be a transient and reversible weak interaction. Moreover, there are thousands of lysine acetylation modification sites in cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al, 2022</xref>); so, it is difficult to speculate the characteristics of their specific binding deacetylase, which makes the efficiency of enriching specific KDACs by common protein-protein interaction methods, such as co- immunoprecipitation and pull-down technologies, challenging. As a result, the identification and mechanism of new deacetylases in prokaryotic cells are lagging. Therefore, the screening and identification of new deacetylases, especially for new types of KDACs that may not depend on NAD<sup>+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup>, have been a bottleneck limiting the research on the regulatory mechanisms of bacterial acetylation/deacetylation modifications.</p>
<p>In this study, we fortuitously identified the protein AhCobQ in <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> ATCC 7966 (UniProt ID A0KI27, gene ID <italic>AHA_1389</italic>) that presents NAD<sup>+</sup>- and Zn<sup>2+</sup>- independent protein lysine deacetylase activity. Interestingly, although this protein is described as a CobQ/CobB/MinD/ParA family protein in the UniProt database, it is homologous with cobyric acid synthase in other bacterial species but shares no homology with CobB sirtuin family proteins. In addition to deacetylating lysine acetylated sites common to AhCobB (UniProt ID A0KKN9, gene ID <italic>AHA_2317</italic>) sirtuin and another deacetylase AhAcuC (UniProt ID A0KLZ2, gene ID <italic>AHA_2788</italic>) in <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>, we also confirmed that AhCobQ deacetylated specific lysine acetylated sites as did other KDACs, even in the same protein. In general, our results demonstrated a new type of bacterial KDAC, which shares no homology with currently known lysine deacetylases, including those in eukaryotic cells, and extends our understanding of the complicated regulatory mechanism of bacterial lysine acetylation modifications.</p>

<title>The physiological phenotypes of AhCobQ are different from those of AhCobB</title>
<p>This project proceeded from the misunderstanding that AhCobQ and AhCobB may be homologous proteins because AhCobQ is annotated as a CobQ/CobB/MinD/ParA family protein in the UniProt database. Therefore, we constructed <italic>ahcobB</italic> and <italic>ahcobQ</italic> mutant strains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and compared their general physiological phenotypes. When compared to the wild-type strain (WT), the deletion of <italic>ahcobB</italic> did not affect thehemolytic or swarming ability of <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>. Notably, <italic>ΔahcobQ</italic> did not affect the hemolytic ability either but significantly increased the swarming ability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref><bold>, C and Figure S1</bold>). Most interestingly, <italic>ΔahcobB</italic> sharply increased, while <italic>ΔahcobQ</italic> significantly decreased, the bacterial biofilm formation ability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). These results indicated that CobB and CobQ in <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> may play different roles in biological functions.</p>

<title>AhCobQ and AhCobB are not homologous proteins</title>
<p>We then further investigated the evolutionary relationship between AhCobQ and AhCobB. To our surprise, we found that the proteins belong to different protein families. AhCobB (UniProt ID A0KKN9) belongs to a well-known NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacylase sirtuin family and shares a highly homologous SIR2 domain with CobB sirtuins in many bacterial species, such as <italic>E. coli</italic> (NPD_ECOLI), <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> (NPD_SALTY), <italic>Pseudomonas nitroreducens</italic> (A0A246F352_9PSED), and even seven types of sirtuins in humans (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). However, AhCobQ (UniProt ID A0KI27) shares an AAA_31 ATPase domain with several homologous proteins, such as cobalamin biosynthesis protein CobQ in <italic>P. nitroreducens</italic> (A0A246FC44_9PSED), probable plasmid partitioning protein in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (G3XCW7_PSEAE), and chromosome partitioning ATPase in <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> (A0A0F6B556_SALT1). Moreover, AhCobQ also shares homology with Soj protein (A0KQY7_AERHH) and cell division inhibitor MinD (A0KK56_AERHH) in <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> as well (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref><bold> and Figure S2</bold>). Interestingly, this protein was not found to have homologous proteins in humans or mice species, indicating the significant evolutionary difference between AhCobQ and sirtuins.</p>

<title>AhCobQ is an NAD- and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-independent lysine deacetylase</title>
<p>Dot blot and western blot experiments showed that the deletion of <italic>ahcobQ</italic> or <italic>ahcobB</italic> both significantly increased the whole protein lysine acetylation levels in <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C and D</xref>), which aroused our interest as to whether AhCobQ is a lysine deacetylase or not. To test this possibility, we purified AhCobQ, AhAcuC, and AhCobB proteins and incubated them <italic>in vitro</italic> with lysine acetylated-bovine serum albumin (Kac- BSA) as a protein substrate with and without NAD<sup>+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup> treatment (<bold>Figure S3 and S4</bold>). As a positive control, AhCobB and AhAcuC significantly deacetylated Kac-BSA in the presence of NAD+ or Zn2+ buffer, which met our expectation. However, AhCobQ clearly deacetylated Kac-BSA regardless of whether NAD<sup>+</sup> or Zn2<sup>+</sup> were present (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E and G</xref>). Moreover, the KDAC activity of AhCobB was inhibited when the sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM) was added, but this did not affect the deacetylase activity of AhCobQ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Furthermore, the introduction of the metal ion chelator, EDTA, had no discernible effect on the deacetylase activity of AhCobQ (<bold>Figure S5</bold>). These results strongly indicate that AhCobQ is an NAD<sup>+</sup>- and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-independent protein deacetylase. Additionally, since AhCobQ has an ATPase domain at the N-terminal, we also tested its deacetylase activity with or without ATP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref><bold> and Figure S6</bold>). The results demonstrated that the KDAC activity of AhCobQ was ATP-independent, suggesting its enzymatic activity was downstream of the ATPase domain.</p>
<p>We further digested Kac-BSA to peptides after AhCobQ incubation and then subjected the peptides to LC MS/MS to identify their acetylated sites (<bold>Table S1</bold>). The results showed that the MS intensities of at least 15 Kac peptides in BSA were significantly decreased after AhCobQ treatment. To further validate the KDAC characteristics of AhCobQ and exclude the possibility that AhCobQ may hydrolyze Kac peptides or switch the lysine acetylation to other unknown PTMs, we selected and synthetized an acetylated peptide sequence (YNGVFQECCQAEDK<sup>ac</sup>GACLLPK) with its unacetylated peptide as negative control and subjected them to additional deacetylation assays. The synthetized acetylated (STD*<sup>Kac</sup>) and deacetylated (STD) peptides were incubated with AhCobB and AhCobQ and then identified by LC MS/MS. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, the masses of the STD*<sup>Kac</sup> and STD peptides were 786.35538 (3+) and 772.35175 (3+), respectively. When the STD*<sup>Kac</sup> peptide was incubated with AhCobB or AhCobQ, the corresponding retention time in the C18 chromatography and the MS1 peak of the deacetylated peptide were found in both treatments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Moreover, the deacetylated and acetylated peptides were further validated in MS2 by LC MS/MS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C and D</xref>).

<title>The deacetylase activity of AhCobQ is in an unidentified domain</title>
<p>Because AhCobQ has a conservative N-terminal AAA family ATPase domain (1–179 aa) and its KDAC activity was not affected by ATP, we then asked whether this domain has deacetylase activity. We divided and purified recombinant AhCobQ protein into two truncated protein fragments of 1–179 aa and 179–264 aa and then tested their deacetylase activities. To our surprise, the 179-264 aa protein fragment but not the 1- 179 aa fragment showed NAD<sup>+</sup>- and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-independent deacetylase activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). To better understand the deacetylase domain of AhCobQ, a total of 12 truncated protein fragments were constructed and purified, and their deacetylase activities were evaluated (<bold>Figures S7 and 4A</bold>). As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, the 1–179 aa, 200–255 aa, and 189–240 aa shortened proteins disrupted the deacetylase activity of AhCobQ to some extent, whereas the 179–264 aa, 189–264 aa, 199–264 aa, 195–264 aa, 195– 255 aa, 189–245 aa, 189–250 aa, 189–255 aa, and 189–264 aa shortened proteins did not, indicating that the deacetylase activity may be in the 195–245 aa range. Interestingly, although the full amino acid sequence of AhCobQ (1–254 aa) is homologous with Soj protein (A0KQYT), site-determining protein (A0KI19 and A0KK56), and ParA family protein (A0KQG8) in <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>, the KDAC activity domain (195–245 aa) does not share homology with these proteins, which suggests the different biological roles among them. Moreover, AhCobQ (195–245 aa) also shares homology with several prokaryotic species, such as <italic>Aeromonas sp., Aliivibrio sp., Enterovibri sp., Oceanimonas sp., Photobacterium sp.,</italic> and <italic>Vibrio sp</italic>., most of which are marine prokaryotes based on a PSI-BLAST program searching, but the search failed to find homologous proteins in eukaryotic cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).

<title>Validation of the specificity of Kac proteins and sites by deacetylases</title>
<p>We further validated the specificity of Kac proteins and the sites regulated by these deacetylases. A total of 11 target proteins (HrpA, SUN, ENO, ArcA, ADK, IscS, A0KJ75, GyrB, FtsA, RecA, and ICD) were selected for validation due to their significantly upregulated Kac levels in the <italic>ΔahcobQ</italic> strain, potentially indicating their roles as substrates for AhCobQ. These proteins were first cloned and purified in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The anti-Kac western blot showed that these purified proteins did not have lysine acetylation signals, which may be because of the heterologous expression in an engineered bacterial strain. This was ideal for excluding signal interference from the background (<bold>Figure S11</bold>). Next, site-specific lysine acetylation of the target protein substrates was constructed using a two-plasmid-based system of genetically encoded N<sup>Ɛ</sup>-acetyllysine, which was purified and incubated with AhCobQ, AhCobB, and AhAcuC for western blot analysis against anti-lysine acetylation antibodies (<bold>Figure S12</bold>). As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>, when compared to untreated Kac proteins, the acetylation level of four Kac sites (K816 in HrpA, K103 and K148 in SUN, K195 in ENO) that were uniquely regulated by AhCobQ according to quantitative acetylome analysis was significantly reduced after incubation with AhcobQ but unchanged after incubation with AhCobB or AhAcuC. Moreover, K26 in ArcA-2 and K48 in ADK were reduced in both AhCobB and AhCobQ incubations, and K93 in IscS and K81 in A0KJ75 were decreased with all three deacetylases (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). These results were consistent with our quantitative acetylome results, except for K34 in GlmM, which was decreased in AhCobB and AhCobQ treatments in the western blotting assay but upregulated by all three deacetylase mutants according to the proteomics data (<bold>Figure S13</bold>). Intriguingly, several proteins that contained multiple Kac sites were found to be regulated by different deacetylases. For example, K331 and K449 in GyrB were deacetylated by AhCobQ and AhCobB, respectively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). The same results were found in K320 and K409 in FtsA and in K279 and K306 in RecA as well. These results indicate the different regulatory mechanisms among these KDACs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Lysine acetylation has been confirmed to play crucial roles in almost all essential biological functions in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Normally, reversibility and dynamicity are necessary characteristics of lysine acetylation. The regulatory mechanism of deacetylation has received as much attention as that of acetylation. In different bacterial species, there are hundreds to thousands of protein lysine acetylation modification sites, which are theoretically unlikely to be regulated by one or a few deacetylases, and there must be some unknown deacetylases in bacteria that act on specific protein substrates to maintain the normal physiological function of cells. Therefore, finding new bacterial deacetylases and identifying their modified protein substrates, so as to better understand the molecular mechanism of their regulation, are important in the research on protein acetylation modification regulation.</p>
<p>Here, we reported that CobQ protein in <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> is an NAD<sup>+</sup>- and Zn<sup>2+</sup>- independent deacetylase, and it is very different from currently known deacetylases. We were first interested in the function of AhCobQ based on its annotation as a CobQ/CobB/MinD/ParA family protein in the UniProt database. The deacetylation assay suggested that AhCobQ deacetylated Kac-BSA in the same manner as AhCobB. To our surprise, AhCobQ does not share homology with any prokaryotic sirtuin CobB or currently known eukaryotic deacetylases. We then asked why this was the case since both proteins appeared to belong to the same protein family. Actually, CobB has a conflicting naming phenomenon in the UniProt annotation. There are two distinct CobB annotations in the UniProt database: one is the well-known NAD-dependent protein deacylase, such as NPD_ECOLI in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the other is the ATP-dependent a,c-diamide synthase, such as CobB_SINSX <italic>in Sinorhizobium sp.</italic> that plays an important role in cobalamin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Galperin &amp; Grishin, 2000</xref>). In some bacterial species, a,c-diamide synthase is also annotated as CbiA (such as CBIA_SALTY, for example), indicating the controversial assignment of CobB. Interestingly, there is not an a,c-diamide synthase homologous protein in <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> ATCC 7966, and the CobB annotation in <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> ATCC 7966 is specific for NAD-dependent protein deacylase. In general, the CobQ protein is annotated as cobyric acid synthase and belongs to a,c-diamide synthase (CobB or CbiA) but not the sirtuin protein (CobB) family. The role of AhCobQ is unknown to date because <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> may import rather than synthesize cobalamin (vitamin B12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Seshadri et al, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The LC MS/MS analysis of synthesized Kac peptides treated by AhCobQ further validated that this protein is a deacetylase and excluded the possibility of it being a hydrolase. Surprisingly, the enzymatic activity of AhCobB was not affected by NAD<sup>+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, or the sirtuin inhibitor NAM. Given that AhCobQ was reported to be an ATP- dependent cobyric acid synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Galperin &amp; Grishin, 2000</xref>), we also tested the effect of ATP on deacetylase activity but obtained negative results. Thus, the deacetylase activity of AhCobQ was determined to be NAD<sup>+</sup>-, Zn<sup>2+</sup>-, and ATP-independent. Subsequent assays showed that the deacetylase activity of AhCobQ was mediated by an unknown C-terminal domain in the 195–245 aa range that was downstream of the predicted ATPase domain, suggesting a new domain was responsible for deacetylation. However, the intrinsic enzymatic mechanism needs to be further investigated.</p>
<p>We then further asked whether the protein substrates of AhCobQ were the same as the unknown bacterial KDAC homologs in <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>, AhCobB, and AhAcuC. Although the CobB substrates were identified in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the AcuC substrates and their comparison with the CobB substrates at a high throughput level had not been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kuhn et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Weinert et al, 2017</xref>). The characteristics of Kac sites regulated by CobB and AcuC are not yet known. Here, we compared the differential expression of Kac proteins and sites among <italic>ahcobQ</italic>, <italic>ahcobB</italic>, and <italic>ahacuC</italic> mutant and wild-type strains using a quantitative proteomics method. We only focused on the high abundance Kac proteins or sites (fold change &gt; 1.5) when comparing the mutant and WT strains. The results showed that 9.9% of the acetylated proteins (312/3164 Kac protein) were regulated by <italic>ahcobB</italic>, which is consistent with the proportion in the <italic>E.coli cobB</italic> mutant and the previous conclusion that CobB is the predominate deacetylase in some bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Weinert et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">AbouElfetouh et al, 2015</xref>). We also found 47 and 186 significantly enriched Kac proteins in <italic>ΔahcobQ</italic> and <italic>ΔahacuC</italic>, respectively.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there were unique and overlapping Kac substrates among three KDACs, indicating that these KDACs may construct a complicated network for co-regulation of acetylation proteins. Furthermore, although the enriched GO terms and related substrates were different, all the KDACs appeared to be involved in metabolic pathways.</p>
<p>To further validate our proteomics results, plasmid-based site-specific acetylation was introduced as a target of the recombinant proteins, and the deacetylase activity of the KDACs was determined <italic>in vitro</italic>. The behavior of the three KDACs on a total of 14 target site-specific acetylated proteins was consistent with our proteomics results, with the results exceeding our expectations. AhCobQ regulated certain proteins at specific Kac sites, which implied that it is involved in specific biological functions. Moreover, it also co-regulated the same Kac sites as did one or all the other KDACs, indicating that the cooperation of these KDACs may play an important role during the maintenance of cellular acetylation homeostasis. Most importantly, our results also showed that AhCobQ deacetylated different Kac sites on the same protein as AhCobB or AhAcuC.</p>
<p>For example, the bacterial topoisomerases DNA gyrase GyrB is an essential enzyme that controls the topological state of DNA during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Tari et al, 2013</xref>). Previous studies reported the important role of GyrB in bacterial fluoroquinolone resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chauffour et al, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Li et al, 2022</xref>). The 3D structure prediction showed that GyrB K331 is located in the ATPase domain that is responsible for supercoiling DNA, whereas K449 is located in the Toprim domain that is required for the interaction with GyrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Brino et al, 2000</xref>). Our current data showed that K331 and K449 were deacetylated by AhCobQ and AhCobB, respectively, indicating the delicate regulatory mechanisms in both functional domains. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that different KDACs regulate the Kac level at specific sites of the same protein and that they may be involved in differential biological functions in prokaryotic cells. To our knowledge, it is the first evidence that different KADCs regulates the Kac level at specific-site of one protein and that may involve in differential biological functions in prokaryotic cell. We then further wondered the role of AhCobQ in bacterial biological functions. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD) is a key enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway, and also affects bacterial biofilm formation and virulence in several species. Diverse Kac sites of bacterial ICD have been well identified. In <italic>E. coli</italic> K12, there are at least 15 Kac sites on ICD, and the Kac at K55 and K350 have been determined to play crucial roles on the enzymatic activity by a positively regulatory manner, while Kac at K100, K230 and K235 in a negatively regulatory manner . However, only four Kac sites including K55, K142, K177 and K350 have been proved to be deacetylated by CobB sirtuin obviously. In our quantitative MS data, there are at least ten Kac sites in ICD protein, while only the Kac level of ICD K388 was AhCobQ regulated and others were not altered in KADCs deleted strains. The following assay confirmed that the enzymatic activity of ICD was negatively regulated in a dose- dependent manner by deaectylated ICD K388 site by AhCobQ, whereas not affected by AhCobB and AhAcuC. These results indicate the important role of AhCobQ in bacterial metabolic regulation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, here, we identified a novel NAD<sup>+</sup>- and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-independent deacetylase, AhCobQ, in prokaryotic cells, which does not share homology with current known deacetylases and is unique in prokaryotes. The deacetylase activity of this KDAC is through an unknown domain. Moreover, AhCobQ acetylates at least 47 protein substrates involved in many biological processes, especially metabolic pathways. We provide evidences that AhCobQ negatively regulates the enzymatic activity of bacterial isocitrate dehydrogenase at K388 site. These results indicate that AhCobQ has an important regulatory role in bacterial metabolic pathways. AhCobQ is a novel deacetylase in prokaryotic cells and its biological functions need to be further investigated.</p>

<title>Quantitative acetylome analysis</title>
<p>The quantitative acetylome was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhang et al, 2022</xref>). Briefly, the protein samples from bacteria cultured overnight were collected by centrifugation and then sonicated in an ice bath. A 10 mg protein sample was reduced by 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), alkylated by 20 mM iodoacetamide (IAA), and then digested to peptides by trypsin at a 1:50 ratio at 37°C for 16 h. The lysine acetylation peptides were enriched by an immuno-affinity enrichment method using an agarose- conjugated anti-lysine-acetylated antibody (Hangzhou Jingjie, PTM 101).</p>

<p>For BSA acetylation identification, the digested peptides were analyzed on an Orbitrap Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an EASY- nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptides were first loaded into a C18 trap column (1.9 μm, 100 μm, 20 mm) and separated on an EASY-nLC 1200 UPLC system. The precursor ions were selected for fragmentation in the higher energy collision-activated dissociation (HCD) cell at a normalized collision energy of 27% and then detected using the Orbitrap analyzer at a resolution of 15,000 at m/z 200.</p>
<p>The synthetic peptides YNGVFQECCQAEDKGACLLPK (STD) and YNGVFQECCQA EDK<sup>ac</sup>GACLLPK (STD<sup>*Kac</sup>) were analyzed using an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the quantitative acetylome, the enriched peptides were analyzed using an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer equipped with a high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility (FAIMS) Pro spectrometer and an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>
<p>The data obtained were compared and annotated with the BSA (UniProt ID P02769) or <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> ATCC 7966 database from the UniProt database using MaxQuant v1.6.2.10 software. The mass error of the search was set to 10 ppm, the main search was set to 5 ppm, the fragment ion was set to 0.02 Da, and the variable modification was acetylation modification. The maximum false discovery rate (FDR) threshold for proteins, peptides, and modification sites was set at 1%. In addition, the localization probability threshold was specified as &gt;0.75, and the modification site score threshold was set to 40. The precursor area for quantification of synthetic peptides YNGVFQECCQAEDKGACLLPK (STD) and YNGVFQECCQAEDK<sup>ac</sup>GACLLPK (STD<sup>*Kac</sup>) was manually exacted with Thermo Xcalibur (v.3.0.63). When performing a label-free quantitative (LFQ) comparison, in addition to the above settings, label-free quantification was also set to LFQ, and the intensity signal ratio of the corresponding modified peptides in the identification results (ratio) was &gt;1.5. P&lt;0.05 (Student’s <italic>t</italic> test) among the three biological replicates in each group was considered a significant difference.</p>

<title>Western blot</title>
<p>The protein samples (0.2 µg) were separated on a 12% sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes using a semi-dry transfer system (Bio-Rad, USA) at 25 V for 20 min. The membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% skim milk for 1 h and incubated with the diluted primary antibody (PTM-101 1:1,000) for 5 h at room temperature. After washing three times with TBST, the membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000), at room temperature for 1 h. Finally, the membranes were covered with Clarity western ECL (Bio-Rad) chromogenic solution and exposed with a ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The exposed PVDF membranes were stained with Coomassie R-350 to verify whether the loading amounts were consistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Peng et al, 2019</xref>).</p>

<title>Dot blot</title>
<p>10 μg protein was diluted and spotted on the PVDF membrane. Once the samples had air-dried, the membranes underwent a blocking process with Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% BSA for a duration of 3 to 5 hours. Following this, they were incubated with the PTM-101 antibody at a 1:1000 dilution for 5 hours.</p>
<p>Afterward, the membranes were washed three times in TBST, then incubated with a secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse HRP-IgG, at a 1:5000 dilution and containing 3% BSA, for one hour at room temperature. This was followed by five washes in TBST, each lasting 5 minutes. To conclude the process, the membrane was treated with Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad) chromogenic solution, exposed using a ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and finally stained with Coomassie R-350 to ensure consistent sample loading.</p>

<title>Recombinant protein production and purification</title>
<p>The target genes were amplified and ligated to the digested pET-21b/32a plasmid using the restriction sites <italic>EcoRI</italic> and <italic>HindIII</italic>. Then, the recombinant plasmid was transformed into competent <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3), and the positive clones were selected from an agar plate with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. For the construction of site-directed mutant strains, the target gene was mutated using a Fast Mutagenesis System kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Transgen Biotech Co., Beijing, China). All primer pairs used in this study are listed in <bold>Table S6</bold>.</p>
<p>The successfully constructed recombinant strains were transferred to 200 mL of LB medium containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin, and then, 200 μL of 1 M isopropyl β-D-1- thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added until the OD at 600 nm reached about 0.6. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and dissolving in 10 mL of a solution (5 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM NaCl, 0.05M Tris-HCl pH=8.0), the bacterial cells were ultrasonically disrupted for 20 min on ice. The supernatant was collected by centrifuging at 10,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 min, and the recombinant proteins were purified using an Ni<sup>+</sup>-NTA column as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Jiang et al, 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Expression and purification of site-specific Kac proteins</title>
<p>We used two genetic code expansion systems in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 to express site-specific acetylated proteins (Vidali G et al, 1968 Bryson et al, 2017). First, the target gene was inserted into the pET-21b plasmid as described above, and the lysine codon at the target position of the gene was substituted with an amber stop (TAG) codon by site- directed mutagenesis. Then, equal amounts of pTECH-MbAcK3RS (IPYE) and recombinant pET-21b plasmid were co-transfected into competent <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) on agar plates containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 30 μg/mL chloramphenicol. After culturing for 5 h at 37°C and 200 rpm, the successful PCR products were confirmed with DNA sequencing.</p>
<p>The successfully site-specific acetylated mutants were cultured overnight in 5 mL of LB medium and then transferred to 200 mL of fresh LB medium containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 30 μg/mL chloramphenicol and incubated at 200 rpm and 37°C. To express the acetyl proteins, 2 mM N-acetyllysine and 20 mM NAM were added to the medium at 37°C and vortexed at 200 rpm until the OD at 600 nm reached about 0.8. Then, 200 μL of 1M IPTG was added to the medium, and the cells were cultured at 16°C and vortexed at 200 rpm for 18 h to express the proteins. The procedure of site-specific Kac protein purification was the same as the method described above.</p>

<p>In recent years, lots of researchers tried to explore the existence of new acetyltransferase and deacetylase by using specific antibody enrichment technologies and high resolution mass spectrometry. Here is an example for this effort. Yuqian Wang et al. studied a novel Zn2+- and NAD+-independent KDAC protein, AhCobQ, in Aeromonas hydrophila. They studied the biological function of AhCobQ by using biochemistry method and MS identification technology to confirm it. These results extended our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of bacterial lysine acetylation modifications. However, I find this conclusion is a little speculative, and unfortunately, it also doesn't totally support the conclusion as the authors provided.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study reports on a novel NAD+ and Zn2+-independent protein lysine deacetylase (KDAC) in Aeromonas hydrophila, termed as AhCobQ (AHA_1389). This protein is annotated as a CobQ/CobB/MinD/ParA family protein and does not show similarity with known NAD+-dependent or Zn2+-dependent KDACs. The authors showed that AhCobQ has NAD+ and Zn2+-independent deacetylase activity with acetylated BSA by western blot and MS analyses. They also provided evidence that the 195-245 aa region of AhCobQ is responsible for the deacetylase activity, which is conserved in some marine prokaryotes and has no similarity with eukaryotic proteins. They identified target proteins of AhCobQ deacetylase by proteomic analysis and verified the deacetylase activity using site-specific Kac proteins. Finally, they showed that AhCobQ activates isocitrate dehydrogenase by deacetylation at K388.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The finding of a new type of KDAC has a valuable impact on the field of protein acetylation. The characters (NAD+ and Zn2+-independent deacetylase activity in an unknown domain) shown in this study are very unexpected.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The characters (NAD+ and Zn2+-independent deacetylase activity in an unknown domain) shown in this study are very unexpected. To convince readers, MSMS data must be necessary to accurately detect (de)acetylation at the target site in the deacetylase activity assay. The authors showed the MSMS data in assays with acetylated BSA, but other assays only rely on western blot.</p>
<p>(2) They prepared site-specific Kac proteins and used them in deacetylase activity assays. Incorporation of acetyllysine at the target site should be confirmed by MSMS and shown as supplementary data.</p>
<p>(3) The authors imply that the 195-245 aa region of AhCobQ may represent a new domain responsible for deacetylase activity. The feature of the region would be of interest but is not sufficiently described in Figure 5. The amino acid sequence alignments with representative proteins with conserved residues would be informative. It would be also informative if the modeled structure predicted by AlphaFold is shown and the structural similarity with known deacetylases is discussed.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In recent years, lots of researchers have tried to explore the existence of new acetyltransferase and deacetylase by using specific antibody enrichment technologies and high-resolution mass spectrometry. This study adds to this effort. The authors studied a novel Zn2+- and NAD+-independent KDAC protein, AhCobQ, in Aeromonas hydrophila. They studied the biological function of AhCobQ by using a biochemistry method and used MS identification technology to confirm it. The results extend our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of bacterial lysine acetylation modifications. However, I find their conclusion to be a little speculative, and unfortunately, it also doesn't totally support the conclusion that the authors provided. In addition, regarding the figure arrangement, lots of the supplementary figures are not mentioned, and tables are not all placed in context.</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>- In the opinion of this reviewer, is a little arbitrary to come to the title &quot;Aeromonas hydrophila CobQ is a new type of NAD+- and Zn2+-independent protein lysine deacetylase in prokaryotes.&quot; This should be modified to delete the &quot;in the prokaryotes&quot;, unless the authors get new or more evidence in the other prokaryotes for the existence of the AhCobQ.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestions. &quot; in the prokaryotes &quot; has been deleted in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- I was confused about the arrangement of the supplementary results. There are no citations for Figures S9-S19.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for your suggestion. We have made revisions and highlighted in the undated manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- No data are included for Tables S1-S6.;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Dear reviewer, sorry to confuse you. We have included the Supplementary Tables in the undated manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The load control is not all integrated. All of the load controls with whole PAGE gel or whole membrane western blot results should be provided. Without these whole results, it is not convincing to come to the conclusion that the authors have.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Dear reviewer, thanks for your suggestion. We have meticulously incorporated the complete PVDF membranes from our Western blot experiments into Supplementary Material 1. Furthermore, we have included the Coomassie Blue R-350 staining outcomes of these PVDF membranes, post-Western blot detection, as a loading control in accordance with the protocol outlined in the reference by Charlotte et al. (Journal of Proteome Research, 2011, 10:1416–1419).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The materials &amp; methods section should be thoroughly reviewed. It is unclear to me what exactly the authors are describing in the method. All the experimental designs and protocols should be described in detail, including growth conditions, assay conditions, purification conditions, etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Dear reviewer, thanks for your valuable comments. We have carefully reviewed the entire manuscript and made revisions, highlighted in red.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Relevant information should be included about the experiments performed in the figure legends, such as experimental conditions, replicates, etc. Often it is not clear what was done based on the figure legend description.</p>

They also provide evidence that the 195-245 aa region of AhCobQ is responsible for the deacetylase activity, which is conserved in some marine prokaryotes and has no similarity with eukaryotic proteins. They identified target proteins of AhCobQ deacetylase by proteomic analysis and verified the deacetylase activity using site-specific acetyllysine-incorporated target proteins. Finally, they show that AhCobQ activates isocitrate dehydrogenase by deacetylation at K388.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The finding of a new type of KDAC has a valuable impact on the field of protein acetylation. The characters (NAD+ and Zn2+-independent deacetylase activity in an unknown domain) shown in this study are very unexpected.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) As the characters of AhCobQ are very unexpected, to convince readers, MSMS data would be needed to exactly detect deacetylation at the target site in deacetylase activity assays. The authors show the MSMS data in assays with acetylated BSA, but other assays only rely on western blot.</p>
<p>(2) They prepared site-specific Kac proteins and used them in deacetylase activity assays. The incorporation of acetyllysine at the target site needs to be confirmed by MSMS and shown as supplementary data.</p>
<p>(3) The authors imply that the 195-245 aa region of AhCobQ may represent a new domain responsible for deacetylase activity. The feature of the region would be of interest but is not sufficiently described in Figure 5. The amino acid sequence alignments with representative proteins with conserved residues would be informative. It would be also informative if the modeled structure predicted by AlphaFold is shown and the structural similarity with known deacetylases is discussed.</p>

<p>We are sorry to confuse you. The vector used for the purification of CobB and CobQ in the manuscript is pET-32a, which carries the TrxA fusion protein and is approximately 20kDa in size. Therefore, the final molecular weight of recombinant AhCobB and AhCobQ is 48.3(28.3+ ~20kDa) and 49.8 (29.8+ ~20kDa), respectively.</p>

<p>(2) Figure 7: The gels look very smeary. Please explain.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Dear esteemed reviewer, in our study, we have meticulously crafted recombinant site-specific Kac proteins utilizing an innovative two-plasmid system, grounded on the seminal work published in Nature Chemical Biology (2017, 13(12): 1253-1260), which introduced the genetic encoding of Nᵋ-acetyllysine into recombinant proteins. However, we have encountered a prevalent challenge—the occurrence of protein truncation due to premature translation termination at the reassigned codon. This phenomenon not only diminishes protein yields, as highlighted in ChemBioChem (2017, 18(20): 1973-1983), but also plagues many recombinant proteins with a troublesome backdrop in Western Blot (WB) outcomes.</p>
<p>Despite our rigorous approach, involving at least two independent repetitions for WB analysis of site-specific Kac proteins, yielding consistent results, we acknowledge that the overall quality of these WB assays remains suboptimal. This variability is inherently tied to the intrinsic properties of the target proteins themselves. Illustratively, the WB outcomes for proteins such as ENO and ICD exhibit notable differences in quality across biological replicates, emphasizing the complexity and nuances involved in this process.</p>
<p>Thus, while our methodology remains robust and reproducible, we are mindful of the limitations imposed by the nature of the proteins under investigation and strive to continually refine our approaches to mitigate these challenges.</p>

<p>(5) Has the mechanistic role of lysine 388 in ICD been characterized?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your invaluable professional insights. Indeed, the acetylation sites of ICD have been established to exert a significant influence on its enzymatic activity. Sumana Venkat et al., in their seminal work published in the Journal of Molecular Biology (2018, 430(13): 1901-1911), convincingly demonstrated that the acetylation of specific lysine residues—K100, K230, K55, and K350—in ICD proteins from <italic>E. coli</italic> serves as a negative regulatory mechanism for enzyme activity. Intriguingly, the functional implications of the Kac modification on K387 (corresponding to the K388 site in ICD from <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> ATCC 7966, as featured in this manuscript) remain an uncharted territory.</p>
<p>Our experimental endeavors have illuminated that the K388 site of ICD in <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> holds the potential to modulate enzymatic activity and is under the regulatory influence of AhCobQ.</p>

<p>L174 Figure 2D - There is no big change in the acetylation between the wild type and ahcobQ mutant from Figure 2D, but the ahcobB mutant is.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I am extremely grateful for your insightful comment. As clearly depicted in the right panel of Figure 2D, the overall Kac protein levels in both the <italic>ahcobQ</italic> and <italic>ahcobB</italic> knockout strains exhibit a marked elevation compared to the wild-type strain, despite equivalent loading of total cellular proteins (the left panel of Figure 2D). Notably, this increase is particularly pronounced among proteins with a molecular weight below 35 kDa. We wholeheartedly concur with your perspective that the deletion of <italic>ahcobB</italic> leads to a more substantial enhancement in Kac protein levels, suggesting CobB may play a pivotal role in regulating a broader spectrum of acetylated proteins or Kac sites. This hypothesis is further strengthened by subsequent mass spectrometry analyses, which lend additional credence to our shared understanding.</p>

<p>L174-187, L795 - Please show the whole membrane (or PAGE gel) of the loading control of CobB, and CobQ, except for the Kac-BSA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Dear esteemed reviewer, we have thoroughly revised our submission to include the full western blot (WB) membrane for all figures and supplementary figures within the updated Supplementary Material 1. Additionally, we would like to clarify a few crucial points to ensure transparency and accuracy.</p>
<p>Firstly, in Figure 2D, we present WB results solely pertaining to whole-cell samples from cobB or cobQ mutant strains. Consequently, these findings do not directly correlate with recombinant CobB or CobQ proteins.</p>
<p>Secondly, the objective of Figure 2 is to validate the lysine deacetylase activity of AhCobQ protein through a qualitative, rather than quantitative, experimental approach. Hence, the crucial loading control lies in the amount of Kac-BSA, rather than CobB or CobQ. Prior to conducting the in vitro deacetylase assay, we ensured equal protein concentrations of purified CobB or CobQ using BCA assay, adhering to the protocol's specified deacetylase-to-Kac-BSA loading ratio of 1:5. However, this ratio renders the deacetylase (CobB or CobQ) undetectable on Coomassie Blue R-350-stained blots or WB membranes (as detailed in the whole WB membrane in Supplementary Material 1).</p>
<p>To reinforce our observations, we reiterated the analysis of protein samples by subjecting them once again to SDS-PAGE, maintaining the same loading quantity as utilized in the preceding western blotting experiment shown in Figure 2E. As Author response image 1 clearly illustrates, the CobB/CobQ bands are indeed discernible, albeit they exhibit significantly fainter intensities when compared to the Kac-BSA bands. Notably, upon reviewing the full strained PVDF membrane presented in Supplementary Material 1, we find that the CobB/CobQ bands are not readily visible. This observation can be attributed to the potential loss of proteins during the transfer process from SDS-PAGE to the PVDF membrane.</p>

</fig>
<p>Furthermore, recognizing the potential for confusion given the similar molecular weights of CobB (257aa) and CobQ (264aa, excluding fusion tags), we conducted a comparative analysis of deacetylase activity between His-tagged and GST-fused recombinant CobQ proteins. Encouragingly, both variants exhibited deacetylase activity (as presented in Figure S5 of the revised manuscript), thereby excluding any influence from nonspecific proteins that might have contaminated the purification process.</p>
<p>We hope these clarifications and additions to our submission address your concerns and enhance the overall quality of our work. Thank you for your valuable time and consideration.</p>

Therefore, there is no possibility that the western blot and loading control do not correspond. Secondly, not every site of BSA has acetylation modifications, and the amount of modifications at each site is also different, so there will be a large amount of protein but a small amount of acetylation.</p>

<p>- All the proteins are expressed and purified from E.coli BL21(DE3). How did you avoid the pollution of the deacetylase from the E.coli? There is no control over it in your experiment.

</disp-quote>
<p>In response to your inquiry, we have conducted a meticulous comparative analysis of the deacetylase activity exhibited by both His-tagged and GST-fused recombinant AhCobQ proteins. Reassuringly, our findings reveal that both variants possess robust deacetylase activity, as clearly demonstrated in Figure S5 of the revised manuscript. Furthermore, to ensure the rigor of our experiments, we employed GST protein purified from <italic>E.coli</italic> strains as a negative control in Figure S8. The Western blot (WB) results conclusively demonstrate that GST protein alone lacks deacetylase activity, thereby reinforcing the authenticity of our findings and effectively mitigating any concerns regarding potential interference from nonspecific proteins during the purification process.</p>

To clarify, the Kac peptides identified from Kac-BSA, as presented in Table S1, were meticulously selected for the purpose of enhancing their display and facilitating interpretation. The comprehensive raw mass spectrometry (MS) data, along with detailed analytical outcomes, have been diligently deposited within the ProteomeXchange Consortium, specifically through the PRIDE partner repository, under the dataset identifier PXD038735 or alternatively accessible via the iProx database under IPX0005366000. The analysis results also included in the Table S1 and Supplementary material 2.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is crucial to note that in this study, we utilized Bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the foundational database for our MS searches. Consequently, the absence of CobB or CobQ proteins in our MS results stems from the inherent focus on BSA and the specific experimental design, which did not encompass the detection of these particular proteins.</p>
<p>We appreciate your attention to these details and hope this clarification addresses your query.</p>

<p>L189-L206 - Based on the results here, the function of CobB and CobQ overlaps on the same STDKac peptides.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Dear esteemed reviewer, our mass spectrometry (MS) analysis has revealed an intriguing finding: CobB and CobQ indeed function on the same STDKac peptide, suggesting a potential collaboration among distinct deacetylases in regulating protein function. This observation is further corroborated by our subsequent quantitative Kac proteomics results, which were obtained from three deacetylase mutants. These results underscore the possibility that CobB, CobQ, and AcuC possess both unique and overlapping protein substrates, reinforcing our hypothesis that multiple deacetylases work in concert to modulate protein activity.</p>

<p>- Do you assay the Km and Kcat about the CobQ by using Kac-BAS as the substrate by comparing with AhCobB?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Dear reviewer, thanks for your professional suggestion. In accordance with your guidance, we diligently attempted to analyze the Km or Kcat values of CobQ during its incubation with the substrate Kac-BSA using LC-MS/MS, repeating the process twice. However, to our disappointment, our current experimental platform has been unable to detect any discernible metabolites. We suspect that this may stem from operational proficiency challenges, as even our positive control experiment involving CobB incubation has failed to yield satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Given our uncertainty regarding the root cause of these issues, coupled with the suggestion from experts that the LC column might be a contributing factor except for skill, we have decided against repeating the experiments at this juncture. Nonetheless, we would like to assure you that we have rigorously validated the deacetylase activity of CobQ proteins through mass spectrometry, as detailed in our manuscript.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I am delighted to share that our preliminary findings have sparked interest among other research teams. In fact, one such group, upon reading our preprint, has independently tested the activity of CobQ and uncovered an additional intriguing function. We are actively exploring the possibility of collaborating with this team to delve deeper into the research and, hopefully, in the future, conduct a more refined analysis of the Km and Kcat of CobQ.</p>

However, a common problem experienced is protein truncation arising from translation termination at the reassigned codon, lowering protein yields (ChemBioChem, 2017, 18(20): 1973-1983), and leading to a dirty background of WB results in many recombinant proteins. Although we did perform at least two times independent repeats for site-specific Kac protein WB and got similar results, the WB quality of site-specific Kac proteins are general poor and that depend on the properties of target proteins. For example, the WB results of ENO and ICD can display considerable qualities in different biological repeats.</p>

<p>- Why did you choose the PAGE gel but not the anti-His Western blot as the loading control?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for your suggestion. Labeling antibodies is a very effective loading control. However, in order to ensure the accuracy of the data, both the experimental data and loading control in this manuscript are required to be reflected on the same membrane. If His tags are used, the membrane will be washed repeatedly for secondary color development. Based on the fact that acetylation modification is already difficult for color development, this will greatly affect the quality of the results presented. Meanwhile, while ensuring consistent protein levels, we believe that changes in acetylation modifications can also explain the issue. Therefore, you choose the PAGE gel but not the anti-His Western blot as the loading control.</p>

</fig>
<p>Dear reviewer, we are pleased to present the mass spectrum data pertaining to the Kac modification at the K388 site of the ICD protein in Δ<italic>ahcobQ</italic> strain in Figure2 in this responding letter. It is important to clarify that, while we have not directly validated the Kac status of site-specific lysine acetylation at the recombinant ICD K388 site through mass spectrometry (MS) in this particular study, we have strong reasons to believe in its specificity.</p>
<p>Firstly, our confidence stems from the well-established and rigorously validated two-plasmid system methodology for site-directed acetylation modification. This approach has been successfully employed in modifying diverse and specific sites across various proteins, as evidenced by the pioneering work of David et al. in Nature Chemical Biology (2017, 13(12), 1253-1260).</p>
<p>Secondly, we have taken meticulous measures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our findings. This includes double-checking our PCR primers and DNA sequencing for the genetic code expansion technology employed. Furthermore, we have included control experiments utilizing proteins that were not subjected to site-directed acetylation (ICD), as detailed in Figure 8A in revised manuscript, thereby providing an additional layer of validation and reinforcing the robustness of our results.</p>
<p>We believe that these two lines of evidence, combined with our rigorous experimental design and execution, provide a solid foundation for our conclusion regarding the specific acetylation of the K388 site in ICD.</p>

<p>Thank you for your insightful suggestion. We fully concur that a site-specific antibody targeting ICDK388 would be an optimal tool to elucidate the impact of CobQ on the acetylation status (Kac) of this protein. Unfortunately, we are currently without such an antibody due to the intricate and time-consuming process of its production, which also requires rigorous validation to ensure specificity. Furthermore, the cost associated with its development is considerable.</p>
<p>To address this limitation, in the present manuscript, we have innovatively employed a two-plasmid system for site-directed acetylation modification of ICDK388. This method, which has been extensively validated and utilized in modifying diverse specific sites (David et al., Nature Chemical Biology, 2017, 13(12), 1253-1260), allowed us to precisely manipulate the acetylation status of our target protein. Additionally, we incorporated control experiments using proteins that were not subjected to site-directed acetylation, as depicted in Figure 8A in revised manuscript, thereby reinforcing the robustness and reliability of our findings.</p>
