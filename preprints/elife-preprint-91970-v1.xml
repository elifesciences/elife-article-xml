<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis’s (Mtb)</italic> autarkic lifestyle within the host involves rewiring its transcriptional networks to combat host-induced stresses. With the help of RNA-seq performed under various stress conditions, we identified that genes belonging to <italic>Mtb</italic> sulfur metabolism pathways are significantly upregulated during oxidative stress. Using an integrated approach of microbial genetics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, animal experiments, chemical inhibition, and rescue studies, we investigated the biological role of non-canonical L-cysteine synthases, CysM and CysK2. While transcriptome signatures of <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> appear similar under regular growth conditions, we observed unique transcriptional signatures when subjected to oxidative stress. We followed pool size and labelling (<sup>34</sup>S) of key downstream metabolites, viz. mycothiol and ergothioneine, to monitor L-cysteine biosynthesis and utilization. This revealed the significant role of distinct L-cysteine biosynthetic routes on redox stress and homeostasis. CysM and CysK2 independently facilitate <italic>Mtb</italic> survival by alleviating host-induced redox stress, suggesting they are not fully redundant during infection. With the help of genetic mutants and chemical inhibitors, we show that CysM and CysK2 serve as unique, attractive targets for adjunct therapy to combat mycobacterial infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)</italic> continues to stride as the number one killer among all infectious diseases, accounting for nearly 1.5 million deaths yearly. The aggravating situation is despite the clinical use of over 20 antibiotics and a century-old vaccine, BCG. The gradual rise in the emergence of increasingly drug-resistant strains and HIV-TB co-infection further highlights the urgency to identify newer attractive drug targets. Throughout the course of infection, <italic>Mtb</italic> is exposed to a continuum of dynamic host-induced stresses such as severe nutrient deprivation, acidified compartments, and toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) produced by its resident phagosomes. In turn, <italic>Mtb</italic> produces copious amounts of actinomycetes-specific mycothiol, the major antioxidant in actinomycetes that act as the functional equivalent of glutathione, to combat ROS and RNS. In addition to mycothiol, <italic>Mtb</italic> also produces ergothioneine, a low molecular weight thiol, and several enzymes that act concertedly to subvert host-induced redox stress. The redox-active group of both mycothiol and ergothioneine is derived from L-cysteine. Hence, genes involved in the biosynthesis of L-cysteine are upregulated in the host and <italic>in vitro</italic> upon oxidative and nutritional stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Notably, an increased expression of these genes is functionally crucial, as suggested by the attenuated survival of transposon mutants of many sulfur and L-cysteine biosynthesis genes within the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>].</p>
<p>In mycobacteria, sulfur assimilation begins with the import of sulfate through a sulfate transporter composed of SufI.CysT.W.A. Intracellular sulfate is a substrate for APS synthase CysD.N.C, which adenylates and phosphorylates sulfate to form adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS). APS sits at a metabolic branch point; it can either be converted into sulfolipids by consequent actions of multiple Stfs enzymes or reduced via SirA and SirH to sulfide (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). This pathway encompasses sulfide formation from sulfate, called the sulfur assimilation pathway. <italic>Mtb</italic> genome encodes three L-cysteine synthases – the canonical CysK1 and non-canonical CysM and CysK2 enzymes. Interestingly, humans do not possess L-cysteine synthases, raising the possibility of developing antibiotics without a homologous target in the host. CysK1 utilizes sulfide produced via the sulfur assimilation pathway and O-acetyl-L-serine produced from glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate to produce L-cysteine. CysM, on the other hand, uses O- phospho-L-serine and a small sulfur carrier protein CysO as substrates. Like CysK1, CysK2 utilizes O-phospho-L-serine and sulfide as substrates (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). In addition, <italic>Mtb</italic> can also synthesize L- cysteine through a reverse transsulfuration pathway from L-methionine. This example of convergent metabolic redundancy raises several interesting questions: (1) Why would <italic>Mtb</italic> rely on multiple enzymes and pathways to produce the same biomolecule? (2) Are these “functionally redundant” enzymes dispensable, or are they required at a distinct cellular space, time, and condition? (3) Is the L-cysteine pool produced through a particular pathway functionally compartmentalized? That is, is it metabolized into a specific kind of downstream thiol?</p>
<p>To define these unsolved aspects of <italic>Mtb</italic> L-cysteine metabolism, we sought to investigate the interplay of non-canonical L-cysteine synthases of <italic>Mtb</italic> and elucidate their roles in abetting virulence. We aimed to decipher the relative contribution of CysM and CysK2 enzymes in alleviating host-induced stresses and promoting the survival of <italic>Mtb</italic> within the host. We also investigated their role in secondary metabolism, synthesizing low molecular weight thiols, such as mycothiol and ergothioneine, and understanding the consequential effects of their deletion on the global transcriptome of <italic>Mtb.</italic> Lastly, with the help of specific inhibitors, we evaluated their potential to serve as attractive drug targets for adjunct antibiotic therapy.</p>

<title>Non-canonical L-cysteine synthases facilitate Mtb in combating host-induced stresses</title>
<p><italic>Mtb</italic> is a generalist, a prototroph organism that can produce all 20 proteinogenic amino acids. In agreement with this notion, numerous microarray studies depict the upregulation of multiple amino acid pathways within the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], indicating a higher dependency of <italic>Mtb</italic> survival and virulence on amino acid biosynthesis and regulation. Beyond their role in protein synthesis, amino acids such as tryptophan, lysine, and histidine interact with the host immune cells to facilitate mycobacterial survival within the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. We sought to identify distinct host stresses that result in the transcriptional modulation of specific amino acid biosynthetic pathways with the help of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). We compared the transcriptional profile of <italic>H37Rv</italic> (<italic>Rv</italic>) grown in 7H9-ADC with the profiles obtained when bacilli were subjected to oxidative, nitrosative, starvation, and acidic stresses (Table S1). The volcano plot illustrates differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were significantly upregulated (blue) and downregulated (red) under indicated stress conditions (absolute log<sub>2</sub> Fold change&gt;1 and Padj&lt;0.05) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2a-e</xref>). Exposure to starvation conditions resulted in drastic transcription modulation compared with other stresses, suggesting that nutrient deficiency is the primary driver of transcriptome remodeling. In contrast, we observed the lowest number of DEGs when the bacteria were subjected to mildly acidic conditions (pH 5.5). Heat maps of normalized DEGs depict that DEG changes were comparable across biological replicates within each sample set (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2f-j</xref>).</p>
<p>To further refine our understanding of the DEGs, we grouped them into various functional categories and found that genes belonging to intermediary metabolism &amp; respiration remained the most affected in all conditions highlighting their role of metabolic rewiring (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3a</xref>). Pathway enrichment analysis of the most enriched Gene Ontology (GO) further revealed that, while, expectedly, metabolic pathways were found to be downregulated during starvation, we observed enrichment of nitrogen metabolism (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3b</xref> &amp; Table S2). Surfactant stress resulted in the upregulation of branched-chain amino acids/keto acids degradation pathways (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3c</xref>), and nitrosative stress ensued up-regulation of fatty acid and lipid biosynthetic processes (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3d</xref>). There were no changes observed in mildly acidic conditions (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3e</xref>). Importantly, oxidative stress resulted in significant up-regulation of genes involved in sulfur metabolism (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3f</xref>). We further analyzed the DEGs involved in sulfur and L-cysteine metabolism across sample sets and discerned an overlap of the genes affected under two or more conditions. Interestingly, we observed upregulation of sulfate transporters genes (<italic>subI</italic>, <italic>cysT</italic>, <italic>cysW</italic>, <italic>cysA1</italic>) across multiple stresses and sulfur assimilation (<italic>cysH, cysA2, cysD, cysNC)</italic> during starvation, oxidative and SDS stress. <italic>CysK2</italic>, a non-canonical L-cysteine synthase, was found to be up-regulated during all stresses except SDS stress (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>).</p>

<p>Thus RNA-Seq data suggest that sulfur assimilation and L-cysteine biosynthetic pathway genes are the most commonly upregulated pathways in <italic>Mtb</italic> exposed to multiple host-like stresses (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). To address the functional relevance of this observation, we deleted two non-canonical L-cysteine synthases-CysM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] and CysK2, from the <italic>Mtb</italic> chromosome. CysK2 mutant, <italic>RvΔcysK2,</italic> was generated using the recombineering method, and the recombination at the native loci was confirmed with the help of multiple PCRs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). While deletion of <italic>cysM</italic> or <italic>cysK2</italic> did not affect mycobacterial growth under <italic>in vitro</italic> nutrient-rich 7H9-ADC or 7H9-ADS (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4a</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4b</xref>), it significantly compromised <italic>Mtb</italic> growth in nutrient-limiting Sauton’s media (∼2 log<sub>10</sub>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>), suggesting the importance of <italic>cysM-</italic> and <italic>cysK2-</italic>derived L-cysteine. Restoring <italic>cysM</italic> or <italic>cysK2</italic> expression in the complementation strains, <italic>RvΔcysM::M</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2::K2,</italic> rescued the growth defects (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). <italic>Mtb</italic> is a metabolically versatile organism capable of utilizing a large variety of carbon and nitrogen sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Unlike 7H9, wherein glucose, glycerol, glutamate, and ammonia act as carbon and nitrogen sources, Sauton’s media contains glycerol and asparagine as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources, suggesting metabolic reprogramming aided by CysM and CysK2 enable <italic>Mtb</italic> to grow optimally in a limited nutritional environment. This observation was further recapitulated under nutrient starvation (PBS), wherein the survival of <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> was lower than parental <italic>Rv</italic> or <italic>RvΔcysM::M</italic> or <italic>RvΔcysK2::K2</italic> strains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). Interestingly, when exposed to acidic conditions (pH 4.5), <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> survival were observed to be ∼0.85 and ∼0.24 log<sub>10</sub> lower, respectively, compared with <italic>Rv</italic>, suggesting CysM is relatively more important for bacillary survival under acidic stress (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>). The highest attenuation of <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> was observed upon the addition of cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), an organic hydroperoxide that, upon decomposition, generates free radicals. The relative survival of <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> was ∼2.04 and ∼1.31 log<sub>10</sub> lower, respectively, compared to <italic>Rv</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>). The addition of diamide, which results in thiol oxidation, also attenuated the survival of <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> by ∼1.33 and ∼1.26 log<sub>10</sub> compared with <italic>Rv</italic> (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4c</xref>). When the mutant strains were subjected to nitrosative stress, the survival of <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> was ∼0.93 and ∼0.86 log<sub>10</sub> lower than <italic>Rv</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref>). However, no significant attenuation was found during reductive and surfactant stress (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1h-i</xref>). Collectively, <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> displayed increased susceptibility towards oxidative, nitrosative, mild acidification, and PBS starvation to varying degrees compared with <italic>Rv, RvΔcysM::M</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2::K2</italic>. The data suggests that L-cysteine, produced via CysM and CysK2, and its downstream products help mycobacteria thwart specific stresses that <italic>Mtb</italic> encounters within the host.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Distinct roles of CysM and CysK2.C</title>
<p>To decipher the mechanism through which CysM and CysK2 combat oxidative stress, we performed a global transcriptomic analysis of <italic>Rv</italic>, <italic>RvΔcysM</italic>, and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> in the presence and absence of oxidative stress (CHP) (Table S3). Principal Component Analysis demonstrated clear separation of strains under different conditions. Intriguingly, while <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> were closely located on a PCA plot in the absence of any stress, oxidative stress resulted in a significant divergence between the two groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). Deletion of <italic>cysM</italic> resulted in differential expression of 322 genes (159 downregulated and 163 upregulated) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5a-b</xref>), while deletion of <italic>cysK2</italic> impacted 278 genes (155 downregulated and 123 upregulated) under regular growth conditions (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5c-d</xref>) (absolute log<sub>2</sub> Fold change&gt;1 and Padj&lt;0.05). In contrast, upon treatment with CHP, nearly ∼33% and ∼53% of <italic>Mtb</italic> genes were differentially expressed in <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2,</italic> respectively, compared with <italic>Rv</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b-c</xref>). To understand the individual contribution of CysM and CysK2 in combating oxidative stress, we compared the DEGs of <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> to <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> under regular growth and oxidative stress conditions. While DEGs between <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> were limited to 13 in untreated conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>), CHP treatment resulted in differential expression of 1372 genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5e</xref>), highlighting unique transcriptional signatures associated with each L-cysteine synthase under oxidative stress. Subsequently, we compared the DEGs of <italic>Rv</italic>, <italic>RvΔcysM</italic>, and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> obtained under oxidative stress with the help of a Venn diagram. This analysis revealed that CysM and CysK2 influence a shared repertoire of 1023 genes (529 upregulated and 494 downregulated) compared to <italic>Rv</italic> upon CHP treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>). Importantly, CysM and CysK2 distinctively modulate 324 and 1104 genes, respectively, during oxidative stress (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f-g</xref>). Assortment of DEGs into functional classes revealed intermediary metabolism &amp; respiration and cell wall pathways among the most impacted categories (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2h</xref>). These results corroborate the recent finding that CysK2 alters the phospholipid profile of the <italic>Mtb</italic> cell envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Pathway enrichment analysis of the most enriched Gene ontology biological process indicated that while most pathways are commonly affected by CysM and CysK2, these L-cysteine synthases also have a unique transcriptional footprint (Table S4). Pathways such as DNA binding, homologous recombination, translation, ribosome, etc., were commonly affected in <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> compared to <italic>Rv</italic> during oxidative stress (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5f, g</xref>).

Together, our data point to the unique roles of CysM and CysK2, as their deletion differentially affects various cellular pathways under oxidative stress.</p>

<title>Key metabolites are differentially affected upon CysM and CysK2 deletion</title>
<p>L-Cysteine concentration in <italic>Mtb</italic> is notoriously low, usually 10-fold lower than most other amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. As expected, L-cysteine levels were below the limit of detection/quantification (not shown). Therefore, we used key downstream metabolites to monitor L-cysteine biosynthesis and utilization. We followed pool size and labelling (<sup>34</sup>S) of L-methionine, mycothiol/mycothione, and ergothioneine, made from L-cysteine, via three distinct and dedicated metabolic pathways (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>). First, L-methionine, mycothiol, and ergothioneine concentrations vary from zero to 24 h, indicating that their pool sizes are not as stable as those of other core metabolites. This is consistent with their function, susceptibility to redox homeostasis, and L-methionine’s role in protein synthesis. Second, upon challenge with CHP for 24 h, L-methionine levels decrease in <italic>Rv</italic>, remain constant in <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic>, and increase in <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Ergothioneine levels are identical in the three strains, and upon treatment with CHP, they are decreased in the parent strain but remain unchanged in the <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). Mycothiol levels increase in the <italic>Rv</italic>, <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> strains and remain nearly constant in <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). Finally, mycothione levels increased slightly in the parent strain, decreased in the <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic>, and remained stable in the <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>). These changes revealed a significant role of distinct L-cysteine biosynthetic routes on redox stress and homeostasis.</p>

<p>Employing <sup>34</sup>S labelling, we observed a reduced rate of synthesis of mycothiol, mycothione and ergothioneine in <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> compared to <italic>Rv</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e-g</xref>).

<p>This result further indicates that these two routes are partially redundant; that is, they generate the same end product, L-cysteine. Yet, pool size measurements demonstrate significant changes, highlighting that while these pathways produce the same metabolite, their complex biological roles and requirements (co-substrates, pathways, regulation, etc.) are not fully redundant. This interpretation is in accordance with transcriptomics and phenotypic results described above. These non-overlapping metabolic requirements (<italic>e.g.</italic>, O-acetyl-L-serine vs. O-phospho-L-serine vs. CysM) are likely the source of the different metabolic phenotypes observed. Therefore, even producing the same end-product, genetic disruption of different L-cysteine synthases differently affects bacterium metabolism and fitness, leading to the distinct phenotypes observed between <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysM in vitro</italic>, <italic>in cellulo</italic>, and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>CysM and CysK2 alleviate the toxicity of host-produced ROS and RNS</title>
<p>To define whether the attenuation of mutant strains observed during defined <italic>in vitro</italic> host-like conditions can be recapitulated within the host cells, we compared the survival of parental, mutants, and complementation strains in murine peritoneal macrophages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>).

<p>To understand whether the ability of CysM to mitigate oxidative and nitrosative stress is linked to its role in facilitating mycobacterial survival <italic>in vivo,</italic> we infected WT, phox<sup>-/-</sup> and IFNγ<sup>-/-</sup> mice with <italic>Rv</italic>, <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysM::M</italic> and analyzed bacillary load at 4 weeks p.i (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5g</xref>).

Due to the lack of ROS and RNS in IFNγ<sup>-/-</sup> mice, <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> showed higher bacillary load than in phox<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5h</xref>). <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> displayed better survival in phox<sup>-/-</sup> and IFNγ<sup>-/-</sup>mice in the spleen than lungs, which could either be because of relatively lesser ROS and RNS stress or imperiled response in clearing <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5i</xref>). In contrast to the peritoneal macrophage infection experiment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), attenuated survival of <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> was not completely salvaged in IFNγ<sup>-</sup>/<sup>-</sup> mice, suggesting that CysM may also be involved in alleviating additional stresses such as nutrient deprivation and/or IFNγ independent ROS/RNS produced by the host.

<title><italic>L-Cysteine synthase inhibitors can effectively kill Mtb</italic> within the host</title>
<p>Data presented above demonstrated that CysM and CysK2 might serve as clinically-important targets for adjunct TB therapy. Brunner <italic>et al.</italic> screened a compound library to identify inhibitors of mycobacterial L-cysteine synthases-CysK1, CysK2, and CysM. We selected three compounds - Compound 1 (C1) (named compound 2 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]), which inhibits all three synthases; Compound 2 (C2) (compound 6 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]), which inhibits both non-canonical L-cysteine synthases and Compound 3 (C3) (compound 31 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]), which selectively inhibits CysK1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref> &amp; b). To examine the therapeutic potential of these inhibitors, we first tested their effect on the survival of <italic>Rv</italic> within host peritoneal macrophages. Treatment with C1 resulted in ∼1 log<sub>10</sub> attenuation compared with the untreated cells. Killing mediated by C2 or C3 was marginally lower compared with C1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>). Next, we examined the ability of these drugs to enhance the bactericidal activity of INH, a drug whose activity depends on redox state of the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], and therefore could be affected by disruption of L-cysteine downstream pathways. Towards this goal, we first measured the MICs of INH (0.06 µg/ml) and C1 (0.6 mg/ml), C2 (0.6 mg/ml), and C3 (0.15 mg/ml) independently. As expected, all the compounds were ineffective in killing <italic>Mtb</italic> because of redundant roles and relatively less requirement of L-cysteine synthases during regular growth conditions. To examine the combinatorial effect, we selected sub-MIC values of INH (0.03 µg/mL, encircled orange) and increasingly two-fold diluted concentrations of C1, C2, or C3, all below MIC values (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c-e</xref>; blue encircled denotes the starting concentration) and assessed bacterial survival upon combinatorial treatment with INH and the three L-cysteine synthase inhibitors.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Throughout its course of infection, <italic>Mtb</italic> must persist in a hostile, oxidizing, and nutrient-deprived environment of host macrophage. Understanding the dynamic metabolic interactions between the pathogen and its host is imperative to identify its weaknesses which can be exploited to design new-age chemotherapy. Our study provides convincing evidence that the genes involved in the L-cysteine biosynthetic pathway are attractive targets for the design of anti-mycobacterial drugs. Genes involved in sulfur assimilation and L-cysteine biosynthesis were found to be upregulated in the transcriptome profile of <italic>Rv</italic> subjected to various host-like stresses. The sulfur metabolism pathway was particularly enriched upon the addition of oxidizing agent, CHP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, S2 &amp; S3). This observation has been consistently reported by multiple studies demonstrating the up-regulation of sulfur assimilation and L-cysteine biosynthetic genes in response to oxidative stress, nutrient deprivation, and macrophage infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Besides being involved in protein synthesis, L-cysteine is also important for the biosynthesis of L-methionine, S-adenosyl methionine, coenzyme A, and iron-sulfur clusters. As a thiol-containing molecule, L-cysteine contributes to the intracellular redox state directly and through the production of major antioxidants like mycothiol and ergothioneine. These numerous essential functions of L-cysteine prompted us to further examine its roles in the context of <italic>Mtb</italic> cellular metabolism and virulence.</p>
<p>Unlike <italic>Mtb</italic>Δ<italic>cysH</italic>, which was reported to be an L-cysteine auxotroph and thus required L-methionine or glutathione supplementation to grow <italic>in vitro</italic> (from which L-cysteine can be generated catabolically)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], neither deletion of <italic>cysK2</italic> nor <italic>cysM</italic> impacted <italic>Mtb</italic> growth kinetics <italic>in vitro</italic> suggesting that these genes are functionally redundant during rich growth conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>). Interestingly, the induction of various host-like stresses attenuated the growth of these mutants compared to the parental strain, pointing towards the possibility of an enhanced requirement of L-cysteine-derived antioxidants and other biomolecules to subvert these stresses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In agreement with this hypothesis, we previously showed that the cellular thiol levels are higher during oxidative stress in <italic>Mtb</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Similarly, various MSH and ERG mutants display enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress caused by treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, cumene hydroperoxide, or O<sup>2•−</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].</p>
<p>While the transcriptomic profiles of mutants were highly similar to each other during regular growth conditions, the addition of CHP resulted in differential expression of &gt;30% <italic>Mtb</italic> genes, indicating that cues and downstream effects of the two non-canonical L-cysteine synthases are partially non-overlapping, further underlying their importance for the bacillary growth inside the host (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). We also found that the steady-state levels (pool sizes) of key L-cysteine derived antioxidants, ergothioneine, and mycothiol, are significantly different at 24 h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The rate of synthesis of mycothiol, mycothione and ergothioneine were observed to be lower in <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> compared to <italic>Rv</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic>.</p>
<p>The addition of L-cysteine in oxidatively stressed cells nullified the compromised survival of the mutants indicating that <italic>Mtb</italic> cells are able to uptake L-cysteine from the extracellular medium, as shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], and reduced levels of L-cysteine in the mutants are chiefly responsible for their attenuated growth in the presence of stresses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Various <italic>Mtb</italic> mutants in mycobacterial sulfur metabolism genes are severely compromised to persist within the host and cause disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Inorganic sulfate is present at 300-500 μM in human plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. However, the inability of host-derived sulfur/L-cysteine to compensate for attenuated survival of mutants is suggestive of either inaccessibility of sufficient L-cysteine in <italic>Mtb</italic> niches or inefficient expression, function, or uptake by transporters <italic>in vivo</italic>. Importantly, compromised survival of <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2 in vivo</italic> was largely mitigated in IFNγ-/- and Phox-/-, indicating that the non-canonical L-cysteine synthases, CysM and CysK2, independently facilitate mycobacterial survival during immune-mediated redox stress (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Using network analysis of the <italic>Mtb</italic> protein interactome, a flux balance analysis of the reactome and randomized transposon mutagenesis data, along with sequence analyses and a structural assessment of targetability, Raman <italic>et al.,</italic> reported CysK2 and CysM as high confidence drug targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Similarly, inhibitors of CysM showed mycobactericidal activity in a nutrient-starvation model of dormancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Interestingly, humans do not reduce sulfur to produce L-cysteine; they rather synthesize L-cysteine through SAM-dependent transmethylation followed by transsulfuration of L-methionine. Owing to their complete absence in humans, mycobacterial L-cysteine biosynthetic genes and their regulators represent unique, attractive targets for therapeutic intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. We found that both <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> displayed enhanced antibiotic sensitivity <italic>in vitro</italic> and within the host (data not shown). Importantly, a combination of L-cysteine synthase inhibitors with front-line TB drugs like INH, significantly reduced the bacterial load inside the host (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Altogether, this study demonstrates for the first time that the two non-canonical L-cysteine synthases have non-redundant biological functions. Deletion or biochemical inhibition of CysM or CysK2 perturbs redox homeostasis of <italic>Mtb</italic> and allow for the maximal effect of host macrophages antibacterial response, and thus increased elimination of virulent <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p>

<p>We generated gene replacement mutants through the recombineering method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Briefly, 671bp upstream of 176<sup>th</sup> nucleotide from 5’ end (5’ flank) and 643 bp downstream of 943<sup>rd</sup> nucleotide from 3’ end (3’ flank) of <italic>cysK2</italic> were PCR amplified from <italic>Rv</italic> genomic DNA using Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific). The amplicons were digested with BstAPI and ligated with compatible hygromycin resistance (<italic>hyg<sup>r</sup></italic>) cassette and <italic>oriE</italic>+cosλ fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], to generate the allelic exchange substrate (AES). AES was digested with SnaBI to release the LHS-<italic>hyg<sup>r</sup></italic>-RHS fragment, and the eluted fragment was electroporated into the recombineering proficient <italic>Rv</italic>-<italic>ET</italic> strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Multiple <italic>hyg<sup>r</sup></italic> colonies were examined by PCRs to screen for legitimate recombination at <italic>cysK2</italic> locus. <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic>, thus generated, was cured of pNit-ET through negative selection on LB Agar plates containing 2% sucrose. To generate the complementation strain, full length <italic>cysK2</italic> gene was PCR amplified from genomic DNA isolated from <italic>Rv</italic> as the template and Phusion DNA polymerase (ThermoFischer Scientific). The amplicon was digested with NdeI-HindIII (NEB), cloned into the corresponding sites in pNit-3F and the resultant plasmid was electroporated into <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> to generate the <italic>RvΔcysK2::cysK2</italic> strain. <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysM::cysM</italic> strains were generated in the lab previously using a similar method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>].</p>

In specific cases, the peritoneal macrophages were treated with 10 ng/ml IFNγ (BD Biosciences) overnight and 10 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Sigma) for 2 h for activation. Where indicated, cells were further pretreated with 100 µM 1400 W (Sigma) overnight to inhibit iNOS or pretreated with 0.2 mM L-cysteine before infection. Single-cell <italic>Mtb</italic> suspensions were used for infection at 1:10 (host cells: bacteria) MOI. 4 h post-infection (p.i), cells were washed thrice and replenished with complete RPMI containing IFNγ + LPS, 1400 W, or L-cysteine, as required. The infected host cells were washed thrice with PBS, lysed using 0.05% Dodecyl sulfate sodium salt (SDS), and serial dilutions were plated on 7H11-OADC to enumerate bacillary survival.</p>

<caption><title>Overview of Sulfur metabolism pathway in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic></title><p>Sulfate is imported via the sulfate transporter composed of SufI.CysT.W.A, which is acted upon by CysDNC complex to form Adenosine-5’-phosphosulfate (APS). APS can either form sulfolipids or is reduced by subsequent actions of CysH and SirA to form sulfide. CysK1, the classical L-cysteine synthase, utilizes reduced sulfide and O-acetyl-L-serine as substrates to form L-Cysteine. Alternatively, L-cysteine is produced by CysM, a non-canonical L-cysteine synthase that is unique to actinomycetes, and uses O-phospho-L-serine and a small sulfur carrier protein CysO to form L-cysteine. <italic>Mtb</italic> also encodes for a third L-cysteine synthase, CysK2. However, the major product of this pathway is S-sulfo-L-cysteine, which can get rapidly converted to L-cysteine.</p></caption>

<p>Sulphur atoms derived from cysteine are thought to play significant roles in maintaining redox homeostasis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which encounters stresses associated with immune cell interactions. In this <bold>valuable</bold> manuscript, the authors provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence that the genes encoding cysteine biosynthetic enzymes (cysM and cysK2) are required to maintain full viability of M. tuberculosis under in vitro stress conditions, macrophage infections, and within the lung tissues of mice. The manuscript presents transcriptomic and metabolomic evidence to support the hypothesis that CysM and CysK2 play distinct roles in maintaining cysteine-derived metabolite pools under stress conditions. The work will be of interest to microbiologists in general.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Khan et. al., investigated the functional redundancy of the non-canonical L-cysteine synthases of M. tuberculosis, CysM and CysK2, focussing on their role in mitigating the effects of host-derived stress. They found that while deletion mutants of the two synthases (Rv∆cysM, Rv∆cysK2) have similar transcriptomes under standard conditions, their transcriptional response to oxidative stress is distinct. The impact of deleting the synthases also differentially affected the pools of L-cysteine-derived metabolites. They show that the mutants (Rv∆cysM, Rv∆cysK2) have impaired survival in peritoneal macrophages and in a mouse model of infection. Importantly, they show that the survival of the mutants increases when the host is defective in producing reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, linking the phenotype to a defect in combating host-derived stress. Finally, they show that compounds inhibiting L-cysteine synthases reduce the intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. The distinct transcriptome of the Rv∆cysM and Rv∆cysK2 mutants in the presence of oxidative stress provides solid evidence that these mutants are distinct in their response to oxidative stress, and suggests that they are not functionally redundant.</p>
<p>
2. The use of macrophages from phox-/- and INF-/- mice and an iNOS inhibitor for the intracellular survival assays provides solid evidence that the survival defect seen for the Rv∆cysM and Rv∆cysK2 mutants is related to their reduced ability to combat host-derive oxidative and nitrosative stress. This is further supported by the infection studies in phox-/- and INF-/- mice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. There are several previous studies looking at the transcriptional response of M. tuberculosis to host-derived stress, however, the authors do not discuss initial RNA-seq data in the context of these studies. Furthermore, while several of the genes in sulfur assimilation and L-cysteine biosynthetic pathway genes are upregulated by more than one stress condition, the data does not support the statement that it is the &quot;most commonly upregulated pathway in Mtb exposed to multiple host-like stresses&quot;.</p>
<p>
2. For the quantification of the metabolites, it isn't clear how the abundance was calculated (e.g., were standards for each metabolite used? How was abundance normalised between samples?), and this information should be included to strengthen the data. Furthermore, labelling with L-methionine was performed to determine the rate of synthesis of the L-cysteine-derived metabolites. L-cysteine is produced from L-methionine via the transsulfuration pathway, which is independent of CysM and CysK2. It is therefore difficult to interpret this experiment, as the impact of deleting CysM and CysK2 on the transsulfuration pathway is likely indirect.</p>
<p>3. The ability of L-cysteine to rescue the survival defect of the Rv∆cysM and Rv∆cysK2 mutants in macrophages is interpreted as exogenous L-cysteine being able to compensate for reduced intracellular levels. However, there is no evidence that L-cysteine is being taken up by the mutants and an alternate explanation is that L-cysteine functions as an antioxidant within cells i.e., it reduces intracellular ROS.</p>
<p>The authors sought to investigate the functional redundancy of the non-canonical L-cysteine synthases CysM and CysK2. While their distinct transcriptional response to oxidative stress suggests distinct physiological roles, the study did not explore these differences and therefore provides only preliminary insight into the underlying reasons for this observation. In the context of drug development, this work suggests that while L-cysteine synthase inhibitors do not have high potency for killing intracellular M. tuberculosis, they have the potential to decrease the pathogen's survival in the presence of host-derive stress.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper examines the role L-cysteine metabolism plays in the biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The authors have preliminary data showing that Mycobacterium tuberculosis has two unique pathways to synthesize cysteine. The data showing new compounds that act synergistically with INH is very interesting.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>RNAseq data is interesting and important.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper would be strengthened if the authors were to add further detail to their genetic manipulations.</p>
<p>The authors provide evidence that they have successfully made a cysK2 mutant by recombineering. This data looks promising, but I do not see evidence for the cysM deletion. It is also important to state what sort of complementation was done (multicopy plasmid, integration proficient vector, or repair of the deletion). Since these mutants are the basis for most of the additional studies, these details are essential. It is important to include complementation in mouse studies as unexpected loss of PDIM could have occurred.</p>

<p>In this work, the authors conduct transcriptional profiling experiments with Mtb under various different stress conditions (oxidative, nitrosative, low pH, starvation, and SDS). The Mtb transcriptional responses to these stress conditions are not particularly new, having been reported extensively in the literature over the past ~20 years in various forms. A common theme from the current work is that L-cysteine synthesis genes are seemingly up-regulated by many stresses. Thus, the authors focused on deleting two of the three L-cysteine synthesis genes (cysM and cysK2) in Mtb to better understand the roles of these genes in Mtb physiology.</p>
<p>The cysM and cysK2 mutants display fitness defects in various media (Sautons media, starvation, oxidative and nitrosative stress) noted by CFU reductions. Transcriptional profiling studies with the cysM and cysK2 mutants revealed that divergent gene signatures are generated in each of these strains under oxidative stress, suggesting that cysM and cysK2 have non-redundant roles in Mtb's oxidative stress response which likely reflects the different substrates used by these enzymes, CysO-L-cysteine and O-phospho-L-serine, respectively. Note that these studies lack genetic complementation and are thus not rigorously controlled for the engineered deletion mutations.</p>
<p>The authors quantify the levels of sulfur-containing metabolites (methionine, ergothioneine, mycothiol, mycothionine) produced by the mutants following exposure to oxidative stress. Both the cysM or cysK2 mutants produce more methionine, ergothioneine, and mycothionine relative to WT under oxidative stress. Both mutants produce less mycothiol relative to WT under the same condition. These studies lack genetic complementation and thus, do not rigorously control for the engineered mutations.</p>
<p>Next, the mutants were evaluated in infection models to reveal fitness defects associated with oxidative and nitrosative stress in the cysM or cysK2 mutants. In LPS/IFNg activated peritoneal macrophages, the cysM or cysK2 mutants display marked fitness defects which can be rescued with exogenous cysteine added to the cell culture media. Peritoneal macrophages lacking the NADPH oxidase (Phox) or IFNg fail to produce fitness phenotypes in the cysM or cysK2 mutants suggesting that oxidative stress is responsible for the phenotypes. Similarly, chemical inhibition of iNOS partly abrogated the fitness defect of the cysM or cysK2 mutants. Similar studies were conducted in mice lacking IFNg and Phox establishing that cysM or cysK2 mutants have fitness defects in vivo that are dependent on oxidative and nitrosative stress.</p>
<p>Lastly, the authors use small molecule compounds to inhibit cysteine synthases. It is demonstrated that the compounds display inhibition of Mtb growth in 7H9 ADC media. No evidence is provided to demonstrate that these compounds are specifically inhibiting the cysteine synthases via &quot;on-target inhibition&quot; in the whole Mtb cells. Additionally, it is wrongly stated in the discussion that &quot;combinations of L-cys synthase inhibitors with front-line TB drugs like INH, significantly reduced the bacterial load inside the host&quot;. This statement suggests that the INH + cysteine synthase inhibitor combinations reduce Mtb loads within a host in an infection assay. No data is presented to support this statement.</p>
