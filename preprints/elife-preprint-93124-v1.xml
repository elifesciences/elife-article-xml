<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>The gut is an emerging regulator of bone marrow (BM) hematopoiesis and several signaling molecules are involved in this communication. Among them, bile acids (BAs), originally classified as lipid solubilizers, have emerged as powerful signaling molecules that act as a relay between the digestive system, the microbiota and the rest of the body. The signaling function of BAs relies on specific receptors, including Takeda-G-protein-receptor-5 (TGR5). TGR5 has potent regulatory effects in immune cells, but its effect on the BM as a primary immune organ remains unknown. Here, we investigated the BM of young mice and observed a significant reduction in bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) upon loss of TGR5, accompanied by an enrichment in BM adipocyte progenitors which translated into enhanced hematopoietic recovery upon transplantation. These findings open the possibility of modulating stromal hematopoietic support by acting on TGR5 signaling.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The bone, long considered a merely structural organ, is now seen as a highly dynamic tissue in which various processes, including hematopoiesis, bone remodeling, immunity and metabolism are tightly regulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. These processes rely on specialized microenvironments, termed niches, that play a critical role in cell fate regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, with the bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) being an emerging niche component<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The bone marrow (BM) niche regulates hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) quiescence, self-renewal and commitment towards differentiated cells thanks to a combination of soluble factors and cell-cell interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Osteoblasts, adipocytes and endothelial cells form the BM niche along with a wide range of BM stromal cells (BMSCs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. While the involvement of these specific cell types in the regulation of hematopoiesis is generally accepted, the extent of their action is controversial, especially for cells that form part of the adipocytic lineage. Mature BM adipocytes were first described to have a predominantly negative effect on hematopoietic recovery post-myeloablation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Subsequent studies showing a positive effect of the BM adipocyte lineage on hematopoietic recovery called these results into question<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Recent work has uncovered a more nuanced role of non-lipidated BM adipogenic precursors in the control of bone homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> and favoring hematopoietic recovery upon irradiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. As for other adipose depots, the BMAT is plastic and can be remodeled upon injury and dietary or pharmacological stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Bone and BM homeostasis is influenced by extramedullary mechanisms, including the incompletely understood gut-BM cross-talk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Communication between the gut and distant organs can be mediated by different signaling molecules, including bile acids (BAs), metabolites derived from the liver and modified by the gut microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. BAs are signaling molecules that modulate whole-body metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> through activation of specific receptors that include the G protein-coupled receptor Takeda-G-protein-receptor-5 (TGR5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. BA-TGR5 signaling has been studied in a multitude of organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and profoundly affects adipose tissue physiology through several mechanisms, ranging from beiging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and suppression of chronic inflammation in resident macrophages of the white adipose tissue (WAT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, to stimulation of fat oxidation in brown adipose tissue (BAT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In addition, TGR5 expression was observed in human BMSC-derived adipocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, but the effect of TGR5 on BMAT and thus on BM function is unknown. Previous reports have shown that BAs impact fetal and adult hematopoiesis acting as chemical chaperones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and, more recently, through direct interaction with myeloid blood cell precursors via the vitamin D receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. However, the effects at the level of TGR5, a BA-specific and potentially druggable receptor, remain to be unraveled.</p>
<p>Here, we report that TGR5 regulates the BM adipocytic lineage and hematopoietic recovery upon transplantation. We show that the loss of TGR5 markedly decreases BMAT in chow- and high-fat-diet (CD and HFD, respectively) conditions. Concomitantly, we observe an increase of immunophenotypically-defined adipocyte-progenitor cells (APCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and a hastened hematopoietic recovery upon BM transplantation that is not dependent on the hematopoietic cells transplanted but on the genotype of the recipient.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We first aimed to define the presence of TGR5 in primitive and differentiated hematopoietic populations. For this, we took advantage of a GFP reporter mouse model driven by the <italic>Tgr5</italic> promoter (TGR5:GFP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Flow cytometry analysis of hematopoietic populations showed consistent GFP signal throughout the main hematopoietic stem and progenitor (HSPC) populations in the adult mouse BM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We observed significant levels of GFP positivity in the lineage negative (Lin<sup>−</sup>), c-Kit<sup>+</sup>, Sca1<sup>+</sup> cells (LKS), a population highly enriched in murine hematopoietic stem and multipotent progenitor cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We detected similar frequencies of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in restricted myeloid progenitors with no marked differences in the percentage of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells between the different immunophenotypically defined subpopulations (granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMP), common myeloid progenitors (CMP) and megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEP) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). GFP expression was further detected by immunohistochemistry in the BM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), spleen (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>) and thymus (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>), confirming the expression of TGR5 in different immune organs. Flow cytometry analysis of fully differentiated hematopoietic populations in peripheral blood (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>) showed that TGR5 is mostly expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage with lower expression in lymphocytes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that TGR5 is present in primitive and differentiated hematopoietic cells.</p>

<p>We next aimed at defining the impact of a loss-of-function of TGR5 in hematopoiesis. Flow cytometry analysis of the BM of young germline TGR5 knock-out (<italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) mice showed no marked alterations in the percentage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) or absolute number (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) of HSPC populations compared to their controls (<italic>Tgr5<sup>+/+</sup></italic>). Functionally, we could not detect differences in hematopoietic colony-forming unit (CFU) potential, and thus functional blood cell progenitors, between <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice and their <italic>Tgr5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> counterparts (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). However, we observed an increase in the total number of CD45<sup>+</sup> cells per hindlimb collected from <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) that did not lead to an increase in CFUs per hindlimb (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>). Complete blood counts (CBC) of peripheral blood showed a modest increase in the number of red blood cells and a decrease in eosinophils, but no change in other white blood cells or platelets in <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D-H</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that TGR5 is non-essential for steady-state hematopoiesis in young adult male mice.</p>

</fig>
<p>In the next step, we aimed at defining the hematopoietic cell-autonomous effects of a germline deletion of TGR5 upon hematopoietic stress. For this, we examined the repopulating capacity of <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Tgr5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> BM cells when co-transplanted with competitor CD45.1.2 BM into a lethally irradiated wild-type recipient (CD45.1) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>). We found that, upon primary transplantation, <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> donor cells blunt short-term repopulating capacity, but do not affect long-term repopulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>) nor short-term repopulating capacity in the secondary or tertiary transplant (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> BM cells exhibit a transient deficit in short-term repopulating capacity that is corrected over serial transplantation in wild-type recipients, with no detectable long-term impairment of hematopoietic stem cell function.</p>
<p>Based on our findings that functional hematopoietic progenitors are quantitatively conserved at homeostasis and that the cell-autonomous effects disappear on serial transplantation (i.e., exposure to a wild-type BM niche), we hypothesized that an altered BM microenvironment in <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals may account for this phenotype. In agreement with the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, we found that young adult <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> male mice display a decrease in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and a decrease in trabecular number (Tb.N) with no changes in trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) or separation (Tb.Sp) at the distal femur (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, A and B). In addition, no alterations in cortical parameters were found at the level of the femoral diaphysis (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3, A</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>), as evaluated by micro-computed tomography (µCT). We could not detect any changes in bone microarchitecture in the spine at the level of L4 in young male <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3, C</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). These data suggest that the role of TGR5 on bone microarchitecture differs based on skeletal location, which is in line with the recently described differential regulation of the axial and the appendicular skeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>To further study the overall composition of the BM microenvironment, we used osmium tetroxide (OsO<sub>4</sub>) contrast-enhanced µCT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> to visualize the tibial BMAT. The BMAT in the proximal tibia, also known as regulated BMAT (rBMAT), is regarded as the most dynamic and stimuli-responsive BMAT in opposition to that found in the distal tibia, which is enriched in the less responsive constitutive BMAT (cBMAT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. This analysis revealed a profound reduction in proximal tibia BMAT in young adult <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals as well as a less marked decrease in distal tibia BMAT compared to age-matched controls (<italic>Tgr5<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, C and D). As BMAT accumulates with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, we evaluated the tibias of 1-year-old <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, which showed a similar decrease in BMAT compared to their age-matched controls, indicating that the expansion of BMAT with aging was blunted in the absence of TGR5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Dietary intervention has also been shown to modulate BMAT expansion and high-fat diet (HFD)-feeding robustly increases marrow adiposity, in general, and rBMAT, in particular<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. To investigate if TGR5 could control BMAT plasticity upon this intervention, we fed <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Tgr5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice with HFD for 8 weeks and evaluated the tibial BMAT. In agreement with our data in young and middle-aged chow-diet (CD)-fed mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C-F</xref>), contrast-enhanced µCT analysis of OsO<sub>4</sub>-stained tibias revealed a marked decrease in rBMAT along with a more moderate decrease in cBMAT in <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice compared to their wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, G</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">H</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we sought to evaluate whether the robust decrease in rBMAT with a more preserved cBMAT was exclusive of the appendicular skeleton or was also present in axial structures. For this, we chose the caudal spine, as this segment of the vertebral column contains a gradient where rBMAT gives way to cBMAT in a proximal- to-distal manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. µCT scanning of OsO<sub>4</sub>-stained caudal spines showed this adipocytic gradient, so-called the yellow-to-red transition. at the level of the second caudal vertebrae (CA2) in young male <italic>Tgr5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3E</xref>). Analogously to our findings for the rBMAT in tibia, <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice presented a marked decrease in BMAT at the level of CA2 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3F, G</xref>). Histological preparations of the same spine segments from an independent cohort further confirmed our µCT data (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3H</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our findings indicate a mutual loss of trabecular bone and marrow adiposity in <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. Specifically, loss of TGR5 decreased trabecular bone in the appendicular skeleton without affecting bone structure at the level of the axial skeleton. Conversely, lack of TGR5 markedly reduced BMAT volume in both the appendicular and axial skeleton. The decrease in BMAT occurred fundamentally at the expense of rBMAT both at homeostasis and under HFD-induced expansion of BMAT, suggesting that TGR5 might be a key player in the regulation of this tissue.</p>
<p>Given the changes in both BMAT and bone architecture, we hypothesized that BM stroma cells (BMSCs) obtained from <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice would present a defect in both adipocytic and osteoblastic differentiation. Surprisingly, and contrary to our hypothesis, <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> BMSC cultures differentiated better into adipocytes, as evidenced by Oil Red O staining (ORO) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>) and digital holographic microscopy (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4, B</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Moreover, <italic>Tgr5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> BMSCs displayed comparable osteoblastic differentiation, evaluated by alkaline phosphatase staining (ALP) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4D</xref>) and calcium deposition, as evidenced by alizarin red staining (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4E</xref>). Taken together, these <italic>in vitro</italic> data indicate that TGR5 deletion does not cause an intrinsic defect in <italic>in vitro</italic> BMSC differentiation.</p>

<p>Recent reports have revealed that lipodystrophy or specific ablation of pre-adipocytic populations in the BM leads to massive trabecular bone invasion of the medullary cavity, indicating that these populations negatively regulate the mineralized compartment of the BM microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Considering this, we hypothesized that our findings in <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, (i.e., decreased BMAT and trabecular bone together with an increased <italic>in vitro</italic> adipocyte differentiation), could be explained by an <italic>in vivo</italic> blockage of lipidation of adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs) that is rescued upon forced induction of <italic>in vitro</italic> adipocytic differentiation. In order to assess this, we analyzed the BM stroma based on the expression of Sca1 and CD24 for APC quantification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In agreement with our hypothesis, we found an increase in immunophenotypic APCs (CD45<sup>−</sup>Ter119<sup>−</sup>CD31<sup>−</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>−</sup>) in the stroma of <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4F</xref>). Finally, we observed an alteration in the clonogenic capacity of BMSCs, evidenced by an increase in fibroblast colony-forming units (CFU-F) in <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> BM and compared to wildtype controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4G</xref>), which agrees with a shift towards less differentiated BM stromal populations in <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> animals. Taken together, our findings indicate that TGR5 loss-of-function perturbs the bone-BMAT-hematopoietic tissue equilibrium within the marrow cavity and suggests that TGR5 signaling is necessary for BM pre-adipocytes to fully mature.</p>
<p>Given the accumulation of APCs in <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, we next investigated the impact of the associated BM microenvironment alterations in stress hematopoiesis. Based on the first report of the negative effect of lipidated BM adipocytes on hematopoietic recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> and recent work showing that non-lipidated adipocytic precursors improve hematopoietic recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, we reasoned that the displacement of the BM adipocyte differentiation axis towards non-lipidated progenitors observed in the BM microenvironment of <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice would correlate with an improved early hematopoietic recovery upon irradiation and transplantation. To assess this, we generated inverse chimeras (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>) and evaluated early hematopoietic recovery using CBCs as a direct readout of the functionality of the system for the first 4 weeks post-irradiation. We observed lower mortality post-transplant in the <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> recipients (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>) and faster hematopoietic recovery in <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> recipients upon lethal irradiation and transplantation with wild-type donor cells. <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> recipients recovered their platelet levels faster than the <italic>Tgr5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> recipients, showing values consistently above 200.000/µL one week sooner; platelet levels below this threshold are considered a risk factor for bleeding events (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. The recovery was also faster for white blood cells (WBCs) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>) without a clear predominance of any cell type as shown for neutrophils (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>), monocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>) or lymphocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>). Of note, <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> recipients had their neutrophil levels over 500.000 cells/µL, the threshold value for infection risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, on day 15 post-irradiation (uncorrected p-value 0.028) but this difference was no longer statistically significant upon multiple-comparison correction. We observed no major differences in the recovery of red blood cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref>). Taken together, our findings suggest that the loss of TGR5 leads to a BM stroma that is beneficial for early hematopoietic recovery.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the current study, we aimed at investigating the role of TGR5 on BM homeostasis. We showed that TGR5 loss-of-function leads to the accumulation of adipocytic precursors and a simultaneous loss of BMAT, suggesting that TGR5 is necessary for the <italic>in vivo</italic> maturation of BM adipocytes in young male mice. We also found that <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice receiving BM transplantation after lethal irradiation recover faster than their <italic>Tgr5<sup>+/+</sup></italic> counterparts, which could be a consequence of the accumulation of adipocyte precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, a decrease of lipidated adipocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>The BM adipocyte differentiation axis is gaining attention as a fundamental component of bone and blood physiology, with several recent studies focusing on the BM stroma population as a key player in the maintenance of the balance between bone and BM space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Ablation of the BM adipocyte precursor population leads to massive accumulation of bone in the medullary cavity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> which in turn reduces the volume available for hematopoietic tissue. In agreement with this model, we observe that male <italic>Tgr5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice display an increase in adipocytic precursors, a decrease in bone, and an expansion of CD45<sup>+</sup> cells in the BM.</p>
<p>BMAT has been described as a highly dynamic fat depot that responds to dietary changes, but it has distinct characteristics compared with extramedullary fat, both from a biological and regulatory perspective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. For instance, and surprisingly, both nutrient deprivation (e.g. caloric restriction and anorexia) and excess (e.g. HFD feeding) result in BMAT expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Although counterintuitive, this nutrient-mediated control of BMAT ensures energy conservation in BM to support the energy-consuming process of hematopoiesis and bone remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> . Another difference between BMAT and peripheral adipose tissues is the absence of HFD-induced pro-inflammatory response in the BMAT compared with the latter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. While the role of TGR5 in extramedullary adipose tissues has been extensively studied, and shown to be important for beige remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, lipolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, and protection against diet-induced immune infiltration of the white adipose tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, the effects of an activated TGR5 signaling pathway in BMAT and its impact on hematopoiesis is unknown and will require future investigation. Of note, the BA ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is routinely used in clinics in the context of BM transplantation, where supplementation with UDCA has been shown to reduce post-transplant complications and improve overall survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Available reports have attributed these benefits to the unique feature of tauro-conjugated form of UDCA (TUDCA) as chemical chaperones, improving protein folding in fetal liver HSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> or after acute BM insult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In addition, UDCA and TUDCA are hydrophilic BAs, and part of their beneficial effects could be a consequence of changes in the hydrophobicity of the BA pool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. However, BAs signal through dedicated BA receptors, but the receptor-mediated signaling of UDCA and TUDCA remains unclear. Although some studies proposed UDCA as a TGR5 agonist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, effects occur mainly at supra-physiological doses of UDCA. In addition, the EC<sub>50</sub> of UDCA for TGR5 is more than 60 times higher than that of the strongest endogenous TGR5 agonist, lithocholic acid (LCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, indicating that UDCA is a poor TGR5 agonist. Based on this notion, it will be interesting to investigate whether, in these context-dependent conditions, the benefits of UDCA upon stress hematopoiesis result from the inability to activate TGR5 signaling in the BMAT. Future work will be needed to confirm this possibility.</p>
<p>Finally, novel therapeutic strategies could be envisioned in the future to pharmacologically mimic TGR5 inhibition in the BMAT. Although several selective TGR5 agonists have been developed, only a few TGR5 antagonists have been discovered, namely triamterene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> and SBI-115<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. However, these compounds have only been used <italic>in vitro,</italic> and additional <italic>in vivo</italic> research and optimization will be required to pharmacologically block TGR5 in the context of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or other conditions linked to stress hematopoiesis, in which a fast production of mature blood cells is required. Our results indicate that deletion of TGR5 modulates the BM adipocyte lineage and suggest that strategies aimed at blocking the activity of this receptor might be therapeutically attractive.</p>

<p>For transplantation assays, recipient mice were irradiated (lethal x-ray irradiation 8.5 Gy, split in two 4.25 Gy doses 4 h apart using an RS-2000 X-ray irradiator (RAD SOURCE). Transplanted cells were administered the day following irradiation via tail-vein injection. For two weeks after lethal irradiation, mice were treated in drinking water with paracetamol (500 mg Dafalgan in 250 ml water). No antibiotics were provided in drinking water.

<p>Bone microarchitecture was evaluated according to the ASBMR guidelines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> using a custom CTan (Bruker, Belgium) script for automatic segmentation of trabecular bone in the distal femoral VOI, which was set 100 slices proximal to the distal growth plate and extended 200 slices towards the femoral diaphysis (slice thickness of 0.010 mm). The threshold used to binarize the calcified tissue was 40 on a 0-255 scale. Reconstruction of the scans was performed using NRecon (Bruker, Belgium) and further analysis were performed using CTan (Bruker, Belgium) with the minimum for CS to image conversion set at 0 and maximum set at 0.14.

<title>Cell extraction</title>
<p>Culture of primary BMSCs was performed as reported in the literature <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. 8-12-week-old male mice were used for these experiments. To isolate BMSCs from the BM, we collected femora and tibias, cut the epiphyses, and placed the bones in a 200 μL pipette tip with its end cut to fit in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Bones were spun at 10.000 g for 10 seconds to flush out the BM from the medullary cavity. The BM plug was then transferred to a 15 mL conical tube containing 10 mL of ascorbic-acid free αMEM (containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin) and this suspension filtered through a 70 μm mesh filter prior to plating in a 100 mm cell culture dish (Corning, USA). Cells were replated 72 hours later at a density of 62.500 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in tissue-culture treated 12-well plates (i.e., 250.000 cells/well) and grown to confluency prior to differentiation. Culture medium was refreshed every other day until confluency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For CFU-F assays, BM was obtained in a similar manner and plated at a density of 1 million cells per well of a tissue-culture treated 6-well plate (i.e., 100.000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>). CFU-F cultures were kept in αMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and stained on day 7 post-plating with 0.1% toluidine blue in 10% formalin.</p>

<title>Media composition and differentiation cocktail</title>
<p>Differentiation into osteoblasts was started once confluency was reached. For osteoblastic differentiation, the base culture medium of ascorbic-acid free αMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin was supplemented with L-ascorbic acid (final concentration 8 mM) and β-glycerophosphate (final concentration 1 mM) and refreshed every other day until the endpoint of the assay.</p>
<p>Differentiation into adipocytes was started once confluency was reached. For adipocytic differentiation, base culture medium was high-glucose (4.5 g/L) DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin was used. Adipocytic induction medium containing dexamethasone (1 μM), isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX, 0.5 mM), insulin (2 μM) and rosiglitazone (20 μM) was prepared. Cells were cultured in adipocytic differentiation medium for 4 days with refreshing on day 2. On day 4, culture medium was changed to maintenance medium, prepared by supplementing the base medium with only insulin (2 μM) and rosiglitazone (20 μM). Cells were kept in maintenance medium until the endpoint (Day 7 post-differentiation) with no medium refreshing.</p>

<title>Differentiation stains</title>
<p>For alkaline phosphatase (ALP) stain of osteoblast cultures, one tablet of SigmaFast (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 10 mL distilled water. Osteoblasts were fixed in 10% formalin for 1 minute, washed once with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 and incubated in the staining solution for 6 minutes. Cells were then washed with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 and imaged.</p>
<p>For alizarin red (AR) stain of calcium deposits in osteoblastic cultures after ALP staining, cells were washed once with distilled water and incubated for 45 minutes with AR stain (prepared fresh with 2 g of alizarin red in 100 mL distilled water and pH adjusted to 4.2). Cells were then washed with distilled water 4 times and imaged.</p>
<p>For Oil Red O (ORO) staining of adipocyte cultures, we fixed the cells in 10% formalin for 1 hour at room temperature. In the meantime, we filtered the ORO stock solution through filter paper as described in the literature <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Cells were stained with ORO for 15 minutes, washed 6 times with distilled water, imaged, and incubated for 10 minutes with 100% isopropanol to solubilize the stain. ORO was quantified using an iD3 plate reader (Agilent, USA) set to measure absorbance at 490 nm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Digital holographic microscopy</title>
<p>Digital holographic imaging was performed in black wall 96-well imaging plates (Corning, 353962) using Transmission DHM® T1000 (Lyncée Tec, Switzerland). Plates were pre-coated with Poly-ornithine (Sigma,100 mg/L) to prevent cell detachment. The cells were imaged live and without prior liquid manipulation using a 20x/0.4 NA microscope objectives. The best-focus phase images were reconstructed automatically in MATLAB (MathWorks, USA) from the acquired holograms and the average quantitative phase signal or optical path difference (OPD) was automatically measured using a fixed threshold value.</p>

<p>This study investigates the role of the bile acid receptor TGR5 in adult hematopoiesis of the mouse model. The findings are potentially <bold>useful</bold> because the loss of TGR5 leads to dysregulation of bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) that has emerging regulatory functions. However, the study is still <bold>incomplete</bold> because the mechanism of TGR5 is not clear, the stromal cells expressing TGR5 have not been well defined, and there is not strong evidence for the role of TGR5 in recovery from transplant stress.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Alonso-Calleja and colleagues explore the role of TGR5 in adult hematopoiesis at both steady state and post-transplantation. The authors utilize two different mouse models including a TGR5-GFP reporter mouse to analyze the expression of TGR5 in various hematopoietic cell subsets. Using germline Tgr5-/- mice it's reported that loss of Tgr5 has no significant impact on steady-state hematopoiesis, with a small decrease in trabecular bone fraction, associated with a reduction in proximal tibia adipose tissue, and an increase in marrow phenotypic adipocytic precursors. The authors further explored the role of stroma TGR5 expression in the hematopoietic recovery upon bone marrow transplantation of wild-type cells, although the studies supporting this claim are weak. Overall, while most of the hematopoietic phenotypes have negative results or small effects, the role of TGR5 in adipose tissue regulation is interesting to the field.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
• This is the first time the role of TGR5 has been examined in the bone marrow.</p>
<p>
• This paper supports further exploration of the role of bile acids in bone marrow transplantation and possible therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
• The authors fail to describe whether niche stroma cells or adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs) express TGR5.</p>
<p>
• Although the authors note a significant reduction in bone marrow adipose tissue in Tgr5-/- mice, they do not address whether this is white or brown adipose tissue especially since BA-TGR5 signaling has been shown to play a role in beiging.</p>
<p>
• In Figure 1, the authors explore different progenitor subsets but stop short of describing whether TGR5 is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).</p>
<p>
• Are there more CD45+ cells in the BM because hematopoietic cells are proliferating more due to a direct effect of the loss of Tgr5 or is it because there is just more space due to less trabecular bone?</p>
<p>
• In Figure 4 no absolute cell counts are provided to support the increase in immunophenotypic APCs (CD45-Ter119-CD31-Sca1+CD24-) in the stroma of Tgr5-/- mice. Accordingly, the absolute number of total stromal cells and other stroma niche cells such as MSCs, ECs are missing.</p>
<p>
• There are issues with the reciprocal transplantation design in Fig 4. Why did the authors choose such a low dose (250 000) of BM cells to transplant? If the effect is true and relevant, the early recovery would be observed independently of the setup and a more robust engraftment dataset would be observed without having lethality post-transplant. On the same note, it's surprising that the authors report ~70% lethality post-transplant from wild-type control mice (Fig 4E), according to the literature 200 000 BM cells should ensure the survival of the recipient post-TBI. Overall, the results even in such a stringent setup still show minimal differences and the study lacks further in-depth analyses to support the main claim.</p>
<p>
• Mechanistically, how does the loss of Tgr5 impact hematopoietic regeneration following sublethal irradiation?</p>
<p>
• Only male mice were used throughout this study. It would be beneficial to know whether female mice show similar results.</p>

<p>Summary: In this manuscript, the authors examined the role of the bile acid receptor TGR5 in the bone marrow under steady-state and stress hematopoiesis. They initially showed the expression of TGR5 in hematopoietic compartments and that loss of TGR5 doesn't impair steady-state hematopoiesis. They further demonstrated that TGR5 knockout significantly decreases BMAT, increases the APC population, and accelerates the recovery upon bone marrow transplantation.</p>
<p>Strengths: The manuscript is well-structured and well-written.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: The mechanism is not clear, and additional studies need to be performed to support the authors' conclusion.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The nature of BMAT and how it relates to brown, white or brown/beige adipose tissue has been a persistent question in the field. Our understanding is that BMAT is currently considered a distinct adipose depot that is neither white nor brown/beige. BMAT does not express UCP1 to an appreciable extent, with reports showing its expressing possibly detecting contamination by tissues surrounding bone (Craft et al., 2019). Beyond this consideration, as the regulated BMAT in TGR5-/- mice is almost absent, determination of the brown/beige vs white nature of the regulated BMAT remains technically challenging.</p>

<p>In Figure 1, the authors explore different progenitor subsets but stop short of describing whether TGR5 is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).</p>

<p>Figure 1 of the originally submitted manuscript described TGR5 expression in committed myeloid progenitors (CMP, GMP and MEP).

<p>• Are there more CD45+ cells in the BM because hematopoietic cells are proliferating more due to a direct effect of the loss of Tgr5 or is it because there is just more space due to less trabecular bone?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we do not have direct evidence to address this question, we see approximately an average 20% increase in CD45+ cell counts in the baseline Tgr5-/- mice. The absolute volume of bone and BMAT lost in these animals does not account for 20% of the total volume of the medullary cavity, so we speculate that the increase in CD45+ counts is not due exclusively to an increase in available volume.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• In Figure 4 no absolute cell counts are provided to support the increase in immunophenotypic APCs (CD45-Ter119-CD31-Sca1+CD24-) in the stroma of Tgr5-/- mice. Accordingly, the absolute number of total stromal cells and other stroma niche cells such as MSCs, ECs are missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We initially chose not to report the total number of cells per leg, as the processing of the bones for stroma isolation is less homogenous than that of the HSPC populations (which we do by crushing whole bones with a mortar and pestle). Regardless of these considerations, the data for absolute counts of APCs (left panel), the stroma-enriched fraction (CD45-Ter119-CD31- - middle panel) and endothelial cells (CD45-Ter119-CD31+ - right panel) is provided in Author response image 3. Note that the number of cells plated for CFU-F and BMSC in vitro differentiation is constant between the genotypes, thus confirming the importance of ther elative abundance data shown in the submitted version of the manuscript. In conclusion, we have prioritized the data showing the relative overrepresentation of APC progenitors in the BM stroma as measured by flow cytometry in a per cell basis, which is in line with the functional in vitro data. Further studies could address the specific question through 3D wholemount studies once APC in situ markers are firmly characterized.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. On the one hand, we disagree on the relevance of the effect size, as Tgr5-/- mice recover from low levels of platelets significantly faster than the Tgr5+/+ controls. Underlining the relevance, in a clinical setting, G-CSF is administered to patients routinely even if the acceleration of recovery is of 1-2 days (Trivedi et al., 2009).</p>
<p>From the point of view of the mortality, we agree that it is higher than expected. We have suffered from cases of swollen muzzles syndrome in our facilities that have greatly hampered our ability to perform myeloablation experiments (Garrett et al., 2019), as even sublethal doses have resulted in the appearance of severe side effects that are reasons for euthanasia under Swiss legislation. For example, a strong reduction in mobility requires immediate euthanasia. All experiments were performed blinded to genotype allocation, so we can reasonably exclude experimenter bias. Finally, it could be argued that mice with more marked symptomatology leading to euthanasia are more likely to have hematopoietic deficits, which in our case was mostly seen for Tgr5+/+animals. We have therefore chosen to report mortality together with the longitudinal assessment of peripheral blood counts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Mechanistically, how does the loss of Tgr5 impact hematopoietic regeneration following sublethal irradiation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The question of a non-lethal hematopoietic stress is a very relevant one. Unfortunately, and as delineated in the previous point, we have been seriously conditioned by cases of swollen muzzles syndrome (Garrett et al., 2019) that have stopped us from proceeding with more irradiation studies. We will profit from the change of animal facility that will consolidate during the upcoming year Labora(tory of Regenerative Hematopoiesis) to address this point in follow-up studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Only male mice were used throughout this study. It would be beneficial to know whether female mice show similar results.</p>

<p>We agree with this comment, and we expect to include the characterization of BM microenvironment (Figure 3 of the current manuscript) in females in the reviewed version of the manuscript when a suitable cohort becomes available.</p>

<p>We agree with Reviewer #2 that more studies are needed to understand what the role of TGR5 in the hematopoietic system is. We have been hampered in our studies of stress hematopoiesis because of frequent cases of swollen muzzles syndrome (Garrett et al., 2019), which has made difficult to continue with experiments involving myelosuppression (see response to Reviewer #1 as well). Further studies are planned or ongoing, including determining the role of the microbiome on the observed TGR5 bone and hematopoiesis stress phenotypes, but will be the focus of a separate study.</p>
