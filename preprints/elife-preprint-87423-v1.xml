<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Current prevailing knowledge on EMT (epithelial mesenchymal transition) deems epithelial cells acquire the characters of mesenchymal cells to be capable of invading and metastasizing on their own. One of the signature events of EMT is called “cadherin switch”, e.g. the epithelial E-cadherin switching to the mesenchymal Cadherin-11. Here, we report the critical events after EMT that cancer cells utilize cadherin-11 to hijack the endogenous cadherin-11 positive fibroblasts. Numerous 3-D cell invasion assays with high-content live cell imaging methods reveal that cadherin-11 positive cancer cells adhere to and migrate back and forth dynamically on the cell bodies of fibroblasts. By adhering to fibroblasts for co-invasion through 3-D matrices, cancer cells acquire higher invasion speed and velocity, as well as significantly elevated invasion persistence, which are exclusive characteristics of fibroblast invasion. Silencing cadherin-11 in cancer cells or in fibroblasts, or in both, significantly decouples such physical co-invasion. Additional bioinformatics studies and PDX (patient derived xenograft) studies link such cadherin-11 mediated cancer hijacking fibroblasts to the clinical cancer progression in human such as triple-negative breast cancer patients. Further animal studies confirm cadherin-11 mediates cancer hijacking fibroblasts in vivo and promotes significant solid tumor progression and distant metastasis. Moreover, overexpression of cadherin-11 strikingly protects 4T1-luc cells from implant rejection against firefly luciferase in immunocompetent mice. Overall, our findings report and characterize the critical post-EMT event of cancer hijacking fibroblasts in cancer progression and suggest cadherin-11 can be a therapeutic target for solid tumors with stroma. Our studies hence provide significant updates on the “EMT” theory that EMT cancer cells can hijack fibroblasts to achieve full mesenchymal behaviors in vivo for efficient homing, growth, metastasis and evasion of immune surveillance. Our studies also reveal that cadherin-11 is the key molecule that helps link cancer cells to stromal fibroblasts in the “Seed &amp; Soil” theory.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The prevailing concept for the metastasis of mesenchymal-like cancer cells is that they have undergone the EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) process and hence have acquired the mesenchymal cell characteristics of being able to invade by themselves <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. This is evidenced by the synergistic orchestra between the EMT-TFs (EMT-activating transcription factors) signaling network and the cell migration/invasion signaling networks including integrins, MMPs (metalloproteinases), RTKs (Receptor tyrosine kinases) and small GTPases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. EMT has also been suggested to promote primary tumor growth and progression by linking the EMT-TFs signaling to multiple growth factor signalings and cell division signaling in the cancer cells. However controversially, a partial EMT process with adaptive plasticity to the homing microenvironment and/or a complete reversal of EMT process called MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition) might be involved or even required for successful homing and growth of some types of cancer in vivo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Till today, the critical role of EMT in cancer in vivo is still actively debated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In recent years, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been suggested to not only support cancer growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and contribute to the inflammation in the tumor microenvironment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, but also to play an important role in local cancer invasion and cancer distal metastasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. For epithelial-like cancer cells, it is relatively straightforward to understand that they follow fibroblasts created micro-tunnels to invade through 3-D matrices <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> since epithelial-like cancer cells are usually not capable by themselves of invading through a dense 3-D microenvironment filled with extracellular matrices. However, for mesenchymal-like cancer cells, the story becomes much more complicated. In a solid tumor microenvironment, with both mesenchymal-like cancer cells and fibroblasts which can invade through 3-D matrices by themselves, a simple question to ask would be whether fibroblasts are facilitating or dampening the mesenchymal cancer cell invasion.</p>
<p>With the above question left to be answered in detail, recent studies on the co-invasion of these two mesenchymal cell types in the same 3-D microenvironment have reported that fibroblasts facilitate cancer cell invasion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and a direct contact between human lung cancer cells and fibroblasts is essential during their co-invasion through 3-D matrices, however the detailed mechanisms are largely unknown <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Cadherin-11, also called OB-cadherin, a type II classical cadherin, was initially discovered in osteoblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. In the past twenty years, the Brenner lab and peers have observed that cadherin-11 is also specifically expressed in fibroblasts from various tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. It has also been reported that there is a strong positive correlation between the protein expression level of cadherin-11 in breast cancer cells and the severity of their metastasis in vivo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The cadherin expression switch from E-cadherin to cadherin-11 in cancer cells has also been defined as one of the major cancer EMT markers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Cadherins regulate homophilic cell-to-cell adhesion, which has been classically defined as one type of cadherin binds to the same type of cadherin on the other cell in trans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Such cadherin adherens junction (AJ) formation happens generally in the same cell types. Interestingly, in a solid tumor microenvironment, there are cadherin-11 expressions in both mesenchymal-like cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts. Thus, it is the homophilic adhesion at the molecular level (cadherin-11 to cadherin-11), but heterophilic adhesion at the cellular level (cancer cells to fibroblasts). Hence, in this study, we focused on the critical post EMT events happening after the cadherin switch from E-cadherin to cadherin-11 in cancer cells. We scrutinized the role of cadherin-11 dependent cancer-to-fibroblast adhesion in multiple 3D ex vivo cell co-invasion models. We then determined the correlation and clinical relevance of cadherin-11 mediated cancer hijacking fibroblasts in human breast cancer progression by employing most up-to-date bioinformatics databases. We further studied how such cadherin-11 mediated cancer hijacking fibroblasts post EMT events contribute to cancer growth, local invasion, distant metastasis, progression and immune rejection against tumor implants in multiple mouse models in vivo.</p>

<title>Cadherin-11 positive cancer cells form adherens junctions (AJs) with fibroblasts</title>
<p>The adherens junction has been defined as a cell-cell junction where the cadherins on one cell bind to the same type of cadherins on the other cell (homophilic binding). Hence, it has been largely studied in cultures of a single cell type <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Adherens junction formation also requires a whole set of intracellular AJ structural proteins, such as catenins, to stabilize such cell-to-cell cadherin binding. It is not known if the cancer cells that express cadherin-11 have enough molecular machinery to be capable of forming stable AJs with fibroblasts that endogenously express abundant cadherin-11 proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. To address this question, we first cocultured MDA-MB-231 or BT549 breast cancer cells, which inherently express cadherin-11 proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, with primary human fibroblasts and stained for cadherin-11 protein. The results confirmed cadherin-11 AJ formation between these human cancer cells and human fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>).</p>

<title>Cancer cells hijack fibroblast cell bodies for invasion through 3D matrices</title>
<p>Next, to observe the cell co-invasion capabilities of these cancer cells and fibroblasts, we developed a “matrigel dam” directional 3D cell invasion assay in which we can adjust the serum concentration or the matrigel dam width to control cell invasion speed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). We determined that 20% serum driving cell invasion through a 1 cm wide matrigel dam showed a significant invasion speed difference between fibroblasts and cancers during their individual invasion in this assay. Pure fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, middle panels) invaded much faster with much higher persistence than the pure cancer cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, right panels) under the same conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E, F</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). However, strikingly, when fibroblasts and cancer cells were mixed together (1:1 ratio), these cancer cells physically associated with the fibroblasts and they managed to invade faster and also as persistently as the fibroblasts in this assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, left panels, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E, F</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">G</xref>, Video 1, 2 &amp; 3), like taking a high-speed train for faster travel.</p>
<p>High magnification zoom-in confocal imaging with elevated offsets on the red fluorescence channel revealed that cancer cells physically stayed adhered to the fibroblasts and migrated back and forth on the fibroblast body with high dynamics when these fibroblasts invaded through the 3-D matrix (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">I</xref>, Video 4). We also observed that fibroblasts formed long and thin cell body protrusions at the invasion front to invade through the 3-D matrix and cancer cells remained physically adhered to these long and thin fibroblast protrusions throughout the co-invasion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). In such cancer cell-fibroblast co-invasion, almost none of the cancer cells invaded without adhering to fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">I</xref>, Video 4). Multiphoton microscopy imaging of a large cell population of cancer cells and fibroblasts during their co-invasion through 3D matrices in another cell invasion assay also confirmed strong physical adhesions between the cancer cells and the fibroblasts during their co-invasion (Figure S1A &amp;B).</p>
<p>To avoid the possible concerns of cells touching the glass surface beneath the matrigel dam during invasion, a possible mixed 2.5-D <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> and 3-D cell invasion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), we employed a full 3-D spheroid cell invasion assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Interestingly in such assays, pure cancer cells expressing cadherin-11 did not invade much out of the spheroids into the surrounding 3-D matrices. By contrast, we observed significant cell invasion in all the spheroids that were composed of pure fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, upper panels, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). When these cancer cells were mixed with fibroblasts in a 1:1 ratio (total cell numbers were maintained the same in all spheroids), we again observed striking cancer cell invasion together with the fibroblasts. Further, the cell bodies of many cancer cells partially co-localize with the cell bodies of the leading fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom panels and zoom panels), confirming a proximal physical contact between cancer cells and fibroblasts during their co-invasion, as previously observed in our live cell imaging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">I</xref>, Video 4).</p>

<p>Next, we sought to confirm such cancer cell and fibroblast co-invasion at the single-cell level without forcing proximal physical contacts by mixing thousands of cells in high densities to begin with as in the previous two cell invasion assays. By employing a microfluidic cell invasion device that is able to limit flow to allow just a couple of cells to pass through a narrow tunnel filled with 3-D matrices (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, we observed such “cell hijacking” between one single cancer cell and one single fibroblast. It is important to point out that both cells started their own invasion as two separated single cells without any contact and such “cell hijacking” happened at the first contact as soon as they touched each other (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> &amp; Video 5). Interestingly, when the cancer cell was caught by the fibroblast, the cancer cell body almost totally rounded up while the fibroblast still maintained its invasive cell shape in the 3-D matrices. This suggests the cancer cell gave up its self-invasion but took the “train” (fibroblast) to travel. Thus, it is reasonable to describe such co-invasion as the cancer cell “hijacking” the fibroblast, but not vice versa (Video 5).</p>

<title>Co-invasion by cancer cells hijacking fibroblasts is cadherin-11 dependent</title>
<p>As cadherin-11 AJs can form between these cancer cells and fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>), we next sought to determine the role of cadherin-11 in regulating such cancer cells hijacking fibroblasts for co-invasion. First, we confirmed that cadherin-11 siRNA successfully downregulated cadherin-11 protein expression in these cells (Figure S2A &amp; B). In the same 3-D spheroid cell invasion assay as described previously, we observed that cadherin-11 downregulation promoted cell dissemination in these breast cancer cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) when they were cultured alone, suggesting that same cell adhesion suppresses invasion of these cancer cells. In contrast, cadherin-11 downregulation inhibited cell invasion in a culture of sole fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, we observed totally opposite cell invasion behaviors by equivalently perturbing cadherin-11 in human cancer cells and human primary fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>), which is not a too big surprise for us according to our previous publications about the clear differences between cancer cells and normal fibroblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Cell-to-cell adhesion forces in AJs and TJs (tight junctions) are usually defined as “frictions” during cell dissemination or cell invasion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Hence, it is easy to understand that when cell-to-cell adhesion forces in AJs are weakened by cadherin-11 downregulation, cell dissemination increases in these breast cancer cells. However, our results in fibroblasts from the same spheroid assay suggest that the “cell-to-cell adhesion friction” theory is not enough to explain the phenomenon in fibroblasts. Interestingly, this finding is consistent with previous studies, involving several different 3-D assays which reported that cell invasion significantly decreases in fibroblasts with a cadherin-11 blockade by a cadherin-11-Fc fusion protein or in fibroblasts from cadherin-11-null mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Also, according to our findings above in untransfected wildtype cells, cancer cells alone didn’t invade much while fibroblasts alone did invade a lot in the 3-D spheroid assay, suggesting that fibroblasts do have a strong driving power for invasion but cancer cells don’t in this case (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, by integrating information from all these studies, we see that, in contrast to the effects of cadherin-11 friction forces in regulating cell invasion, there exists an unknown mechanism by which cadherin-11 actually promotes cell invasion in fibroblasts. But such a mechanism could be negligible or nonexistent in all the cancer cells that we have tested (Figure S2C).</p>

<p>Hence, based on these findings, we speculate that fibroblasts are more like the “driving wheel” in a car where cadherin cell-to-cell adhesion friction plays as the resistance force and the pulling force between each adjacent cell concurrently. Whilst in cancer cells, which are more like the “non-driving wheel” in a car, cadherin cell-to-cell adhesion friction most likely only plays as the resistance force because the cancer cells themselves don’t have a potent power for invasion by themselves in the 3-D assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> BT549 alone culture panel; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> BT549 alone culture w/Con siRNA panel). However, in fibroblast and cancer cell coculture, fibroblasts are able to transmit power to drive the cancer cells to invade (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> coculture panel). Next, we started to perturb cadherin-11 in the coculture system by silencing cadherin-11 in cancer cells only, or in fibroblasts only, or in both concurrently. Results revealed that in all cadherin-11 silencing cases, the co-invasion of cancer cells hijacking fibroblasts was significantly de-coupled (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-F</xref>; Figure S3A-D). Interestingly, silencing cadherin-11 in just cancer cells significantly drove fibroblasts to invade farther in the 3D coculture system (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, second row), which further suggests that cadherin cell-to-cell adhesion friction in cancer cells plays as the resistance force. When such resistance force is reduced by cadherin-11 silencing in these cancer cells, the neighboring fibroblasts were freed and let go for invasion. Thus, all these results suggest that, in coculture, fibroblasts transmit power to drive cancer cell invasion and such power transmission (most likely as the force transmission by physical pulling) is cadherin-11 cell-to-cell adhesion dependent.</p>

Interestingly, high expression of cadherin-11 doesn’t correlate with poor patient survival either in 626 patients by using the Overall Survival (OS) analysis method (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) or in 1,764 patients by using the Patient Relapse-Free Survival (RFS) analysis method (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).

Such an interesting finding from the patient survival clinical data clearly positions the significant role of cadherin-11 in cancer metastasis, which links up with our findings of cancer hijacking fibroblasts for invasion in 3D ex vivo studies above (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Next, we sought to analyze the correlation between high expression of cadherin-11 with patient survival in triple negative breast cancer patients by using the DMFS analysis method as in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>. However, due to the very limited number of triple negative breast cancer patient survival data, instead, we analyzed the correlation between high expression of cadherin-11 with ER negative breast cancer patient survival in 68 patients by using the DMFS analysis method.

Such clinical data further validates our findings of high cadherin-11 expression particularly in triple negative breast cancers from the CCLE database analysis as above (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Overall, all the clinical data from these two databases suggests high expression of cadherin-11 in cancer cells, so that they can readily hijack fibroblasts by such a cadherin-11-to-cadherin-11 homophilic adhesion at the molecular level, significantly drives cancer progression in human patients, particularly with high relevance to distant metastasis progression.</p>

<title>Cadherin-11 mediates fibroblasts regulated tumor homing, growth and local invasion in human triple negative breast cancer with human fibroblast co-implantation xenograft mouse models</title>
<p>Optimal cadherin based adherens junction formation is achieved by one type of cadherin binds to the “same” type of cadherin on the other cell in trans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Previous studies on cadherin-11 mediated cancer growth and progression in xenograft mouse models were done by implanting human breast cancer cells (with “human” cadherin-11) into the mouse stroma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. It needs to be pointed out that mouse stromal fibroblasts express “mouse” cadherin-11 but not “human” cadherin-11. Although such a mouse model can be used to test the cadherin-11 intracellular signaling changes in these cadherin-11 bearing cancer cells themselves supported by a “mouse” stromal microenvironment in vivo, it is not suitable for studying the effects of homophilic molecular adhesions of “human” cadherin-11 on the cancer cells to “human” cadherin-11 on the stromal fibroblasts, which actually happens in human.</p>
<p>To focus on homophilic “human” cadherin-11 to “human” cadherin-11 adhesions between cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts, we designed a human triple negative breast cancer with primary human fibroblast co-implantation xenograft mouse model, which is similar to previous in vivo mouse studies done by human cancer and human fibroblast co-implantations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. We found that co-implantation with primary human fibroblasts significantly promoted human cancer cell growth in NOD/SCID mice as visualized by weekly bioluminescence imaging of MDA-MB-231-luc cells, especially at early time points after implantation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, note only MDA-MB-231-luc cells have bioluminescence but fibroblasts don’t). Such a finding was not obvious at later time points possibly because later cancer growth was largely supported by the mouse stroma. Further, co-implantation with primary human fibroblasts significantly raised the successful rate of MDA-MB-231-luc xenograft growth in these mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, B</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, note those small tumors with bioluminescence below 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> photons/s at week 11). As a control, implantation of primary human fibroblasts alone into NOD/SCID mice did not form any tumors (data not shown). Interestingly, in vivo bioluminescence imaging of MDA-MB-231-luc cells revealed that cancer cells with fibroblast co-implantation underwent more local invasion (measured as total tumor area) compared to cancer cells without fibroblast co-implantation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), consistent with the cell invasion findings in the ex vivo 3D spheroid assays. Tumor volume measurements further showed that tumors of MDA-MB-231-luc with fibroblast co-implantation grew much faster and larger than tumors of MDA-MB-231-luc sole implantation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Such a finding was also observed in triple negative breast cancer patient derived cancer (ID: PDX5993) with or without primary human fibroblast co-implantation xenografts in NOG mice.

<p>Previous studies on cadherin-11 in cancer progression in vivo were performed mainly by perturbing cadherin-11 expression level in cancer cells only to determine how cadherin-11 regulates cancer cells themselves, including studies on cadherin-11 regulated intracellular signalings and cadherin-11-to-cadherin-11 homophilic adhesions between the same type of cancer cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. To avoid the effects of perturbing cadherin-11 in altering cancer cells themselves and to focus on how the cadherin-11-to-cadherin-11 adhesions between the two different types of cells regulate human cancer hijacking human stromal fibroblasts in vivo, we chose to perturb cadherin-11 only in primary human fibroblasts in our human triple negative breast cancer with primary human fibroblast co-implantation xenograft mouse model.

<title>Overexpression of cadherin-11 in 4T1 mouse triple negative breast cancer cells to enhance their adhesion to mouse fibroblasts promotes tumor invasion, growth and distal metastasis</title>
<p>Next, we sought to determine the in vivo effects of cadherin-11 overexpression in cancer cells with their enhanced adhesion to stromal fibroblasts. 4T1 murine cancer implantation in BALB/c mice is a widely used immunocompetent triple negative breast cancer implantation mouse model, which very closely mimics triple negative breast cancer progression in human <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Interestingly, although 4T1 cells are very invasive breast cancer cells, they express high levels of epithelial E-cadherin with almost no expression of mesenchymal N-cadherin or cadherin-11 (Figure S4A) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Thus, we firstly made stable cadherin-11 overexpressing 4T1 cell lines and confirmed the overexpression levels by Real-Time qRT-PCR (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Next, in our established ex vivo 3D spheroid assay, we observed that unlike the human BT549 TNBC cell line that showed little invasion on its own (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), 4T1 wildtype cells showed invasion which was not enhanced by cadherin-11 overexpression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, upper panels, and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Furthermore, addition of mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts did not enhance the invasion of 4T1 wildtype cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). NIH3T3 fibroblasts did enhance the invasion of cadherin-11 overexpressing 4T1 cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). In vivo experiments of 4T1 implantation into the mammary pads of BALB/c mice determined that tumors of 4T1 cells with mouse cadherin-11 overexpression grew significantly faster than those of 4T1 wildtype cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). This is not due to an increased proliferation rate (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Moreover, BALB/c mice carrying tumors of 4T1 cells with mouse cadherin-11 overexpression died much earlier than those carrying tumors of 4T1 wildtype cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). Micro-MRI imaging detected large metastatic tumor lesions at multiple lymph nodes under the dorsal neck skin in BALB/c mice carrying tumors of 4T1 cells with mouse cadherin-11 overexpression at the left 4<sup>th</sup> mammary pads. In comparison, Micro-MRI imaging failed to detect any metastatic tumor lesion in BALB/c mice carrying tumors of 4T1 wildtype cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). Overall, all these results suggest that 4T1 TNBC cells with mouse cadherin-11 overexpression can hijack mouse fibroblasts to promote tumor homing, growth, progression and metastasis with much shorter mouse survival in vivo.</p>

<title>Overexpression of cadherin-11 in 4T1 mouse triple negative breast cancer cells with firefly luciferase prevents immune rejection in immunocompetent BALB/c mice in vivo</title>
<p>Recent studies discovered that implantation of 4T1-luc cells into immunocompetent BALB/c mice induces immune rejection against the tumor implant by the mouse immune system through recognition of the firefly luciferase protein as a foreign antigen <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Such a phenomenon is also described on the product sheet of the commercial 4T1-luc cells (PerkinElmer Inc). Initially, we planned the experiments of implanting 4T1-luc cells into BALB/c mice to determine if we could achieve a mild immune rejection so that we were able to observe 4T1-luc cell activities in vivo by bioluminescence imaging. However, a very strong immune rejection against the implanted wildtype 4T1-luc cells was observed. Very unexpectedly, in comparison, a much milder immune rejection was observed in the 4T1-luc cells with stable mouse cadherin-11 overexpression (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A, B</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). To further confirm such an interesting and unexpected finding, we repeated the in vivo mouse experiments with different batches of cells for implantation and results stayed very similar (Figure S5A, B &amp; C). This is not due to a proliferation rate change (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). In comparison, such an immune rejection in immunocompetent BALB/c mice, which can be partially reversed by cadherin-11 overexpression, was not observed in immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice with the implantation of the same 4T1-luc cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E, F</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). Again, similarly to 4T1 cells without luciferase in BALB/c mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D-G</xref>), the tumor progression of 4T1-luc cells with cadherin-11 overexpression was much faster than 4T1-luc wildtype cells in NOD/SCID mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E, F</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). Such an interesting finding suggests that by hijacking mouse stromal fibroblasts in vivo by mouse cadherin-11-to-cadherin-11 adhesions, 4T1-luc cells with stable mouse cadherin-11 overexpression are able to significantly escape from the immune surveillance of the mouse immune system recognizing the firefly luciferase as a foreign antigen, which significantly prevents in vivo immune rejection against such cancer implants.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings firstly suggest that EMT is the origin but may not be the direct cause for cancer progression in vivo. Current prevailing EMT theory suggests epithelial cells undergo EMT so as to acquire the mesenchymal cell characteristics of being able to migrate, invade and metastasize on their own <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. For example, the two widely used human triple negative breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and BT549, have been recognized as very migratory and invasive cancer cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. But these findings were previously observed mostly on 2D in vitro cell culture or Boyden Chamber based transwell cell migration and invasion assays. With the much-improved 3D ex vivo spheroid assays, we have observed that these cells are not very invasive on their own comparing to when they are cocultured with fibroblasts. Meanwhile, the previous in vivo findings of MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells being invasive and metastatic in vivo were observed without considering their ideal physical interactions with fibroblasts in vivo by xenografting these human cancer cells expressing human cadherins into mouse stroma full of mouse cadherins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. The cadherin biology studies have suggested that optimal cadherin-to-cadherin binding is achieved by “homophilic binding” between same types of cadherins not across species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Here we have determined that the “cadherin switch” from E-cadherin to cadherin-11 readily grants cancer cells the capability of hijacking fibroblasts, which significantly promotes cancer progression both in vitro and in vivo. Another example, the long-time deemed very aggressive 4T1 cells actually have only undergone partial EMT without cadherin switch. The only cadherin that 4T1 cells endogenously express is still E-cadherin but not any other mesenchymal cadherins (Figure S4A) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, although they are already very migratory, invasive and aggressive both in vitro and in vivo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. But, when we overexpressed cadherin-11 in 4T1 cells, they became even more aggressive and metastatic in vivo with significantly shorting mouse survival. Thus, we hereby provide significant updates to the EMT theory that the whole process of EMT may not significantly promote cancer progression itself, but the cadherin switch of the EMT process that enhances the interaction between cancer cells and the stroma, such a post-EMT event, might be the direct cause for enhanced cancer progression in human. Such cancer cell physical interactions with fibroblasts in such a short distance, the length of two extracellular regions of cadherin-11 proteins that are bound in trans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, may play further roles in promoting cancer cell proliferation, differentiation, escape from immune surveillance (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>), drug resistance and immunotherapy resistance beyond the studies that we have performed here.</p>
<p>Our study further suggests that EMT is sufficient and MET may not be required for cancer homing. Recent studies have observed the plasticity of EMT in vivo and suggest that the reverse process MET promotes cancer homing and outgrowth at metastatic sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Stable knockdown of PRRX1 or TWIST or both, two of the key EMT-TFs, induced cancer colonization and outgrowth in lung <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. These studies have suggested that a partial or even complete reverse of EMT by the MET process might be involved in cancer homing and outgrowth in metastatic sites and have raised controversies and debates on the EMT theory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. In comparison, we have observed that simply overexpressing the mesenchymal cadherin-11 in 4T1 cells, who endogenously only express E-cadherin, to enhance their adhesions to stromal fibroblasts is sufficient to promote their growth in situ, progression, metastasis and outgrowth in metastatic sites, such as lymph nodes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Our study suggests that the cadherin-11 mediated cancer cell hijacking fibroblasts is enough to promote cancer homing and MET is not required in such cases.</p>
<p>EMT cancer cells may be way smarter than we ever thought. For the cell invasion research field, in addition to the current knowledge of cancer cell self-invasion, cancer cell following fibroblast-made matrix tunnel invasion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, cancer cell coupling with macrophage invasion by an EGF/CSF1 paracrine signaling loop <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, we have discovered a novel cancer cell invasion mechanism of cadherin-11 homophilic adhesion mediated cancer cell hijacking fibroblast invasion. Such cell “hijacking” is achieved by EMT cancer cells, especially triple negative breast cancer cells, expressing fibroblast specific protein cadherin-11 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. This finding might help untangle the puzzle of why cadherin-11 expressing cancer cells are always more metastatic in vivo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Further, our study reveals such an alternative invasion mode when cadherin-11 positive cancer cells are surrounded by fibroblasts. Instead of being trapped and constrained by these neighboring giant cells, cancer cells hijack them by cadherin-11 and go with them. Interestingly, EMT cancer cells can do sole invasion by themselves, but when they manage to adhere to fibroblasts by engaging the cadherin-11-to-cadherin-11 adhesions, they gave up their own mesenchymal invasion but rather take the fibroblast “train” for a co-invasion, which may significantly save tremendous energy that cancer cells have to spend in doing mesenchymal invasion on their own. Such a smart energy saving strategy may further let cancer cells spend their precious energy in other valuable activities such as homing, proliferation and inducing angiogenesis.</p>
<p>Lastly, previous studies have focused on the extracellular intercell signalings between the cancer cells and the stromal fibroblasts in the “Seed and Soil” theory of cancer metastasis and homing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Our study suggests that cadherin-11 can be the key molecule that readily engages EMT cancer cells to the surrounding stroma for enhanced survival, local invasion, distal metastasis, escape from immune surveillance and much more.</p>

Bioluminescence of tumors was measured every week on an IVIS Lumina XR imaging system (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) after intraperitoneal injection of D-luciferin (150 mg/kg, 200 μl). Images were capture every minute for continuous 15 mins and analyzed by the Living Image® software (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Tumor growth was monitored by measuring tumor length (L) and width (W) using Vernier calipers weekly (NOD/SCID mice) or every 2-3 days (BALB/c mice).

<title>Microscopy</title>
<p>For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were labeled with a primary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature or 16 hours at 4°C, followed by secondary antibody labeling for 1 hour, and then mounted on slides with FluorSave™ Reagent (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). For confocal microscopy, images were captured on various confocal microscopes at the Brigham &amp; Women’s Hospital Confocal Microscopy Core Facility, the Analytical Imaging Facility of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the Nikon Imaging Center at Harvard Medical School, the Integrated Imaging Center at Johns Hopkins University, the Multiphoton Microscopy Core Facility at The MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Confocal Microscopy Core Facility at Hong Kong Baptist University. Confocal microscopy was performed by scanning multiple confocal layers along the z-axis. For live-cell imaging, cells were grown in 35 mm glass-bottomed Fluorodishes (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, Florida), and then mounted onto the confocal microscope equipped with a heating chamber warmed to 37 °C and supplied with 10% CO<sub>2</sub>. Sections of confocal images were scanned along the cell z axis every 1 min. After imaging, 3-D stacks of images at each time point were projected into a 2D image. Image reconstruction and quantitative colocalization analyses were performed using MetaMorph imaging software version 7.6.1.0 (Universal Imaging, Chesterfield, PA), Leica LAS X software (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany), Zeiss Zen microscope software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany), ImageJ software or Fiji software, etc.</p>

<p>Cells were pre-labeled by using the Vybrant™ Multicolor Cell-Labeling Kit (DiO, DiI, DiD Solutions) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Each spheroid was made by resuspending 8,000 cells in 15 μl media with 0.24% methyl cellulose (4,000 cpi, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) by the hanging drop method <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Each spheroid was then embedded in 400 μl extracellular matrix (ECM) with 6 mg/ml matrigel (Cultrex® BME, Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) and 1.4 mg/ml collagen (Corning® Collagen I, Corning, NY). After the ECM was solidified, 200 μl liquid media were placed on top to cover the ECM. The final serum concentration in all spheroid assay experiments was 6.7% except for the cytokine stimulation spheroid experiments, in which the final serum concentration was 1.3%. The 3-D spheroid made by this hanging drop method is like a 3-D pancake shape with long X-Y axes but a shorter Z axis, which is perfect for confocal imaging.

<p>The authors of this manuscript studied cell-cell interaction between fibroblast and cancer cells as an intermediary model of tumor cell migration/invasion. The work focused on the mesenchymal cadherin-11 (CDH11) which is expressed in the later stages of the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor cellular models, and whose expression is correlated with tumor progression in vivo. The authors employed 3-D matrix and live cell imaging to visualize the nutrient-dependent co-migration of fibroblast and cancer cells. By siRNA-based suppression of CDH11 expression in tumor cell line and/or fibroblast cells, the authors observed decreased co-movement and attenuated growth of mixed xenograft. Accordingly, the authors conclude that post-EMT cancer cells are capable of migrating/invading through CDH11-mediated cell-cell contact.</p>
<p>While the data point to the involvement of CDH11 in fibroblast mediated co-invasion, as it stands it is difficult to fully contextualize these observations within the broader context of the molecular mechanisms underlying metastasis, and in particular do not firmly establish a primary role for CDH11 at this time. The reviewers were specifically concerned about indirect effects of CDH11 manipulation on the physiology and cell biology of the tumor cells, and the possibility that several of the results could be consequences of these changes rather than due specifically to CDH11 mediated interactions.</p>
<p>The reviewers acknowledge the difficulty in fully controlling for these phenomena, and believe this work will be of interest to the large number of researchers investigating the molecular basis for metastasis and specifically of trans cell-type interactions. However until experiments establishing the specific formation and CDH11-mediated interactions in co-invasion are carried out, the author's conclusions about the prominent role of CDH11 should be treated as intriguing, but speculative.</p>

<p>We extend our gratitude to eLife for affording us the opportunity to publish our manuscript as a peer-reviewed preprint. We acknowledge that our exploration of the novel cell hijacking mechanism underlying cancer metastasis remains an evolving endeavor. Being the inaugural study to introduce this innovative phenotype, substantiated by comprehensive in vivo investigations that underscore its real-world significance, we eagerly anticipate forthcoming research in this domain. The inception of the concept of cancer metastasis dates back to the 18th century. Throughout the extensive journey marked by a multitude of millions of publications in this field, our work introduces a transformative and disruptive dimension with the unveiling of this cell hijacking mechanism. Simultaneously, it initiates a deeper exploration of the intricacies within the metastatic process. We sincerely value the meticulous assessment of our work and look forward to subsequent investigations that will elucidate these findings within the broader context of metastasis.</p>

<p>We extend our sincere gratitude to the peer reviewers for their invaluable and constructive feedback. We also wish to express our appreciation for the concise summary of our study and the recognition of the challenges posed by the current technological landscape in fully elucidating the phenotype.</p>
<p>In response to the reviewer's concerns regarding the indirect effects of CDH11 manipulation on the physiology and cellular biology of tumor cells, we encourage readers to revisit Figure 3. In this figure, we not only silenced CDH11 in cancer cells but also in fibroblasts. The outcomes of this intricate experiment have been comprehensively discussed in the main text and are visually summarized in Supplemental Figure S2.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we draw attention to a comprehensive review of our in vivo studies presented in Figure 6, wherein we exclusively silenced CDH11 in fibroblasts without any manipulation of the cancer cells. These findings underscore the molecular underpinnings of CDH11 as the mediator of cell hijacking. Consequently, we are confident that the reviewer's concerns regarding potential side effects of CDH11 manipulation on tumor cells, which could weaken the manuscript's conclusions, can be addressed.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we wish to emphasize that we shared the same initial concerns as our reviewers when designing these studies. We have diligently endeavored to alleviate these concerns through a series of comprehensive in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments. Once again, we strongly encourage readers to explore our supplemental data for a more in-depth understanding. Thank you.</p>
