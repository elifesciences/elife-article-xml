<title>Abstract</title><p>While mitochondria in different tissues have distinct preferences for energy sources, they are flexible in utilizing competing substrates for metabolism according to physiological and nutritional circumstances. However, the regulatory mechanisms and significance of metabolic flexibility are not completely understood. Here we report that the deletion of <italic>PTPMT1,</italic> a mitochondria-based phosphatase, critically alters mitochondrial fuel selection – the utilization of pyruvate, a key mitochondrial substrate derived from glucose (the major simple carbohydrate), is inhibited, whereas the fatty acid utilization is enhanced. <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout does not impact the development of the skeletal muscle or heart. However, the metabolic inflexibility ultimately leads to muscular atrophy, heart failure, and sudden death. Mechanistic analyses reveal that the prolonged substrate shift from carbohydrates to lipids causes oxidative stress and mitochondrial destruction, which in turn results in marked accumulation of lipids and profound damage in the knockout muscle cells and cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, <italic>PTPMT1</italic> deletion from the liver or adipose tissue does not generate any local or systemic defects. These findings suggest that PTPMT1 plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial flexibility and that their balanced utilization of carbohydrates and lipids is essential for both the skeletal muscle and the heart despite the two tissues having different preferred energy sources.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell, produce energy in the form of ATP from the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Mitochondrial abundance and their preferences for metabolic substrates differ in various cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. While mitochondria are abundant in red skeletal muscles such as Soleus, and the heart, the mitochondrial content in white muscles, such as Extensor Digitorum Longus (EDL), is much lower. Mitochondria in the skeletal muscle and heart have distinct preferences for energy sources - skeletal muscle mitochondria prefer glucose (the major simple carbohydrate) as the substrate, whereas cardiac mitochondria mainly use fatty acids as the fuel. Moreover, different types of skeletal muscle cells (fibers) utilize glucose to produce energy in different mechanisms - in slow-twitch oxidative muscle fibers glucose (via pyruvate) is primarily oxidized in mitochondria for energy production, whereas fast- twitch muscle fibers use cytosolic glycolysis to quickly produce energy to support rapid contraction. Nevertheless, both muscle and heart mitochondria are flexible in selecting substrates in response to stress (exercise, fasting, etc.) and under disease conditions (heart failure, diabetes, etc.) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. It remains to be determined how mitochondrial utilization of various competing metabolic substrates is coordinated and whether disruption of mitochondrial flexibility in fuel selection affects the function of the heart and skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>PTPMT1, encoded by nuclear DNA, is localized to the mitochondrion and anchored at the inner membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. It dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs). PIPs are a class of membrane phospholipids that bind to a distinctive set of effector proteins, thereby regulating a characteristic suite of cellular processes, including membrane trafficking and ion channel/transporter functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. PTPMT1 is also involved in the synthesis of cardiolipin by converting phosphotidylglecerol phosphate to phosphotidylglecerol, the precursor of cardiolipin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Global knockout of <italic>PTPMT1</italic> results in developmental arrest and post-implantation lethality <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Our previous studies suggest that PTPMT1 facilitates mitochondrial metabolism largely by dephosphorylation of downstream PIP substrates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> that appear to inhibit mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation but enhance cytosolic glycolysis by activation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, a transporter of four-carbon (C4) dicarboxylate intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle that has been shown to regulate cellular energetics by limiting mitochondrial oxidation of glucose <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. <italic>PTPMT1</italic> is highly expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. In the present study, we exploit <italic>PTPMT1</italic> tissue-specific knockout models to address the role and mechanisms of PTPMT1-facilitated mitochondrial metabolism in these tissues. We find that PTPMT1 plays an important role in facilitating mitochondrial utilization of carbohydrates and that balanced fuel selection is essential for maintaining both muscle and heart functions despite the two tissues having distinct preferences for energy sources.</p>

<title>Knockout of <italic>PTPMT1</italic> from skeletal muscles results in defective contractile function and progressive muscle atrophy</title>
<p>To determine the role of PTPMT1-mediated metabolism in the skeletal muscle and heart, we generated tissue-specific <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout mice (<italic>PTPMT1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>/<italic>CKMM-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic>) by crossing <italic>PTPMT1 floxed</italic> mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> and muscle creatine kinase promoter-driven <italic>Cre</italic> transgenic mice (<italic>CKMM-Cre</italic>), which express the Cre recombinase in the skeletal muscle and heart starting at embryonic day 13 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) showed ∼95% and ∼80% deletion of <italic>PTPMT1</italic> in the skeletal muscle and heart in adult <italic>PTPMT1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>/<italic>CKMM-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). These animals were indistinguishable from their wild-type (WT, <italic>PTPMT1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>/<italic>CKMM-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic>) littermates up to 3 months of age, suggesting that <italic>PTPMT1</italic> deletion did not affect muscle or heart development. The knockout mice exhibited reduced weight gain starting at 4 to 5 months (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Muscle wasting was observed in <italic>PTPMT1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>/<italic>CKMM-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice at 8 months or older. Histopathological examination of skeletal muscles of these knockout mice revealed characteristic changes of muscle atrophy - marked variations in muscle fiber diameters and the presence of ghost fibers or more interstitial space (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, Masson’s trichrome staining revealed increased collagen-rich fibrotic regions in <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout muscles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We then examined <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout mice at 6-8 months before muscle wasting occurred. <italic>PTPMT1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>/<italic>CKMM-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice became fatigued faster and fell more quickly than <italic>PTPMT1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>/<italic>CKMM-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> control animals in wire hang tests, indicating muscle weakness (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In treadmill exercise tests, both male and female knockout mice displayed reduced maximum speed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), endurance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), and distance of the run (Supplemental Figure 1A). To determine whether the reduced muscle strengths of the knockout mice resulted from muscle cell-intrinsic defects, isometric contractile properties of isolated muscles were examined. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> force-frequency measurements were performed on Soleus, a more oxidative muscle with a higher percentage of slow-twitch Type I fibers, and EDL, a more glycolytic muscle with a higher percentage of fast-twitch Type II fibers. Both knockout Soleus and EDL showed decreased optimal length, the length of the muscle at which maximal force was achieved (Supplemental Figure 1, C and D). Specific force production of <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout Soleus (Supplemental Figure 1E) and EDL (Supplemental Figure 1E) was decreased. However, normalized force production was decreased only in knockout Soleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), but not in knockout EDL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). These data suggest that PTPMT1 plays a more important role in oxidative than glycolytic muscle fibers although both knockout Soleus and EDL developed muscle atrophy subsequently.</p>

<p>To determine the impact of PTPMT1 depletion from the skeletal muscle and heart on the metabolism of the whole body, we measured plasma glucose and fatty acid levels and found that they were comparable in <italic>PTPMT1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>/<italic>CKMM-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>PTPMT1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>/<italic>CKMM-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> control mice (Supplemental Figure 2A). Plasma levels of lactate (Supplemental Figure 2B) and lipid metabolic products (Supplemental Figure 2C) in <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout mice were also relatively normal (except that cholesterol and nonesterified fatty acids levels were decreased and marginally increased, respectively, in female knockout mice). Adipokine array assays of the plasma showed no or subtle differences in Adiponectin, Leptin, Lipocalin- 2, ANGPTL3, Resistin, FGF-21, DPPIV, Fetuin A, IGF-1, etc. between <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout and control mice (Supplemental Figure 2D). In addition, no differences in glucose tolerance tests were observed between <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout and control mice (Supplemental Figure 2E). Furthermore, we checked expression levels of key enzymes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism in <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout muscles. No changes in HK2, PKM1, LDHA, DICER1, MCAD (ACADM), ACADL, HADHA, CPT2, or FABP3 were found. However, the expression of CPT1B, was increased in <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout muscles (Supplemental Figure 2, F and G). These results suggest that systemic glucose and lipid metabolism in these tissue-specific knockout mice was not significantly changed, but fatty acid partitioning for oxidation in the mitochondria was elevated in <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout muscles.</p>

<title>PTPMT1 depletion ultimately leads to mitochondrial damage and bioenergetic stress in knockout skeletal muscles</title>
<p>Gömöri trichrome staining revealed ragged red fibers in <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout skeletal muscles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), as observed in various types of human mitochondrial myopathies. Electron microscopic analyses showed that interfibrillar mitochondria in knockout Soleus and EDL were disorganized and enlarged, in contrast to normal mitochondria that typically reside in pairs and position on either side of the Z-disc in control muscles. In addition, there was a massive accumulation of subsarcolemmal mitochondria in the knockout muscles, whereas the content of intermyofibrillar mitochondria decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Although EDL, unlike Soleus, uses more cytosolic glycolysis than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for energy production, the mitochondrial structural changes appeared to be more severe in EDL than Soleus in the knockout mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, a massive accumulation of intramyofibrillar lipids were detected by Oil Red O staining in 6-month or older <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout muscles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Total mitochondrial content in <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout Soleus and EDL also slightly decreased compared to that in control muscles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). ATP levels in both knockout Soleus and EDL decreased significantly compared to WT counterparts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Consistent with these data, the energetic stress sensor, AMP- activated kinase (AMPK), was highly activated in <italic>PTPMT1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>/<italic>CKMM-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> muscles as determined by the phosphorylation levels of Thr<sup>172</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a negative regulator of fatty acid oxidation, was inhibited, as evidenced by a marked increase in the inhibitory phosphorylation of this enzyme (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), implying increased fatty acid oxidation in PTPMT1-depleted mitochondria. In agreement with previous findings that AMPK negatively regulates mTOR signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, mTOR was substantially inhibited. Activities of S6K, S6, and 4E-BP1, key downstream components of mTOR signaling, were also concomitantly decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), indicating diminished anabolic activities and consistent with the muscle atrophy phenotype. Interestingly, Akt activities, as reflected by its phosphorylation levels (Ser<sup>473</sup> and Thr<sup>308</sup>), were increased in <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout skeletal muscles, recapitulating mTOR and raptor (a component of the mTOR complex 1) knockout muscles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Likely due to the cross-talk between Akt and Ras signaling pathways, Erk activities were also slightly increased in these knockout muscles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that muscle atrophy developed in <italic>PTPMT1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>/<italic>CKMM-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice after 6-8 months, to assess the direct impact of <italic>PTPMT1</italic> deletion on mitochondrial metabolism, it is important to examine mitochondria isolated from young <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout mice before the tissue damage. Expression levels of electron transport chain complexes in these PTPMT1-ablated mitochondria were not changed (Supplemental Figure 3A). Total cellular ATP levels in <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout muscles at this age were comparable to those in control tissues at this age (Supplemental Figure 3B), and the knockout muscles did not show bioenergetic/metabolic stress (Supplemental Figure 3C). We also checked LC3-I/II levels in <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout muscles and found no evidence of elevated autophagic activities (Supplemental Figure 3D). These results indicate that the decrease in total cellular ATP levels in older knockout muscles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) was a secondary effect not a direct effect of PTPMT1 depletion.</p>

<title>PTPMT1 loss impairs mitochondrial utilization of pyruvate, whereas the fatty acid utilization is enhanced</title>
<p>We next sought to address the mechanisms by which PTPMT1 loss impacts mitochondrial metabolism. To avoid secondary effects, we examined mitochondrial metabolic activities of <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout muscles in 3-month-old <italic>PTPMT1<sup>fl/fl</sup>/CKMM-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>PTPMT1<sup>+/+</sup>/CKMM-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice. Knockout muscle tissues showed decreased maximal reserve oxidative capacities in the presence of full substrates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), consistent with our previous observations from other <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. We also isolated mitochondria from young skeletal muscles and assessed mitochondrial metabolism in the presence of ADP and a single metabolic substrate by real-time measurement of ATP synthesis-driven oxygen consumption. When pyruvate, a key metabolite derived from glucose, was provided as the sole substrate, ATP synthesis-driven oxygen consumption in PTPMT1-deficient mitochondria was markedly decreased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that mitochondrial pyruvate utilization was impaired in the absence of PTPMT1. Interestingly, we observed enhanced oxygen consumption in these mitochondria when fatty acids were supplied as the fuel (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition, a slightly increased respiratory response in PTPMT1-depleted mitochondria was detected when glutamate, another mitochondrial substrate, was provided (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Importantly, feeding with succinate, the substrate for Complex II of the electron transport chain, resulted in similar oxygen consumption in PTPMT1 null and control mitochondria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), validating the intact function of the electron transport chain in the knockout mitochondria and excluding flavin adenine dinucleotide and quinone-linked deficiencies. These mechanistic data suggest that PTPMT1 plays an important role in facilitating carbohydrate oxidation in mitochondria.</p>

<p>Consistent with the above notion, intramitochondrial pyruvate levels in the mitochondria freshly isolated from <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout muscles decreased by half (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Levels of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), an important metabolite in the TCA cycle, also decreased in the knockout mitochondria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), although steady-state mitochondrial acetyl-CoA levels were not changed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). To further determine if pyruvate transport efficiency may be reduced in PTPMT1-ablated mitochondria, we incubated fresh mitochondria with pyruvate and measured acute production of α-KG from extramitochondrial pyruvate. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>, α-KG production in PTPMT1-ablated mitochondria was indeed decreased compared to that in control mitochondria. Notably, the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), the enzyme that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA to feed the TCA cycle, was not affected in the knockout mitochondria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). These observations together with that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier/transporter (MPC) was comparably expressed in PTPMT1-ablated mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>) suggest that the function of PTPMT1 null mitochondria in uptaking pyruvate was diminished. Possibly due to an adaptive response to the inhibited pyruvate oxidation in the mitochondria, skeletal muscle fiber-type switching occurred in <italic>PTPMT1<sup>fl/fl</sup>/CKMM-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mice.

<p>Oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria yields much more ATP relative to carbohydrates (via pyruvate); however, fatty acid oxidation requires a greater rate of oxygen consumption for a given rate of ATP synthesis than carbohydrates.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mitochondrial flexibility in substrate selection is essential for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis in physiology and under stress; however, the regulatory mechanisms and its significance for various tissues and cell types remain poorly characterized <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. In this study, we have identified an important role of the mitochondrial phosphatase PTPMT1 in maintaining mitochondrial flexibility. The loss of PTPMT1 decreased mitochondrial utilization of pyruvate, a key mitochondrial substrate derived from glucose, whereas fatty acid oxidation was enhanced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Importantly, this prolonged mitochondrial substrate shift causes oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage, ultimately leading to the accumulation of lipids/lipid intermediates in <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout skeletal muscle and cardiac myocytes. Excess lipids/lipid intermediates are known to be toxic to cardiomyocytes (lipotoxicity) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The profound damages in <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout hearts and muscles that occurred subsequently were likely attributed to these accumulated lipids, although other factors, such as decreased anabolic activities (as demonstrated by diminished mTOR signaling) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), could also contribute to these phenotypes. The mitochondrial and tissue damages combined with the resulting energetic stress finally led to muscle atrophy and heart failure in the knockout mice.</p>
<p>One of the important findings in this report is that persistent mitochondrial fuel switch from pyruvate to fatty acids is detrimental for both cardiac and skeletal muscles despite the two tissues having different preferred energy sources. Glucose is the major energy source for skeletal muscles. It is used for energy production mainly in mitochondria in oxidative red muscles or through cytosolic glycolysis in glycolytic white muscles. Glucose is also the main energy source for the developing heart, but the adult heart primarily utilizes fatty acids to produce ATP. Indeed, when mitochondrial utilization of pyruvate was inhibited by <italic>PTPMT1</italic> deletion, heart dysfunction developed much later than skeletal muscle dysfunction. Interestingly, our data from these animal models suggest that efficient carbohydrate oxidation in mitochondria and mitochondrial balanced fuel selection are critically important for both oxidative and glycolytic muscles as well as the adult heart, but not for the development of the skeletal muscle and heart. Despite enhanced fatty acid and glutamate oxidation and that energy homeostasis was initially maintained in <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout muscle cells and cardiomyocytes due to metabolic adaptations or activation of alternative energy-producing pathways, these knockout cells later still showed energy deficits due to oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage that occurred subsequently. <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout hepatocytes or adipocytes did not display such secondary effects (mitochondria and cell damages). This is possibly because the requirement of carbohydrate oxidation for energy production in hepatocytes and adipocytes is lower than that in skeletal muscle cells and cardiomyocytes, and/or <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout hepatocytes and adipocytes did not need to uptake excessive fatty acids in the effort to maintain energy homeostasis. Another possibility is that the capabilities of hepatocytes and adipocytes to process fatty acids and to clear lipid metabolites (through cholesterol synthesis and cholesterol exportation out of the cell) are much stronger than muscle cells and cardiomyocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Another important finding in this report is that PTPMT1 plays a major role in governing the metabolic fate of pyruvate and maintaining mitochondrial flexible substrate utilization. Pyruvate is at the central branch point of mitochondrial oxidation and cytosolic glycolysis in glucose metabolism − It can enter the mitochondrion for oxidation or be reduced to lactate in the cytosol. Our data suggest that inhibited mitochondrial utilization of pyruvate is most likely responsible for the remodeled metabolism in <italic>PTPMT1</italic> knockout cells since ATP synthesis-driven oxygen consumption of PTPMT1-ablated mitochondria was greatly reduced with pyruvate as the sole substrate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Moreover, acute production of α-KG from extramitochondrial pyruvate was indeed decreased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>).</p>
<p>The precise mechanism by which PTPMT1 facilitates mitochondrial utilization/uptake of pyruvate remains to be further determined. PTPMT1 is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane where pyruvate transporters reside. This phosphatase dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. We have shown previously that PIPs directly promote fatty acid-induced activation of UCP2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. UCP2, unlike UCP1, is a C4 metabolite transporter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Elevated UCP2 activity inhibits mitochondrial oxidation of glucose but enhances cytosolic glycolysis although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. PTPMT1 depletion likely leads to the buildup of downstream PIP substrates in the mitochondrial inner membrane, which in turn remodel mitochondrial energy source selection by enhancing UCP2 function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> [UCP2 levels in PTPMT1-ablated mitochondria were not changed (Supplemental Figure 3A, 7B)]. It may also be possible that the accumulated PIPs directly inhibit the mitochondrial pyruvate transporter MPC. It is important to note that PTPMT1 was reported to be involved in the synthesis of cardiolipin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> which is one of the major components of the mitochondrial inner membrane and that plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial membrane stability and dynamics. Thus, it may also be possible that PTPMT1 depletion decreases mitochondrial pyruvate utilization through reduced cardiolipin synthesis. Comprehensive metabolomic analyses for <italic>PTPMT1</italic>-deleted cells would provide additional insights into the mechanisms underlying the metabolic alterations caused by PTPMT1 loss.</p>
<p>In summary, in this report, we provide evidence that the mitochondria-based multi-functional phosphatase PTPMT1 plays an important role in facilitating mitochondrial utilization of pyruvate and maintaining mitochondrial flexibility for balanced substrate selection. Prolonged mitochondrial energy sources switch from carbohydrates to lipids such as that caused by PTPMT1 depletion is detrimental for the skeletal muscle and heart but not the liver and adipose, ultimately leading to muscle atrophy and heart failure.</p>

<title><italic>Ex vivo</italic> muscle contractility assay</title>
<p>Intact Soleus and EDL isolated from mice were used for the collection of isometric force data using an eight-chamber system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Data were analyzed with ADInstruments PowerLab software customized for these experiments. Muscles were first equilibrated for 20 min to mimic conditions of normal activity (low duty cycle, ∼1%). Muscles were then subjected to the length-force relationship test to determine the optimal length at which maximal force is achieved. Muscles were stimulated with frequencies ranging from 1 to 130 Hz to generate force <italic>versus</italic> frequency relationships. From these relationships, the frequency producing maximal tetanic force (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>) was then used for the rest of the experiments. Muscles were stimulated every minute with <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> for 5–10 min to assure that the preparation was stable at which point the tissue bathing buffer was replaced with one containing 0 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> + 0.1 mM EGTA. The muscles were then stimulated every minute at <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> to determine the impact of the removal of external calcium on muscle force. After 20 min, the 0 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer was washed out and replaced by a buffer containing 2.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and the muscles were stimulated every minute for 20 min at <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> to allow for force recovery. After force measurement protocols, muscle dimensions and masses were measured for the determination of cross-sectional normalized forces (relative force). Muscle force was reported as absolute force (mN) and force normalized to the following muscle physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA, N/cm2) equation as previously reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> with a small modification in that in our final length calculation, we considered the length to weight ratio of muscle fibers for stretched muscles (tendon-to- tendon) of <italic>ex vivo</italic> muscles in contractility chambers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> as the actual muscle fiber size was smaller than the length of the measured stretched muscle. Since the PCSA is very sensitive to length, by adjusting to the length of the muscle fiber, force estimation was more precise. Thus, our final formula was: Muscle force (N/cm2) = (force (g) x (muscle length (cm) x 0.75 (EDL) or 0.85 (Soleus) x 1.06 (muscle density))/(muscle weight (g) x 0.00981).</p>

<title>Echocardiography</title>
<p>Echocardiographic studies were performed by trained investigators at Emory University Department of Pediatrics Animal Physiology Core as previously reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Mice were anesthetized with 1-2% isoflurane/100% oxygen continuously and positioned on a warming platform set to 37°C. The heart rate was controlled at 360-460 beats per minute to standardize recordings. ECG and respiratory rate were monitored for physiological assessment while scanning. A Vevo 2100 digital high-frequency ultrasound system (FujiFilm Visualsonics Inc, Toronto, ON, Canada) equipped with an MS400, 30-MHz transducer was used to acquire the images. Interventricular septal thicknesses (IVS), left ventricular internal dimensions (LVID) and posterior wall thicknesses (LVPW) at diastole and systole (IVS-d, LVID-d, LVPW-d and IVS-s, LVID-s, LVPW-s) were measured from M-mode images in both parasternal long axis and short-axis views. Left ventricle volume at diastole and systole (LV Vol-d, LV Vol-s), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) were calculated as the following formula (Vevo 2100 Workstation Software VisualSonics INC, Toronto, ON, Canada): LV Vol- d(ul) = [(7.0 /(2.4 + LVID-d)] * LVID-d<sup>3</sup>); LV Vol-d(ul) = [(7.0 /(2.4 + LVID-s)] * LVID-s<sup>3</sup>); EF (%) = 100 * [(LV Vol-d – LV Vol-s) / LV Vol-d]; FS (%) = 100 * [(LVID-d – LVID-s) / LVID-d]. The mitral valve flow Doppler velocities were measured by the apical four-chamber view. Early (E) and late (A) mitral valve inflow velocity and mitral valve E to A ratios (MV E/A) were also obtained.</p>
<p>Echocardiographic speckle-tracking based strain measurement was also performed using the VevoStrain<sup>TM</sup> application (VisualSonics Vevo 2100 Imaging System, FujiFilm VisualSonics, Inc, Toronto, ON, Canada) which produces velocity strain and time-to-peak analyses on myocardial wall images. The B-Mode cine loop was acquired for Vevo Strain analysis. The qualified consecutive cardiac cycles were selected between one respiration cycle and the next in the EKG panel. Both endocardium and epicardium were traced simultaneously and semi-automatically at the parasternal long-axis view. VevoStrain builds the dynamic LV wall trace for all frames in the cine loop. Velocity, displacement, strain, and strain rate data were calculated based on a speckling-tracking algorithm provided by the Vevo software. Data on overall cardiac tissue performance, segmental time-to-peak, and segmental phase quantification were also collected.</p>

<p>The manuscript entitled, &quot;Loss of PTPMT1 limits mitochondrial utilization of carbohydrates and leads to muscle atrophy and heart failure,&quot; by Zheng, et al., is focused on assessing the role of deletion of PTPMT1, a mitochondria-based phosphatase, in mitochondrial fuel selection. Authors show that the utilization of pyruvate, a key mitochondrial substrate derived from glucose, is inhibited, whereas fatty acid utilization is enhanced. Importantly, while the deletion of PTPMT1 does not impact development of skeletal muscle or heart, the metabolic inflexibility leads to muscular atrophy, heart failure, and sudden death. Mechanistically, authors claim that the prolonged substrate shift from carbohydrates to lipids causes oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to accumulation of lipids and muscle cell and CM damage in the KO. Interestingly, PTPMT1 deletion from the liver or adipose tissue does not generate any local or systemic defects. Authors conclude that PTPMT1 plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial flexibility and that the balanced utilization of carbohydrates and lipids is essential for skeletal muscle and heart. While interesting and authors did a ton of experiments for this project, several major concerns exist. First, because both the CKMM- and the MYHC-Cre express early, during development , it seems the effects of the deletion of PTPMT1 are more likely be specific to defects in muscle and cardiac development rather than postnatal, especially since loss of PTPMT1 affects mTOR activity; indeed, previous reports have shown that selective deletion of mTOR or raptor in skeletal muscle during embryonic development leads to a reduction in postnatal growth and the development of late-onset myopathy and premature death around 6 to 8 months of age. The effects of the deletion in muscle seem eerily similar and therefore likely mechanistically function the same -embryonically, as has been previously suggested. This is also true for cardiac abnormalities, where developmental defects can manifest in mice as they age after at least 3-4 months and decreased mTOR activity can lead to significant cardiac dysfunction and failure (similarly to the effects observed here by the authors). To prove one way or another, authors should show developmental data providing evidence that the effects are not occurring at this stage. It is a lot of work, but the right way to differentiate pre- vs post- development functions of PTPMT1 in the muscle and heart, otherwise cannot verify mechanistically what the precise cause for the phenotype may be. Authors could consider generating mice that have inducible Cre drivers. In addition, how is it that the effects of loss of PTPMT1 are similar between muscle and heart given the differences in energy usage and utilization between these two tissues? Increases in AMPK are usually associated with better metabolic outcomes, particularly in the heart. Increased AMPK activation has also been shown to help reduce fat storage, increase insulin sensitivity, reduce cholesterol/triglyceride production, and suppress chronic inflammation. In addition, increases in carnitines are associated with enhanced metabolic function. Carnitines facilitate transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix, triggering cardioprotective effects through reduced oxidative stress, inflammation and necrosis of cardiac myocytes. All of these factors are positive, so how do authors explain this discrepancy in their findings which suggest opposing outcomes- as above, I suggest the explanation is that it is due to developmental effects of deletion of PTPMT1.</p>
<p>Authors attribute much of the pathology in the muscle and heart due to increased lipid accumulation in these tissues; but how do authors explain how hearts and muscle have more fat when the mice are smaller than wt? Is there a difference in energy expenditure in the mice? What about changes in white fat, core temperature or browning of fat? Authors do not mechanistically prove that lipid accumulation is the cause of death in these animals. Rescue experiments should be considered.</p>

<p>Zheng et al. have investigated the effects of PTPMT1 Knock-out on cellular metabolic flexibility. Using several types of appropriate tissue-specific mouse models, the authors have generated data that are both reasonable and broadly significant. While the central mechanism driving the metabolic fuel preference and flexibility remains elusive as the author mentioned in the main text, the finding that the absence of PTPMT1 inhibits glucose (pyruvate) utilization and promotes FAO, resulting in cellular stress and damage, particularly in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, is intriguing and has practical implications for further research. However, some quantitative data are lacking and certain explanations may be misleading, warranting revisions.</p>
