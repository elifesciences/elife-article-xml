<abstract><p>Cohesin is a DNA tethering complex essential for chromosome structure and function. In fission yeast, defects in the cohesin loader Mis4 result in chromosome segregation defects and dysregulated expression of genes near chromosome ends. A genetic screen for suppressors of the thermosensitive growth defect of <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> identified several hypomorphic mutants of the Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1), a conserved kinase that integrates cellular signals to regulate growth and metabolism through substrate-specific phosphorylation. Here, we demonstrate that the TORC1 pathway modulates cohesin functions in chromosome segregation and gene expression. In the context of compromised cohesin loading, the incidence of chromosome segregation defects was modulated by the growth medium in a TORC1-dependent manner. Pharmacological or genetic down-regulation of TORC1 activity restored cohesin binding to its chromosomal sites and improved mitotic chromosome segregation. Notably, reduced TORC1 activity also increased cohesin binding and chromosome transmission fidelity in wild-type cells. These results suggest that environmental cues influence chromosome stability via TORC1. Biochemically, TORC1 co-purified with cohesin and reduced TORC1 activity correlated with decreased phosphorylation of specific residues on Mis4 and cohesin. Mutations in cohesin that mimic the non-phosphorylated state mirrored the effects of TORC1 downregulation, showing that TORC1 is part of the network that controls cohesin phosphorylation to modulate its functions. Finally, we show that the functional interaction between TORC1 and Mis4 extends to the regulation of stress-responsive genes. Our findings reveal a TORC1-cohesin link that may facilitate cellular adaptation to environmental changes. Given that TORC1 inhibitors and calorie restriction extend lifespan in diverse species, this connection raises the intriguing possibility that cohesin-mediated changes in chromosome structure contribute to these effects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The cohesin complex is a pivotal player in genome structure and function. Its activity is critical for a variety of biological processes, including sister chromatid cohesion, nuclear division, DNA replication and repair, and gene expression. Cohesin is an ATP-powered molecular machine that is capable of capturing DNA. Intra-chromosomal DNA capture folds the interphase genome into loops, which contributes to gene regulation, particularly during development and cell fate decisions. Conversely, DNA capture in trans provides cohesion between sister chromatids, which is essential for chromosome segregation and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zheng &amp; Xie, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Davidson &amp; Peters, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Oldenkamp &amp; Rowland, 2022</xref>). The core cohesin complex consists of two Structural Maintenance of Chromosome proteins, Smc1 and Smc3 (Psm1 and Psm3 in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>) whose ATPase heads are bridged by a kleisin subunit (Rad21/Scc1) to which a fourth subunit (hSTAG1-2, spPsc3, scScc3) binds. DNA capture by cohesin requires the so-called loading complex NIPBL/MAU2 (spMis4/Ssl3, scScc2/Scc4) which binds to cohesin and DNA. Inactivation of the cohesin loading machinery before S phase results in the failure of sister-chromatid cohesion establishment and aberrant chromosome segregation during the ensuing mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Furuya <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ciosk <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bernard <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Similarly, DNA loop extrusion is dependent on the NIPBL-Cohesin holocomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Davidson <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Chromatin loops are dynamic structures that form and dissolve on a time-scale of minutes. In human, the DNA binding factor CTCF appears to delineate loop domains, often referred to as topologically associated domains (TADs). Dynamically extruding cohesin complexes are thought to facilitate enhancer-promoter scanning <italic>in cis</italic>. TAD boundaries (insulation) appear regulated as the strengths of CTCF-anchored loop domains are enhanced when mouse embryonic stem cells exit pluripotency. Consistently, mutations in the genes encoding CTCF and cohesin components are linked to human diseases and developmental abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zheng &amp; Xie, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Davidson &amp; Peters, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Oldenkamp &amp; Rowland, 2022</xref>). The remodelling of genome architecture appears particularly important for appropriate gene expression during cell fate decisions, suggesting that signalling pathways should convey cellular cues to cohesin. In this context, a genetic screen in mammalian cells identified a set of kinases that alter chromosome folding when inactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Park <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we reveal a connection between fission yeast cohesin, its loader Mis4 and the Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1). TORC1 is a master regulator of cell growth and metabolism, highly conserved in eukaryotes. The kinase activity of TORC1 is stimulated by a variety of intra- and extracellular signals, including nutrients, growth factors, hormones and cellular energy levels. Once activated, TORC1 promotes cell growth and metabolism through the phosphorylation of multiple effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">González &amp; Hall, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Otsubo <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). In mammalian species, growth factors and cellular energy stimulate the activity of mTORC1 through the Rheb GTPase, and the inhibition of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which functions as a GTPase-activating protein for Rheb. In response to amino acid availability, mTORC1 is activated via RAG GTPases in a TSC-independent manner. Under nutrient-rich conditions, TORC1 promotes anabolic processes, such as protein, nucleotide, and lipid synthesis, while inhibiting catabolic processes, such as autophagy.</p>
<p>In fission yeast, Tor2 provides the catalytic activity of TORC1, while Mip1, the Raptor equivalent, participates in substrate recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Morozumi <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). The complex contains three additional subunits, the mLST8 orthologue Wat1/Pop3, Toc1 and Tco89 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hayashi <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). TORC1 plays a crucial role in switching between cell proliferation and differentiation by sensing nitrogen source. When deprived of nitrogen, fission yeast cells arrest in G1, mate and undergo meiosis. In the absence of a mating partner, G1 cells enter a G0, quiescent state. Like its mammalian counterpart, the Rheb GTPase Rhb1 is an essential activator of TORC1. Upon nitrogen deprivation, TORC1 activity is restrained by the Gtr1-Gtr2 GTPases, the TSC complex, and the Gcn2 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">van Slegtenhorst et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chia et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fukuda &amp; Shiozaki, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fukuda et al, 2021</xref>). In conditions of abundant nutrients, TORC1 activity is high but nevertheless attenuated by the Gtr1-Gtr2 heterodimer, which is analogous to the mammalian RAG GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fukuda and Shiozaki, 2018</xref>). TORC1 is essential for cell growth, and loss of the TORC1 activity results in cell cycle arrest in G1. Rapamycin only partially inhibits TORC1 activity in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and does not inhibit growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Otsubo <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The link between cohesin and TORC1 emerged from a genetic screen for mutants able to suppress the thermosensitive growth (Ts) defect of <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic>, which is defective for cohesin loading and chromosome segregation at the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birot <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). In principle the screen had the potential to identify regulators of Mis4, with the rationale that loss of a negative regulator should upregulate residual Mis4<sup>G1487D</sup> activity and restore growth at the restrictive temperature. Alongside the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) Pef1, a known negative regulator of Mis4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birot <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>), several mutants of TORC1 were recovered.</p>
<p>In this study, we explore the connection between cohesin and TORC1. Mis4 plays a crucial role in loading cohesin onto chromosomes and establishing sister chromatid cohesion during the S phase of the cell cycle. Cohesin loading is reduced in the <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> mutant at the non-permissive temperature, resulting in defective sister-chromatid cohesion and chromosome segregation defects during mitosis. The downregulation of TORC1 enhanced cohesin binding to Cohesin-Associated Regions (CARs) and reduced chromosome segregation defects. Likewise, the incidence of chromosome segregation defects was modulated by the growth medium in a TORC1-dependent manner. These observations suggested that the TORC1 complex may control cohesin dynamics. Therefore, we investigated the impact of reducing TORC1 activity on wild-type cells. Indeed, the binding of cohesin to CAR increased. Furthermore, this was accompanied by an increase in the fidelity of chromosome transmission during vegetative growth. These findings raise the intriguing possibility that environmental cues could influence the robustness of chromosome segregation processes.</p>
<p>Affinity purification experiments showed that TORC1 and cohesin co-purified from protein extracts. The phosphorylation level of specific residues on cohesin and its loader was reduced in TORC1 mutants. Phospho-mutants recapitulated most of the effects observed when TORC1 was downregulated, arguing that TORC1 signalling contributes to the phosphorylation status of cohesin and thereby to its regulation.</p>
<p>Finally, we asked whether the TORC1-cohesin link may extend to the regulation of gene expression. Previous work from our group had shown that Mis4 plays a role in controlling gene expression in the sub-telomeric regions of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dheur <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). Since TORC1 is involved in environmental adaptation, we performed transcriptome profiling of Mis4 and TORC1 mutants under different culture conditions. The analysis confirmed that Mis4 affects the expression of a small number of genes with a localisation bias away from centromeres and close to telomeres. Interestingly, the identity and number of affected genes differed widely between experimental conditions, suggesting a defective adaptive response. Combining all experiments, 338 genes were differentially expressed in <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> compared to wild type. Remarkably, almost all of these genes were also regulated by TORC1. In many cases, the genes were deregulated in the same way and without additive effect, suggesting that Mis4 and TORC1 act in the same pathway.</p>
<p>Collectively, the data presented indicate that TORC1 influences the association of cohesin complexes with chromosomes, regulating their functions in chromosome segregation during mitosis and in the transcriptional response to environmental changes.</p>

<title>A genetic screen for suppressors of <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> identified components of TORC1</title>
<p>The G1487D substitution in the cohesin loader Mis4 renders the strain thermosensitive for growth (Ts, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). At the restrictive temperature the amount of cohesin associated with chromosomes is reduced and cells exhibit defects in chromosome segregation during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birot <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). To identify putative regulators of Mis4, we previously carried out a genetic screen for suppressors of the Ts phenotype of <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birot <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). One of the suppressors identified was Pef1, a CDK whose activity restrains cohesin binding to Cohesin Associated Regions (CARs). Besides <italic>pef1</italic>, the genetic screen identified three other genes: <italic>tor2</italic> (1 allele), <italic>mip1</italic> (5 alleles) and <italic>caa1</italic> (1 allele). The suppressive effect of the <italic>caa1</italic> mutant was modest (<xref rid="figs1A" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>tor2</italic> and <italic>mip1</italic> mutants clearly suppressed the Ts phenotype of <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic>, at a level similar to that conferred by the deletion of the <italic>pef1</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1A" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The <italic>caa1</italic> gene encodes an aspartate aminotransferase that is required for full activation of the TORC1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Reidman <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Tor2 and Mip1 are components of TORC1 ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hayashi <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Both genes are essential for cell survival. The <italic>tor2</italic> allele recovered in our genetic screen bears a substitution in the kinase domain which affected colony growth suggesting that TORC1 activity is largely affected. The five Mip1/Raptor mutants did not show this phenotype, the growth being similar to that of a wild strain. Still they all show reduced phosphorylation of the S6-kinase Psk1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), a well-known TORC1 substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Nakashima <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Likewise, the <italic>mip1-Y533A</italic> mutant which is deficient for Psk1 binding and phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Morozumi <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>), suppressed the Ts phenotype of <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In a similar manner, the pharmacological downregulation of TORC1 by rapamycin resulted in enhanced growth of <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> at the restrictive temperature (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Other thermosensitive mutants of the cohesin pathway (<italic>eso1-H17</italic> and <italic>rad21-K1</italic>) were not rescued ruling out a general suppressing effect. Hence, the suppression of <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> may stem from reduced TORC1 kinase activity. Conversely, the genetic upregulation of TORC1 exacerbated the Ts phenotype of <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic>. TORC1 activity upon nitrogen deprivation is restrained by the Gtr1-Gtr2 GTPases, the TSC complex, and the Gcn2 kinase. Among these, the Gtr1-Gtr2 GTPases dampen TORC1 even in nutrient replete conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">van Slegtenhorst <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chia <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fukuda &amp; Shiozaki, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fukuda <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>)). The deletion of <italic>gcn2</italic> or <italic>tsc2</italic> was essentially neutral in terms of <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> suppression, although the suppression by <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> was reduced in a <italic>tsc2</italic>-deleted background. Deletion of <italic>iml1, gtr1</italic> or the <italic>gtr1-Q61L</italic> allele (mimicking the GTP-bound inactive state of the Gtr1 GTPase, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chia <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>)) exacerbated the Ts phenotype of <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> while mimicking the active GDP-bound form by using the <italic>gtr1-16N</italic> allele, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chia <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>) was neutral. The deletion of <italic>tor1</italic>, encoding the catalytic subunit of the related complex TORC2 exacerbated the Ts phenotype of the <italic>mis4</italic> mutant (<xref rid="figs1A" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As TORC1 kinase activity is upregulated when <italic>tor1</italic> is deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ikai <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>), this observation is in line with the notion that <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> is sensitive to hyperactive TORC1.</p>
<p>The above genetic analyses show that the Ts phenotype of the <italic>mis4</italic> mutant is dampened when TORC1 activity is down-regulated and exacerbated when TORC1 is up-regulated. Because <italic>mip1</italic> alleles barely affected growth on their own and were excellent <italic>mis4</italic> suppressors we focused our analyses on one of them, <italic>mip1-R401G</italic>. We found that <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> acted as suppressor in another genetic context of impaired cohesin loading. The acetyl-mimicking forms of Psm3 have been demonstrated to impede the loading of cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Murayama &amp; Uhlmann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hu <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birot <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). This phenotype is exacerbated by the deletion of <italic>pph3</italic>, encoding the catalytic subunit of Protein Phosphatase 4 and the double mutant strain is Ts for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birot <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). The <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> mutant efficiently suppressed the Ts phenotype of <italic>psm3-K105NK106N pph3</italic>Δ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating that the suppression is not restricted to <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> but appears generally related to cohesin loading.</p>

<title>The occurrence of chromosome segregation defects in <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> is modulated by TORC1 and growth conditions</title>
<p>When <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> cells were shifted to the restrictive temperature cell proliferation was reduced and viability dropped ∼25 fold after 24 hours when compared to wild-type. The <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> mutation efficiently suppressed the proliferation and viability defects (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). A hallmark of cohesin mutants is the occurrence of abnormal mitoses in which the spindle apparatus attempts to segregate un-cohered sister chromatids. A single kinetochore is captured by microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles (merotelic attachment) and moves back and forth on the anaphase spindle as a result of opposite forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Pidoux <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gregan <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). Live cell analysis confirmed the occurrence of merotelic kinetochores in the <italic>mis4</italic> mutant (<xref rid="figs2A" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In fixed cells, a merotelically-attached chromatid appears as DAPI-stained material lagging on the anaphase spindle. Anaphases with lagging DNA were frequent for <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> after one doubling of the cell population at the restrictive temperature and their occurrence was significantly reduced by <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Rapamycin exposure during a single cell cycle also reduced the frequency of anaphases with lagging DNA, although the effect was weaker (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This is consistent with the notion that the down-regulation of TORC1 reduced chromosome segregation defects of the <italic>mis4</italic> mutant. The suppressor effect of the <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> mutation was not restricted to the <italic>mis4</italic> mutant. The frequency of anaphases with lagging DNA was efficiently reduced in the <italic>psm3K105N-K106N pph3Δ</italic> background (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). As for <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic>, cohesin loading is impaired in this genetic setup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birot et al, 2020</xref>) but Mis4 is wild-type. This shows that the suppression is not allele-specific, but may instead stem from an upregulation of the cohesin loading machinery.</p>

<p>Merotelic kinetochores oppose spindle forces and reduce the rate of spindle elongation during anaphase. As the number of merotelic kinetochores increases, the spindle elongation rate slows down and may even become negative resulting in spindle shrinkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Courtheoux <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). The rate of spindle elongation was strongly affected in <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> and spindle shrinkage events were frequent, indicative of a high level of merotely. Spindle shrinkage occurred in ∼53% of anaphases in <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> whereas it was reduced to ∼21% in the <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> background (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref rid="figs2B" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Particularly striking was the observation of spindle shrinkage followed by asymmetric spindle displacement resulting in the generation of anucleate daughter cells after cytokinesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Nearly 80% of cells showed this phenotype in <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> for the late time points whereas the frequency was reduced to ∼20% in the presence of <italic>mip1-R401G</italic>. Altogether, these analyses indicate that the <italic>mis4</italic> mutant experienced numerous merotelic events during anaphase at the restrictive temperature, leading to asymmetric spindle shrinkage and the production of anucleate cells. The suppression of these phenotypes by <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> is consistent with improved sister-chromatid cohesion, leading to a lower incidence of merotelic attachments and chromosome segregation defects. At centromeres, defective cohesion results in increased distance between sister-kinetochores, a phenotype that can be evidenced by microscopy. When early mitotic cells are abruptly cooled on ice, microtubules disassemble leaving unattached kinetochore pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gachet <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). In some instances a kinetochore pair drifts away from the other chromosomes, allowing the measurement of inter-kinetochore distance. The inter-kinetochore distance increased in the <italic>mis4</italic> mutant compared to the wild type. Importantly, the defect was reduced in the <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> background (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). The suppression was nevertheless partial, suggesting sister-centromere cohesion was not fully restored. Using a GFP-tagged <italic>ade6</italic> locus on the right arm of chromosome III, we found that sister-chromatid cohesion remained defective at that site (<xref rid="figs2C" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The level of Psm3 acetylation, a marker of sister-chromatid cohesion establishment, was low in the <italic>mis4</italic> mutant and was not restored by <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> or rapamycin. These data suggest that sister chromatid cohesion remains defective overall, but has improved sufficiently, particularly at the centromeres, to enable more effective chromosome segregation during mitosis.</p>
<p>Physiologically TORC1 acts as a rheostat, its activity rising with nutrient availability. YES is a rich undefined medium containing numerous sources of nitrogen, whereas ammonia is the sole source of nitrogen in EMM2. The Ts phenotype of <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> was stronger and the frequency of lagging DNA was higher in the rich, complete medium YES than in the synthetic minimal medium EMM2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). The artificial increase of TORC1 activity by <italic>gtr1-Q61L</italic> resulted in an elevated rate of anaphases with lagging DNA in EMM2 medium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Conversely, the use of glutamate, a nitrogen source slightly poorer than ammonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Davie et al, 2015</xref>) reduced chromosome segregation defects (<xref rid="figs2D" ref-type="fig">Figure 2— figure supplement 4</xref>). Altogether, these analyses show that the incidence of chromosome segregation defects of <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> is modulated by growth conditions in a TORC1-dependent manner.</p>

<title>Reduced TORC1 activity increased Mis4 and cohesin binding to Cohesin Associated Regions (CARs)</title>

The down-regulation of TORC1 may rescue <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> by up-regulating its residual cohesin loading activity. To address this issue, cells were arrested at the end of the G1 phase by the use of the <italic>cdc10-129</italic> Ts mutation and cohesin binding to chromosomes monitored by Rad21 ChIP-qPCR at known CARs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).

When shifted at 36.5°C, <italic>cdc10-129</italic> cells progress through G2, M and arrest in G1. As reported previously, Rad21 binding to CARs was reduced in a <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Feytout <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Vaur <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birot <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). The <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> mutation efficiently restored cohesin binding to near wild-type levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). A similar effect was observed in the <italic>psm3<sup>K105N-K106N</sup> pph3</italic>Δ background (<xref rid="figs3A" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) indicating that <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> restores cohesin loading in these two distinct genetic contexts. Importantly, a similar stimulating effect was observed in cells with a wild-type cohesin loading machinery. In an otherwise wild-type background, Mis4 and Rad21 binding to CARs were increased in <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> cells at most chromosomal sites examined (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-D</xref>). Rapamycin treatment during a single cell cycle provoked a similar effect although less pronounced (<xref rid="figs3A" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We conclude that TORC1 down-regulation increases cohesin abundance at CARs, presumably by stimulating cohesin loading.</p>

<title>TORC1 signalling affects the phosphorylation levels of Mis4-S183 and Psm1-S1022</title>

<p>Both phosphorylation sites on Psm1 and Mis4 adhere to the CDK consensus (S-T/P) but were not described as direct targets of Cdc2, the main fission yeast CDK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Swaffer <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Label-free mass spectrometry indicated that the phosphorylation of Mis4-S183 was not dependent on the CDK Pef1 either (<xref rid="figs5B" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, Psm1-S1022 phosphorylation was strongly reduced in <italic>pef1</italic> deleted cells (<xref rid="figs5B" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Pef1 was reported as a positive regulator of TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Matsuda <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>), suggesting Pef1 may promote the phosphorylation of Psm1 through TORC1 activation. Indeed, the phosphorylation level of the TORC1 substrate Psk1 was reduced in <italic>pef1</italic> deleted cells and the double mutant <italic>pef1</italic>Δ <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> grew very poorly (<xref rid="figs5B" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with further reduced TORC1 activity. The phosphorylation of Psm1 is therefore possibly dependent on the activation of TORC1 by Pef1. Conversely, Pef1 activity does not seem to depend on TORC1 as the phosphorylation status of Rad21-T262, which is a Pef1 substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birot <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>), was not affected by <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> (<xref rid="figs5B" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>
<p>TORC1 may regulate cohesin phosphorylation directly, or via the activation of downstream kinases. In fission yeast there are three known AGC kinases phosphorylated and thereby presumably activated by TORC1: Psk1, Sck1 and Sck2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Nakashima <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chica <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). The ribosomal S6 kinase Psk1 was introduced earlier. The closest homologs of Sck1-2 are SGK1-3 (Serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1, 2 and 3) in human and SCH9 in budding yeast. AGC kinase genes are dispensable for growth in fission yeast, either alone or in combination, which rendered possible a straightforward analysis.</p>
<p>Deletion of the <italic>psk1</italic> gene was essentially neutral for <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> (<xref rid="figs5C" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The deletion of <italic>sck1</italic> had a weak suppressor effect whereas <italic>sck2</italic> deletion suppressed the growth defect to a level similar to <italic>mip1-R401G</italic>. The double deletion of <italic>sck1</italic> and <italic>sck2</italic> had the same effect as the single deletion of <italic>sck2</italic>. Using Rad21-FLAG ChIP-qPCR on G1-arrested cells we determined the relative enrichment of cohesin localised at CARs in the mutant strains versus wild-type (<xref rid="figs5C" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). A small decrease was observed for <italic>sck1</italic>Δ at several CARs, such as 438, tRNA-L, cc2, imr2-L and 1806. The <italic>sck2</italic>Δ single mutant behaved quite similar to wild-type, at least in G1-arrested cells. In contrast, the <italic>sck1</italic>Δ <italic>sck2</italic>Δ double mutant showed an increase relative to wild-type at almost all loci examined and at a level similar to <italic>mip1-R401G</italic>. This indicates a synthetic effect of the simultaneous deletion of <italic>sck1</italic> and <italic>sck2</italic> on cohesin association at CARs in G1-arrested cells. The frequency of chromosome segregation defects of <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> was markedly reduced in a <italic>sck2</italic>-deleted background and further decreased by the additional deletion of <italic>sck1</italic> (<xref rid="figs5C" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p>
<p>The phosphorylation level of Psm1-S1022 was similar to wild-type in the <italic>sck1</italic>Δ and <italic>sck2</italic>Δ single mutants. The <italic>sck1</italic>Δ <italic>sck2</italic>Δ double mutant showed a 33% decrease in phosphorylation (<xref rid="figs5C" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>sck1</italic> and <italic>sck2</italic> are redundant for the regulation of Psm1-S1022 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation level of Mis4-S183 was increased 9-fold in <italic>sck1</italic>Δ compared to wild-type. Conversely, Mis4-S183p was reduced in the <italic>sck2</italic>Δ strain (3.7 fold decrease relative to wild-type) and the double mutant showed a 5-fold higher signal than the wild-type (<xref rid="figs5C" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). As Mis4-S183 is phosphorylated in the double mutant this indicates that Mis4-S183 is phosphorylated by another, unknown kinase, at least in this genetic context. In this scenario, the unknown kinase would be positively regulated by Sck2 and negatively by Sck1.</p>
<p>The interplay between TORC1, Pef1 and other kinases downstream of TORC1 appears complex and remains to be elucidated. Nevertheless, the above data show that TORC1 signalling affects the phosphorylation level of Mis4 and Psm1, the abundance of cohesin at CARs and the suppression of <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> phenotypes.</p>

<title>Rapamycin increased the fidelity of chromosome transmission of wild-type cells in a pathway involving Psm1 phosphorylation</title>
<p>The data we have obtained so far show that reducing TORC1 activity reduced the severity of chromosome segregation defects in genetic contexts where cohesin loading is compromised. We therefore wondered whether the alteration of TORC1 activity could affect the fidelity of chromosome transmission in the wild type. The loss frequency of whole, natural chromosomes can be estimated by measuring the breakdown of diploids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Allshire <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). Remarkably, diploids were more stable when grown in the presence of rapamycin when compared to solvent alone (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). We also measured the loss frequency of CM3112, a circular, non-essential minichromosome derived from the centromere region of chromosome III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Matsumoto <italic>et al</italic>, 1990</xref>). In the wild type, it is lost at a rate of around 1 per 100 divisions. Again, rapamycin led to a substantial decrease in the incidence of CM3112 loss (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). The frequency of CM3112 loss was reduced in the <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> mutant when compared to wild-type. Furthermore, the combination of rapamycin and <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> did not result in an additive effect, consistent with rapamycin and <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> acting in the same pathway. In a similar manner, <italic>psm1-S1022A</italic> showed minimal responsiveness to rapamycin, while <italic>psm1-S1022D</italic> exhibited a discernible response. The involvement of Mis4-S183 phosphorylation was less clear. The <italic>mis4-S183A</italic> mutant did show a reduced response to rapamycin (<xref rid="figs7A" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the phosphomimetic allele <italic>mis4-S183E</italic> did not restore the response to rapamycin, and the double mutants did not reveal a clear genetic interaction, which complicated the interpretation. Taken together, these data indicate that rapamycin increases the stability of chromosomes through a pathway involving Mip1 and the phosphorylation of the cohesin subunit Psm1.</p>

<title>Mis4 and TORC1 control a common set of genes involved in the response to environmental changes</title>
<p>In a previous study, gene expression profiling of <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> identified a small number of upregulated and downregulated genes within subtelomeric domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dheur <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). The genetic link between TORC1 and cohesin prompted us to ask how the two pathways may interact in terms of gene expression. As TORC1 adapts cells to changes in their environment, we looked at the transcriptome by RNA-sequencing of wild-type, <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic>, <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> and the double mutant in various experimental conditions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). These included cycling cells in the rich complete medium YES at 25°C (V25) and upon a temperature shift to 36.5°C for one doubling (V36.5) or arrested in G1 (<italic>cdc10-129</italic>) at this temperature (G1_36.5). We also looked upon nitrogen starvation by shifting actively cycling cells from the synthetic medium EMM2 to EMM2 deprived of a nitrogen source (EMM2-N). In this situation, TORC1 activity is restrained, cells arrest in G1 and either mate to enter the reproductive cycle (meiosis) or enter a G0, quiescent state. As no mating partner was available in our experiments, cells homogeneously arrested in G1 after nitrogen deprivation (<xref rid="figs8A" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). RNA-sequencing was performed 24 hours after the shift to EMM2-N (T0-N). One half of the remaining culture was shifted to 36.5°C for 4 days (T4D36.5) while the other half was kept at 25°C for 4 days (T4D25).

<p>As in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dheur <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>), a small number of genes were found to be differentially expressed in the <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> mutant compared to the wild type (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). In actively growing cells in rich medium 12 genes were affected, 50 after one cell doubling at 36.5°C and 27 in G1-arrested cells at 36.5°C. The number of differentially expressed genes increased upon nitrogen deprivation (T0-N, 118 genes, T4D25, 125 genes). A similar number of genes were affected in <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> when nitrogen depleted cells were shifted to 36.5°C for 4 days (T4D36.5, 76 genes). A much larger number of genes were differentially expressed in <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> versus wild-type (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). As illustrated by the Venn diagrams, a significant proportion of <italic>mis4</italic>-affected genes were also affected in the <italic>mip1</italic> mutant.</p>
<p>Most <italic>mis4</italic>-affected genes were specific to a particular experimental condition (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). For example, of the genes that are up-regulated in the <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> mutant compared to the wild-type, 184 are specific to a single experimental condition, 24 are up-regulated in two experiments, two are up-regulated in three experiments, and two are up-regulated in four experiments. A similar trend is seen for down-regulated genes. Thus, most of the Mis4-sensitive genes are only sensitive under specific culture conditions. These observations suggest that <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> affects the transcriptional response to environment changes.</p>
<p>In aggregate, 338 genes were differentially expressed in <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> relative to wild-type across all experiments (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). The analysis of gene lists with AnGeLi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bitton <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) indicated that <italic>mis4</italic>-regulated genes showed a localization bias towards chromosome ends (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref> and <xref rid="figs8B" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). The response to nitrogen starvation and differentiation (meiosis), as well as enrichment for “stress genes”, were observed, consistent with a defective adaptive response. Genes encoding membrane transporters were significantly enriched, suggesting a role in cell homeostasis. A strong overlap was apparent with a published set of genes whose expression was upregulated in a <italic>tor2</italic> conditional mutant at the restrictive temperature (<xref rid="figs8B" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wei <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>)). A significant overlap was also seen with genes up-regulated in G0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Zahedi <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>), suggesting Mis4 may participate in the proper establishment and/or maintenance of the quiescent state (<xref rid="figs8B" ref-type="fig">Figure 8— figure supplement 2</xref>). Cell survival remains high in G0 in the <italic>mis4</italic> and <italic>mip1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="figs8C" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 3-4</xref>) but upon refeeding a delay in G0 exit was noticeable (<xref rid="figs8E" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 5</xref>). This phenotype was quite strong for <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> and more subtle for the <italic>mis4</italic> mutant.</p>
<p>Most (300/338) genes affected by <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> were also affected by <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). If we go into more detail, we can identify a large group of genes (100/300) for which the quantitative variations were similar, moving in the same direction, with little or no additive effect in the double mutant (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref> and <xref rid="figs8F" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 6</xref>). For this particular set of genes the epistatic relationship suggests that Mis4 and TORC1 may act in the same pathway. In other instances, the changes in gene expression relative to the wild-type were in opposite directions in <italic>mis4</italic> and <italic>mip1</italic> mutants (64 occurrences, 62 genes, <xref rid="figs8G" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 7</xref>). Overall, these data show that Mis4 and TORC1 functionally interact for the regulation of genes involved in the response to environmental changes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The data presented in this work provide evidence for a regulation of cohesin by the TOR signalling pathway. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report to demonstrate such a relationship. Previously, a link had been established between the two pathways, but in the opposite direction. mTORC1 is indeed down-regulated in cells from patients with Roberts syndrome, caused by mutational alteration of the ESCO2 cohesin acetyl-transferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). The down-regulation of the cohesin loader NIPBL in breast cancer cells induced cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and autophagy through the caspase 3 and mTOR signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). The first hint for a regulation of cohesin by the TOR pathway came from the observation in fission yeast that the growth of a conditional mutant of <italic>mis4</italic> was enhanced by rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sajiki <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), although the underlying molecular mechanisms remained unclear. In mammalian species, a fraction of mTOR controls nuclear processes, notably transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>). Likewise, fission yeast TORC1 is involved in the regulation of facultative heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wei <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hirai <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>) and transcriptional processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Laribee &amp; Weisman, 2020</xref>). The present work establishes, for the first time, a close link between cohesin and the TOR pathway, suggesting the exciting possibility that extracellular signals could remodel the functional architecture of chromosomes during differentiation or adaptation processes.</p>

<title>Mis4 and Psm1 as downstream targets of TORC1</title>
<p>We present evidence showing that cohesin and TORC1 components co-purify from protein extracts and Mis4-S183 and Psm1-S1022 are less phosphorylated in <italic>mip1</italic> mutants. Non-phosphorylatable mutants recapitulated most of the effects of TORC1 down-regulation while mutants mimicking the phosphorylated state produced phenotypes similar to TORC1 hyper activation. Whether cohesin and Mis4 are substrates of TORC1 or other kinases regulated by TORC1 is currently unknown. Meanwhile, our work provides the first evidence that cohesin is a downstream effector of TORC1. It is worth mentioning that TORC1 components were found to co-purify with the budding yeast cohesin loader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mattingly <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>), suggesting that the link between cohesin and TORC1 may extend to other species.</p>
<p>Both phosphorylation events on Mis4 and Psm1 have been reported in the literature but their biological functions are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kettenbach <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Swaffer <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Tay <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Halova <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Mis4-S183 is located within an unstructured, flexible region connecting the Ssl3 interaction domain and the hook domain that provides Mis4 catalytic activity. It was proposed that phosphorylation at CDK sites within the unstructured linker may affect the flexibility of the complex and modulate its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chao <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Mis4-S183 and the CDK consensus are conserved in hNIPBL and the residue was found phosphorylated in a number of phosphoproteomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ruse <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dephoure <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Pan <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mayya <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Christensen <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rigbolt <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Beli <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>).

The S1022 residue of Psm1 lies close to the “joint” region below the ATPase heads that the “hinge” domain contacts when cohesin is in its folded conformation. Whether the phosphorylation of Psm1-S1022 affects the outcome of DNA transactions remain to be investigated.</p>

<title>TORC1 activity restrains cohesin binding to CARs</title>
<p>Reducing TORC1 activity by the <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> mutation enhanced cohesin binding to CARs. Remarkably, a similar effect was observed within a single cell cycle of rapamycin treatment. Increased cohesin binding at CARs occurred in two genetic contexts of sensitized cohesin loading and with a wild-type cohesin loading machinery. The most straightforward interpretation is that TORC1 restrains cohesin loading onto chromosomes. One distinct possibility would be that TORC1 down-regulation promotes cohesin accumulation at CARs without <italic>de novo</italic> loading. It was proposed that CARs correspond to the borders of yeast TAD-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Costantino <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Increased abundance of cohesin at CARs may result from the accumulation of cohesin with loop extrusion activity at TAD boundaries. Considering that loop extrusion requires the NIPBL-Cohesin holocomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Davidson <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>), it is interesting to note that Mis4 binding to CARs was similarly enhanced. TORC1 may also impinge on cohesin sliding by transcription-related processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lengronne <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schmidt <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>) and / or influence cohesin accumulation through the phosphorylation of chromatin-bound proteins. Future work will aim at clarifying these issues.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>TORC1 and chromosome segregation</title>
<p>Cells with an impaired cohesin loading machinery experience chromosome segregation defects during mitosis. We have shown here that the intensity of the defect is dependent on TORC1 activity. The most prominent defect is the merotelic attachment of kinetochores which, when left uncorrected, lead to aberrant chromosome segregation. Although the down-regulation of TORC1 reduced the frequency of aberrant anaphases, sister-chromatid cohesion remained largely impaired, even though cohesin binding to CARs in the <italic>mis4</italic> mutant was restored to near wild-type levels in cells arrested at the G1/S boundary. The increase in chromosome bound cohesin may have enhanced cohesion establishment during S-phase. Indeed the inter-kinetochore distance was reduced but sister-chromatid cohesion remained overall defective at a distal, chromosome arm locus. Consistently, cohesin acetylation was not improved by TORC1 down-regulation. The acetylation of Psm3, mediated by Eso1 in fission yeast, counteracts the cohesin releasing activity of Wapl and is thought to stabilize cohesin binding and cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Feytout <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kagami <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Vaur <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Birot <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, deletion of the <italic>wpl1</italic> gene does not rescue the <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> mutant and <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells can survive with non-detectable acetylation or in a context in which Psm3 cannot be acetylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Feytout <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birot <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). The primary defect of <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> may therefore stem from inability to generate sister-chromatid cohesion rather than its maintenance. <italic>In vitro</italic> assays have suggested that sister-chromatid capture by cohesin is a two-step process catalysed by Mis4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Murayama <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). The down-regulation of TORC1 may increase the residual loading activity of Mis4 but second DNA capture may remain largely deficient, resulting in poor sister-chromatid cohesion. Increased cohesin binding at peri-centromeres may improve chromosome segregation through other routes. Cohesin organizes the peri-centromere regions in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lawrimore <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Paldi <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Local depletion of cohesin at centromeres in fission yeast lead to a high incidence of merotelic attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernard <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). A recent study revealed that vertebrate kinetochores are bipartite structures and highlighted a role for cohesin in bridging to the two parts into a functional unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sacristan <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>). Lastly, enhanced cohesin binding to centromeres may facilitate the correction of merotelic attachments by the Aurora B kinase. The localization of Aurora B relies on histone H3-T3 phosphorylation by Haspin whose localization to centromeres depends largely on the cohesin subunit Pds5 in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Yamagishi <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Goto <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>That chromosome segregation defects increased with TORC1 activity suggests the intriguing possibility that the fidelity of chromosome segregation could be modulated by environmental cues. Chromosome segregation defects in the <italic>mis4</italic> mutant were most intense in the complete rich medium YES than in the synthetic medium EMM2. The use of glutamate, a nitrogen source slightly poorer than ammonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Davie <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) further reduced chromosome segregation defects. Furthermore, Rapamycin reduced the frequency of chromosome loss in wild-type cells in a pathway involving the phosphorylation state of Psm1-S1022. It is striking that rapamycin increased the stability of chromosomes during vegetative growth. The idea that nutritional inputs affect the stability of chromosomes could make sense in ecological terms. Microbial species in the wild compete with each other. When nutrients are abundant, it may be preferable to divide in order to colonise the niche rapidly, even at the expense of a few cells. Conversely, when nutrients become scarce, survival of the species may rely more heavily on the fitness of individual cells.</p>

<title>Mis4 and TORC1 control the gene response to environmental changes</title>
<p>In a previous study we reported that <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> affects the expression of genes located in subtelomeric domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dheur <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). Here we extend the study by challenging cells with various culture conditions. Several conclusions can be drawn. Very few genes were affected when cells were actively cycling in rich media, when TORC1 activity is high. The gene list was much longer upon nitrogen deprivation, when TORC1 activity is repressed, and the list of genes evolved with time spent in G0. In aggregate 338 genes were affected in <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> when compared with wild-type with a bias towards chromosome ends and far from centromeres. Lastly, most genes misregulated in <italic>mis4-G1487D</italic> were misregulated in the <italic>mip1-R401G</italic> mutant suggesting Mis4 and Mip1 act in a same pathway. Paradoxically, the <italic>mis4</italic> and <italic>mip1</italic> mutants remained viable during G0 although a delay was noticeable upon re-entry into the cell cycle at elevated temperature. A defect in quiescence exit was previously reported when the <italic>mis4</italic> gene is affected and the phenotype appears strongly dependent on the allele considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sajiki <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Suma <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>). It must be kept in mind that <italic>mis4</italic> mutants were originally screened for a defect during vegetative growth. It would be interesting to screen specifically for <italic>mis4</italic> alleles affecting cell survival in quiescence.</p>
<p>Given the role of cohesin and its loader in chromosome folding, it is tempting to speculate that TORC1 might direct cohesin to establish a chromosome architecture conducive to transcriptional responses to environmental changes. If increased binding of Mis4 and cohesin at CARs does reflect extruding cohesin complexes that have reached TAD boundaries, chromosomes might be more compacted when TORC1 is down regulated. Conversely, high TORC1 would promote the opposite. Even if this hypothesis turned out to be correct, it does not explain why regulated genes show a bias towards chromosome ends. Chromosomes in fission yeast adopt a Rabl configuration in interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mizuguchi <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Centromeres cluster at the SPBs while telomeres cluster in a few patches at the opposing hemisphere near the nuclear periphery. These constraints generate specific chromosomal regions with distinct molecular environments. Chromosome conformation capture and the mapping of DNA binding sites of inner nuclear membrane proteins have provided evidence of functional sub-nuclear environments that correlate with gene expression activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Steglich <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Grand <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). The studies suggest more internal locations of actively expressed genes, and nuclear peripheral localization of poorly expressed genes. Chromosome regions containing gene clusters that are up-regulated upon nitrogen starvation re-position from the nuclear periphery to the interior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alfredsson-Timmins <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). In this regard, Mis4-regulated genes tend to be lowly expressed and enriched for nitrogen responsive genes. Modifying chromosome compaction may alter the Rabl configuration or generate forces that modify the properties of the inner nuclear envelope, leading to misregulated gene expression. Indeed, loss of cohesin causes an increase in inter-chromosomal contacts and a reduction in chromosomal territoriality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mizuguchi <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Cohesin and TORC1 have been implicated with a wide range of human pathologies, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Yoon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Waldman, 2020</xref>). Rapamycin has attracted much attention for its putative ability to mimic caloric restriction, resulting in improved health and lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bjedov &amp; Partridge, 2011</xref>). Our study suggests the intriguing possibility that some effects are mediated by the ability of cohesin to remodel chromosomes in response to various extracellular signals, including nutrients.</p>

<title>Strains, media and genetic techniques</title>
<p>General fission yeast methods, reagents and media are described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Moreno <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>). All strains are listed in Supplementary file 1. Experiments were carried out using YES medium unless otherwise stated. For cell growth assays serial dilutions of cells were spotted on YES medium and the plates incubated at the indicated temperatures for 3 days unless otherwise stated. EMM-GLU is EMM2 in which NH<sub>4</sub>Cl was replaced with 20mM glutamate. Rapamycin (Calbiochem, 4.57mg/ml stock in DMSO) was added to the culture medium to 200ng/ml. For nitrogen deprivation, cycling cells in EMM2 (∼5-10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml) were washed three times in EMM2-N and incubated in EMM2-N at the same density. Cell cycle arrest in YES medium was achieved by shifting cycling <italic>cdc10-129</italic> cells (∼10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml) at 36°C for 3.5 hours. Hydroxyurea (HU) was used to arrest cells in early S-phase. HU (12mM) was added to cycling cells in YES (∼10<sup>7</sup>/ml) and shifted to 36.5°C for 3.5 hours. All cell cycle arrests were checked by flow cytometry analysis of DNA content. The genetic screen for <italic>mis4</italic> suppressors was described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birot <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). The suppressors fell into four linkage groups. To identify the mutated loci, genomic DNA was extracted from one mutant from each group and from the wild-type <italic>S. pombe</italic> reference strain and co-hybridized to tiling arrays as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birot <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). For the <italic>mip1</italic> group (5 alleles) the mutated site in each strain was identified by PCR followed by DNA sequencing. Phospho-mutants were generated using the SpEDIT method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Torres-Garcia <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). The introduction of the desired changes was confirmed by PCR followed by DNA sequencing. Gene mapping, sequence and annotations were from Pombase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Rutherford <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>). Chromosome loss assays were as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Allshire <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>) using the calculation method of Kipling and Kearsey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kipling &amp; Kearsey, 1990</xref>). Cells containing the CM3112 minichromosome are Ade+ and form white colonies on YES medium. Loss of the minichromosome generates Ade-cells that form red colonies. White colonies grown on YES medium (5-10) were picked, resuspended in 1 ml of YES+Adenine medium, and the cell density was measured. Cells were diluted to 10<sup>4</sup>/ml in YES+Adenine and incubated at 25°C for 3 days. Cells (500-1000) were plated on YES plates at day 0 and day 3 to estimate the proportion of cells containing the minichromosome. The rate of chromosome loss per division was calculated using the formula: loss rate = 1-(F/I)<sup>1/N</sup>, where F is the final percentage of cells bearing the minichromosome, I is the initial percentage of cells carrying the minichromosome, and N is the number of generations between I and F. The same method was applied to measure the breakdown of diploid strains but with two successive rounds of growth in liquid YES+Adenine medium before the final plating.</p>

<title>Cytological techniques</title>
<p>DNA content was measured by flow cytometry with an Accuri C6 Flow cytometer after Sytox Green staining of ethanol-fixed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Knutsen <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). Data were presented using the FlowJo software. Indirect immunofluorescence was done as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birot <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Cells were imaged using a Leica DMRXA microscope and a 63X objective. Measurements were made using MetaMorph software.</p>
<p>Live cell analysis was performed in an imaging chamber (CoverWell PCI-2.5, Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR) filled with 1 ml of 1% agarose in minimal medium and sealed with a 22 × 22-mm glass coverslip. Time-lapse images of Z stacks (maximum five stacks of 0.5 μm steps, to avoid photobleaching) were taken at 60 sec intervals. Images were acquired with a CCD Retiga R6 camera (QImaging) fitted to a DM6B upright microscope with a x63 objective, using MetaMorph as a software. Intensity adjustments were made using the MetaMorph, Image J, and Adobe Photoshop packages (Adobe Systems France, Paris, France). To determine the percentage of mispositioned spindles, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 6 min at room temperature, washed twice in PBS, and observed in the presence of DAPI/calcofluor.</p>
<p>The position of the SPBs, kinetochores and centromeres were determined by visualization of the Cdc11–GFP, Ndc80–GFP and Mis6-RFP signals. Maximum intensity projections were prepared for each time point, with the images from each channel being combined into a single RGB image. These images were cropped around the cell of interest, and optional contrast enhancement was performed in MetaMorph, Image J or Photoshop where necessary. The cropped images were exported as 8-bit RGB-stacked TIFF files, with each frame corresponding to one image of the time-lapse series. For all channels, custom peak detection was performed. The successive positions of the SPBs and kinetochores/centromeres were determined.</p>
<p>For the measurement of inter-kinetochore distance, cells were grown overnight at 25°C, then shifted to 36.5°C for 5 hours and subsequently chilled at 4°C for 30 minutes. At this stage, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gachet <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), metaphase spindles collapsed, microtubules were absent, and sister kinetochores were frequently misaligned relative to the two spindle pole bodies (SPBs). After the cold shock, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 6 minutes at room temperature, washed twice in PBS, stained with DAPI and the distance between Mis6-RFP signals was measured.</p>

<p>Peptide mixture was analyzed on a Ultimate 3000 nanoLC system (Dionex, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) coupled to a Electrospray Orbitrap Fusion™ Lumos™ Tribrid™ Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Ten microliters of peptide digests were loaded onto a 300-µm-inner diameter x 5-mm C18 PepMapTM trap column (LC Packings) at a flow rate of 10 µL/min. The peptides were eluted from the trap column onto an analytical 75-mm id x 50-cm C18 Pep-Map column (LC Packings) with a 5–27.5% linear gradient of solvent B in 105 min (solvent A was 0.1% formic acid and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in 80% ACN) followed by a 10 min gradient from 27.5% to 40% solvent B. The separation flow rate was set at 300 nL/min. The mass spectrometer operated in positive ion mode at a 2-kV needle voltage. Data were acquired using Xcalibur software in a data-dependent mode. MS scans (m/z 375-1500) were recorded in the Orbitrap at a resolution of R = 120 000 (@ m/z 200) and an AGC target of 4 x 105 ions collected within 50 ms.

<p>Exponentially growing cells in EMM2 medium at 25°C were washed three times in EMM2-N and incubated in EMM2-N for 24 hours at 25°C. Half of the culture was transferred to 36.5°C while the other half remained at 25°C. After 3 days, nitrogen (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl 5g/l) was added (time 0). Exit from G0 was monitored by flow cytometry analysis of DNA content . At 25°C (G0 25°C =&gt; exit 25°C) the onset of DNA replication occurred ∼7hrs after nitrogen addition for all strains. At 36.5°C (G0 36.5°C =&gt; exit 36.5°C) DNA replication was slow or asynchronous even for the wild-type. The numbers above the peaks indicate the fraction of cells with 1C and 2C DNA content for the 0 and 12h time points. The <italic>mis4</italic> mutant behaved mostly as wild-type although a larger fraction of cells did not replicate 12 hours after nitrogen addition. For the two strains harbouring <italic>mip1-R401G</italic>, a large fraction of cells did not replicate during the duration of the experiment.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Besson et al. investigate how environmental nutrient signals regulate chromosome biology through the TORC1 signaling pathway in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Specifically, the authors explore the impact of TORC1 on cohesin function - a protein complex essential for chromosome segregation and transcriptional regulation. Through a combination of genetic screens, biochemical analysis, phospho-proteomics, and transcriptional profiling, they uncover a functional and physical interaction between TORC1 and cohesin. The data suggest that reduced TORC1 activity enhances cohesin binding to chromosomes and improves chromosome segregation, with implications for stress-responsive gene expression, especially in subtelomeric regions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work presents a compelling link between nutrient sensing and chromosome regulation. The major strength of the study lies in its comprehensive and multi-disciplinary approach. The authors integrate genetic suppression screens, live-cell imaging, chromatin immunoprecipitation, co-immunoprecipitation, and mass spectrometry to uncover the functional connection between TORC1 signaling and cohesin. The use of phospho-mutant alleles of cohesin subunits and their loader provides mechanistic insight into the regulatory role of phosphorylation. The addition of transcriptomic analysis further strengthens the biological relevance of the findings and places them in a broader physiological context. Altogether, the dataset convincingly supports the authors' main conclusions and opens up new avenues of investigation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the study is strong overall, a few limitations are worth noting. The consistency of cohesin phosphorylation changes under different TORC1-inhibiting conditions (e.g., genetic mutants vs. rapamycin treatment) is unclear and could benefit from further clarification. The phosphorylation sites identified on cohesin subunits do not match known AGC kinase consensus motifs, raising the possibility that the modifications are indirect. The study relies heavily on one TORC1 mutant allele (mip1-R401G), and additional alleles could strengthen the generality of the findings. Furthermore, while the results suggest that nutrient availability influences cohesin function, this is not directly tested by comparing growth or cohesin dynamics under defined nutrient conditions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors follow up on a previous suppressor screen of a temperature-sensitive allele of mis4 (mis4-G1487D), the cohesin loading factor in S. pombe, and identify additional suppressor alleles tied to the S. pombe TORC1 complex. Their analysis suggests that these suppressor mutations attenuate TORC1 activity, while enhanced TORC1 activity is deleterious in this context. Suppression of TORC1 activity also ameliorates chromosome segregation and spindle defects observed in the mis4-G1487D strain, although some more subtle effects are not reconstituted. The authors provide evidence that this genetic suppression is also tied to the reconstitution of cohesin loading. Moreover, disrupting TORC1 also enhances Mis4/cohesin association with chromatin (likely reflecting enhanced loading) in WT cells, while rapamycin treatment can enhance the robustness of chromosome transmission. These effects likely arise directly through TORC1 or its downstream effector kinases, as TORC1 co-purifies with Mis4 and Rad21; these factors are also phosphorylated in a TORC1-dependent fashion. Disrupting Sck2, a kinase downstream of TORC1, also suppresses the mis4-G1487D allele while simultaneous disruption of Sck1 and Sck2 enhances cohesin association with chromatin, albeit with differing effects on phosphorylation of Mis4 and Psm1/Scm1. Phosphomutants of Mis4 and Psm1 that mimic observed phosphorylation states identified by mass spectrometry that are TORC1-dependent also suppressed phenotypes observed in the mis4-G1487D background. Last, the authors provide evidence that the mis4-G1487D background and TORC1 mutant backgrounds display an overlap in the dysregulation of genes that respond to environmental conditions, particularly in genes tied to meiosis or other &quot;stress&quot;.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors provide compelling evidence from genetics, biochemistry, and cell biology to support a previously unknown mechanism by which nutrient sensing regulates cohesin loading with implications for the stress response. The technical approaches are generally sound, well-controlled, and comprehensive.</p>
<p>Specific Points:</p>
<p>(1) While the authors favor the model that the enhanced cohesin loading upon diminished TORC1 activity helps cells to survive harsh environmental conditions, as starvation of S. pombe also drives commitment to meiosis, it seems as plausible that enhanced cohesin loading is related to preparing the chromosomes to mate.</p>
<p>(2) Related to Point 1, the lab of Sophie Martin previously published that phosphorylation of Mis4 characterizes a cluster of phosphotargets during starvation/meiotic induction (PMID: 39705284). This work should be cited, and the authors should interrogate how their observations do or do not relate to these prior observations (are these the same phosphosites?).</p>
<p>(3) It would be useful for the authors to combine their experimental data sets to interrogate whether there is a relationship between the regions where gene expression is altered in the mis4-G1487D strain and changes in the loading of cohesin in their ChIP experiments.</p>
<p>(4) Given that the genes that are affected are predominantly sub-telomeric while most genes are not affected in the mis4-G1487D strain, one possibility that the authors may wish to consider is that the regions that become dysregulated are tied to heterochromatic regions where Swi6/HP1 has been implicated in cohesin loading.</p>
<p>(5) It would be helpful to show individual data points from replicates in the bar graphs - it is not always clear what comprises the data sets, and superplots would be of great help.</p>
