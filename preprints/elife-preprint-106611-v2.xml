<title>Abstract</title><p>Enhancing proteasome function has been a long-standing but challenging target of interest for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, emphasizing the importance of understanding proteasome activation mechanisms. Most proteasome activator complexes use the C-terminal HbYX (hydrophobic-tyrosine-almost any residue) motif to bind and trigger gate-opening in the 20S proteasome. This study defines a critical molecular interaction in the HbYX mechanism that triggers gate opening. We focus on the Hb site interaction and find it plays a surprisingly central and crucial role in driving the allosteric conformational changes that induce gate opening in the archaeal 20S. We examined the cryo-EM structure of two mutant archaeal proteasomes, αV24Y T20S and αV24F T20S. These two mutants were engineered to place a bulky aromatic residue in the HbYX hydrophobic pocket; both mutants are highly active, though their mechanisms of activation are undefined. Collectively, our findings indicate that the interaction between the Hb group of the HbYX motif and its corresponding hydrophobic pocket is sufficient to induce gate opening in a mechanistically similar way to the HbYX motif. The activation mechanism studied here involves the expansion of the hydrophobic binding site, allosterically altering the state of the IT switch thus triggering gate-opening. Furthermore, we show that the canonical αK66 residue, previously understood to be critical for proteasome activator binding, also plays a key role in stabilizing the open gate, irrespective of activator binding. This study differentiates between the residues in the HbYX motif that support binding interactions (“YX”) versus those that allosterically contribute to gate opening (“Hb”). The insights reported here will guide future drug development efforts, particularly in designing small molecule proteasome activators, by targeting the identified hydrophobic pocket.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The proteasome is a molecular machine responsible for degrading misfolded, damaged, and unneeded proteins that are targeted via multiple mechanisms including the conventional pathway of ubiquitination(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Proteasomal degradation regulates major cellular processes and functions, such as synaptic plasticity and memory formation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Impairment of proteasome function has correlated with areas of the brain affected by neurodegenerative diseases, supporting its implication in these diseases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Furthermore, increasing proteasome activity has been shown to induce protective or rescue effects in models of neurodegenerative diseases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), strengthening the rationale to develop small molecule proteasome activators. The objective of this study is to provide a clear mechanistic framework of how proteasome activation occurs to inform drug discovery efforts.</p>
<p>The eukaryotic proteasome, also referred to as the 20S or the Core Particle (CP), consists of four stacked heteroheptameric (homoheptameric in archaea) rings arranged as α – β – β – α(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Three of the seven β subunits carry protease sites with distinct protease activities: caspase-like (β1), trypsin-like (β2), and chymotrypsin-like (β5). The α subunits have an N-termini that extends toward the central pore, forming a gate that regulates substrate entry. The gate is primarily formed by the N-termini of α2, 3, and 4 with α3’s N-termini (the longest) acting as the lynchpin(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). The interactions that stabilize the open conformation have been reported in crystal and cryo-EM structures(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). A YDR motif, found on the α N-termini, interacts with the neighboring α subunit’s N-terminal tail, to stabilize the gate in the open state. Most recently, we discovered that the open and closed states of the α N-termini conformation are stabilized by two alternating conformations of the IT switch(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Two α subunit residues, I12 and T13, in the archaeal <italic>Thermoplasma acidophilum</italic> proteasome (T20S), switch positions to occupy the pocket adjacent to Helix 0 and stabilize the open and closed gate conformation respectively. This IT switch is functionally conserved in the eukaryotic 20S(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Basal kinetics of the archaeal proteasome gate, quantified using NMR(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), indicates that the gate fluctuates between open and close on a time scale of seconds; however, the gate primarily exists in the closed state of isolated 20S.</p>
<p>The 20S proteasome is known to associate with regulatory complexes, collectively referred to as Proteasome Activators (PAs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). PA700 or 19S, which associates with the 20S to form the 26S, has been identified as a critical component of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway. PA700 recognizes ubiquitinated substrates and unfolds them to be degraded by the 20S. Like many PAs, PA700 induces 20S gate-opening via the HbYX-dependent mechanism, as does the archaeal homolog of PA700 called PAN(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Three of the six C-terminal tails of PA700’s ATPases carry a HbYX motif (hydrophobic-tyrosine-almost any residue), whereby the “X” residue must be the C-terminal residue. These HbYX motifs interact with the inter-subunit pockets in the 20S α ring and allosterically induce gate-opening. The precise molecular mechanism of how the motif’s binding in inter-subunit pockets induces gate opening is not known, though high-resolution structures of the 26S(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) and the 20S interacting with a di-peptide HbYX-mimetic(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) have generated plausible models. Structures of the 26S reveal that the C-terminal tails bind in a particular order during activation, though the correlation between the number of C-terminal tails/HbYX-bound to induce gate opening is controversial. A study indicated that partial gate opening occurs when Rpt2, 3, and 5, which have HbYX motifs, dock in their corresponding α inter-subunit pockets and full gate opening occurs when Rpt6, which does not have a HbYX motif, additionally binds(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Another study indicated that the binding of Rpt2, 3, and 5 did not open the gate, but the additional binding of Rpt6 causes full gate opening(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Interestingly, multiple studies suggest that Rpt1, which carries the penultimate tyrosine, but not the Hb group (partial-HbYX), must also bind in combination with Rpt2, 3, 5, and 6 for gate opening(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Collectively, these structures suggest that each inter-subunit pocket contributes to gate opening to varying extents, which correlates with the fact that each α subunit’s N-terminal tails differentially participate in the closed state, though the minimum occupancy of inter-subunit pockets required for gate opening is unresolved.</p>
<p>While some PAs are HbYX-dependent like PA700, the 11S family, such as PA26 or PA28 activate the proteasome via a HbYX-independent mechanism. Despite the divergence between mechanisms, they converge on the critical molecular interactions and conformational changes (e.g. the IT switch) that stabilize the open gate state(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). For example, both HbYX-dependent and HbYX-independent PAs have been shown to interact with αK66 side chain and mutating αK66 to alanine impedes PAs association and activation, validated by velocity sedimentation assay and proteasomal peptidase activity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Both mechanisms also involve a displacement of αPro17(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) and switching of the IT switch(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Therefore, though the cause of the conformational changes mentioned may differ between HbYX-dependent and HbYX-independent mechanisms, they share in some of the PA-20S interactions that support the open conformational state of the gate.</p>
<p>Our early studies showed that the HbYX motif could function even on short 6-7 residue peptides(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>); recently we showed that HbYX-dependent gate opening could be reduced to a carboxybenzyl (CBZ)-blocked YA dipeptide called ZYA—a minimal HbYX mimetic. Our ZYA-T20S structure(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) indicated the minimum molecular interactions necessary for optimal HbYX-dependent gate-opening by a small molecule. In our 1.9Ǻ resolution structure, ZYA was observed to interact with residues in the α subunit (G19, K66, L81, etc.) in a similar orientation and fashion as the native HbYX motif of various PA complexes. Our cryo-EM data indicated that αV24 (and αA154) hydrophobically interacts with the carboxybenzyl of ZYA and the hydrophobic side chain of the PAs HbYX motif. Interestingly, our previous study also indicated that a single residue mutation on αV24 (i.e., αV24Y, αV24F) increased proteasome activity, though the mechanism of activation by this mutation was not determined. To assess the significance of these mutations in activating the proteasome via the HbYX-dependent pathway, we determined the cryo-EM structure of αV24Y T20S and αV24F T20S. The results of this study indicate that occupancy of a hydrophobic pocket by a bulky hydrophobic group such as αV24Y within the α inter-subunit pocket is sufficient to trigger 20S gate opening via the HbYX-dependent mechanism, demonstrating the surprising importance of the HbYX motif’s single Hb group for allosteric activation of the 20S. The findings reported here are expected to translate to the human proteasome as ZYA is a robust activator of the mammalian 20S and the HbYX-dependent mechanism is conserved; thereby, uncovering a highly specific pharmaceutical target for proteasome activation.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM map of αV24Y T20S shows HbYX-dependent-like conformational changes and an open gate state</title>
<p>To elucidate how the mutation, αV24Y, induce gate-opening in the archaeal proteasome (αV24Y T20S), we resolved its structure using cryo-EM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; Fig. S1 &amp; S2). The <italic>Thermoplasma acidophilum</italic> 20S (T20S) has D7 symmetry, which was applied during reconstruction, and the final map resolved to 2.38Å (EMD-44914). Comparing the αV24Y T20S electron density map against our wild-type T20S (WT T20S) map (EMD-28878) revealed conformational changes similar to those previously noted in our ZYA-T20S model(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) (PDB:8F7K) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Alignment of the maps indicate the αV24Y mutation induced minimal conformational changes in the β rings, while the α subunits exhibited rotational changes that closely mimicked HbYX-dependent conformational changes, such as those induced by ZYA binding(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> &amp; B). Comparison of the maps show the presence of the expected larger density of the mutant tyrosine side chain in the hydrophobic pocket of the αV24Y T20S map with proximity to the docking location of the carboxybenzyl group (Z) of ZYA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, D</xref>, &amp; E).</p>

<p>Our prior biochemical analysis showed that the αV24Y mutation caused substantial acceleration of peptide degradation, suggesting that this mutation might stimulate gate-opening(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>); therefore, we sought to determine the conformational changes in the structure of αV24Y T20S. We observed significant densities corresponding to the YDR motif in the open state, designating an open gate conformation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F, G</xref>, &amp; H). Additionally, the densities corresponding to the “IT switch” were in similar confirmation to previously known open gate proteasome cryo-EM structures: ZYA-T20S (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I, J</xref>, &amp; K) and L81Y-T20S(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). It is also apparent in the map of αV24Y T20S that there is a lack of densities in the central cavity of the α ring that corresponding to the closed state of the α N-termini, definitively confirming that V24Y T20S’s gate is open (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> &amp; B). Collectively, the comparison of maps demonstrates that V24Y T20S is in an open state with global conformational changes in the α-subunits that mirror those of a HbYX-bound proteasome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>αV24Y T20S shows HbYX dependent conformational changes that are greater in magnitude than those seen in the ZYA-T20S structure</title>
<p>To gain a more detailed understanding of the conformational changes induced by αV24Y, we generated an atomic model using the αV24Y T20S map. To evaluate the global conformational changes in the α subunits, we aligned the αV24Y T20S and the ZYA-T20S to the WT T20S model via their β subunits and overlayed all three models (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The α subunits in αV24Y T20S rotate roughly as a rigid body on a pivot around Helix 2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B, C</xref>, &amp; 3A), using WT T20S as a reference. This rotation around Helix 2 is also true for the ZYA-T20S structure and was noted previously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), but the rotation in αV24Y T20S is greater than in ZYA-T20S (see arrows in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The helical bundle composed of Helices 4, 5, and 6 (see asterisks in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) move the most with some residues in these helices moving 3-4Å in the αV24Y T20S model relative to WT, which is about twice the distance moved in the ZYA-T20S model(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). In addition, αP17 in the αV24Y moves about 1.6Å and Helix 0 moves ∼1.4Å compared to WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), which is also about twice the distance these residues move in the ZYA-T20S structure. Taken together, the conformational changes induced by αV24Y are highly similar to those induce by binding of the HbYX mimetic ZYA, but they are of greater magnitude in these structures. The observed greater change is likely attributable to the αV24Y mutation affecting the entire proteasome population within that structure.</p>

</fig>
<p>In contrast, ZYA is a low-affinity ligand, anticipated to occupy only a subset of the binding sites in its structure’s population. Since cryo-EM analysis averages all structures, the reduced population with conformational changes in the ZYA-bound structure represents an average of closed and open states and thus, apparent conformational changes are smaller in the ZYA structure relative to the αV24Y mutant.</p>
<p>αK66 has long been known to be critical for binding to the C-terminal carboxyl of PA’s(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). We previously observed that αK66 was repositioned by the binding of ZYA’s carboxyl(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Since the inter-subunit pocket in the αV24Y T20S has no ligand bound, we expected αK66 to have a similar conformation to WT, but we were surprised to find that K66 was similarly repositioned in the αV24Y T20S mutant, as it was in ZYA-T20S, except to a slightly greater extent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). This suggests αK66, by itself, may play mechanistic roles in gate opening, in addition to its role in PAs binding. Based on the comparison of the WT, ZYA bound and αV24Y T20S structures, we conclude that the αV24Y mutation by itself induces HbYX-dependent conformational changes in the 20S proteasome.</p>

<title>Comparison of V24Y T20S to the WT T20S reveals specific intra-subunit conformational changes induced by αV24Y mutation</title>
<p>It is remarkable that a single point mutation in the T20S can mimic a 3-residue motif, let alone the activation capacity of a large complex like PAN or PA26. While the α ring is an allosteric system with each neighboring α subunit affecting the next (e.g., a rigid body rotation of one α subunits is expected to affect its neighbor and so on), it’s also likely that HbYX binding or the αV24Y mutation could cause conformational changes in a single α subunit as well, which could trigger allosteric transitions to the open state. Thus, we sought to identify the intra<bold>-</bold>subunit (within a single subunit) conformational changes that could lead to larger inter-subunit (between subunits) conformational changes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> &amp; B) that perpetuate around the entire α-ring and induce gate-opening (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>The substitution of αV24 for tyrosine presents a much larger and aromatic side chain in the hydrophobic pocket. This tyrosine could impose intra-subunit conformational changes on the surrounding secondary structures. To measure these changes, we aligned a single α subunit from the WT T20S to αV24Y T20S. We found that the distance between αL21 and αA154, residues that surround the hydrophobic pocket, indicate that the pocket is widened by ∼1.3A due to the αV24Y mutation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> vs. D). Another measurement of this pocket width between T124 and L21 also widens by ∼1Å (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). However, the distance between αV24 or αV24Y to αL81 is consistent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> vs. D), suggesting that the hydrophobic pocket has not enlarged in all directions.</p>

<p>We hypothesize that the widening of the hydrophobic pocket that αV24Y occupies is the causal point of origin triggering the inter-subunit conformational changes that we observed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>. The HbYX hydrophobic pocket occupied by αV24Y side chain is adjacent to another hydrophobic pocket found on the opposite side of Helix 0 (on the 20S central channel), where the side chain of αI12 (an IT Switch residue) occupies in the open state (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> &amp; F). The αV24Y T20S model coincides with the αV24Y T20S map, showing that the IT switch is in the open state (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), where the αI12 side chain is oriented to occupy the IT switch hydrophobic pocket adjacent to Helix 0 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> vs. F). Due to the adjacent proximity of both hydrophobic pockets (on either side of and below Helix 0), a conformational change in the HbYX hydrophobic pocket would also affect the IT switch’s hydrophobic pocket since these pockets share common space. It is highly plausible that the change in the HbYX hydrophobic pocket, resulting from the larger side chain of tyrosine (compared to valine), could facilitate the switch between αT13 and αI12 in the IT switch hydrophobic pocket (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> vs. F). The αV24Y mutation increases the hydrophobicity and size of the pocket, likely enhancing the binding affinity for the larger hydrophobic side chain of isoleucine. In conclusion, it appears that occupancy of the HbYX hydrophobic pocket with an aromatic ring of tyrosine allosterically affects the IT switch hydrophobic pocket, as intra-subunit conformational changes allow the IT switch to reconfigure to an open state.</p>
<p>αProline17 (P17) displacement is one of the first identified inter-subunit conformational changes associated with triggering gate opening, specifically by the 11S family members(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Interestingly, when the IT switch switches to an open configuration, it generates “slack” between the IT switch and P17(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) (Fig. S4A &amp; S4B). In αV24Y T20S, this “slack” appears to allow for an increase in the intra-subunit distance between Helix 0 and αP17 (Fig. S4B). In addition, we observe an intra-subunit displacement (not rotation based) of P17 by 1.5Å (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>) consistent with the additional slack from the switching of the IT switch. In addition, intra-subunit analysis shows αP17 is displaced by 1Å away from its neighbor’s Helix 0 (Fig. S4C); however, this distance between P17 and the neighboring Helix 0 does not change globally (Fig. S4A &amp; S4B) due to the rigid body rotation of the α subunits which maintain packing between the P17 loop and the neighboring Helix 0. In short, the conformational change of the IT switch to the open state appears to provide flexibility for the Pro17 loop to absorb, or perhaps allow, the rigid body rotation associated with HbYX induced gate-opening. Moreover, our structure suggests the widening of the hydrophobic pocket between αL21 and αA154 may also contribute to the shift in αP17, as αL21 is connected on the other side of the αP17 loop (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>).</p>
<p>We observed that the side chain of αE25 is involved in an intrahelical hydrogen(H)-bond with αR28 in the WT structure (Fig. S5A &amp; S5B), which is displaced by the αV24Y mutation and instead H-bonds with αR20 (Fig. S5C &amp; S5D). The displacement slightly increases the distance between αE25 and αR20 (Fig. SB vs. S5D) further providing “slack” for the αP17 movement. We previously showed the mutation of αE25 to alanine, activated gate opening and prevented PAs from being able to induce gate opening in the T20S(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Therefore, biochemical evidence also supports an important role for this αE25 rearrangement in destabilizing the closed state and perhaps stabilizing the open state.</p>
<p>We also considered other mechanisms by which the αV24Y mutation might influence gate opening such as its side chain’s hydroxyl polar interactions. We find that αY24 side chain interacted with the side chain of αD152 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>); however, no significant conformational changes were observed along the β-sheet that αD152 is positioned on. Thus, it is not apparent how the polar interaction between αY24 and αD152 might be associated with gate opening, other than the fact that the H-bond may help orient this tyrosine rotamer.</p>

<title>Comparison of activated T20S forms: αV24Y T20S and ZYA-T20S</title>
<p>The cryo-EM structure presented here (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> &amp; 2) and our previously published biochemical data(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) clearly demonstrate the open state of the αV24Y-T20S mutant. The substitution of αV24 for tyrosine was engineered to mimic how the “Hb” group of the HbYX motif binds to its hydrophobic pocket, but does it? As previously mentioned, the global conformational changes in the αV24Y 20S were similar to a HbYX-bound 20S (i.e., minimal conformational changes in the β subunits, rigid body rotation of α subunits pivoting on Helix 2) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> &amp; 2), suggesting that the mechanism of gate-opening by αV24Y mutation has mechanistic overlap with the HbYX mechanism (e.g. ZYA-T20S). Therefore, we sought to identify, at the molecular level, how these two open T20S models compare and identify any intra-subunit conformational changes that can be specifically attributed to the occupancy of the hydrophobic pocket by the Hb component of the HbYX motif, without influence from the Y and X residues of the HbYX motif. The αV24Y T20S model allows for analysis of the isolated effects of Hb occupancy in the hydrophobic pocket.</p>
<p>Comparison of αV24Y T20S against ZYA-T20S reveals that the intra-subunit conformational changes induced by αV24Y were highly similar, as there were few differences between the α subunits when aligned to one another (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, B</xref> &amp; C). Comparison of the hydrophobic pocket between the two open models, ZYA-T20S and αV24Y T20S, shows that the Z group of ZYA and the αV24Y tyrosine both clearly bind to the HbYX hydrophobic pocket and overlap in space, though they bind in different orientations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Moreover, molecular surface representations of the hydrophobic pocket (WT versus V24Y T20S) clearly show pocket occupancy by the mutant tyrosine’s side chain (Fig. S7). In addition, the measurements of αV24Y’s side chain or Z of ZYA to surrounding residues within each individual subunit provide the most relevant visual approximation and overlap comparison of the “Z” and “αV24Y” aromatic group positions in the HbYX hydrophobic pocket (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref> &amp; F). For comparison, the distance between αV24 or αV24Y to αL81 marginally differs by ∼0.3A while the distance between αL21 and αL81 is comparable in both models (Fig. S6A &amp; S6B). The measurement of the hydrophobic pocket between αL21 and αT124 is widened in the αV24Y T20S (∼0.7Å; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). This pocket measurement also enlarges in the ZYA T20S structure compared to WT, though to a lesser extent (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>), consistent with the observed extent of changes in these models (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). However, the largest difference in this comparison between ZYA bound and αV24Y is in the measurement between αL21 and αA154, as the V24Y tyrosine is better positioned to influence this specific measurement. (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). To validate this important conformational change in the maps raw data in a statistically significant way we used CCP-EM to generate confidence maps of WT and V24Y structures at an FDR 0.01. These confidence maps clear show conformational differences in A154 in the V24Y structure (Fig. S3B). Lastly, the placement of αI12’s side chain in the IT switch hydrophobic pocket between Helix 0 and Helix 2 protrudes ∼0.8Å deeper in the pocket in V24Y T20S compared to ZYA-T20S (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>), consistent with the larger hydrophobic pocket under Helix 0 in the mutant.</p>
<p>Collectively, evidence suggests that ZYA’s mechanism as an activator is due to its hydrophobic group occupying the space between HbYX hydrophobic pocket, similar to αV24Y, but ZYA’s mechanism also relies on others parts of the dipeptide as modifications to tyrosine affected the small molecule’s ability to activate(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). In combination with the evidence shown here, we conclude that the hydrophobic group of ZYA is likely the primarily feature allosterically affecting gate-opening but the insertion of this Hb group into the hydrophobic pocket also relies on interactions of the Y and X residues with the inter-subunit pocket to provide sufficient binding affinity. As for αV24Y T20S, the hydrophobic component (tyrosine’s side chain) is covalently held in place in the hydrophobic pocket and thus does not require the “YX” interactions and therefore, sufficiently supports stable gate opening through a similar mechanism to ZYA.</p>

<title>αK66 supports gate opening through a previously unknown mechanism</title>
<p>Many studies in the past have highlighted the importance of αK66, found in the back loop of the inter-subunit pocket (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> &amp; 5A), and our αV24Y T20S structure shows that αK66 is reorganized similar to when ZYA binds. These observations inspired us to elucidate how intra-subunit conformational changes in αK66 may be affected by αV24Y. αK66 is well known to form hydrogen or salt bonds with the C-termini of PAs and is required for PA binding to the 20S(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), but how is αK66 affected when there is no bound PA? The back loop of the inter-subunit pocket is naturally a more flexible loop but in αV24Y T20S, this loop does have significant intra-subunit conformational changes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), with this loop being displaced by ∼3Å (inter-subunit measurements are similar). Additionally, we noticed αK66 moved ∼1Å towards αT78 and its side chain is oriented to be in closer proximity to hydrogen bond with both αT78 and αE211 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> &amp; B). Such interactions are not observed in the WT T20S (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>) but are seen in the ZYA-T20S (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). αK66A mutants do not exhibit activation by HbYX-dependent or HbYX-independent activators leading prior studies to conclude that αK66 was important for binding of proteasome activators(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). However, the repositioning of αK66 in the αV24Y T20S structure, which does not have a proteasome activator bound, indicates that αK66 may also be involved in stabilizing the open state on its own. To test this hypothesis, we generated a double mutant proteasome, αV24Y-αK66A T20S. We isolated this mutant and measured fluorogenic peptide hydrolysis activity (LFP). We found that αV24Y-αK66A T20S has similar activity to WT and is not hyperactive like αV24Y T20S (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Thus, αK66 is essential for αV24Y induced gate-opening. These enzymatic results support the conclusion that αK66 does not only interact with proteasome activators to support gate opening but is also critically involved in stabilizing the open state of the α subunit gate by forming new interactions with αT78 and αE211 in the open state.</p>

<title>αV24Y mutation affected the hydrophilicity of the inter-subunit pocket</title>
<p>Our previous study of ZYA-T20S suggested that the HbYX mechanism of activation involved the rearrangement of water molecules, so we sought to determine if the same applies in αV24Y T20S. The mutation essentially introduces a larger hydrophobic side chain to the inter-subunit pocket and therefore, we expect rearrangement of water molecules. Our map and model suggest that the αV24Y mutation either excluded or rearranged water molecules found in the WT T20S inter-subunit pocket (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref> vs. B). Additionally, none of the water molecules placement in αV24Y</p>
<p>T20S coincided with the exact placement and interactions as in ZYA-T20S (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), suggesting that waters involved in ZYA’s binding to the inter-subunit pocket may not be relevant in αV24Y T20S. This is unsurprising given that ZYA is a molecule that occupies a good portion of the inter-subunit pocket, relative to the small change caused by the αV24Y mutation. Interestingly the inter-subunit pockets of αV24Y appears to be more dehydrated relative to the WT, but structures with equivalent resolutions would be necessary to confirm. The results collectively suggest that while water interactions in the inter-subunit pockets change substantially in the open versus closed states (at these resolutions), we do not observe specific waters shared between these two open 20S models that would suggest waters being critically involved in stabilization of the open gate by these two different activation mechanisms (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

<title>αV24F T20S is not activated similarly to αV24Y T20S</title>
<p>Similar to αV24Y T20S, the αV24F T20S mutant showed increased basal activity compared to WT T20S biochemically(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Therefore, we sought to elucidate whether the mechanism of activation would be similar if the substitution was to a phenylalanine as opposed to a tyrosine. Comparison of the αV24F T20S map (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, Fig. S8 &amp; S9) to αV24Y T20S and WT T20S maps and models reveal a distinct lack of densities in the α subunits when αV24 is mutated to phenylalanine (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref> &amp; C). The lack of densities is most apparent from the N-termini and through Helix 0, though the map was also lacking densities in other selected regions of the α subunit. Globally analyzing the αV24F T20S map suggests that the αV24F mutation affected the proper folding of secondary structures surrounding the αV24F mutation (e.g. on Helix 0), but interestingly, this lack of Helix 0 folding did not affect the assembly of the proteasome itself (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref> &amp; C). The difference between maps indicates that the β subunits are minimally affected in the assembly of the proteasome and that the lack of densities affected the α subunit throughout, though they were most apparent around the gating regions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref> &amp; E). The lack of densities in αV24F T20S map suggests that substrates could enter the mutant proteasome more easily through the larger opening and therefore, biochemically exhibited kinetics comparable to or even exceeding the activated proteasome(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Proteasome impairment and reduced proteostasis are common observations in clinical cases and animal models of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, which has inspired the search for small molecule proteasome activators for years. Yet, there is a lack of robust small molecule proteasome activators to date, in part due to a lack of understanding in proteasome activation mechanisms. The α inter-subunit pockets have long been known to be the binding site of PA complexes but the exact molecular interactions between the inter-subunit pockets and the PAs that cause gate-opening have been elusive, preventing efficacious design of proteasome-activating small molecules. While no FDA-approved <italic>in vivo</italic> proteasome-activating small molecule exists as a tool for proof of concept, our previous work(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) to express constitutively active 20S proteasomes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> indicated that the mutant proteasomes supported an increased resistance to proteotoxicities and increased lifespan, supporting the rationale for this study. Here, we present a single specific binding site within the inter-subunit pocket that when occupied, is sufficient to induce gate opening and therefore, a plausible and well-defined pharmaceutical target for proteasome activators.</p>
<p>To identify the fundamental molecular interaction(s) required for gate-opening, we focused on the archaeal proteasome as it is homoheptameric, which is particularly an advantage when desiring a high resolution cryo-EM structure to map detailed interactions. Moreover, the archaeal proteasome still carries the conserved structures involved in gating, and both human and archaeal 20S can be opened by the same HbYX peptides (e.g. ZYA), implying that the findings of this study could be applied to the human system with some caveats discussed below. We recently demonstrated that the αV24Y mutant archaeal proteasomes exhibited upregulated activity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Our αV24Y T20S structure here reveals inter-subunit conformational changes essentially identical to a HbYX-bound archaeal proteasome (ZYA-T20S)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), demonstrating that it is in an open state, allowing us to further elucidate how this single residue mutation opens the gate, and by extension, better understand the mechanism of gate opening by the HbYX motif itself.</p>
<p>Collectively, our findings in αV24Y T20S focus on a mechanism of gate-opening originating at the occupancy of a hydrophobic pocket between αL21 and αT124. The αV24Y mutation places an aromatic side chain in between αL21 and αT124 (as well αL21 and αA154), similar to the position of the benzyl group (Z) of ZYA in the ZYA-T20S structure. The occupancy of this hydrophobic pocket by αV24Y expands the adjacent pocket where αI12 of the IT Switch is previously found to bind in open gate proteasome structures. αL21, displaced by αV24Y’s larger side chain compared to αV24 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), is connected to the αP17 loop, which has been commonly shown to be displaced in open gate proteasome structures. The results here also suggest that this mechanism applies to the ZYA-T20S (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>), though it may not be the only mechanism supporting ZYA’s gate-opening as ZYA is a dipeptide as opposed to a single residue mutation (αV24Y) that occupies the hydrophobic pocket. For example, the YA residues bridge the subunit from αK66 to the αP17 loop, which also likely stabilizes the open state(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). The interaction of ZYA’s carboxy group with αK66 may also help stabilize the open-state conformation of αK66 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), which we showed is essential for gate-opening here (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). The conformational changes between the two models are consistent, although αV24Y T20S exhibits larger conformational changes likely due cryo-EM averaging effects in the lower populated ligand-bound states (ZYA) compared to the V24Y mutant. ZYA as a dipeptide has the ability to and perhaps, even rely on interacting with other parts of the inter-subunit pocket to supports its binding and orient the Z group in the hydrophobic pocket. Results from both αV24Y T20S and ZYA-T20S both suggest that occupying the hydrophobic pocket is a key to gate opening in the archaeal proteasome, and potentially the mammalian proteasome if placed in the right pocket(s).</p>
<p>The two key residues that “sandwiches” αV24Y’s side chain and forms the hydrophobic pocket, αL21 and αA154, are conserved in the human 20S α inter-subunit pockets (Fig. S10), indicating that a similar mechanism of occupying this hydrophobic pocket is used for gate-opening in the human system. Five out of seven H20S α subunits carry leucine in a similar position to αL21 in the T20S. The remaining two subunits carry an isoleucine (α6: PSMA1) and valine (α7: PSMA3), which are hydrophobic like leucine. Additionally, while αA154 is only conserved as alanine in α1: PSMA6, the rest of the subunits carry a methionine in this position, which is also hydrophobic. Previous analysis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) also indicated that the H20S has analogs of the IT switch in selected α subunits, which suggests that targeting this hydrophobic pocket at selected α subunits with the conserved IT switch would have a greater effect on gate-opening than others. Any application of this mechanism in the human system is still complicated and should also consider the prior prediction that multiple inter-subunit pockets likely need to be occupied by the HbYX motifs for gate-opening(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). The conservation of activation motif, residues, and conformational changes between archaeal and human proteasomes for gate opening demonstrates potential for the findings in this study to translate to activating the human 20S.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our αV24F T20S structure indicates that the position of this residue in the protein chain plays a role in α subunit folding. Our αV24F T20S cryo-EM map reveals that the α subunits are partially assembled, with the majority of regions proximal to the gating residues lacking densities, suggesting disorder. Yet, the β subunits appear functional, both structurally and biochemically(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), which suggests that the proteasome does not require perfectly formed α subunits for complete proteasome assembly. We notice that the hydroxyl group of αV24Y’s side chain is involved in polar interactions; however, we do not presume this to be involved in α subunit assembly as valine lacks the side chain to interact similarly. Rather, we speculate that αV24F may introduce too large of a hydrophobic group that, without a hydroxyl to interact with αD152 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>) prevents proper folding interactions.</p>
<p>Collectively, our analysis indicates that the HbYX hydrophobic pocket expands due to αV24Y’s more bulky side chain, which likely sets of a chain of events starting with the IT switch, which are modeled and schematized in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>. The wider and now more hydrophobic IT switch pocket likely promotes IT switch to switch to the open state, providing flexibility for the αP17 loop intra-subunit motions, or “slack”. In addition, the widening of the hydrophobic pocket and rearrangement of the αE25 H-bonding pattern also appears to allow more flexibility for αP17 loop motions. Combined, these intra-subunit conformational changes collectively elongate the αP17 loop, increasing its flexibility. This enhanced flexibility is crucial because the αP17 loop interfaces with Helix 0 of neighboring α subunits. The loop’s increased plasticity accommodates rigid-body rotations against the adjacent α subunits, which would otherwise be constrained. As a result, these rotational movements can propagate allosterically around the proteasome α ring. Though this causal chain of events is supported by these structures, the timing and order of these events cannot be elucidated with these static structures. The structures here suggest a plausible molecular mechanism of how a single residue mutation in the HbYX hydrophobic pocket can induce 20S gate opening (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

<p>Our findings in this study also highlight and revise an understanding of the αK66’s role in proteasomal gate-opening. Previous findings have consistently alluded to its critical role for the association of HbYX-dependent and HbYX-independent PAs, as αK66 was shown to interact with and orient the C-terminal tails of PAs for gate-opening(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). To our surprise, the αV24Y T20S structure demonstrates that αK66’s side chain conformation changes, even though it does not interact with a PA or HbYX mimetic such as ZYA. Our double mutant αV24Y&amp;K66A T20S’s basal activity supports the necessity of the αK66 conformational change observed in the αV24Y model and indicates the involvement of αK66 in stabilizing the open-gate conformation through a previously unreported mechanism. The conformational change in αK66 is supported by changes in H-bonding interactions between αK66 and surrounding residues, which are absent in the closed structure (WT T20S). These findings therefore demonstrate that αK66’s conformational changes support other conformational changes such as the conformation of the back loop, which it is connected to, and has been shown to be involved in HbYX-dependent gate opening(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Essentially, αK66 is deduced to contribute more than interacting with activators, and also appears to be necessary to stabilize the open state of the 20S.</p>
<p>Our prior study showed the possible roles waters could play in proteasome activation and gating regulation. Our ZYA-T20S structure indicated that the hydroxyl of ZYA’s tyrosine side chain interacted with a water molecule that further hydrogen bonded with αL21 and αE25. To elucidate the relevance and importance of this water interaction, we mutated αE25(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). αE25A proteasome mutants exhibited an upregulated basal activity that was not further activated by PAN or PA26, suggesting it plays an important role in gating. To elucidate whether a similar mechanism occurs in αV24Y T20S open gate conformation, we sought to identify where waters might be found within the inter-subunit pocket. Broadly, we observed significantly fewer waters in the inter-subunit pockets of αV24Y T20S than we did in the WT T20S and ZYA-T20S. We note that αV24Y T20S’s resolution is not as high as ZYA-T20S but is reasonable for predicting water coordinates. Because no common water was found in the two different open states, the necessity and role of specific water molecule interactions in gate-opening could not be elucidated from these structures.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the findings described indicate that the occupancy of the hydrophobic pocket within the α inter-subunit pocket is sufficient to induce gate-opening in archaeal proteasomes. The application of this finding in the mammalian system relies on further identification of the critical inter-subunit pockets that need to be occupied by the HbYX motif in that system to stabilize gate-opening. Our prior studies involving ZYA have indicated a minimum of two HbYX motifs binding for gate-opening in the mammalian system(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). However, the mammalian 20S has 7 different pockets that can be occupied in different ways by 6 different Rpt1-6 C-termini, so the specific inter-subunit pockets that need C-termini/HbYX motifs bound to activate gate opening has not been worked out. All cryo-EM studies to date agree that occupancy of five Rpt C-termini is sufficient for gate opening, but which of those are required for gate opening is not known. Further progress on the HbYX mechanism based on the results thus far would be to identify the specific inter-subunit pockets that need to be occupied by the HbYX motif to induce gate-opening in the eukaryotic proteasomes.</p>
<p>While this study provides significant insights, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations. A key limitation stems from using the homoheptameric archaeal T20S as our model. Although this simpler system allows for more reliable dissection of fundamental mechanisms, and core elements like HbYX-induced gate opening are conserved at the intersubunit pocket level, the overall T20S and eukaryotic 20S/26S proteasomes differ significantly in their complexity. Specifically, our engineered αV24Y mutation results in a tyrosine constitutively occupying all seven identical hydrophobic pockets. This contrasts with the eukaryotic proteasome, which possesses seven distinct α-subunit pockets that interact with various Rpt C-termini through dynamic binding. Moreover, the specific Rpt C-termini interactions—whether acting individually or cooperatively—that are essential to drive gate opening in the eukaryotic system remain incompletely understood. Therefore, while insights from our archaeal system are valuable for understanding general principles, direct comparisons and extrapolations to the intricate allostery and interaction complexities of the eukaryotic 26S proteasome must be made with caution.</p>
<p>The work presented here is conducted with the intentions of understanding proteasome activation mechanisms and developing the molecular framework for restoring or activating proteasome activity to combat the impairment consistently observed in neurodegenerative diseases, which is barred by our limited understanding of proteasome regulation. Here, we advance the field’s understanding of proteasomal gate-opening by extending beyond the vague idea that HbYX motif binding induces gate opening, to pinpointing a sole molecular interaction that significantly and sufficiently opens the proteasome’s gate. Our findings inform proteasome activating drug discovery efforts to focus on small molecules that occupies the HbYX hydrophobic pocket.</p>

<title>Confidence map generation</title>
<p>Small conformational changes (e.g. ∼1Å) with larger allosteric effects altering 20S gating and enzymatic activity are common features in the 20S proteasome, which has been published extensively. However, to more rigorously demonstrate that these changes are statistically significant at the map data level, we used CPP-EM to generate confidence maps of our WT and V24Y structures (Fig. S3B). Confidence maps statistically interpret cryo-EM densities by testing each voxel against background noise and controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). We thresholded our maps of WT and V24Y at an FDR of 0.01 to highlight regions with statistically significant density. We then overlayed these maps in Chimera to show they clearly show conformational changes even at an FDR of 0.01, especially at the specific regions the reviewer was concerned about.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> manuscript describes cryo-EM structures of archaeal proteasomes that reveal insights into how occupancy of binding pockets on the 20S proteasome regulates proteasome gating. The evidence supporting these claims is <bold>convincing</bold>, although the extrapolation of these findings to the more complex eukaryotic proteasome may prove challenging. This work will be of high interest to researchers interested in proteasome structure and regulation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Chua, Daugherty, and Smith analyze a new set of archaeal 20S proteasomes obtained by cryo-EM that illustrate how the occupancy of the HbYX binding pocket induces gate opening. They do so primarily through a V24Y mutation in the α-subunit. These results are supported by a limited set of mutations in K66 in the α subunit, bringing new emphasis to this unit.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The new structure's analysis is comprehensive, occupying the entire manuscript. As such, the scope of this manuscript is very narrow, but the strength of the data are solid, and they offer an interesting and important new piece to the gate-opening literature.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Extrapolating from the core HbYX activating motif shared by Archae and Eukaryotes to the specific operations of gate opening, which is more elaborate in eukaryotes, may prove challenging.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Chuah et al. reports the experimental results that suggest the occupancy of the HbYX pockets suffices for proteasome gate opening. The authors conducted cryo-EM reconstructions of two mutant archaeal proteasomes. The work is technically sound and may be of special interest in the field of structural biology of the proteasomes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the work incrementally deepens our understanding of the proteasome activation and expands the structural foundation for therapeutic intervention of proteasome function. The evidence presented appears to be well aligned with the existing literature, which adds confidence in the presentation.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed all my questions.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Chua, Daugherty, and Smith analyze a new set of archaeal 20S proteasomes obtained by cryo-EM that illustrate how the occupancy of the HbYX binding pocket induces gate opening. They do so primarily through a V24Y mutation in the αsubunit. These results are supported by a limited set of mutations in K66 in the α subunit, bringing new emphasis to this unit.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The new structure's analysis is comprehensive, occupying the entire manuscript. As such, the scope of this manuscript is very narrow, but the strength of the data is solid, and they offer an interesting and important new piece to the gate-opening literature.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major Concerns</p>
<p>(1) This manuscript rests on one new cryo-EM structure, leading to a single (albeit convincing) experiment demonstrating the importance of occupying the pocket and moving K66. Could a corresponding bulky mutation at K66 not activate the 20S proteasome?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this insightful question. We believe such a mutation would likely not activate the proteasome, and would likely  be detrimental to gate opening. Our previous work (Smith et al., Molecular Cell, 2007), and data presented in this manuscript, demonstrate that a K66A mutation, which removes the side chain, blocks 20S gate opening. Furthermore, our new αV24Y T20S structure reveals that Lys66 forms specific hydrogen bonds with surrounding residues that are crucial for stabilizing the open gate conformation (Fig. 5). An aromatic or bulky hydrophobic mutation at this position would be unable to form these essential hydrogen bonds and would likely disrupt the necessary stabilizing interactions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) To emphasize the importance of this work, the authors highlight the importance of gateopening to human 20S proteasomes. However, the key distinctions between these proteasomes are not given sufficient weight.</p>
<p>(a) As the authors note, the six distinct Rpt C-termini can occupy seven different pickets. However, how these differences would impact activation is not thoroughly discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's point regarding the complexities of eukaryotic 26S proteasome activation. While our manuscript discusses some aspects of this, we agree that a detailed mechanistic extrapolation from our archaeal T20S model to the diverse interactions within the human 26S proteasome is challenging. As we elaborate in our response to Reviewer #2 (Recommendation #3), the significant differences in α-ring composition (homoheptameric vs. heteroheptameric) and the multifactorial nature of Rpt C-termini binding make direct, wide-reaching speculations about specific pocket contributions in the eukaryotic system difficult at this stage. Our aim was to focus on the conserved fundamental role of the HbYX hydrophobic pocket itself.</p>

<p>(b) With those other sites, the relative importance of various pockets, such as the one controlling the α3 N-terminus, should be discussed more thoroughly as a potential critical difference.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises an excellent point about the regulation of specific α-subunits, like the α3 N-terminus, which acts as a lynchpin in gating. Understanding its precise regulation in the eukaryotic 26S proteasome is indeed a key goal in the field. However, determining which specific HbYX binding events (e.g., in the α2-α3 pocket, the α3-α4 pocket, or cooperative binding across multiple pockets) control the α3 subunit's conformation is beyond the scope of what our current T20S structural data can definitively inform. The cooperative nature of HbYX binding and its precise allosteric consequences across the heteroheptameric α-ring are complex questions that remain to be fully elucidated in the eukaryotic system. Our study focuses on demonstrating the sufficiency of hydrophobic pocket occupancy for activation in a conserved manner, which we propose is a fundamental aspect of HbYX action. Identifying which of the seven distinct eukaryotic hydrophobic pockets must be engaged for full activation remains an important area for future research.</p>

<p>(c) These differences can lead to eukaryote 20S gates shifting between closed and open and having a partially opened state. This becomes relevant if the goal is to lead to an activated 20S. It would have been interesting to have archaea 20S with a mix of WT and V24Y α-subunits. However, one might imagine the subclassification problem would be challenging and require an extraordinary number of particles.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that exploring mixed subunit populations is an interesting idea, particularly given the dynamic and potentially partially open states of eukaryotic proteasomes. We have previously considered co-expressing WT and V24Y α-subunits. However, the interpretation of such experiments would be challenging. With 14 potential sites for mutant incorporation across the two homoheptameric α-rings, a heterogeneous population of proteasomes with varying numbers and arrangements of V24Y subunits would be generated. Correlating any observed changes in activity or structure (e.g. via cryoEM subclassification, would be exceedingly difficult) to specific stoichiometries or arrangements of mutant subunits would be highly complex and likely inconclusive for deriving clear mechanistic insights.</p>

<p>(d) Furthermore, the conservation of the amino acids around the binding pocket was not addressed. This seems particularly important in the relative contribution of a residue analogous to K66 or V24.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the mislabeled figure title in the previous submission, which may have made this information less accessible. We have now corrected the title for Supplemental Figure S10 (previously S9). This figure presents the sequence alignment showing the conservation of residues in and around the HbYX hydrophobic pocket, including those analogous to T20S αV24, αL21, and αA154. As discussed in the manuscript, key residues that form this pocket, such as those corresponding to and surrounding T20S L21 and A154, are indeed well conserved in human α-subunits. This conservation supports the relevance of our findings to eukaryotic proteasomes.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Chuah et al. reports the experimental results that suggest the occupancy of the HbYX pockets suffices for proteasome gate opening. The authors conducted cryo-EM reconstructions of two mutant archaeal proteasomes. The work is technically sound and may be of special interest in the field of structural biology of the proteasomes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the work incrementally deepens our understanding of the proteasome activation and expands the structural foundation for therapeutic intervention of proteasome function. The evidence presented appears to be well aligned with the existing literature, which adds confidence in the presentation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper may benefit from some minor revision by making improvements on the figures and necessary quantitative comparative studies.</p>

<p>(5) The title for Figure S9, &quot;αV24Y T20S validation,&quot; is inappropriate. A better title should discuss the sequence conservation of those amino acids. Why is the arrow drawing attention to L21 when the paper is about V24? There should be a corresponding alignment that includes K66.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out the title issue for Figure S10 (previously S9); this has now been corrected to reflect its focus on sequence conservation. The arrow highlighting L21 (and its eukaryotic analogues) is intended to draw attention to a key residue that, along with A154, forms part of the hydrophobic pocket occupied by V24Y. As detailed in the main text and shown in Figures 3C, 3D, and 4G, measurements involving L21 were used to demonstrate the widening of this pocket upon V24Y mutation or ZYA binding.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors might consider improving the manuscript by addressing the following minor issues:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 1: it might be easier for readers to understand what the authors meant to show by superimposing the atomic model of the mutated sidechain with the density map. In this case, the density map could be rendered half-transparent, or it could be represented by mesh.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this suggestion for enhancing Figure 1. While we agree that showing the model fit within the density is valuable, we found that incorporating this directly into the comparative overlay panels of Figure 1 (which already depict multiple aligned density maps) made the figure overly complex and visually detracted from its primary message of comparing overall conformational states. However, we do provide a clear illustration of the model-to-map fit for the αV24Y T20S structure in Supplemental Figure S3, where the atomic model is shown within the transparent map surface. Furthermore, all our maps and models are publicly available, and we encourage interested readers to perform detailed comparisons. We believe this approach balances clarity in the main figure with the provision of detailed validation data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) What is the solvent-inaccessible surface area of the mutated side-chain buried by its hydrophobic interaction with the HbYX pockets? How is this buried surface area compared to the solvent-accessible surface area of the HbYX pocket without the mutation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the idea of another visual to answer the question and provide the reader with a better perception of this pocket in the WT versus V24Y T20S. To address this we added a new Supplemental Figure 7 with surfaces showing this comparison including each separate pocket and an overlay with solid and mesh surfaces. We also added this line to the text: “Moreover, molecular surface representations of the hydrophobic pocket clearly show occupancy by the mutant tyrosine’s side chain (Fig. S7)”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Based on the data of the buried surface area of the mutated side-chain (requested above), can the authors make some quantitative comparison with the activated eukaryotic proteasome (either human or yeast 26S) with the alpha-pocket occupied with HbYX motifs from Rpt subunits? How similar are they?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a thoughtful suggestion, and we understand the interest in directly comparing pocket occupancy across systems. While we draw general parallels regarding HbYXdependent activation in the discussion, we believe a direct quantitative extrapolation of specific surface area occupancies from our T20S V24Y mutant to the eukaryotic system would be overly speculative and unlikely to yield further definitive insights into the eukaryotic gate-opening mechanism at this time. The primary reason for this is the significant disparity in complexity between the archaeal T20S and eukaryotic 26S proteasomes. The eukaryotic α-ring is a heteroheptamer, composed of seven distinct αsubunits, which creates seven non-identical inter-subunit pockets. In contrast, our study utilizes the homoheptameric archaeal T20S. Furthermore, eukaryotic 26S proteasome activation involves the intricate binding of multiple C-terminal tails from the six different Rpt ATPase subunits of the 19S regulatory particle. These C-termini include various HbYX motifs as well as non-HbYX tails, and they interact with the diverse α-subunit pockets in a highly complex, multifactorial manner that drives what appears to be an allosteric mechanism for gate regulation.</p>
<p>Crucially, the precise number of C-termini required for 20S gate-opening in the eukaryotic system, the specific combination of these Rpt C-termini, and even the exact inter-subunit pockets that must be occupied to induce robust gate opening are still areas of active investigation and are not resolved (as discussed in our manuscript). Therefore, attempting to extrapolate nuances, such as the precise degree of hydrophobic pocket occupancy from our single, engineered αV24Y side-chain (which models one specific type of Hb-pocket interaction in a simplified system) to each of the potentially five or more different Rpt Ctermini interactions within the various 20S inter-subunit pockets in the eukaryotic 26S proteasome, would involve too many assumptions and would not provide reliable predictive power to understand mechanism.</p>
<p>However, regarding the fundamental question of how a hydrophobic group occupies the HbYX pocket in our archaeal model system, we believe Figure 4D provides relevant insight that may address the reviewer's underlying curiosity. This figure carefully illustrates the spatial overlap, showing that the engineered αV24Y side-chain and the hydrophobic 'Z' group of the ZYA HbYX-mimetic occupy the same region within the T20S inter-subunit hydrophobic pocket. This provides a clear visual comparison of this key 'Hb' interaction in our defined and structurally characterized system.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It may be helpful that at the end of the discussion, the authors make some comments on how the current results might offer insights into the eukaryotic proteasome activation, and on what the limitations of the current study are.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We agree that discussing the implications for eukaryotic proteasome activation and the study's limitations is important.</p>
<p>Insights into Eukaryotic Proteasome Activation:</p>
<p>We have indeed discussed how our current findings with the αV24Y T20S mutant offer insights into eukaryotic proteasome activation in the Discussion section. To briefly summarize:</p>
<p>(1) Conservation of the Target Site: Our study highlights that the key residues forming the hydrophobic pocket targeted by the αV24Y mutation (αL21 and αA154 in T20S) are well-conserved in the human 20S α-subunits (as shown in Fig. S9). This suggests that the mechanism of inducing gate opening through occupancy of this specific hydrophobic 'Hb' pocket by an aromatic residue is a plausible strategy for activating eukaryotic proteasomes.</p>
<p>(2) Relevance of the IT Switch: The αV24Y mutation, by occupying the Hb-pocket, allosterically affects the conserved IT switch, promoting an open-gate conformation. As detailed in our previous work (Chuah et al., Commun. Biol. 2023; Ref. 31 in the current manuscript), this IT switch mechanism is also functionally conserved in most human α-subunits. The current study reinforces that direct manipulation of the Hb-pocket is sufficient to trigger this conserved downstream gating machinery.</p>
<p>(3) Therapeutic Implications: These findings further pinpoint the HbYX hydrophobic pocket as a specific and promising target for the design of small molecule proteasome activators aimed at human proteasomes.</p>
<p>While these parallels are informative, we reiterate our caution (as also mentioned in response to comment #3 and in the manuscript regarding direct quantitative extrapolation due to the increased complexity of the heteroheptameric eukaryotic α-ring and the multifactorial nature of Rpt C-termini interactions.</p>
<p>We also agree that we should add a statement regarding key limitation raised by the reviewer, to our manuscript. Below is the key limitations paragraph that has been added to the penultimate paragraph of the discussion:</p>
<p>“While this study provides significant insights, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations. A key limitation stems from using the homoheptameric archaeal T20S as our model. Although this simpler system allows for more reliable dissection of fundamental mechanisms, and core elements like HbYX-induced gate opening are conserved at the intersubunit pocket level, the overall T20S and eukaryotic 20S/26S proteasomes differ significantly in their complexity. Specifically, our engineered αV24Y mutation results in a tyrosine constitutively occupying all seven identical hydrophobic pockets. This contrasts with the eukaryotic proteasome, which possesses seven distinct α-subunit pockets that interact with various Rpt C-termini through dynamic binding. Moreover, the specific Rpt Ctermini interactions—whether acting individually or cooperatively—that are essential to drive gate opening in the eukaryotic system remain incompletely understood. Therefore, while insights from our archaeal system are valuable for understanding general principles, direct comparisons and extrapolations to the intricate allostery and interaction complexities of the eukaryotic 26S proteasome must be made with caution.”</p>
