<title>Abstract</title><p>Neurexins play diverse functions as presynaptic organizers in various glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. However, it remains unknown whether and how neurexins are involved in shaping functional properties of the glycinergic synapses, which mediate prominent inhibition in the brainstem and spinal cord. To address these issues, we examined the role of neurexins in a model glycinergic synapse between the principal neuron in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and the principal neuron in the lateral superior olive (LSO) in the auditory brainstem. Combining RNAscope with stereotactic injection of AAV-Cre in the MNTB of neurexin1/2/3 conditional triple knockout mice, we showed that MNTB neurons highly express all isoforms of neurexins although their expression levels vary remarkably. Selective ablation of all neurexins in MNTB neurons reduced not only the amplitude but also the kinetics of the glycinergic synaptic transmission at LSO neurons. The synaptic dysfunctions were primarily caused by impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of release and tightness of coupling between voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles. Together, our current findings demonstrate that neurexins are essential in controlling the strength and temporal precision of the glycinergic synapse, which therefore corroborates the role of neurexins as key presynaptic organizers in all major types of fast chemical synapses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neurexins are evolutionarily conserved synaptic adhesion molecules and their genetic mutations are highly associated with autism and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gomez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sudhof, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">2017</xref>). In the vertebrate, neurexins are encoded by three genes Nrxn1, Nrxn2, Nrxn3, each of which contains distinct promoters for expressing longer α- and shorter β-neurexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ullrich et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ushkaryov et al., 1992</xref>). Both α- and β-neurexins are critical and non-redundant in regulating the formation and function of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anderson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Missler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sudhof, 2017</xref>). Triple knockout (KO) of α-neurexins causes a significant decrease in the density of GABAergic but not glutamatergic synapses while producing a strong reduction in both inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Missler <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Triple KO of β-neurexins reveals a significant phenotype only in glutamatergic synapses, but not in GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Deletion of all neurexins, including Nrxn1/2/3 α- and β-neurexins, leads to profound but strikingly distinct phenotypes in different synapses, which further supports diverse actions of neurexins in specific neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Luo et al., 2020</xref>). Consistently, transcriptomic analysis has revealed that the expression profiles of various neurexins differ remarkably in excitatory neurons versus inhibitory neurons even among distinct subtypes of interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Foldy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fuccillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lukacsovich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Uchigashima et al., 2019</xref>). Despite the multifaceted roles of neurexins widely observed in various glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boxer and Aoto, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Luo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sudhof, 2017</xref>), however, it remains largely unknown how neurexins may regulate the functional properties of the glycinergic synapses, which mediate essential inhibition in the spinal cord, brainstem and retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Assareh et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brill et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Feng et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Foster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gomeza et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gomeza et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zeilhofer et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In the mammalian auditory brainstem, it is well-characterized that the principal neurons in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) project glycinergic synaptic inputs to the lateral superior olive (LSO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fischer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kotak et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nabekura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sanes and Friauf, 2000</xref>). These synapses are robust, precise and extremely reliable even during high frequency stimulation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Krachan et al., 2017</xref>). Strong evidence has shown that the MNTB-LSO glycinergic synapses are subject to extensive refinement during development, including transmitter type switch, the elaboration of dendrites and axonal arbors followed by synaptic pruning, to achieve exquisite control of fast inhibition(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brill <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kim and Kandler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kotak <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nabekura <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sanes and Friauf, 2000</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms of shaping their functional characteristic remain incompletely understood.</p>
<p>We utilized the triple Nrxn1/2/3 conditional KO mice (Nrxn123 cTKO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) to ablate all neurexins in MNTB principal neurons with stereotactic injection of associated adeno-virus (AAV) expressing Cre-recombinase. Combined with RNAscope technique, we verified that MNTB neurons highly express various isoforms of neurexins. Selective injection of AAV-Cre, but not AAV-EGFP, successfully blocked expression of all neurexins in MNTB neurons. Functionally, pan-neurexin deletion significantly impaired both the amplitude and the kinetics of the glycinergic synaptic transmission. Surprisingly, deletion of all neurexins led to a significantly higher number of glycinergic synapses innervating the LSO and higher frequency of spontaneous neurotransmitter release. Application of low extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> blocked the glycinergic neurotransmission of both control and neurexin-deficient synapses, but with a significant difference in its effectiveness. Moreover, treatment with EGTA, a high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator with slow binding kinetics, caused a much stronger inhibition of neurotransmission in neurexin-deficient synapses, suggesting a significant disruption of the tight coupling between voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles in the MNTB-LSO glycinergic synapses.</p>

<p>As an initial exploration, we took advantage of Nrxn123 cTKO mice that enable deletion of all neurexins following the expression of Cre recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>), to bypass the functional redundancy of different neurexins. Neuronal specific deletion of all neurexins was achieved by stereotactic injection of AAV-Cre-EGFP into the MNTB at P0 (TKO). As control, AAV-EGFP was injected (Ctrl). Successful virus injection and expression of Cre recombinase in MNTB neurons were confirmed by strong EGFP fluorescence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d-e</xref>). FISH data further demonstrated that the recombinase dramatically blocked the expression of all neurexins, as compared to the normal expression of neurexins when EGFP was expressed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>, compared to 1b). Altogether, these data show that the glycinergic neurons in the MNTB highly express various neurexin genes, which can be specifically deleted by stereotactic injection of AAV-Cre in Nrxn123 cTKO mice.</p>

<title>Neurexins are essential for dictating the strength and kinetics of the MNTB-LSO glycinergic synapse</title>
<p>Since neurexins play an essential role in orchestrating functional organization of various synapses including both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, we hypothesize that deletion of all neurexins may have a significant impact on glycinergic synapses. To test the hypothesis, we sought to examine how neurexins may regulate the function of the MNTB-LSO glycinergic synapse in the auditory brainstem. Because LSO neurons receive excitatory glutamatergic inputs and inhibitory GABAergic/glycinergic inputs, we used a pharmacologic approach to isolate the glycinergic inputs. By blocking glutamatergic inputs with CNQX and AP5, we were able to selectively record inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) from LSO neurons, which can be completely inhibited by strychnine, a potent glycine receptor inhibitor (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
<p>To specifically examine the role of neurexins in regulating the glycinergic synapse, we used an optogenetic approach in which two AAVs, AAV-Cre-EGFP and AAV-DIO-ChR2-mCherry, were co-injected in Nrxn123 cTKO mice. As control, AAV-ChR2-EYFP was used for injection. Virus injection was performed at P0 and acute slices derived from these mice were analyzed at P13-14. We verified the successful expression of ChR2 by examining the fluorescence and further by recording optogenetic-evoked action potentials from the soma of MNTB neurons. Reliable action potential (AP) firing can be induced by single or repetitive high-frequency light stimulation (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1c</xref>). In control mice, optogenetic stimulation of MNTB neurons robustly triggered large IPSCs recorded from LSO neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a-b</xref>), which can be fully blocked by strychnine (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1d</xref>) and are thus purely glycinergic. In TKO mice with co-injection of Cre and ChR2, however, optogenetic stimulation induced significantly smaller IPSCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a-b</xref>). On average, we observed ∼60% reduction in the peak amplitude (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>), similar to previous findings at other different synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Luo <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the kinetics of IPSCs were dramatically reduced as indicated by significantly slower rise time and decay time in TKO mice as compared to control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c-d</xref>). Together, these data strongly suggest that neurexins are essential for the intact function of the glycinergic synapse.</p>

</fig>
<p>To further address the physiological role of neurexins in action potential evoked neurotransmission at the glycinergic synapse, we applied electric stimulation to activate presynaptic fibers of MNTB neurons by placing a stimulating electrode in the midway between the MNTB and the LSO. Consistent with our optogenetic approach, afferent-evoked large IPSCs were predominantly glycinergic as they can also be fully blocked by strychnine (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). A modest but significant decrease in synaptic strength was observed in Nrxn123 TKO mice as compared to control mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e-f</xref>), confirming the important role of neurexins in the glycinergic synapses. The modest effect of the pan-neurexin deletion on synaptic strength in the MNTB-LSO synapses is likely due to the incomplete AAV virus transfection in MNTN neurons. Therefore, it is likely that a small fraction of MNTB neurons may still express relatively normal expression of neurexins. It is worth pointing out that extensive efforts were made to optimize our virus injection protocols by adjusting the injection parameters including the needle angle, virus titers, and volume. On average, it was estimated that approximately ∼80% neurons in the MNTB expressed GFP and thus infected by AAV-Cre. It is also possible that other sources of glycinergic inputs other than the MNTB afferents are likely to present but obscured in wild-type animals by the predominant glycinergic inputs from MNTB neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jalabi et al., 2013</xref>).</p>

<title>The mechanism of neurexins for regulating the MNTB-LSO glycinergic synapse</title>
<p>Since neurexins play multifaceted roles in regulating pre- and/or post-synaptic functions, we explored the potential mechanisms by initially examining the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of IPSCs, which have been routinely used for identifying a presynaptic origin of regulation. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2h</xref>, IPSCs evoked by two consecutive stimuli at various intervals showed a strong depression in both control and TKO mice. However, the PPRs were significantly increased by deletion of neurexins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2i</xref>), suggesting that neurexins are required for maintaining a high release probability of the glycinergic nerve terminal.</p>
<p>We then recorded and analyzed spontaneous IPSCs from LSO neurons. Compared to control, there was no significant difference in both the amplitude and kinetics of sIPSCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a-d</xref>) in TKO mice, indicating the normal content of synaptic vesicle as well as the normal function of postsynaptic glycine receptors. Surprisingly, however, we found that deletion of all neurexins caused a small but significant increase in the frequency of sIPSCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a-b</xref>), which is opposite to previous reports of either no change or decrease in the miniature frequency at glutamatergic or GABAergic synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Luo <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). To test whether the increase in sIPSC frequency may be caused by an increase in the number of glycinergic synapses, we performed immunostaining of brainstem sections containing the LSO with antibodies specific for GlyT2 or VGAT, synaptic markers for the glycinergic neurons. Consistent with the increased frequency of sIPSCs, we found a significant increase in the intensity of both GlyT2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e-f</xref>) and VGAT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h-i</xref>) staining, suggesting more abundant glycinergic terminals at the LSO of TKO mice. These data together show that the pan-neurexin deletion in MNTB neurons has surprisingly increased the baseline glycinergic neurotransmission likely by promoting the synapse formation/maintenance, which is distinct from the phenotypes observed in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Luo <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>Deletion of neurexins impairs the tight coupling between voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles at the glycinergic synapse</title>
<p>Because neurexins are shown to exert diverse impacts including specifying the function of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and their spatial clustering within the presynaptic active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Luo <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Missler <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), we addressed these issues by first exploring the effect of pan-neurexin deletion on the calcium sensitivity of neurotransmitter release at the MNTB-LSO synapse. We perfused the brain slice with low Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0.2 mM) ACSF while recorded IPSCs continuously. In both control and Nrxn123 TKO mice, the perfusion of low Ca<sup>2+</sup> ACSF gradually decreased the amplitude of IPSCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>, c). However, the reduction rate was much faster in TKO mice such that IPSC amplitudes dropped more than 50% in TKO vs ∼10% in control when extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] reached to approximately 1.5 mM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>, d). The extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] blocking 50% of IPSCs were estimated as 1.1 mM and 1.5 mM respectively for control and TKO mice, which are significantly different (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>, f), suggesting that neurexins indeed are crucial for regulating calcium sensitivity of transmitter release at the glycinergic synapse.</p>

<p>One of the critical factors affecting the calcium sensitivity of release is the spatial distance between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Eggermann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Luo <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Additionally, neurexins have been shown to promote tight coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels with synaptic vesicle at the glutamatergic calyx of Held synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Luo <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Because the MNTB-LSO glycinergic synapse is similar on multiple aspects of the functional characteristics, being fast, robust, and precise, to the calyx of Held synapse, we tested whether neurexins are also required for the tight coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels with synaptic vesicle. We incubated the brain slice with high-concentration EGTA-AM and continuously recorded IPSCs from individual LSO neurons. As illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, EGTA-AM treatment slightly blocked IPSCs at control synapses, suggesting the relative ineffectiveness of EGTA in interfering neurotransmitter release (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>, b). By contrast, at the neurexin-deficient synapses, EGTA-AM treatment remarkably impaired IPSCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>, d). On average, the blocking effects of EGTA at neurexin-deficient synapses (53.2 ± 5.4%) was much stronger than control synapses (15.6 ± 4.3%). Therefore, consistent with previous studies at the calyx of Held synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Luo <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), our data provide further support that neurexins are key synaptic organizers for clustering voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels tightly with synaptic vesicles at the glycinergic synapse.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using the MNTB-LSO synapse as a model, here we provide first assessment of the role of neurexins at glycinergic synapses that mediate prominent synaptic inhibition in the spinal cord, brainstem and retina. Our findings in general strongly corroborate the idea that neurexins are central presynaptic organizers in all major types of fast chemical synapses including glutamatergic, GABAergic and glycinergic.</p>
<p>Specifically, we have shown that various neurexin genes express concurrently in these glycinergic neurons but the expression level of each appears to vary significantly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). This finding is consistent with many studies in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, which converge to show that multiple genes, isoforms, and splicing sites of neurexins normally co-express in individual neurons and the expression profiles are highly cell-type specific and brain region specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fuccillo <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Schreiner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Treutlein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Uchigashima <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Distinct neurexins may interact separately and/or redundantly with diverse signaling molecules to form specific molecular codes for shaping neuronal connectivity and functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lloyd et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sudhof, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>We further show that neurexins are critical in controlling the strength and precise timing of the glycinergic synaptic inhibition at LSO neurons by clustering Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels tightly with synaptic vesicles in presynaptic release sites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These data strongly corroborate two perspectives on the function of neurexins as central presynaptic organizers. First, deletion of all neurexins not only weakens the glycinergic synaptic connectivity but also impairs the temporal precision of synaptic inhibition, exactly as it does at the glutamatergic calyx of Held synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Luo <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Since both the glutamatergic calyx of Held synapse and the glycinergic MNTB-LSO synapse in the auditory brainstem are extremely strong and fast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beiderbeck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grothe, 2003</xref>), the orchestrating role of neurexins in controlling the timing and magnitude of their synaptic transmission is therefore desirable for the auditory information processing. Secondly, neurexins execute their role at the glycinergic synapse mainly by tightly organizing Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels within the release sites, again exactly as it does at the calyx of Held synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Luo <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Nanodomain coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles has been found in many fast central synapses and is functionally crucial for increasing the efficacy and speed of neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Eggermann <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). This similar role of neurexins in clustering Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels tightly at presynaptic active zones of not only the glutamatergic synapse but also the glycinergic synapse prompts a shared mechanism and further research on the potential molecular candidates.</p>
<p>On the other hand, our data surprisingly reveal that deletion of neurexins may promote the formation/maintenance of the glycinergic synapse, as evidenced by the increase in the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events measured at LSO neurons as well as the increase in the glycinergic synaptic density in Nrxn123 TKO mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Early studies of TKOs of α-neurexins or β-neurexins lead to general conclusion that neurexins are not essential for the formation/maintenance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Missler <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Moreover, deletion of all α-neurexins and β-neurexins has no impact on the formation/maintenance of glutamatergic synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Luo <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) and GABAergic synapse made by somatostatin-positive interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>), but produces partial loss (∼30%) of GABAergic synapse made by parvalbumin-positive interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). More recent data even show that Nrxn2 unexpectedly restricts excitatory synapse formation in the hippocampus but has no effect on the inhibitory synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Our present findings on the glycinergic synapse suggest a mix of pro- and anti-synaptogenic effects of neurexins and may raise three possibilities. First, Nrxn2 may dominate its function at this synapse during development and play an inhibitory role in the formation of glycinergic synapse, similar as the previous report of Nrxn2 impact on the hippocampal excitatory synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Second, deletion of neurexins impairs the strength of the MNTB-LSO synapse, which may indirectly interfere with synaptic elimination process and therefore lead to an increase in synaptic density. Third, the more abundant glycinergic synapses may arise from the developmental compensation of synapse formation by other sources of glycinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jalabi <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Strong reduction in the strength of the MNTB-LSO synapse caused by selective deletion of neurexins may shift the winner of synaptic competition toward other parallel but much weaker glycinergic inputs in normal animals.</p>

<title>Mouse breeding and virus injection</title>
<p>All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Bioland Laboratory, Guangzhou National Laboratory, Guangzhou, China. Transgenic Nrxn123 cTKO mice of either sex were used for all experiments. Mice were housed at room temperature on a 12 h light–dark cycle (7:00 to 19:00, light) with food and water freely available.</p>
<p>To delete neurexins in MNTB neurons, we injected P0 mice with AAV2/9-hSyn-EGFP-P2A-Cre-WPRE-hGH-Poly (Cat:PT-0156, BrainVTA Co., China). Mice were anesthetized on ice and immediately transferred to a stereotaxic apparatus (RWD Life Technology, China). Injection was achieved by connecting a glass pipette with tip diameter 20-30 μm to Nanoject III programmable nanoliter injector (Drummond Scientific Company, USA). Bilateral injections were performed at the following coordinates: AP from the most rostral point: 5.61 mm, ML: ±0.27 mm, DV: 3.58 mm. For optogenetics experiments, we injected 200 nl (AAV2/9-hSyn-EGFP-P2A-Cre-WPRE-hGH-PolyA and AAV2/9-EF1α-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-mCherry-WPRE-hGH-Poly, 1:1, Cat: PT-0002, BrainVTA Co., China) or 100 nl of AAV2/9-hSyn-hChR2(H123R)-EYFP-WPRE-hGH-PolyA (Cat: PT-1317, BrainVTA Co., China) into each-side MNTB.

<title>Whole-cell voltage-clamped recordings</title>
<p>Whole-cell voltage-clamped recordings were made from visually identified LSO neurons in acute brain slices using an Axopatch 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, USA) and pClamp 11 software (Molecular Devices, USA). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries using a two-stage vertical puller (PC-100, Narashige, Japan). Pipette resistance was 4-6 MΩ when filled with an internal solution containing (in mM): 145 K-gluconate, 6 KCl, 10 HEPES, 3 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na<sub>2</sub>-GTP, 0.2 EGTA, 2 Qx-314; pH 7.2 with KOH. With the extracellular [Cl<sup>−</sup>] of 133 mM and a temperature of 22°, the equilibrium potential of the Cl<sup>−</sup> was approximately −78.8 mV. In voltage-clamp configuration, IPSCs were recorded by holding cells at 10 mV in ACSF containing CNQX (20 μM), D-AP5 (50 μM), to block AMPA, NMDA receptors, respectively. For some experiments, 2 μM strychnine, a potent glycine receptor antagonist, was added to ACSF to verify that IPSCs recorded at LSO neurons are glycinergic. Membrane potentials were not corrected for liquid junction potential. Electrical fiber stimulation was performed using a concentric bipolar electrode (CBAEB75, FHC Inc, USA) positioned medially to the LSO and MNTB. Short pulses (0.1 ms) were delivered via an isolated stimulator (Model 2100; A-M Systems, USA). For optogenetics, a light simulation of 5 ms was delivered by LED (pE-300 white, CoolLED, UK).</p>

<p>Mice were anesthetized and perfused at speed of 1ml/min with 1×PBS for 10 min followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min. Brains were removed and stored in 4% PFA overnight at 4C. After going through a 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose gradient for cryo-protection, the tissue was embedded in OCT (Cat: 14020108926, Leica) and rapidly frozen on dry ice. Transverse sections at 16 μm were cut at -20 °C using a cryostat (CM3050-S, Leica) and mounted directly on Superfrost Plus slides (Cat: PRO-04, Matsunami Platinum Pro). FISH and immunohistochemistry were performed using the RNAscope multiplex platform (Multiplex Reagent Kit, Cat: 323100; Co-detection ancillary Kit, Cat: 323180, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA probes for Nrxn1, Nrxn2, and Nrxn3 (Cat: 461511-C3, 533531-C2, 505431 respectively, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) and primary antibody against VGluT1 (guinea pig, polyclonal, 1:500, Millipore) were used. Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor conjugates (1:400; Thermo Fisher). Samples were mounted with a Vectashield hard-set antifade mounting medium (Cat: H-1500, Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired using Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscopy with a 63x oil-immersion objective (1.4 numerical aperture) or OLYMPUS IXplore SpinSR confocal microscopy with a 60x oil-immersion objective (1.5 numerical aperture).

<p>Jiang et al. demonstrated that ablating Neurexins results in alterations to glycinergic transmission and its calcium sensitivity, utilizing a robust experimental system. Specifically, the authors employed rAAV-Cre-EGFP injection around the MNTB in Nrxn1/2/3 triple conditional mice at P0, measuring Glycine receptor-dependent IPSCs from postsynaptic LSO neurons at P13-14. Notably, the authors presented a clear reduction of 60% and 30% in the amplitudes of opto- and electric stimulation-evoked IPSCs, respectively. Additionally, they observed changes in kinetics, alterations in PPR, and sensitivity to lower calcium and the calcium chelator, EGTA, indicating solid evidence for changes in presynaptic properties of glycinergic transmission.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the authors uncovered an unexpected increase in sIPSC frequency without altering amplitude. Despite the reduction in evoked IPSC, immunostaining revealed an increase in GlyT2 and VGAT in TKO mice, supporting the notion of an increase in synapse number. However, the reviewer expresses caution regarding the authors' conclusion that &quot;glycinergic neurotransmission likely by promoting the synapse formation/maintenance, which is distinct from the phenotypes observed in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons (Chen et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2021)&quot;, as outlined in lines 173-175. The reviewer suggests that this statement may be overstated, pointing out the authors' own discussion in lines 254-265, which acknowledges multiple possibilities, including the potential that the increase in synapses is a consequence rather than a causal effect of Nrxn deletion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, Jiang et al., explore the role of neurexins at glycinergic MNTB-LSO synapses. The authors utilize elegant and compelling ex vivo slice electrophysiology to assess how the genetic conditional deletion of Nrxns1-3 impacts inhibitory glycinergic synaptic transmission and found that TKO of neurexins reduced electrically and optically evoked IPSC amplitudes, slowed optically evoked IPSC kinetics and reduced presynaptic release probability. The authors use classic approaches including reduced [Ca2+] in ACSF and EGTA chelation to propose that changes in these evoked properties are likely driven by the loss of calcium channel coupling. Intriguingly, while evoked transmission was impaired, the authors reported that spontaneous IPSC frequency was increased, potentially due to an increased number of synapses in LSO. Overall, this manuscript provides important insight into the role of neurexins at the glycinergic MNTP-LSO synapse and further emphasizes the need for continued study of both the non-redundant and redundant roles of neurexins.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This well-written manuscript seamlessly incorporates mouse genetics and elegant ex vivo electrophysiology to identify a role for neurexins in glycinergic transmission at MNTB-LSO synapses. Triple KO of all neurexins reduced the amplitude and timing of evoked glycinergic synaptic transmission. Further, spontaneous IPSC frequency was increased. The evoked synaptic phenotype is likely a result of reduced presynaptic calcium coupling while the spontaneous synaptic phenotype is likely due to increased synapse numbers. While neuroligin-4 has been identified at glycinergic synapses, this study, to the best of my knowledge, is the first to study Nrxn function at these synapses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The data are compelling and report an intriguing functional phenotype. The role of Neurexins redundantly controls calcium channel coupling has been previously reported. Mechanistic insight would significantly strengthen this study.</p>
<p>
The claim that triple KO of Nrxns from MNTB increases the number of synapses in LSO is not strongly supported.</p>
<p>
Despite the stated caveats of measuring electrically evoked currents and the more robust synaptic phenotypes observed using optically evoked transmission, the authors rely heavily on electrical stimulation for most measurements.</p>
<p>
The differential expression of individual neurexins might indicate that specific neurexins may dominantly regulate synaptic transmission, however, this possibility is not discussed in detail.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors investigate the hypothesis that neurexins serve a crucial role as regulators of the synaptic strength and timing at the glycinergic synapse between neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and the lateral superior olivary complex (LSO). It is worth mentioning that LSO neurons are an integration station of the auditory brainstem circuit displaying high reliability and temporal precision. These features are necessary for computing interaural cues to derive sound source location from comparing the intensities of sounds arriving at the two ears. In this context, the authors' findings build up according to the hypothesis first by displaying that neurexins were expressed in the MNTB at varying levels. They followed this up with the deletion of all neurexins in the MNTB through the employment of a triple knock-out (TKO). Using electrophysiological recordings in acute brainstem slices of these TKO mice, they gathered solid evidence for the role of neurexins in synaptic transmission at this glycinergic synapse primarily by ensuring tight coupling of Ca2+ channels and vesicular release sites. Additionally, the authors uncovered a connection between the deletion of neurexins and a higher number of glycinergic synapses in TKO mice, for which they provided evidence in the form of immunostainings and related it to electrophysiological data on spontaneous release. Consequently, this investigation expands our knowledge on the molecular regulation of synaptic transmission at glycinergic synapses, as well as on the auditory processing at the level of the brainstem.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors demonstrate substantial results in support of the hypothesis of a critical role of neurexins for regulating glycinergic transmission in the LSO using various techniques. They provide evidence for the expression of neurexins in the MNTB and consecutively successfully generate and characterize the neurexin TKO. For their study on LSO IPSCs the authors transduced MNTB neurons by co-injection of virus-carrying Cre and ChR2 and subsequently optogenetically evoke release of glycine. As a result, they observed a significant reduction in amplitude and significantly slower rise and decay times of the IPSCs of the TKO in comparison with control mice in which MNTB neurons were only transduced with ChR2. Furthermore, they observed an increased paired pulse ratio (PPR) of LSO IPSCs in the TKO mice, indicating lower release probability. Elaborating on the hypothesis that neurexins are essential for the coupling of synaptic vesicles to Ca2+ channels, the authors show lowered Ca2+ sensitivity in the TKO mice. Additionally, they reveal convincing evidence for the connection between the increased frequency of spontaneous IPSC and the higher number of glycinergic synapses of the LSO in the TKO mice, revealed by immunolabeling against the glycinergic presynaptic markers GlyT2 or VGAT.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The major concern is novelty as this work on the effects of pan-neurexin deletion in a glycinergic synapse is quite consistent with the authors' prior work on glutamatergic synapses (Luo et al., 2020). The authors might want to further work out novel aspects and strengthen the comparative perspective. Conceptually, the authors might want to be more clear about interpreting the results on the altered dependence of release on voltage-gated Ca2+ influx (Ca2+ sensitivity, coupling).</p>
