<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>The intuitive manipulation of specific amino acids to alter the activity or specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 has been a topic of great interest. As a large multi-domain RNA-guided endonuclease, the intricate molecular crosstalk within the Cas9 protein hinges on its conformational dynamics, but a comprehensive understanding of the extent and timescale of the motions that drive its allosteric function and association with nucleic acids remains elusive. Here, we investigated the structure and multi-timescale molecular motions of the recognition (Rec) lobe of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, a thermophilic Cas9 from <italic>Geobacillus stearothermophilus.</italic> Our results provide new atomic details about the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec subdomains (<italic>Geo</italic>Rec1, <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2) and the full-length domain in solution. Two rationally designed mutants, K267E and R332A, enhanced and redistributed micro-millisecond flexibility throughout <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, and NMR studies of the interaction between <italic>Geo</italic>Rec and its guide RNA showed that mutations reduced this affinity and the stability of the ribonucleoprotein complex. Despite measured biophysical differences due to the mutations, DNA cleavage assays reveal no functional differences in on-target activity, and similar specificity. These data suggest that guide RNA interactions can be tuned at the biophysical level in the absence of major functional losses but also raise questions about the underlying mechanism of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, since analogous single-point mutations have significantly impacted on- and off-target DNA editing in mesophilic <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> Cas9. A K267E/R332A double mutant did also did not enhance <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 specificity, highlighting the robust tolerance of mutations to the Rec lobe of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and species-dependent complexity of Rec across Cas9 paralogs. Ultimately, this work provides an avenue by which to modulate the structure, motion, and guide RNA interactions at the level of the Rec lobe of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, setting the stage for future studies of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 variants and their effect on its allosteric mechanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The vast majority of Cas systems explored as genome editors originate from mesophilic hosts. The emergence of the thermophilic <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, with DNA cleavage function up to 85°C, can expand CRISPR technology to higher temperature regimes and stabilities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> but its regulatory mechanism relative to canonical Cas9s must be established. The <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9, which originates from the mesophilic <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, as well as <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, are both effectors of Type-II CRISPR systems. Interestingly, the Type II-A <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 has been by far the most used Cas enzyme, including in ongoing clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> But Cas9 homologs of the Type II-C class, such as <italic>Neisseria meningitis</italic> (<italic>Nme</italic>Cas9) and <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> (<italic>Cje</italic>Cas9), to which <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 belongs, have been validated for mammalian genome editing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> reinforcing the need to better understand this CRISPR class.</p>
<p>The similar domain arrangements of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 led us to initially speculate that these could share atomic level mechanistic similarities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 utilizes a guide RNA (gRNA) to localize and unwind a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) target after recognition of its 5’NNNNCRAA-3’ protospacer adjacent motif (PAM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> Upon recognition of the PAM sequence by the PAM-Interacting domain (PI), Cas9-bound guide (gRNA) forms an RNA:DNA hybrid with the target DNA strand. Initially thought to be part of the PI domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, the wedge (WED) domain recognizes the repeat:anti-repeat region of the gRNA and the dsDNA upstream of the target region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> The Rec lobe of Cas9 is responsible for orienting the RNA:DNA hybrid, as well as the adjacent nuclease domains, into their active conformations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Coordinated cleavage of the target and non-target DNA strand then occurs via the HNH and RuvC nucleases, respectively. The <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 nuclease active sites within HNH and RuvC are spatially distinct from the PAM recognition site in the PI domain, necessitating structural and dynamic changes that allosterically couple dsDNA binding to cleavage. Biochemical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and structural<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> experiments using the extensively studied <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 have revealed that its function is governed by a sophisticated allosteric mechanism that transfers gRNA and dsDNA binding information from the Rec lobe to the distal catalytic sites. A dynamically driven allosteric signal spans the HNH domain of <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9, enabled by the plasticity of the Rec lobe, which orchestrates the conformational activation required for DNA cleavage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> Our prior work revealed a divergence in the timescales of allosteric motions in the <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 and <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 HNH domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> suggesting an unusually flexible HNH and unique allosteric mode of regulation for <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. It is therefore also possible that docking of the gRNA with <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, and thus its interaction with the RNA:DNA hybrid, may differ from the <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 system, as <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 contains a truncated Rec lobe with only two of the three canonical subdomains.</p>
<p>The high thermal stability and more compact size of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (it is 281 residues shorter than <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9) can be especially important for <italic>in vivo</italic> delivery applications, since promising viral vectors (<italic>i.e.</italic> adeno-associated virus, AAV) have cargo capacities of ∼4.7kb,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> which prevents <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9-gRNA packaging into a single AAV vector but permits “all-in-one” delivery of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9-gRNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Until the very recent cryo-EM structures of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> little was known about specific residues that influence its structure, gRNA binding, or function. Our recent NMR work with <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 uncovered pathways of micro-millisecond timescale motions that propagate chemical information related to allostery and specificity through <italic>Spy</italic>Rec and its RNA:DNA hybrid,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> prompting us to investigate this phenomenon in <italic>Geo</italic>Rec.</p>
<p>An atomic-level structural understanding of specificity in large multi-domain protein- nucleic acid complexes like Cas9 is often difficult to address by NMR spectroscopy. Although dynamic ensembles in DNA repair enzymes have provided some insight,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> many efforts to improve Cas9 specificity and reduce off-target activity have relied on large mutational screens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> or error- prone PCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, which are less intuitive. Inter-subunit allosteric communication between the catalytic HNH domain and the Rec lobe is critical to Cas9 specificity, as the binding of off-target DNA sequences at Rec alter HNH dynamics to affect DNA cleavage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> To further probe the fundamental role of protein motions in the function and specificity of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, as well as the effect of protein-nucleic acid interactions on its structural signatures, we engineered two mutations in <italic>Geo</italic>Rec (K267E and R332A, housed within <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2). We hypothesized that these variants could enhance <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 specificity (<italic>i.e.</italic> limit its off-target cleavage) for two reasons. First, the chosen mutation sites are homologous to those of specificity-enhancing variants of <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Second, altered Cas9-gRNA interactions have been shown to be a consequence of specificity- enhancement and these charged residues appear to directly interact with the gRNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> Balancing these two points is the fact that Type-II Cas systems generally have conserved nuclease domains, but are delineated by highly varied Rec lobes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> This implies that the structural and dynamic properties of Rec may play an outsized role in differentiating the functions of <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 and <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, which may not be identical. Nevertheless, our work provides new insight into the biophysical, biochemical, and functional role of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe and how mutations modulate the domain itself and its interaction with gRNA in full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9.</p>

<title>The structural similarity of GeoRec1, GeoRec2, and GeoRec facilitates NMR analysis of protein dynamics and RNA affinity</title>
<p><italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 is a 1087 amino acid polypeptide, thus we employed a “divide and concur” approach for NMR studies, which we previously showed to be useful for quantifying allosteric structure and motion in <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> The <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe is comprised of subdomains <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, which likely work together to recognize nucleic acids. We engineered constructs of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 (136 residues, 16 kDa) and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 (212 residues, 25 kDa) subdomains and solved the X-ray crystal structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 at 1.49 Å, which aligns remarkably well with the structure of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 domain within the AlphaFold model (RMSD 1.03 Å) and new cryo-EM structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (RMSD 1.10 Å, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We were neither able to crystallize <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 nor full- length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 in the apo state, but our <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 crystal structure represents the structure of the subdomain within the full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 protein quite well. Our previous studies of <italic>Geo</italic>HNH also show identical superpositions of X-ray crystal structures with full-length Cas complexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> In addition to the individual subdomains, we also generated an NMR construct of the intact <italic>Geo</italic>Rec (370 residues, 43 kDa).</p>

<p>Despite only 22% sequence identity, the structure of <italic>Spy</italic>Rec3 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 are highly similar (RMSD 2.00 Å, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1</xref>). The structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1, in contrast, does not align perfectly with <italic>Spy</italic>Rec1, instead, it partially aligns with both <italic>Spy</italic>Rec1 and <italic>Spy</italic>Rec2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, the nearly identical <italic>Spy</italic>Rec3 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 architectures and their intrinsic dynamics may be a common thread among Type II Cas9s of different size and PAM preference. To capture atomic- level signatures of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, we obtained well-resolved <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N NMR fingerprint spectra for all three protein constructs and assigned the amide backbones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2</xref>). <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N amide and <sup>1</sup>H- <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub> Ile, Leu, and Val (ILV)-methyl NMR spectra (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S3</xref>) of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec overlay very well with those of its individual subdomains, suggesting that the linkage of subdomains within the full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Rec polypeptide does not alter their individual folds. Consistent with this observation, circular dichroism (CD) thermal unfolding profiles of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> ∼ 34 °C) and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 61.50 °C) are distinct and occur as separate events in the unfolding profile of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4</xref>). The dumbbell shape of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, with its two globular subdomains connected by a short flexible linker, is a likely contributor to these biophysical properties.</p>

<title>Rationally designed GeoRec2 mutants do not substantially impact the GeoRec structure</title>
<p>To understand how the structure and gRNA interactions of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 can be modulated at the level of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, we engineered two charge-altering point mutants in the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 subdomain, K267E and R332A. Based on the AlphaFold2 model of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, both of these residues are &lt; 5Å from the bound RNA:DNA hybrid and were predicted to interface with the nucleic acids directly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A/B</xref>). A new experimental cryo-EM structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 confirmed the interaction between K267 and the gRNA, but does not report a &lt; 5Å interaction of R332 with the gRNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> The rationale for our designed mutations was also that removal of positive charge would weaken the interactions between <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and the gRNA, affecting <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> via the electrostatics or dynamics of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe. Studies of <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 revealed that interaction of <italic>Spy</italic>Rec3 (analogous to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2) with its RNA:DNA hybrid triggers conformational rearrangements that allow the catalytic HNH domain to sample its active conformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Thus, <italic>Spy</italic>Rec3 acts as an allosteric effector that recognizes the RNA:DNA hybrid to activate HNH. Mismatches (<italic>i.e.</italic> off-target DNA sequences) in the target DNA generally prevent <italic>Spy</italic>Rec3 from undergoing the full extent of its required conformational rearrangements, leaving HNH in a “proofreading” state with its catalytic residues too far from the DNA cleavage site. Off-target DNA cleavage by Cas9 remains an area of intense study and substantial effort from various groups has gone into mitigating such effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> Indeed, many high-specificity <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 variants contain mutations within <italic>Spy</italic>Rec3 that increase the threshold for its conformational activation, reducing the propensity for HNH to sample its active state in the presence of off-target DNA sequences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> Studies of flexibility within Rec itself, as well as its gRNA interactions in the presence of mutations, are therefore essential to connecting biophysical properties to function and specificity in related Cas9s. The K267E <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 variant is sequentially and structurally similar to a specificity enhancing site in <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 (K526E), within the evoCas9 system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> The <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 K526E mutation substantially reduced off-target activity alone, but was even more effective in conjunction with three other single-point mutations in <italic>Spy</italic>Rec3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> The R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 variant also resembles one mutation within a high-specificity <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 variant, an early iteration of HiFi <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 called HiFi Cas9- R691A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> We assessed mutation-induced changes to local structure in <italic>Geo</italic>Rec via NMR chemical shift perturbations in <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC backbone amide spectra. Consistent with experiments using <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 alone, chemical shift perturbations and line broadening are highly localized to the mutation sites. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-F</xref>).

<p>CD spectroscopy revealed that wild-type (WT<italic>)</italic>, K267E, and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 maintained similar alpha-helical secondary structure, though the thermostability of both variants was slightly reduced from that of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S6</xref>). The <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 is ∼62 °C, consistent with the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of the full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, while that of K267E <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 was decreased to ∼55 °C. Though the R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> remains ∼62 °C, this variant underwent a smaller unfolding event near 40 °C before completely unfolding. These data suggest that despite small structural perturbations, both mutations are destabilizing to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, which led us to expect a change in NMR-detectable protein dynamics.</p>

<title>Mutations enhance and redistribute molecular motions within GeoRec2</title>
<p>Due to the high molecular weight of the intact <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe, decays in NMR signal associated with spin relaxation experiments were significant and hampered data quality. Thus, we focused on quantifying the molecular motions of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 subdomain, where the K267E and R332A mutations reside, and the chemical shift perturbations are most apparent. To obtain high- quality per-residue information representative of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, we measured longitudinal (<italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>) and transverse (<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>) relaxation rates and heteronuclear <sup>1</sup>H-[<sup>15</sup>N] NOEs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S7</xref>), then used these data in a Model-free analysis of per-residue order parameters (<italic>S</italic><sup>2</sup>). Previous measurements of <italic>S</italic><sup>2</sup> across the adjacent <italic>Geo</italic>HNH nuclease revealed substantial ps-ns timescale flexibility,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> leading us to wonder whether a similar observation would be made for <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, which abuts <italic>Geo</italic>HNH. Such a finding could suggest that HNH-Rec2 crosstalk in <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 is driven primarily by rapid bond vector fluctuations. However, unlike <italic>Geo</italic>HNH, <italic>S</italic><sup>2</sup> values for <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 are globally elevated, suggesting that the ps-ns motions of this subdomain arise primarily from global tumbling of the protein in solution. We therefore carried out Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion NMR experiments to assess the flexibility of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 on slower timescales, which has been linked to chemical information transfer in the well-studied <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> Evidence of μs- ms motions (<italic>i.e.</italic> curved relaxation dispersion profiles) is observed in 17 residues within the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 core, spanning its interfaces to Rec1 and HNH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Such motions are completely absent from <italic>Geo</italic>HNH, thus two neighboring domains, <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 and <italic>Geo</italic>HNH, diverge in their intrinsic flexibility (at least in isolation), raising questions about the functional implications of these motions in <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2. We previously showed that heightened flexibility of <italic>Spy</italic>Rec3 via specificity-enhancing mutations concomitantly narrowed the conformational space sampled by <italic>Spy</italic>HNH, highlighting a “motional trade-off” between the domains.

<p>Since <italic>Spy</italic>Rec3 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 have similar structures and μs-ms flexibility, we speculated that charge-altering mutations would modulate the biophysical properties of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec and the function of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, as observed for <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9. We investigated K267E and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 with NMR spin relaxation, as described for WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 (<italic>vide supra</italic>). An analysis of chemical exchange rates, <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub>, derived from dual-field CPMG relaxation dispersion show a global <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> for WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 of 147 ± 41 s<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The K267E mutation, which directly contacts the nucleic acids, shifts the globally fitted <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> to 376 ± 89 s<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, while the R332A variant maintains a global <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> similar to that of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 (142 ± 28 s<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>) and consistent with its similar thermal stability. The global fit of the K267E variant is based on CPMG profiles of 33 residues, while that of R332A is derived from 18 residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S1</xref>). Interestingly, the residues participating in the global motions of both variants are distinct from those of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, demonstrating that residue-specific flexibility is redistributed throughout <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, which suggests an altered intradomain molecular crosstalk within the larger <italic>Geo</italic>Rec. Indeed, perturbation to NMR-detectable motions in <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 rewired its allosteric signaling and enzymatic function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> A similar dynamic modulation of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 may fine-tune its DNA cleavage, which has been demonstrated within the <italic>Geo</italic>HNH nuclease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> and wedge (WED) domains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> We also assessed the ps-ns fluctuations of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 variants (a negligible contribution to the WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 dynamic profile) and calculated order parameters from <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> and <sup>1</sup>H-[<sup>15</sup>N] NOE relaxation measurements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).

<title>Mutations within GeoRec alter its affinity for RNA</title>
<p>The role of the Rec lobe in orienting the RNA:DNA hybrid within Cas9 is crucial to its function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Thus, the structure, motions, and nucleic acid interactions of Rec represent a critical piece of the Cas9 signaling machinery. Previous studies of <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 revealed that gRNA binding to the Rec lobe induces a global structural rearrangement of the protein that positions the adjacent HNH into its “proofreading” state,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> after which target DNA binding positions the nucleases into active conformations for cleavage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> We wondered if the atomistic details of the apo <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9- to-RNP transition could be captured by NMR using the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec construct. In our previous studies, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA cleavage assay with <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and a 141nt gRNA containing a 21nt spacer targeting the mouse <italic>Tnnt2</italic> gene locus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Since this assay was already established, we utilized the same gRNA sequence. However, truncating this gRNA was necessary to optimize binding studies for NMR analysis. We focused on the 5’ end of the gRNA, which includes the spacer sequence, based on the <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 AlphaFold2 model and structural data from <italic>Nme</italic>Cas9 and <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 showing interactions between the Rec lobe and this region of the gRNA. The subsequent cryo-EM structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 corroborated this interaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> Initial attempts using a truncated 101nt portion of the full gRNA resulted in poor NMR spectra. An overlay of the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC NMR spectra of apo <italic>Geo</italic>Rec and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec-RNP at a 1:1 molar ratio showed extensive line broadening (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S11</xref>), likely due to the large size of the complex (75.5 kDa). To mitigate this issue, a 39nt RNA containing the 21bp spacer sequence was selected for its ability to maintain the NMR signal while being long enough to interact fully with the Rec lobe, as suggested by prior structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S12</xref>). When bound to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, this complex is 55.6 kDa and a <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N NMR spectral overlay of apo <italic>Geo</italic>Rec and the domain bound to 39nt RNA shows clear, resolved resonances with significant chemical shift perturbations and line broadening (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A/B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S11</xref>). The strongest chemical shift perturbations are localized to the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 subdomain that interfaces with the RNA:DNA hybrid at the PAM distal end, where previous studies of specificity-enhancing variants of <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 have identified alterations in nucleic acid binding to <italic>Spy</italic>Rec3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> It is not known whether specific residues at the PAM distal binding interface of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 play a similar role.

<p>To understand how the K267E and R332A mutants impact RNA binding to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, we conducted RNA titration experiments via NMR and observed that chemical shift perturbations were attenuated in both variants, relative to WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec. Despite this muted structural effect, the impact from RNA-induced line broadening remains substantial in the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 subdomain. Our NMR data revealed that a three-fold greater concentration of RNA was required to induce the maximal structural and dynamic effects in the variants than is required for WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A/C</xref>), suggesting that the variants have a reduced RNA affinity. MST experiments showed statistically significant reductions in RNA affinity for the K267E and R332A constructs, relative to WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, where K267E <italic>Geo</italic>Rec produced a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 7.2 ± 1.0 µM and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec produced a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 7.2 ± 1.5 µM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The ∼2-fold increase in <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> may also be due, in part, to a change in the binding mode of the RNA, such as a faster <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>. Collectively, these data reveal that mutations within <italic>Geo</italic>Rec primarily alter its structure around the mutation site with weaker distal effects, but more significantly impact protein dynamics and in turn, the RNA interaction. NMR experiments also demonstrate that the presence of RNA impacts both subdomains of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, providing a significant structural interface for additional molecular tuning of nucleic acid binding. To investigate the impact of RNA binding on <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 in greater detail, we conducted NMR titration experiments using the isolated domain, which yielded even clearer NMR spectra. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S13</xref> shows NMR spectra of WT, K267E, and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 overlaid with their corresponding RNA-bound spectra (39nt Tnnt2 RNA). At protein:RNA molar ratios used for full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Rec studies, the WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 spectrum exhibited significant line broadening across the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 sequence. Plots of NMR peak intensities (I<sub>bound</sub>/I<sub>free</sub>) show substantial resonance intensity losses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S13</xref>), with many residues likely in the intermediate exchange regime, in addition to the assumed changes in rotational correlation of the domain. In comparison, spectra of the RNA-bound K267E and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 variants showed less pronounced signal decay at the same levels of titrant, retaining nearly double the I<sub>bound</sub>/I<sub>free</sub> ratio across these spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S13</xref>). These data are consistent with the results of NMR experiments with the 43 kDa <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, supporting the premise that <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 mutations weaken its interaction with RNA. The less crowded NMR spectrum of isolated <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 facilitated the resolution of distinct structural features that explain the impact of the mutations on RNA binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S9</xref>). For example, residue I53 adopts a similar conformation in RNA-bound WT and K267E <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 but assumes a different structural state in R332A. Conversely, residue R25 populates a WT-like structure in RNA-bound R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, unlike K267E. Additionally, two resonances are observed for residue K71 in the RNA-bound R332A NMR spectrum, indicating real-time equilibration between two structural states. This effect is unique to the R332A variant and underscores subtle structural and dynamic changes to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec during RNA binding.</p>
<p>We further examined the NMR data to attempt to identify residues most critical for RNA binding to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec. In an overlay of the WT and mutant RNA-induced chemical shift perturbations (Δδ, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S14</xref>), it became clear that the effect of RNA binding to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec variants was muted, where even at saturating concentrations, the chemical shift perturbations across the K267E and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 sequences were weaker than those of same residues in WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec. The residual Δδ (WT - mutant) was plotted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S14</xref>), where positive values indicate that residues in a <italic>Geo</italic>Rec variant are weakly affected by RNA, relative to WT. Negative residual Δδ denote sites where <italic>Geo</italic>Rec variants experience a greater structural impact from RNA than corresponding sites in WT. Of particular interest are the positive residuals that hint at the sites in <italic>Geo</italic>Rec most critical for tight RNA binding. These residues were mapped onto the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S14</xref>) and termed allosteric hotspots, as many are not at the RNA interface. Mutations of these hotspots in future studies offers a potential means of precisely tuning the affinity of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec to its gRNA. Notably, residues with positive residual Δδ (suggested as critical for tight RNA binding) largely overlap in the analysis of both variants. Specifically, residues F170, R192, H264, R269, L270, L279, H300, D301, E368, D376, D403, E405, E408, and I429 appear as allosteric hotspots (with CPMG relaxation dispersion) critical to WT-like RNA interaction.</p>
<p>Having observed a reduced affinity of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec variants for RNA by NMR and MST, we next quantified the impact of the K267E and R332A mutations on RNP formation and stability in full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. The thermal unfolding midpoint of full-length WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 determined by CD is ∼60 °C and the K267E and R332A mutations do not change the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of the apo protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S15</xref>). Upon formation of an RNP (using a full-length gRNA), the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 increases to 73°C. K267E <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 retains a similar <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> increase to 70 °C, while R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 forms a less stable RNP with <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 61 °C. The trend of these data is consistent with NMR and MST, which highlight that although K267E and R332A mutations within <italic>Geo</italic>Rec have somewhat muted structural effects, these changes alter protein dynamics and the interaction with gRNA.</p>

<title>Mutations in full-length GeoCas9 alter its structural dynamics and interaction with gRNA</title>
<p>To further investigate the effects of mutations on protein dynamics, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on the cryo-EM structure of full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (PDB: 8UZA) in complex with gRNA and target DNA. We simulated the full-length WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and its K267E and R332A mutants as well as a double mutant combining K267E and R332A (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), in three replicates of approximately 2 μs each. Multi-microsecond simulations revealed substantial changes in the dynamics of the <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 mutants compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S16</xref>). Specifically, we observed that mutations in the REC domain significantly altered the dynamics of both the Rec and the adjacent HNH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S16</xref>). Differential root-mean-square fluctuations (ΔRMSF) analysis of protein residues between the WT and variants further highlighted these alterations, showing increased dynamics in the HNH and Rec domains induced by the mutations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). To quantify the impact of these mutations, we analyzed protein- RNA interactions by calculating the number of contacts between <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 and gRNA in the WT and mutant systems. A contact was defined as a distance between two atoms of ≤ 4.5 Å. The number of contacts was significantly reduced in all variants compared to the WT, with the most pronounced reduction observed in the K267E variant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). We next quantified gRNA-Rec domain binding by calculating the binding free energy using the MM-GBSA method over ∼200 ns of stable simulation trajectories (details in Materials and Methods). Consistent with a reduction in gRNA contacts, variants with the K267E mutation exhibited a substantial reduction in binding free energy (&gt;60 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) relative to the WT, whereas the R332A variant displayed a smaller reduction (&lt;20 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).

<p>Additionally, we simulated a novel variant, i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (PDB: 8UZB), containing mutations in the Rec1 and WED domains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, mutations highlighted in lime green). This variant was recently demonstrated to have enhanced specificity in genome-editing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> Intriguingly, i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 exhibited increased dynamics in the HNH and Rec domains, along with a reduction in gRNA binding free energy similar to the K267E and R332A mutants. These results suggest a distinct allosteric pathway involving additional residues that enables i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 to maintain improved DNA cleavage activity despite reduced gRNA binding affinity. In fact, i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 samples the greatest conformational space of any variant tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S16</xref>), suggesting a high level of flexibility is critical to enhanced specificity in <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. Collectively, our simulations reveal that mutations K267E and R332A destabilize the <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 interaction with gRNA, consistent with NMR observations. Furthermore, the enhanced dynamics and altered binding affinities observed in i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 indicate potential allosteric mechanisms that optimize its genome-editing functionality, where K267E and R332A evoke a similar, but lesser degree of biophysical change.</p>

<title>DNA cleavage assays suggest the highly stable GeoCas9 is resistant to functional changes by K267E or R332A mutations</title>
<p>The dynamic impact of the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec mutations and their altered gRNA interactions at the biophysical level led us to speculate that either mutation incorporated into full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 would also alter its DNA cleavage function, especially at elevated temperatures where WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 is most active. Temperature-dependent functional alterations were previously observed for single-point mutations within <italic>Geo</italic>HNH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Although the K267E and R332A mutations slightly diminished on-target DNA cleavage by <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, the effect was very subtle and these overall cleavage activities followed the temperature dependence of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 quite closely (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S17</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess the impact of the K267E and R332A mutations on <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 specificity, we assayed the propensity for off-target cleavage using DNA substrates with mismatches 5-6 or 19- 20 base pairs from the PAM site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S18, Table S2</xref>). As a control for on- and off-target activity, we assayed WT <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 alongside the widely used high-specificity HiFi-<italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S18, Table S3</xref>) and found a lower percent of digested off-target (mismatched) DNA sequences when compared to WT <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9. As expected, WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 was increasingly sensitive to mismatched target sequences closer to the seed site, which has been demonstrated with <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 and other Cas systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> No significant differences in activity were observed with digestion durations ranging from 1-60 minutes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> implying that a 1-minute digestion is sufficient for <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 with the target DNA template. While these findings generally align with prior investigations of off-target DNA cleavage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> there are nuanced differences. Specifically, a previous study reported ∼10% cleavage of off-target DNA with a mismatch 5-6 base pairs from the PAM by WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Our results showed nearly 50% cleavage for the same off-target mismatch, but still a significant decrease in cleavage from on-target or 19-20 base pair distal mismatches. This could be due to the relatively high RNP concentrations (600-900 nM) in our assay (for clear visibility on the gel), compared to prior studies with RNP concentrations ≤ 500 nM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Our results corresponded closely to those of prior studies with a 19-20 base pair mismatch, where off-target cleavage is tolerated by WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Single-point mutants K267E and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 have negligible impact on <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 specificity (both variants follow the trend of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S18</xref>), which contrasts prior work with <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 that demonstrated robust specificity enhancement with single-point mutations in Rec.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Additionally, a <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 double mutant K267E/R332A exhibits decreased on-target cleavage efficiency, which has been noted in high-specificity Cas systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> However, the additive effect of the K267E/R332A double mutant still does not enhance <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 specificity in our assay.</p>
<p>MST-derived binding affinities using full-length Tnnt2 gRNA and full-length WT, K267E, or R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 indicate that all three proteins have similar affinities for the gRNA used in the functional assays (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, mutations do not substantially alter full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 binding to Tnnt2 gRNA, supporting similar cleavage activities for these proteins. We repeated the MST experiments using a different gRNA sequence derived from the new cryo-EM structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (PDB:8UZA), which has a different spacer sequence. We observed a similar trend, as all <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 variants exhibited comparable affinities for this gRNA.

<p>CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful tool for targeted genome editing with high efficiency and modular specificity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Allosteric signals propagate DNA binding information to the HNH and RuvC nuclease domains, facilitating their concerted cleavage of double-stranded DNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> The intrinsic flexibility of the nucleic acid recognition lobe plays a critical role in this information transfer, exerting a measure of conformational control over catalysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> This study provides new insights into the structural, dynamic, and functional role of the thermophilic <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 recognition lobe. Novel constructs of subdomains <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, as well as intact <italic>Geo</italic>Rec show a high structural similarity to the domains in full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, facilitating solution NMR experiments that captured the intrinsic allosteric motions across <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2. These studies revealed the existence of μs-ms timescale motions that are classically associated with allosteric signaling and enzyme function, which span the entire <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 domain to its interfaces with <italic>Geo</italic>Rec1 and the adjacent <italic>Geo</italic>HNH domain.</p>
<p>Based on homology to specificity-enhancing variants of the better studied <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9, the biophysical and biochemical consequences of two mutations were tested in <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2, the larger <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe, and full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. We speculated that removing positively charged residues with potential to interact with negatively charged nucleic acids could disrupt <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9-gRNA complex formation, stability, and subsequent function by altering the protein or nucleic acid motions. Indeed, CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments revealed that mutations enhanced and reorganized the μs-ms flexibility of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2. Further, NMR titrations showed the affinity of K267E and R332A <italic>Geo</italic>Rec for 39nt portions of two gRNAs to be weaker than that of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Rec, consistent with MST-derived <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values using the isolated domain. The mutations also diminished the stability of the full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 RNP complex, though this could result from an allosteric effect that destabilizes the <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 structure without appreciably altering gRNA binding.</p>
<p>The collective changes to protein dynamics, gRNA binding, and RNP thermostability suggested that mutations could modulate <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 function, as observed in similar studies of <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 reporting that gRNA dynamics, affecting the potential for the RNA:DNA hybrid to dissociate, have affected function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> Yet, the functional impact of single-point and double mutations in this work were negligible, despite homologous K-to-E and R-to-A single point mutations enhancing specificity of the mesophilic <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9. The biophysical impact of mutations within <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 and <italic>Geo</italic>Rec may be tempered by its evolutionary resilience and the highly stable neighboring domains in the context of full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, reflected in an unchanged affinity for target DNA once the RNP was formed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> Thus, a greater number of additive (or synergistic) mutations within <italic>Geo</italic>Rec would be required to fine-tune activity or specificity to a large degree.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the effects of these and other <italic>Geo</italic>Rec mutations may vary <italic>in vivo</italic> or with alternative target cleavage sites and cell types. Such studies will be the subject of future work, as will biochemical assays of homologous mutations across diverse Cas9s, which have contributed to the wide use of CRISPR technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> We also note that despite the homology between <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2 and <italic>Spy</italic>Rec3 and the latter’s role in evo- and HiFi-<italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 variants that inspired the K267E and R332A mutations, the maximally enhanced <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 variants contain four mutations each. Presumably each individual substitution plays a small role modulating specificity. However, there is no consistent pattern that discerns whether multiple mutations will have additive or synergistic impacts on Cas9 function. NMR and MD studies of high-specificity <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 variants (HF-1, Hypa, and Evo, each with distinct mutations in the <italic>Spy</italic>Rec3 domain) reveal universal structural and dynamic variations in regions of <italic>Spy</italic>Rec3 that interface with the RNA;DNA hybrid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> Notably, a recently published variant, i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> demonstrated enhanced genome-editing capabilities in HEK293T cells with eight mutations, though none in the Rec2 subdomain. This study highlighted the functional adaptability of i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 under low magnesium conditions, a trait beneficial in mammalian cells, distinguishing it from WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. These very recently published data, as well as the findings reported here still advance our molecular understanding of the functional handles in <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, relevant to the design of new enhanced variants.</p>
<p>This study marks the first phase of mapping allosteric motions and pathways of information flow in the <italic>Geo</italic>Rec lobe with solution NMR experiments. Such information transfer is critical to the crosstalk between Rec and HNH in several Cas9s. Despite NMR advancements in perdeuteration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and sparse isotopic labeling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> per-residue dynamics underlying allosteric signaling in large multi-domain proteins such as <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (∼126 kDa) have remained challenging to characterize. Novel cryo-EM structures of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> will facilitate the merging of future NMR and MD simulation studies to report on RNP dynamics and atomic level networks of communication. The identification of additional (or synergistic) allosteric hotspots within <italic>Geo</italic>Rec using an integrated workflow will help to further resolve the balance between structural flexibility and the unusually high stability of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, leading to new insight into targeted manipulation of RNA affinity and enhanced variants.</p>
<p>Here, we set out to biophysically characterize the Rec lobe of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 to obtain new understanding of its function (in the context of well-studied mesophilic Cas9s). Using an AlphaFold2 model, and later a cryo-EM structure of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, we introduced mutations based on proximal gRNA interactions and homology to specificity-enhancing sites in <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9. However, the mutations did not affect <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 function as expected, highlighting the complicated interplay between the biophysics of mesophilic and thermophilic Cas enzymes and the difficulty of applying universal functional predictions to Cas9. The very recent report of the i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 variant further reinforces this point.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> While high-specificity <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 variants are heavily mutated in Rec3 (analogous to <italic>Geo</italic>Rec2), i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 lacks mutations in Rec2 entirely, raising new questions about the functional role of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec. MD simulations of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, and the Rec variants revealed that while K267E and R332A induce dynamic effects on a similar trajectory to i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, a true high-specificity variant samples a very wide conformational space with displacements of both Rec and HNH (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">S16</xref>). Through further study of the fundamental mechanism of <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9, it remains possible that engineering of <italic>Geo</italic>Rec may produce high-specificity variants.</p>

<title>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations</title>
<p>Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were based on the cryo-EM structure of full-length <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (PDB: 8UZA, resolution 3.17 Å) in complex with gRNA and target DNA with two mutations in <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (at residues 8 and 582). Four systems were considered for the MD studies: WT, K267E, R332A, K267E/R332A and i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9. We generated the WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 by back-mutating A8D and A582H from the cryo-EM structure (PDB: 8UZA), followed by introducing the mutations K267E, R332A, or a double mutation (with both K267E and R332A) for the variant systems. Subsequently, we performed MD simulation of i<italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (PDB: 8UZB, resolution 2.63 Å) consisting of 10 mutations (D8A, E149G, T182I, N206D, P466Q, H582A, Q817R, E843K, E854G, K908R). All systems were solvated with explicit water in a periodic box of ∼ 134 Å x ∼ 154 Å x ∼ 151 Å resulting in ∼ 276,000 atoms. Counter ions were added to neutralize the systems. MD simulations were performed using a protocol tailored for protein-nucleic acid complexes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> previously applied in studies of CRISPR-Cas systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> All the simulations were performed by using Amber ff19SB force field for protein,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> ff99bsc1 corrections and χOL3 corrections for DNA and RNA, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> Water molecules were described by TIP3P model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> All bonds involving hydrogens were constrained using the LINCS algorithm. A particle mesh Ewald method (PME) with a 10 Å cutoff was used to calculate electrostatics. Energy minimization was performed to relax the water molecules and counterions, keeping the protein-nucleic acid complex fixed with harmonic potential restraints of 100 kcal/mol Å<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Equilibration was performed by gradually increasing the temperature from 0 to 100 K and then to 200 K in canonical NVT ensemble and isothermal-isobaric NPT ensemble. A final temperature of 300 K was maintained via Langevin dynamics with a collision frequency γ = 1/ps and a reference pressure of 1 atm was achieved through Berendsen barostat. Production runs were carried out in NVT ensemble for 2 µs for each system in three replicates, resulting in 6 µs per system (totaling 30 µs for all systems). The equations of motion were integrated with the leapfrog Verlet algorithm with a time step of 2 fs. All simulations were conducted using the GPU-empowered version of AMBER 22.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> Analysis was performed on the aggregate ensemble (i.e., ∼6 μs per system).</p>
<p>To characterize the protein-nucleic acid interactions in all the systems under investigation, we performed contact analysis. A contact was considered to form between two atoms within a cutoff distance of ≤4.5 Å. The binding free energy of gRNA and DNA with <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 was calculated using the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> This approach was used to compare the Rec-gRNA binding affinity of WT <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 with its mutants. For each system, the binding energies were calculated over the ∼200 ns ensemble of the stable trajectories at an interval of ∼20 ns.</p>

<title>DNA cleavage assays</title>
<p><italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 gRNA templates containing 21-nt spacers targeting the mouse <italic>Tnnt2</italic> gene locus were introduced into EcoRI and BamHI sites in pUC57 (Genscript). The plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (New England BioLabs) and subsequent restriction digest of the plasmid DNA was carried out using the BamHI restriction enzyme (New England BioLabs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Linearized plasmid DNA was immediately purified using the DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA transcription was performed <italic>in vitro</italic> with the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England BioLabs). DNA substrates containing the target cleavage site (479 base pairs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S13</xref>) were produced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using mouse genomic DNA as a template and primer pairs 5’CAAAGAGCTCCTCGTCCAGT3’ and 5’ ATGGACTCCAGGACCCAAGA3’ followed by a column purification using the NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit (Macherey-Nagel). For the <italic>in vitro</italic> activity assay, RNP formation was achieved by incubating 3 µM <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (WT, K267E, R332A, or K267E/R332A mutant) and 3 µM gRNA at either 37 °C, 60 °C, 75 °C, or 85 °C for 30 minutes in a reaction buffer of 20 mM Tris, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, and 5% glycerol at pH 7.5. The 10 µL cleavage reactions were set up by mixing RNP at varying concentrations with 149 nanograms of PCR products on ice followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 minutes. The reaction was quenched with 1 µL of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) and subsequent incubation at 56 °C for 10 minutes. 6x DNA loading buffer was added to each reaction and 10 µL of reaction mixture per lane was loaded onto an agarose gel. DNA band intensity measurements were carried out with ImageJ.</p>
<p>For <italic>in vitro</italic> off-target activity assays, RNP formation was achieved by incubating 10 µM <italic>Geo</italic>Cas9 (WT, K267E, R332A, or K267E/R332A mutant) and 10 µM gRNA at 37 °C for 30 minutes in the reaction buffer described above. The 10 µL cleavage reactions were set up by mixing 1 µM RNP with 150 nanograms of PCR products (off-target DNA sequences listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S2</xref>) on ice followed by incubation at 37 °C for varying time points. The reaction was quenched with 1 µL of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) and subsequent incubation at 56 °C for 10 minutes. 6x DNA loading buffer was added to each reaction and 10 µL of reaction mixture per lane was loaded onto an agarose gel. DNA band intensity measurements were carried out with ImageJ. WT and HiFi <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 control proteins were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, cat. No. 108158 and No. 108160, respectively), as was the associated <italic>Spy</italic>Cas9 gRNA, Alt-R™ CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA, with an RNA spacer sequence complementing 5’-TGGACAGAGCCTTCTTCTTC-3’.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study from Belato, Knight and co-workers, the authors investigated the Rec domain of a thermophilic Cas9 from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (GeoCas9). The authors investigated three constructs, two individual subdomains of Rec (Rec1 and Rec2) and the full Rec domain. This domain is involved in binding to the guide RNA of Cas9, as well as the RNA-DNA duplex that is formed upon target binding. The authors performed RNA binding and relaxation experiments using NMR for the wild-type domain as well as two-point mutants. They observed differences in RNA binding activities as well as the flexibility of the domain. The authors also performed molecular dynamics and functional experiments on full-length GeoCas9 to determine whether these biophysical differences affect the RNA binding or cleavage activity. Although the authors observed some changes in the thermal stability of the mutant GeoCas9-gRNA complex, they did not observe substantial differences in the guide RNA binding or cleavage activities of the mutant GeoCas9 variants.</p>
<p>Overall, this manuscript provides a detailed biophysical analysis of the GeoCas9 Rec domain. The NMR assignments for this construct should prove very useful, and can serve as the basis for future similar studies of GeoCas9 Rec domain mutants. While the two mutants tested in the study did not produce significant differences from wild-type GeoCas9, the study rules out the possibility that analogous mutations can be translated between type II-A and II-C Cas9 orthologs. Together, these findings may provide the grounds for future engineering of higher fidelity variants of GeoCas9</p>

<p>The manuscript from Belato et al., used advanced NMR approaches and a mutagenesis campaign probe the conformational dynamics of the recognition lobe (Rec) of the CRISPR Cas9 enzyme from G. stearothermophilus (GeoCas9). Using truncated and full-length constructs they assess the impacts of two different point mutations have on the redistribution and timescale of these motions and assess gRNA recognition and specificity. Single point mutations in the Rec domain in a Cas9 from a related species had profound impacts on- and off-target DNA editing, therefore the authors reasoned analogous mutations in GeoCas9 would have similar effects. However, despite a redistribution of local motions and changes in global stability, their chosen mutations had little impact on DNA editing in the context of the full-length enzyme.</p>
<p>In their revised manuscript, the authors were highly responsive to the reviewer's comments incorporating new experimental results including molecular dynamics simulations and RNA binding data using full-length GeoCas9, as well as reframing their discussion and conclusions in consideration of the new data. They were receptive to suggestions for clarification in both the text and methods section. With these changes, the manuscript has been significantly improved.</p>
<p>Their studies highlight the species-specific complexity of interdomain communication and allosteric mechanisms used by these multi-domain endonucleases. The noted strengths of the article remain, and despite the negative results, their approach will garner interest from investigators interested in understanding how the activity and specificity of these enzymes can be engineered to tune activity and limit off-target cleavage by these enzymes. Generally, the manuscript highlights the challenges of studying the effect of allosteric networks on protein function, particularly in multidomain proteins, and thus will be of broad interest to the community.</p>

<p>The authors explore the role of Rec domains in a thermophilic Cas9 enzyme. They report on the crystal structure of part of the recognition lobe, its dynamics from NMR spin relaxation and relaxation-dispersion data, its interaction mode with guide RNA, and the effect of two single-point mutations hypothesised to enhance specificity. They find that mutations have small effects on Rec domain structure and stability but lead to significant rearrangement of micro- to milli-second dynamics which does not translate into major changes in guide RNA affinity or DNA cleavage specificity, illustrating the inherent tolerance of GeoCas9. The work can be considered as a first step towards understanding motions in GeoCas9 recognition lobe, although no clear hotspots were discovered with potential for future rational design of enhanced Cas9 variants.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Detailed biophysical and structural investigation, despite a few technical limitations inherent with working with complex targets, provides converging evidence that molecular dynamics embedded in the recognition lobes allow GeoCas9 to operate on a broad range of substrates.</p>
<p>
- Since the authors and others have shown that substrate specificity is dictated by equivalent hotspot mutations in other Cas9 variants, we are one step closer to understanding this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Since the mutations investigated here do not significantly affect substrate binding or enzymatic activity, it is difficult to rationalize anything for enzyme engineering at this point.</p>
<p>
- Further investigation of the determinants of the observed dynamic modes, and follow-up with rationally designed mutations would hopefully allow to create a real model of the mechanism, but I do understand that this goes beyond the scope of this study.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<p>Responses to final minor critiques following initial revision</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p>
<p>The authors have generally done an excellent job of addressing my and the other reviewers' concerns. I have a few additional concerns that the authors could consider addressing through changes to the text:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for this assessment and are glad to have addressed the major points.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Regarding the gRNA used for NMR studies, I thank the authors for adding additional rationale for their design of the RNA used. However, I still believe that it is misleading to term this RNA as a &quot;gRNA&quot;, given that it is mainly composed of a sequence that is arbitrary (the spacer) and the sections of the gRNA that are constant between all gRNAs are truncated in a way that removes secondary structure that is likely essential for specific contacts with the Rec domains. I do not believe the authors need to make alterations to any of their experiments. However, I do think their description of the &quot;gRNA&quot; should be updated to properly reflect that this RNA lacks any of the secondary structure present in a typical gRNA, much of which is necessary to confer specificity of binding between GeoCas9 and the gRNA. As mentioned in my previous review, this may be best achieved by adding a cartoon of the secondary structure of the full-length gRNA and highlighting the region that was used in the truncated &quot;gRNA&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the Reviewer’s point. For any experiment in which the gRNA was truncated (i.e. NMR or some MST studies), we have clarified the text and no longer call it a “gRNA.” We state initially that it is a portion of the gRNA and then call it simply an “RNA.”</p>
<p>For experiments using the full-length constructs, we have kept the term “gRNA,” as it remains appropriate.</p>
<p>We have also added a final Supplementary figure (S12) showing the structures of the truncated and full-length RNAs used, based on the _Geo_Cas9 cryo-EM structure and predicted with RNAfold.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Lines 256-257: &quot;The ~3-fold decrease in Kd...&quot;. I believe the authors are discussing the Kd's of the mutants relative to WT, in which case the Kd increased. Also, the fold-change appears closer to 2fold than to 3-fold.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, the Reviewer makes a good catch. We have corrected this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Lines 407-408: &quot;The mutations also diminished the stability of the full-length GeoCas9 RNP complex.&quot; This statement seems at odds with the authors' conclusions in the Results section that the full-length GeoCas9 variants had comparable affinities for the gRNAs (lines 376-382)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this seems contradictory. In the absence of full-length structures for all variants, we can’t definitively state what causes this. It could be that the mutation has an interesting allosteric effect on structure that does not affect RNA binding but induces the Cas9 protein to simply fall apart at lower temperatures, rendering the binding interaction moot. We have added a statement to this section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The authors chose to keep &quot;SpCas9&quot; for consistency with their prior work and the work of many several others, including Doudna et al and Zhang et al. However, I will note that their publications on GeoCas9, the Doudna lab did use SpyCas9 to ensure consistent nomenclature within the publications.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have made the change to “_Spy_Cas9”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors clearly answered most of my concerns. I still have some technical questions about the analysis of CPMG-RD data but the numbers provided now seem to make sense. While I still think that crystal structures of the point mutant would make the conclusions more &quot;bullet proof&quot;, I do appreciate the work associated with this and consider that the manuscript can be published as is.</p>

<p>We agree that additional magnetic fields could allow for additional models of CPMG data fitting and that additional crystal structures of the mutants could add to the conclusions. We appreciate the Reviewer recognizing the balance of the current results and potential future studies in signing off on publication.</p>
