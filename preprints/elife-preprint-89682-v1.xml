<title>Abstract</title><p>Postsynaptic mitochondria are critical to the development, plasticity, and maintenance of synaptic inputs. However, their relationship to synaptic structure and functional activity is unknown. We examined a correlative dataset from ferret visual cortex with <italic>in vivo</italic> two-photon calcium imaging of dendritic spines during visual stimulation and electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions of spine ultrastructure, investigating mitochondrial abundance near functionally- and structurally-characterized spines. Surprisingly, we found no correlation to structural measures of synaptic strength. Instead, we found that mitochondria are positioned near spines with orientation preferences that are dissimilar to the somatic preference. Additionally, we found that mitochondria are positioned near groups of spines with heterogeneous orientation preferences. For a subset of spines with a mitochondrion in the head or neck, synapses were larger and exhibited greater selectivity to visual stimuli than those without a mitochondrion. Our data suggest mitochondria are not necessarily positioned to support the energy needs of strong spines, but rather support the structurally and functionally diverse inputs innervating the basal dendrites of cortical neurons.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>By volume, mitochondria are the most prolific organelle in neuronal compartments. Mitochondria are observed within cell bodies, dendritic processes, axons, and occasionally dendritic protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cameron et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kasthuri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Faitg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pekkurnaz and Wang, 2022</xref>). Their abundance is thought to reflect a critical role: supporting the energy demands of neuronal communication through a supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Datta and Jaiswal, 2021</xref>). Neuronal communication occurs through synapses, and the process of transforming action potentials into graded postsynaptic depolarization is one of the most energy-expensive processes in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rossi and Pekkurnaz, 2019</xref>). ATP supplied by mitochondria is needed for postsynaptic glutamate receptor activation, presynaptic vesicle endo/exocytosis pathways, glutamate recycling, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Attwell and Laughlin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Harris et al., 2012</xref>). Mitochondria are also involved in local protein synthesis, protein transport, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering critical for synapse maintenance and structural dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lipton and Whittingham, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Harris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Rangaraju et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Datta and Jaiswal, 2021</xref>). While there is growing evidence that mitochondria support synaptic activity, how this support is achieved is largely unknown. Some research suggests that ATP might diffuse from distant sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Pathak et al., 2015</xref>), but the limited rate of diffusion of ATP in the cytosol implies the importance of spatial positioning close to synaptic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Belles et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hubley et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Devine and Kittler, 2018</xref>). Thus, it is unclear to what extent mitochondrial positioning is orchestrated within neuronal compartments to meet the needs of local synaptic inputs.</p>
<p>Adding further complexity, mitochondria are heterogeneous in morphology and density, in a manner dependent on subcellular compartment (i.e. presynapse vs. postsynapse). Presynaptic mitochondria are generally smaller, shorter, and less complex than those in dendrites of the same brain area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Delgado et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Faitg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Turner et al., 2022</xref>). Ultrastructural correlations reveal a strong link between synaptic strength and mitochondrial abundance: larger boutons, which typically contain a greater number of presynaptic vesicles and are correlated with synapse strength and efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Schikorski and Stevens, 1997</xref>), contain larger mitochondria and, occasionally, a greater number of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wilke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">CserÃ©p et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rodriguez-Moreno et al., 2018</xref>). Scaling to meet presynaptic energy demands has also been shown in the calyx of Held nerve terminal where synapse functional maturation correlates with a dramatic increase in mitochondrial volume and organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Thomas et al., 2019</xref>). However, while evidence grows for the specific recruitment of mitochondria to the presynapse, the nature of <italic>postsynaptic</italic> mitochondria is largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Faitg et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Postsynaptic mitochondria are primarily located within the dendritic shafts, and are rarely found extending into dendritic spines or inside the spine head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cameron et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kasthuri et al., 2015</xref>). Dendritic mitochondria are largely thought to provide local energetic support, based on studies relating mitochondrial and synapse abundance. Mitochondrial density along the dendrite co-varies with synapse density in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Turner et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, dendritic mitochondria are found closer to excitatory synapses than expected by chance in retinal ganglion cells, and a similar relationship has been shown in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Faits et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> measurements of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx correlate with cytosolic calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Datta and Jaiswal, 2021</xref>), further supporting a view of supporting local synaptic activity via calcium buffering. However, a missing piece of this framework is whether dendritic mitochondria are organized to support the structure and function of individual dendritic spines and their synaptic activity.</p>
<p>A spatial relationship between mitochondria and dendritic spines may be critically important. Dendritic spines exhibit a wide diversity of morphologies and functional response properties compared to the somatic output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Scholl et al., 2021</xref>). Given the wide collection of synaptic inputs, conveying distinct information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Scholl and Fitzpatrick, 2020</xref>) at different input rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Goris et al., 2015</xref>), it is reasonable to suggest that mitochondria are precisely positioned to support highly-active synapses onto dendritic spines or those with greater influence on somatic action potentials. In addition, dendrites can exhibit homogeneous or heterogeneous clustering of synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>), and functional organization motifs may require differential energetic support. However, it is an open question whether mitochondria are preferentially positioned to support certain populations of dendritic spines over others based on their structure or sensory-driven activity.</p>
<p>We address this question by combining <italic>in vivo</italic> two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of dendritic spines driven by visual stimuli and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) reconstructions of L2/3 pyramidal neurons of ferret visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Scholl et al., 2021</xref>). Using a deep learning method for unsupervised 3D identification of mitochondria in the EM volumes, we characterized the 3D volume of dendritic mitochondria near individual dendritic spines and compared it to structural and functional measurements. While mitochondrial volume was unrelated to dendritic spine morphology, we discovered a surprising functional correlation: local mitochondria were positioned near spines differentially-tuned to the somatic output and those in regions with functional heterogeneity. Additionally, spines that contain a mitochondrion in the head or neck were larger and more selective to visual stimuli. Our novel dataset and analysis suggest that dendritic mitochondria are precisely positioned to support functional synaptic diversity of cortical neurons.</p>

<title>Characterizing postsynaptic mitochondria in 3D EM volumes from ferret visual cortex</title>
<p>To investigate subcellular organization of dendritic mitochondria, we returned to a previously published CLEM dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Scholl et al., 2021</xref>). This dataset contains individual layer 2/3 neurons from the ferret visual cortex for which basal dendrites were examined <italic>in vivo</italic> with two-photon calcium imaging of GCaMP6s during visual stimulation, and then subsequently recovered for SBF-SEM and volumetric 3D reconstruction to characterize ultrastructural anatomy. In this study, we continued to extract ultrastructural information from the dendrites imaged <italic>in vivo</italic>, focusing on postsynaptic mitochondria. To identify postsynaptic mitochondria, we used an unsupervised method for 3D identification of mitochondria in the EM volumes (see Methods). This method quickly and accurately identified mitochondria within the dendritic shaft (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). From these 3D annotations, we first characterized the basic structure and organization of postsynaptic mitochondria in our dataset (n = 324 mitochondria identified within 63 dendritic segments from 4 cells collected from 2 animals).</p>

<p>Mitochondria were distributed throughout the dendrites, with infrequent large (&gt; 10 micron) gaps between individual mitochondria (median inter-mitochondrion distance = 3.025 Âµm, IQR = 5.281 Âµm, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref></bold>). Mitochondria in the basal dendrites of ferret layer 2/3 cortical cells were typically small (median volume = 0.248 Âµm<sup>3</sup>, IQR = 0.443 Âµm<sup>3</sup>, surface area = 2.537 Âµm<sup>2</sup>, IQR = 3.144 Âµm<sup>2</sup>, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D-E</xref></bold>), with a short length through the dendrite (maximum length median = 1.137 Âµm, IQR = 0.881 Âµm, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F</xref>)</bold>, in comparison to <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> reports of mouse cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lewis et al., 2018</xref>). While most mitochondria were positioned within the dendritic shaft, we did observe a small fraction of mitochondrion positioned either inside the spine neck or head (4.9%, 10/203 spines, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). Of these spines, mitochondria were found entirely within the spine head (2/10), at the junction between the head and neck (5/10), or within the neck (3/10). Mitochondria in spines were significantly smaller and more spherical in shape than dendritic mitochondria (median volume = 0.050 Âµm<sup>3</sup>, IQR = 0.047 Âµm<sup>3</sup>, surface area = 0.658 Âµm<sup>2</sup>, IQR = 0.540 Âµm<sup>2</sup>, maximum length = 0.590 Âµm, IQR = 0.249 Âµm; all p &lt; 0.0001, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests; <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D-F</xref></bold>). These mitochondria were never continuations of dendritic mitochondria.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Dendritic mitochondria organization is independent of dendritic spine morphology</title>
<p>We hypothesized that dendritic mitochondria are strategically positioned to support synapses on dendritic spines in a structural- or activity-dependent manner, as found for axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we measured the total mitochondria volume within a given distance from the base of the spine neck (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). We chose this metric for two reasons: (1) larger mitochondria produce more ATP to support nearby synapses and (2) multiple mitochondria may be clustered nearby individual spines and we assume a greater number of mitochondria equates to greater ATP production. In presynaptic boutons, a critical inflection-point distance has been identified, where, the presence of a mitochondrion less than 3 Âµm from the synapse results in an increase in active zone size and docked vesicle number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). Based on this observation, we measured mitochondria volume using two radii: 1 Âµm and 5 Âµm (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). In our dataset, the median spine neck length is roughly 1.8 Âµm; therefore, 1 and 5 Âµm distances represent short and extended ranges relative to the synapse. For all subsequent analyses, we focused <italic>only</italic> on spines with measurable mitochondrial volume at each radius. In our population, 56.8% of spines had no mitochondria volume within 1 Âµm and 12.1% of spines had none within 5 Âµm. Expectedly, there was greater mitochondria volume for a 5 Âµm radius compared to 1 Âµm nearby individual spines (1 Âµm radius median volume = 0.221 Âµm<sup>3</sup>, IQR = 0.278 Âµm<sup>3</sup>; 5 Âµm radius median volume = 0.771 Âµm<sup>3</sup>, IQR = 0.561 Âµm<sup>3</sup>; n = 69 spines, p &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test), although these two measures were significantly correlated (Spearmanâs r = 0.239, p = 0.238; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Dendritic spines differ in shape and size (e.g. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). As spine structure is highly correlated with synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bartol et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Holler et al., 2021</xref>), we first examined whether mitochondria were preferentially located nearby stronger or weaker synapses, focusing on spines without a mitochondrion in the head or neck. Spine head volume and postsynaptic density (PSD) area, features that are positively correlated with synapse strength, were uncorrelated with mitochondria volume in a 1 Âµm radius (Spine head volume: r = â0.032, p = 0.403, n = 60; PSD area: r = 0.066, p = 0.309, n = 60 spines; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, G</xref></bold>) or a 5 Âµm radius (Spine head volume: r = â0.034, p = 0.357, n = 121; PSD area: r = â0.072, p = 0.216, n = 121 spines; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D, H</xref></bold>). Spine neck length was also uncorrelated with mitochondria volume at both radii (1 Âµm: r = 0.185, p = 0.079, n = 60 spines; 5 Âµm: r = 0.040, p = 0.333, n = 121 spines; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E, F</xref></bold>). We did observe a positive correlation between local 1 Âµm radius mitochondria volume and the distance of a dendritic spine from the cell body (r = 0.325, p = 0.006, n = 60 spines; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref></bold>). While this relationship was not observed for mitochondria within a 5 Âµm radius (5 Âµm: r = 0.104, p = 0.129, n = 121 spines; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref></bold>), there is a simple explanation: the volume fraction of dendrite occupied by mitochondria increases with distance from the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Turner et al., 2022</xref>). Dendrites are thicker near the soma and possess few dendritic spines.</p>

<title>Dendritic mitochondria are positioned near dendritic spines with diverse visual response properties</title>
<p>As dendritic mitochondria position was unrelated to dendritic spine anatomy, we next considered the visually-driven calcium activity of individual dendritic spines. In ferret V1, neurons and dendritic spines have exquisite response specificity to the orientation of drifting gratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>). Somatic orientation tuning is thought to arise from the co-activation of inputs sharing similar tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Scholl et al., 2021</xref>). Given the importance of co-tuned inputs supporting somatic selectivity, we hypothesized that dendritic mitochondria would be strategically positioned for energetic support and maintenance of co-tuned inputs.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we examined spines in our EM volumes which were also examined with <italic>in vivo</italic> two-photon calcium imaging during the presentation of oriented drifting gratings (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Scholl et al., 2021</xref>), evoked calcium signals were measured to characterize the orientation tuning of individual dendritic spines and the corresponding somatic output (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). For each tuned spine, we calculated orientation preference and compared this value to the orientation tuning of each parent soma (<italic>ÎÏ´<sub>pref</sub></italic> ; see Methods). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, spines can be co-tuned with the soma or differentially-tuned. We found that mitochondrial volume within a 1 Âµm radius was correlated with difference in orientation preference relative to the soma (r = 0.315, p = 0.010, n = 54 spines; <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). When increasing the radius to 5 Âµm, however, no correlation was observed (r = 0.017, p = 0.432, n = 107 spines; <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). This trend was found across all 4 cells examined (1 Âµm: mean r = 0.49 Â± 0.22 s.d.; 5 Âµm: mean r = 0.09 Â± 0.13 s.d.). We also considered other spine response properties related to tuning preference; specifically, orientation selectivity and response amplitude at the preferred orientation. For either metric, we observed no relationship to mitochondria within 1 Âµm radius (selectivity: 1 Âµm: r = â 0.081, p = 0.269, n = 60; max response amplitude: 1 Âµm: r = â0.179, p = 0.078, n = 64) but did see a weak, significant relationship to both at a 5 Âµm radius (selectivity: r = 0.175, p = 0.027, n = 121; max response amplitude: r =-0.166, p = 0.030, n = 129). This weak relationship suggests that within some dendritic segments, a greater volume of mitochondria leads to rapid removal of calcium out of the spine and cytoplasm, in agreement with a recent modeling study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Leung et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<p>We next wondered whether mitochondria might be positioned near clusters of spines with diverse orientation preferences. Within the same dendritic segment, local populations of spines can either share the same orientation (homogeneous; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scholl et al., 2017</xref>) or exhibit diversity (heterogeneous; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>). We measured the average orientation difference (i.e. local heterogeneity) of all spines within a 5 Âµm neighborhood of a given spine (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>; see Methods). We choose 5 Âµm because this value is strongly associated with the spatial extent of synaptic clustering and provides adequate sample sizes for computing the average orientation differences (n &gt; 2 spines). Similar to spine-soma difference in orientation preference, we found that local heterogeneity was strongly correlated with mitochondria volume within a 1 Âµm radius (r = 0.563, p = 0.0005, n = 31 spines; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>), and not within 5 Âµm (r = 0.017, p = 0.432, n = 107 spines; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). Importantly, while local heterogeneity was correlated with spine co-tuning (circular r = 0.33, p = 0.0024, n = 100 spines), this correlation was entirely due to inputs that closely matched the somatic preference. Restricting to only differentially-tuned inputs (<italic>ÎÏ´<sub>pref</sub></italic> &gt; 11.25 deg) yielded no correlation between spine-soma similarity and local heterogeneity (circular r = 0.03, p = 0.82, n = 71 spines). Focusing on these spines, local heterogeneity was still strongly correlated with mitochondria volume within 1 Âµm (Spearmanâs r = 0.52, p = 0.0052, n = 50).</p>

<p>Our data show that dendritic mitochondria are not observed near co-tuned spines or homogeneous clusters, but these measurements are based on orientation tuning preference, a metric that does not necessarily reflect local synaptic activity. Thus, we wondered whether a similar relationship exists for correlated activity between spines or the total calcium activity from groups of spines. As functional similarity coincides with spine co-activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scholl et al., 2017</xref>), dendritic mitochondria should not be positioned near spines with greater co-activity or total activity. We examined both the average local temporal correlation of calcium activity (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>) and trial-by-trial average calcium activity for all spines within a 5 Âµm radius of a given spine (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref></bold>; see Methods). We found no relationship for either measurement within a 1 Âµm radius (local temporal correlation: r = 0.015, p = 0.469, n = 28 spines; local average calcium activity: r = 0.160, p = 0.131, n = 51 spines; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E, H</xref></bold>), nor for local temporal correlation at a 5 Âµm radius (r = â0.152, p = 0.141, n = 52 spines; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></bold>). We did, however, observe a considerable negative correlation between mitochondria volume within a 5 Âµm radius and local average calcium activity (r = â0.320, p = 0.0004, n = 105 spines; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref></bold>). As this correlation was only observed at an extended radius, it suggests that dendritic regions with a particularly large volume of mitochondria, calcium is quickly buffered and calcium activity is attenuated within dendritic spines.</p>

<title>Dendritic spines with mitochondria are large and have high tuning selectivity</title>
<p>Our analyses have revealed that dendritic mitochondria are proximal to differentially-tuned spines and dendritic regions of local heterogeneity. These analyses have excluded dendritic spines containing mitochondria in the spine neck or head (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). We then examined whether these unique spines (n = 10) displayed distinct structural or functional properties.

<p>Comparing functional response properties, we found only a single metric showing a significant difference: orientation tuning selectivity.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We used a correlative light and electron microscopy dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Scholl et al., 2021</xref>) to characterize mitochondria within basal dendrites of L2/3 pyramidal neurons of the ferret V1 and relate their abundance near spines to an array of ultrastructural and functional properties of those spines. Based on 3D reconstructions using deep learning segmentation, mitochondria were found throughout the dendrites and had a fragmented morphology similar to those observed recently in CA1 pyramidal neuron basal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Virga et al., 2023</xref>). We report no relationship to measures of synaptic strength such as spine head volume or PSD area to dendritic mitochondrial volume within either a short or extended (1 or 5 Âµm, respectively) distance from the base of the spine neck. We did observe significant correlations between the volume of nearby mitochondrial and functional diversityâfor spine orientation preference similarity to the soma, and for local dendritic orientation preference heterogeneity. We also found that spines having a mitochondrion within the head or neck have significantly larger heads than those that do not and are more selective for visual stimuli, but are no different in other measures of structure and function. Taken together, our results point toward a system where dendritic mitochondria are positioned to support functional diversity, but not synaptic strength as has been previously shown in the presynaptic terminal. Furthermore, though rare, mitochondria within spines do support synaptic strength and selectivity, suggesting that mitochondria are flexible to support different facets of postsynaptic signaling depending on the compartment in which they are present.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Mitochondria and dendritic spine anatomy</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated whether dendritic mitochondria are preferentially positioned to support certain populations of dendritic spines over others, based on their structural or sensory-driven activity. We were surprised to find that dendritic mitochondria were not positioned near strong synapses, as measured by spine volume or PSD area. Considering that glutamate receptors and ion channels might take up 42% of the O<sub>2</sub> consumed by oxidative phosphorylation, and that larger spines have greater quantities of receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Holtmaat and Svoboda, 2009</xref>), we assumed that mitochondria would need to be positioned nearby for oxidative support. This is in contrast to studies of the presynapse: presynaptic terminal active zone area and mitochondria volume are strongly correlated, and mitochondria proximity is correlated with the number of nearby docked vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Smith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Thomas et al., 2019</xref>). Our results suggest mitochondria are not necessarily positioned to support the energy needs of large spines (i.e. strong synapses) through oxidative phosphorylation, at least in the pyramidal neuron basal dendrites we observed, and opens new questions into the nature of dendritic mitochondria.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Mitochondria and spine functional properties</title>
<p>We hypothesized that dendritic mitochondria would be positioned near synaptic inputs co-tuned with the somatic output (i.e. similar orientation preference). Our rationale was that co-activation of co-tuned inputs are critical for shaping somatic selectivity, and these inputs can often be found to be clustered together and possibly trigger nonlinear dendritic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scholl et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">2021</xref>). Surprisingly, we found the opposite to be true: mitochondria are present in greater volumes near differentially-tuned spines. This includes spines that had an orientation preference mismatching the soma and spines within dendritic regions of heterogeneity in orientation preference. What might be the cause of such a striking deviation from our original hypothesis?</p>
<p>One possibility is that regions of high spine functional diversity are more likely to be undergoing plasticity, such as spine pruning, <italic>de novo</italic> formation, or strength modifications. Recent <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have demonstrated that mitochondria are recruited to dendritic regions undergoing structural dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Faits et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dromard et al., 2021</xref>); however, it is unclear whether this is the case for our own EM dataset as we were only able to study a single developmental time point (adolescent, visually-mature ferret). Another possibility is that differentially-tuned spines and heterogeneous clusters reside nearby a greater number of GABAergic shaft inputs, supported energetically or through calcium buffering by locally positioned mitochondria, which could thereby act to sculpt away excitatory input. It is also possible that the activation of co-tuned spines will be more co-activated with and infiltrated by back-propagating somatic action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Palmer and Stuart, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Popovic et al., 2015</xref>), as compared to differentially-tuned spines.</p>
<p>Back-propagating action potentials may alter spine head depolarization, elements of the PSD, or calcium dynamics. These differences in spine activation may lead to different levels of support needed from mitochondria. Although we cannot provide a clear reason for our findings, our data do highlight the need for greater investigation into dendritic mitochondria, their subcellular organization within cells, and their relationship to the patterns of levels of synaptic activity.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Mitochondrial structure and distribution</title>
<p>Several factors influence the size and abundance of neuronal mitochondria including brain region, neuronal compartment, cell type, animal age, and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Delgado et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Glancy et al., 2020</xref>). Despite this variability, dendritic mitochondria are generally longer and take up a greater fraction of neurite volume compared to axonal mitochondria, which tend to be more fragmented and, in some cases, more mobile. Previous reports in mouse hippocampal cell culture and rat hippocampus report dendrites have long and overlapping mitochondria which form stable compartments of â¼35 Âµm length or more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Popov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rangaraju et al., 2019</xref>), while other studies of mouse cortex using EM or light microscopy report mitochondria lengths of roughly 1 to 10 Âµm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lewis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Turner et al., 2022</xref>). Our results are closer to those from the mouse cortex, but are smaller (median length just over 1 Âµm, 10th percentile = 0.55 Âµm, 90th percentile = 2.49 Âµm). The mitochondrial morphology we observe is most similar to a recent report from mouse CA1 pyramidal neuron basal dendrites, where mitochondria are â¼1 Âµm long and have a similar size distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Virga et al., 2023</xref>). This similarity could be due to the fact that dendritic mitochondria morphology is cell type and neuronal-compartment specific (e.g. apical vs. basal dendrites). Another possibility is greater mitochondrial fragmentation, as we observe in L2/3 ferret basal dendrites, is linked to synaptic excitability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Virga et al. (2023)</xref> demonstrated that low levels of excitability and activity is linked to longer mitochondria; thus, presynaptic neurons driving basal synapses in ferret V1 may operate with high firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mante et al., 2008</xref>), leading to more fragmented mitochondria than compared to mouse V1.</p>
<p>Another feature that appears to be highly variable across brain regions is the presence of mitochondria within spines. In hippocampal cell cultures, mitochondria enter about 8-10% of spines, typically as extensions of a dendritic mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2004</xref>). An EM reconstruction of mouse neocortex showed only three out of 1,425 spines (0.21%) contained mitochondria, with two of the three being continuations of dendritic mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kasthuri et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, in olfactory bulb granule cells, â¼87% of spines contain mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cameron et al., 1991</xref>). In our dataset, 4.9% of spines contain mitochondria; however, since we specifically examined L2/3 neuron basal dendrites proximal to the soma, it is difficult to compare this value to the greater literature, and future studies will need to investigate variations due to brain area, cell type, and compartment. One interesting distinction in our data was that all spine mitochondria were roughly spherical or oblong, never continuations of a dendritic mitochondrion. It is likely that these mitochondria are small fragmentations of nearby dendritic mitochondria that are trafficked into the spine, possibly through interactions with the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">MacAskill and Kittler, 2010</xref>). This would align well with the idea that spine mitochondria support synapses onto dendritic spines in a different way than dendritic mitochondria.</p>
<p>Previous observations in cultured neurons suggest that dendritic mitochondria take up stable positions along the dendrite, and similar evidence has been shown in retinal ganglion cell dendrites from the intact retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Faits et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rangaraju et al., 2019</xref>). Experiments have also shown oxidative phosphorylation by mitochondria is needed for dendritic protein translation, not glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rangaraju et al., 2019</xref>), and that it contributes a majority of the energy consumed at the postsynaptic site by receptor and ion channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Harris et al., 2012</xref>). However, in the context of our data, itâs difficult to conceive a system could exist where mitochondria are simultaneously immobile and provide significant quantities of energy for synaptic activity through oxidative phosphorylation, yet have no positional bias towards large, strong synapses. It is possible that there exists a balance between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis supplying energy at the synapse. This balance could shift depending on brain region, cell type, compartment, activity level, and mitochondrial morphology and mobility. In this way, dendritic areas receiving synaptic inputs with high functional diversity require greater local mitochondrial ATP production, while baseline activity is supported through local glycolysis or ATP diffusion from more distant sources. Additionally, the role that mitochondria serve at the synapse may shift toward one of calcium buffering and plasticity support. Local depletion of mitochondria has been shown to reduce plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rangaraju et al., 2019</xref>), and by blocking fission spines have impaired structural and functional LTP. Induction of LTP causes increased dendritic mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> and a burst of fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Divakaruni et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, once spines become established, mitochondria may localize to input-diverse dendritic regions to support synaptic plasticity. More investigation into the support functions of postsynaptic mitochondria is needed to elucidate their different contributions to synaptic function, plasticity, and development.</p>

Tissue was incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes in aqueous 1% thiocarbohydrazide dissolved at 60Â°C, aqueous 1% osmium tetroxide for 45 minutes at RT, and then 1% uranyl acetate in 25% ethanol for 20 minutes at RT in the dark. Tissue was rinsed then left in water overnight at 4Â°C. The following day, tissue was stained with Waltonâs lead aspartate for 30 minutes at 60Â°C. Tissue was then dehydrated in a graded ethanol series (30, 50, 70, 90, 100%), 1:1 ethanol to acetone, then 100% dry acetone. Tissue was infiltrated using 3:1 acetone to Durcupan resin (Sigma Aldrich) for 2 hours, 1:1 acetone to resin for 2 hours, 1:3 acetone to resin overnight, 100% resin for 4 hours the following day, then flat embedded in 100% resin on a glass slide and covered with an Aclar sheet at 60Â°C for 2 days. The tissue was trimmed to less than 1 Ã 1 mm in size, the empty resin at the surface was shaved to expose tissue surface using an ultramicrotome (UC7, Leica), then turned downwards to be remounted to a metal pin with conductive silver epoxy (CircuitWorks, Chemtronics).</p>

<title>SBF-SEM image acquisition and volume data handling</title>
<p>Samples were imaged using a correlative approach as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Thomas et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, tissue was sectioned and imaged using 3View2XP and Digital Micrograph (ver. 3.30.1909.0, Gatan Microscopy Suite) installed on a Gemini SEM300 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy LLC.) equipped with an OnPoint BSE detector (Gatan, Inc.). The detector magnification was calibrated within SmartSEM imaging software (ver. 6.0, Carl Zeiss Microscopy LLC.) and Digital Micrograph with a 500 nm cross line grating standard. A low magnification image of each block face was manually matched to its corresponding depth in the CLSM Z-stack using blood vessels and cell bodies as fiducials. Final imaging was performed at 2.0 - 2.2 kV accelerating voltage, 20 or 30 Âµm aperture, working distance of â¼5 mm, 0.5 - 1.2 Âµs pixel dwell time, 5.7 - 7 nm per pixel, knife speed of 0.1 mm/sec with oscillation, and 56 - 84 nm section thickness. Acquisition was automated and ranged from several days to several weeks depending on the size of the ROI and imaging conditions. The true section thickness was measured using mitochondria diameter calibrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fiala and Harris, 2001</xref>). Calibration for each block was required, since variation in thickness can occur due to heating, charging from the electron beam, resin polymerization, and tissue fixation and staining quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Starborg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hughes et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Serial tiled images were exported as TIFFs to TrakEM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) within ImageJ (ver. 1.52p) to montage tiles, then aligned using Scale-Invariant Feature Transform image alignment with linear feature correspondences and rigid transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lowe, 2004</xref>). Once aligned, images were inverted and contrast normalized.</p>

<title>SBF-SEM image analysis</title>
<p>Aligned images were exported to Microscopy Image Browser (ver. 2.51, 2.6, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Belevich et al., 2016</xref>) for segmentation of dendrites, spines, postsynaptic densities (PSDs), and boutons. Three annotators preformed segmentation and the segmentations of each annotator were proof-read by an experienced annotator (â¼1000 hours of segmentation experience) prior to quantification. Binary labels files were imported to Amira (ver. 6.7, 2019.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific) which was used to create 3D surface models of each dendrite, spine, and PSD. Once reconstructed, the model of each dendrite was manually overlaid onto its corresponding two-photon image using Adobe Photoshop for re-identification of individual spines. Amira was used to measure the volume of spine heads, surface area of PSDs, and spine neck length.</p>
<p>For mitochondrial analyses, segmentations were moved into ORS Dragonfly (ver. 2021.3, 2022.1). Within Dragonfly, a pre-built U-net++ architecture was trained on a small set of manual mitochondria segmentations, then applied for segmentation of all mitochondria within target dendrites. Dendrite segmentations were used as a mask to apply the trained mitochondria network, and mitochondria segmentations were proofread for accuracy. Mitochondria morphology was measured using tools within Dragonfly, while inter-mitochondria distances were measured in Microscopy Image Browser using the measure tool. For quantification of mitochondria volume near spines, a sphere of either 1 Âµm or 5 Âµm radius was applied with the center at the base of each spine neck, and the volume of mitochondria intersected by each sphere was measured. Mitochondria within spines were segmented manually and these spines (n = 10) were not included in correlation analyses. In addition, analyses excluded spines with 0 Âµm<sup>3</sup> mitochondrial volume within the relevant radii unless otherwise stated.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Statistical analyses are described in the main text and in figure legends. We used non-parametric statistical analyses (Wilcoxon sign-rank test, Mann-Whitney rank-sum test) or permutation tests to avoid assumptions about the distributions of the data. Statistical analysis was performed in MATLAB (2021b) or GraphPad Prism (ver. 9). Circular correlation coefficients were computed for tests with circular variables. For all other tests, Spearmanâs correlation coefficient was computed. All correlation significance tests were one-sided. Quantitative approaches were not used to determine if the data met the assumptions of the parametric tests.</p>

<p>This study provided a <bold>valuable</bold> finding demonstrating the spatial relationship between dendritic spines and mitochondria. The authors combined the analysis of ultra-structure data and functional data, which gives an excellent spatial and functional resolution to understand how mitochondria positioning is correlated to synaptic function and response in an in vivo model. Specifically, the authors provided <bold>convincing</bold> evidence and showed that dendritic mitochondria are positioned in spines with a diversity of orientation tuning, spines that display heterogeneous responses, and in areas of low local calcium activity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Mitochondria is the power plant of the cells including neurons. Thomas et al. characterized the distribution of mitochondria in dendrites and spines of L2/3 neurons from the ferret visual cortex, for which visually driven calcium responses of individual dendritic spines were examined. The authors analyzed the relationship between the position of mitochondria and the morphology or orientation selectivity of nearby dendrite spines. They found no correlation between mitochondrion location and spine morphological parameters associated with the strength of synapses, but correlation with the spine-somatic difference of orientation preference and local heterogeneity in preferred orientation of nearby spines. Moreover, they reported that the spines that have a mitochondrion in the head or neck are larger in size and have stronger orientation selectivity. Therefore, they proposed that &quot;mitochondria are not necessarily positioned to support the energy needs of strong spines, but rather support the structurally and functionally diverse inputs.&quot;</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This paper attempted to address a fundamental question: whether the distribution of the mitochondria along the dendrites of visual cortical neurons is associated with the functions of the spines, postsynaptic sites of excitatory synapses. Two state of the art techniques (2 photon Ca imaging of somata and spines and EM reconstructions of cortical pyramidal neurons) had been used, which provides a great opportunity to examine and correlate the function of spine ultrastructure and spatial distribution of dendritic mitochondria.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Overall, the findings are interesting. However, the study lacks the data providing insights into either the mechanisms or the functional meaning of the pattern of mitochondrion distribution along the dendrites, which restricts the significance of the study. It also suffers from small correlation coefficients and small sample sizes (60-121 spines in 4 neurons) as well as missing some important analysis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Mitochondria in synapses are important to support functional needs, such as local protein translation and calcium buffering. Thus, they may be strategically localized to maximize functional efficiency. In this study, the authors examine whether a correlation exists between the positioning of mitochondria and the structure or function of dendritic spines in the visual cortex of a ferret. Unexpectedly, the authors found no correlation between structural measures of synaptic strength to mitochondria positioning, which may indicate that they are not localized only because of the local energy needs. Instead, the authors discover that mitochondria are positioned preferably in spines that display heterogeneous responses, showing that they are localized to support specific functional needs probably distinct from ATP output.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The thorough analysis provides a yet unprecedented insight into the correlation between synaptic tuning and mitochondrial positioning in the visual cortex in vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The study defined 1 Î¼m and 5 Î¼m as short and extended ranges relative to the synapse and examined the correlation between mitochondria volume and multiple parameters within that defined range. Results showed that mitochondria display preferences towards spines that respond differently to visual stimuli or areas with low local calcium activity. However, it is not known whether this mitochondria preference is a cause or a result of spine heterogeneity. It will be interesting to see the correlation of spine volume relative to mitochondrial positioning in 1Âµm and 5Âµm ranges around mitochondria.</p>
<p>Analysis of this study suggested that mitochondrial volume does not correlate with the structural measure of synaptic strength (e.g. spine volume and post-synaptic density (PSD) area). However, the authors did not examine whether mitochondrial volume correlates to synaptic transmission frequency or plasticity. It may still be possible that mitochondria are localized in positions that exhibit a high frequency of transmission or a high degree of plasticity. Future studies will have to determine the underlying cause of mitochondria positioning preference.</p>

<p>Summary: This is a careful examination of the distribution of mitochondria in the basal dendrites of ferret visual cortex in a previously published volume electron microscopy dataset. The authors report that mitochondria are sparsely, as opposed to continuously distributed in the dendritic shafts, and that they tend to cluster near dendritic spines with heterogeneous orientation selectivity.</p>
<p>Strengths: Volume EM is the gold standard for quantification of organelle morphology. An unusual strength of this particular dataset is that the orientation selectivity of the dendritic spines was measured by calcium imaging prior to EM reconstruction. This allowed the authors to assess how spines with varying selectivity are organized relative to mitochondria, leading to an intriguing observation that they localize to heterogeneous spine clusters. The analysis is carefully performed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: Using threshold distances between mitochondria and synapses as opposed to absolute distances may overlook important relationships in the data.</p>
