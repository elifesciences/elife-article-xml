<title>Abstract</title><p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive and fatal muscle degenerating disease caused by dystrophin deficiency. Effective methods for drug discovery for the treatment of DMD requires systems to be physiologically relevant, scalable, and effective. To this end, the Myoscreen platform offers a scalable and physiologically relevant system for generating and characterizing patient-derived myotubes. Morphological profiling is a powerful technique involving the simultaneous measurement of hundreds of morphological parameters from fluorescence microscopy images and using machine learning to predict cellular activity. Here, we describe combining the Myoscreen platform and high dimensional morphological profiling to accurately predict a phenotype associated with the lack of Dystrophin expression in patient derived myotubes. Using this methodology, we evaluated a series of Dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) candidates and identified that the combination of Utrophin and α- Sarcoglycan yielded highest morphological differences between DMD and non-DMD donors. Finally, we validated this methodology by knocking down Dystrophin expression in non-DMD cells as well as introducing Dystrophin expression in DMD cells. Knocking down Dystrophin in non- DMD cells shifted their morphological profile to one that is similar to DMD cells while introducing Dystrophin in DMD cells shifted their morphological profile towards non-DMD cells. In conclusion, we have developed a platform that accurately predicts the DMD disease phenotype in a disease relevant cell type. Ultimately this platform may have wide applications in the drug development process include identification of disease modifier genes, screening of novel therapeutic moieties, and as a potency assay for future therapeutics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Verhaart &amp; Aartsma-Rus, 2019</xref>). It is caused by mutations in <italic>DMD</italic>, a gene located on the X chromosome, spanning a genomic range of greater than 2 Mb, and encoding for dystrophin, a component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), which bridges the inner cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix; this is a disease that primarily affects boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dowling et al., 2021</xref>). Most pathogenic mutations result in a loss of mRNA stability or the introduction of a premature codon, ultimately resulting in the lack of Dystrophin.</p>
<p>The DAPC is a multi-component protein complex that resides within the cell membrane, or sarcolemma, of the myofiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Campbell &amp; Kahl, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ervasti et al., 1990</xref>). The DAPC has three main functions: (i) it shields the sarcolemma from stresses that occur during muscle contraction, (ii) it links the intracellular cytoskeletal scaffold to the extracellular matrix and participates in the transmission of force between the two compartments, and (iii) it functions as a scaffold for signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dowling et al., 2021</xref>). It is comprised of 11 main protein components including Dystrophin, α-Dystroglycan, β-Dystroglycan, α-Sarcoglycan, β-Sarcoglycan, γ- Sarcoglycan, δ-Sarcoglycan, Sarcospan, Syntrophin, Dystrobrevin, and Nitric Oxide Synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Duan et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Dystrophin interacts with the DAPC and the sarcolemma mainly through one of the DAPC components, β-Dystroglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ervasti &amp; Campbell, 1991</xref>) and this interaction stabilizes the complex and the sarcolemma and enables its proper function. Loss of Dystrophin due to pathogenic mutations results in significant changes in the expression and localization of both scaffolding and signaling proteins associated with the DAPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Allen et al., 2016</xref>); DAPC disassembly and loss of the interactions between the intracellular scaffold (F-Actin) and the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Duan et al., 2021</xref>). Ultimately this results in sarcolemma tearing upon muscle contraction, development of abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, long-term deficits in muscle regeneration, and tissue fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burr &amp; Molkentin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chan &amp; Head, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Petrof et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Schmalbruch, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Understanding the disease process and ultimately identifying targets that may function as modifiers within this process requires models that accurately capture key pathophysiological processes at the cellular level. Most of the research and discovery related to DMD has historically been pursued in the <italic>mdx</italic> mouse, an animal with a spontaneous dystrophin mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gerde &amp; Scholander, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Partridge, 2013</xref>). A significant limitation of the <italic>mdx</italic> model is that it presents with less severe disease process and does not closely recapitulate the human phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Partridge, 2013</xref>). The development of improved preclinical models that carry human disease-relevant mutations which are based on the formation of differentiated and functional human myofibers is key for enabling the discovery process. Additionally, it is essential that readouts developed within such a platform are reproducible in the context of a range of pathogenic mutations and allow for a robust assay window to reduce noise and enable the discovery of new targets with high confidence.</p>
<p>For discovery of high confidence targets for muscular dystrophy, it is important to develop physiologically relevant disease models that can accurately mimic in-vivo functionality. While 2D cell culture models are scalable, they do not recapitulate the myofiber morphology and functionality, making the system less valuable for target and drug discovery. Engineered micropatterned plates can provide the appropriate physical environment for myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Skeletal muscle cells differentiated in micropatterned plates form mature myotubes that are aligned and striated and express dystrophin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Young et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, micropatterned plates are ideal for target and drug screening owing to their physiological relevance for myotube formation and by enabling imaging with quantification of complex endpoints. Image based single cell morphological profiling has gained popularity over the past few years. With automated microscopy, a large set of images can be acquired in a very short time. Morphological profiling involves computing hundreds of single cell image features and using complex machine learning and/or deep learning models to uncover novel biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carpenter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dao et al., 2016</xref>). The high dimensional morphological profile can reveal enhanced information about the cellular perturbation compared to the biased single readout from images. Morphological profiling has been used in the past to identify the mechanism of action of test compounds as well as disease mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Scheeder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ziegler et al., 2021</xref>). Recently, unbiased morphological profiling has also been used for identifying signatures of disease phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Schiff et al., 2022</xref>) as well as to distinguish healthy and diseased populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Oppermann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Wali et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we describe the development and validation of a platform based on the implementation of primary human DMD patient and control (non-DMD) myoblasts which are induced to differentiate within a micropatterned substrate allowing for the highly reproducible formation of differentiated myotubes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by morphological profiling in differentiated myotubes, immunostained for Utrophin and α-Sarcoglycan, we can consistently distinguish the two populations (DMD vs. non-DMD) and provide evidence that this is attributed to the absence of dystrophin.</p>

<title>Characterizing primary donor cells for MyoScreen platform</title>
<p>We evaluated a set of human derived skeletal myoblasts for further studies based on three success criteria: (1) donors were selected based on sufficient availability of starting material with a minimum number of cryopreserved vials containing early passage (P0) myoblasts being set at n≥3. This is to ensure that a sufficient supply of cells is available for the entire experiment and to limit batch-to-batch variability, (2) donors were selected based on being male to ensure disease relevance phenotypes observed in DMD as the disease primarily affects boys and mitigate any effect on morphology based on sex, and (3) donors were selected based on their age (3-5 years) since the disease affects boys at a similar age. Patient donor cells that met the 3 criteria are included in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Further triaging was pursued for donors that met the three criteria with the goal of selecting 2 DMD and 2 non-DMD donors using a fusion index (&gt; 0.1) for DMD donors and expression of Dystrophin in non-DMD donors.</p>

<p>The process of donor-specific myoblast selection and cell expansion is illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. Briefly, myoblasts were isolated at a hospital setting from patients following the collection of a skeletal muscle biopsy. The cells were subsequently sorted using magnetic beads based on expression of CD56. CD56 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule – NCAM), is a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of skeletal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Walsh &amp; Ritter, 1981</xref>). Cell sorting was then implemented to quantify the proportion of myoblasts by quantifying Desmin positive cells (DES<sup>pos</sup>). Cell populations that were at least 25% DES<sup>pos</sup> were selected for further expansion. Patient cells obtained at the hospital were expanded and cryopreserved into master and working banks. Before creating a master or a working bank, cells were again characterized for Desmin expression. This was done to ensure that the freeze-thaw process did not alter the proportion of DES<sup>pos</sup> cells in the cryopreserved cell population. Cells from the working bank were subsequently used for all downstream experiments. In all, cells from 4 donors were selected with 2 coming from DMD patients and the other 2 coming from non-DMD individuals.</p>

Cells expanded following patient biopsy collection were subsequently enriched for myoblasts using flow cytometry (CD56<sup>+</sup>). Primary vials were sourced, thawed, and the proportion of Desmin<sup>+</sup> cells was determined using flow cytometry. Cells were expanded and cryopreserved into master banks (MB) at which point they were characterized using flow cytometry (Desmin<sup>+</sup> cells) and the MyoScreen platform (fusion index). Finally, master bank vials were thawed, expanded, and finally cryopreserved into working cell banks (WB) at which point they were characterized using flow cytometry (Desmin<sup>+</sup> cells) and the MyoScreen platform (fusion index). Cells were selected based on consistency in their doubling time, proportion of Desmin<sup>+</sup> cells and fusion index. <bold>(B)</bold> Myoblasts from the two non-DMD (Non- DMD #1, Non-DMD #3) and two DMD (DMD #1, DMD #4) donors were differentiated for 10 days in MyoScreen micropatterned plates.

</fig>
<p>For further characterization, the cells from the master bank were differentiated and stained for Myosin heavy chain (MHC) to identify myotubes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Cell images were then used to extract the myotube area (MHC-positive area), and nuclei count (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), which was used to compute the fusion index (See Methods). As expected, the fusion index for the DMD donors (DMD #1 and DMD #4) was significantly lower compared to non-DMD donors (Non-DMD #1 and Non-DMD #3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Meng et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Dystrophin expression was characterized by immunofluorescence (IF) and simple western blot (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D-1F</xref>). Nuclei and myotubes were identified using Hoechst and Troponin T respectively. The DMD donors have very low to no expression of Dystrophin compared to the non-DMD donors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Image based profiling of donor myotubes separates the donor population better than protein expression</title>
<p>Next, we sought to identify specific proteins that were differentially expressed between DMD and non-DMD myotubes. To this end, we screened for proteins associated with the Dystrophin Associated Protein Complex (DAPC). Myoblasts were seeded and differentiated within the Cytoo MyoScreen 96-well micropatterned plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bosch-Fortea et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Young et al., 2018</xref>). Selecting the platform allowed us to (i) implement a physiologically relevant system for myotube formation and (ii) achieve consistency in the differentiation of myotubes between the various donors.</p>
<p>To examine for potential differences between DMD and non-DMD myotubes we compared protein expression levels for several DAPC proteins using immunofluorescence (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure S2.1</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining against Troponin T was used to identify differentiated myotubes within individual micropatterns (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Cells were counterstained for the various DAPC components. Using image analysis, we determined the average pixel intensity for each myotube. The intensity was then computed for myotubes across each micropattern and each well. The sample average and standard deviation for each donor and DAPC protein were determined (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure S2.1</xref>). In the case of Utrophin, donor DMD #4 had significantly (p-value = 0.0021 (Non- DMD #1); p-value = 0.0001 (Non-DMD #3) higher Utrophin intensity compared to non-DMD donors (Non-DMD #1 and Non-DMD #3). However, this was not true for the DMD donor DMD #1. The variability in expression levels may be attributed to the differences in the severity of DMD in the donor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Janghra et al., 2016</xref>). We observed similar variability in expression levels for the other DAPC proteins (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure S2.1</xref>). Taken together, the expression levels of DAPC proteins did not display significant changes between the DMD and non-DMD donor population.</p>
<p>We speculated that even though we did not detect significant differences in DAPC protein expression levels using immunofluorescence, there may exist significant differences in the manner via which these proteins organize between the two cell populations (DMD vs. non-DMD). To this end, we implemented cell image-based profiling to further analyze the captured images. To quantify the ability of individual DAPC proteins to separate the two populations, we stained for each DAPC marker separately along with Troponin T and Hoechst stain on the MyoScreen platform. CellProfiler was used for segmentation of myotubes and extracting 235 features from individual myotubes pertaining to cell pixel intensity, pixel intensity distribution, texture, and granularity (See Methods). The extracted features were pre-processed and normalized. To avoid the effect of nuclear or Troponin T channel morphology, we restricted ourselves to features from the respective DAPC protein image.</p>
<p>To visualize the high dimensional data, we used t-SNE algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">van der Maaten &amp; Hinton, 2008</xref>). T-SNE is an embedding method which is designed to preserve the high dimensional intra- point distances in a low dimensional (2D) space. The t-SNE plots are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">supplemental Figure S2.2</xref>. Each t-SNE plot is derived from features based upon specific DAPC markers. The t-SNE plot reflects the ability for the individual DAPC markers to separate the donor cells of DMD (Red) and non-DMD (Green) populations. DAPC protein Utrophin and α-Sarcoglycan demonstrated improved separation between the two populations compared to the other DAPC markers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S2.2</xref>). Amongst all the DAPC proteins that were evaluated, Utrophin achieved the highest degree of separation visually.</p>

The left panel is derived using only the utrophin channel features while the right panel is derived using the α- Sarcoglycan features.

<graphic xlink:href="542079v1_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>To quantify the separation, we entered the DAPC image features to an SVM classifier and performed 10-fold cross validation. For performing cross-validation, the data was divided into 10 parts. 9 parts were used for training and 1 part was used for testing the accuracy of the model. The process was repeated 10 times with different parts of the data being used for either testing or training. Robust performance was determined by higher accuracy and lower dispersion in accuracy among the cross validation runs. The accuracy was computed via calculating the F-score (See methods). The F-score for Utrophin and α-Sarcoglycan is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>. We determined that the F-score for Utrophin was significantly higher when compared to that of α-Sarcoglycan. The F-score for other DAPC markers was lower when compared to that of Utrophin and α- Sarcoglycan.</p>
<p>We wanted to further evaluate whether the separation observed when using Utrophin and α- Sarcoglycan is independent of the MyoScreen platform. We plated DMD and non-DMD donor cells in a standard flat-bottom 96 microwell plate and used the morphological profiling to compare the result to cells plated in the MyoScreen platform. We observed that the MyoScreen platform combined with morphological profiling had a significantly higher F-score compared to cell plated in regular 96 microwell plates (<xref rid="figs2c" ref-type="fig">Supplemental figure S2.3</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our results indicate that use of morphological profiling in combination with the MyoScreen platform can yield higher separation between the DMD and non-DMD populations while using the DAPC proteins as a readout.</p>

<title>Combining DAPC markers yields better discrimination between DMD and non-DMD populations</title>
<p>DAPC proteins interact with each other on the cell membrane to ensure proper functioning in myotubes. In healthy myotubes, dystrophin interacts with actin (N-terminus) and the DAPC complex (C-terminus), which in turn interacts with laminin proteins in the extracellular space. The unique interaction of dystrophin with DAPC proteins renders structural integrity to myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bhat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gao &amp; McNally, 2015</xref>). Previously we examined individual DAPC proteins using morphological profiling. Here, we hypothesized that capturing these DAPC protein interactions would yield significantly better separation between DMD and non-DMD populations compared to individual proteins. This is based on the premise that it is the loss of dystrophin that disrupts the interaction of the multi-faceted DAPC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Duan et al., 2021</xref>). Quantifying the changes in the interaction could yield significantly improved separation between the populations.</p>
<p>Instead of pursuing all possible combinations, we restricted ourselves to testing two DAPC protein components at a time. Performing experiments with all possible interactions of two markers would result in 21 combinations. To prioritize DAPC combinations, we approached the problem in a data-driven manner. We first ranked the DAPC markers that demonstrate the highest degree of separation between the two populations. From that ranking we selected the top two markers against which we tested all other protein combinations. This resulted in Utrophin and α-Sarcoglycan as the two proteins with the highest F-score and low coefficient of variation. We evaluated the remaining DAPC proteins (Syntrophin, δ-Sarcoglycan, α- Dystroglycan, β-Dystroglycan) in combination with Utrophin or α-Sarcoglycan. For each of the combinations, we computed F-scores across 10-fold cross validation using individual markers alone as well as combined DAPC markers. As before, the F-score was computed by pooling the DMD donors as one class and the pooled non-DMD donors as another class. The F-scores for the combination of markers with utrophin is shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>. For almost all combinations, the combined marker dataset was better at separating the DMD and non-DMD population compared to an individual marker alone. Combining Utrophin and α-Sarcoglycan yielded the highest separation (F-Score .99). This is not surprising as Utrophin and α-Sarcoglycan individually were able to separate the two populations with greater than 0.9 F-score. Combination of other markers (δ-Sarcoglycan, α-Dystroglycan and β-Sarcoglycan) with Utrophin also yielded higher separation between the two populations, even though δ-Sarcoglycan, α-Dystroglycan and β- Sarcoglycan performed very poorly in separating the two populations individually. The t-SNE plot for the data from marker combination is shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>. We used shades of red to denote the DMD donor population while shades of green to denote the non-DMD donor population. As shown from the t-SNE plots, there is a clear separation between the red (DMD) and green (non- DMD) populations when using Utrophin as constant for the combination of DAPC protein. We also performed combination analysis with α-Sarcoglycan along with α-Dystroglycan, β- Sarcoglycan and δ-Sarcoglycan (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C-D</xref>). Unlike Utrophin, the combination of DAPC proteins with α-Sarcoglycan did not always yield significantly higher F-scores compared to the individual DAPC markers alone (compare red, blue and green boxes), implying that most of the combination effect is driven by α-Sarcoglycan. The median F-score for the combination with α- Sarcoglycan was also lower when compared to combination of DAPC proteins with Utrophin. In addition, we also tested combinations of δ-Sarcoglycan and α-Dystroglycan which also resulted in lower F-scores.</p>

<title>siRNA-mediated knock-down of Dystrophin in healthy donors shifts to a DMD like profile</title>
<p>We hypothesized that the differences detected when comparing DMD and non-DMD myotubes could be attributed to the lack of Dystrophin. Knocking down Dystrophin in non-DMD cells could normalize the differences between the two cell populations. To test this hypothesis, we transfected differentiating non-DMD cells with siRNAs targeting human Dystrophin and achieved a robust decrease (&gt; 75% knock down) in Dystrophin expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>We used non targeting siRNA (scrambled control) transfected in both DMD and non-DMD donors which were used as controls. We also separately transfected the non-DMD donor cells with anti- Dystrophin siRNA with the purpose of knocking down Dystrophin. The immunofluorescence was performed on Utrophin and α-Sarcoglycan, since this combination gave the best separation quantified by F-Score. As before, we used the features pertaining to Utrophin and α-Sarcoglycan images to determine the effects of Dystrophin knock down.</p>
<p>We quantified the ability of the classifier to accurately classify the different perturbations using F-Score by taking two perturbations at a time (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Treating the non-DMD donor cells with scrambled siRNA did not change the phenotype of these cells as evident from the low F-score values for 10-fold cross validation between scrambled and untreated conditions for the non-DMD donor cells (F-Score 0.8141, Data not shown). We derived a classification model based upon DMD and non-DMD scrambled controls and observed that the combination of Utrophin and α- Sarcoglycan was able to accurately classify the controls with an F-Score of .99 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, a classification model trained on anti-Dystrophin siRNA and the DMD scrambled population was also able to accurately separate the two populations with F-Score of 0.95.</p>
<p>We determined that the cell population treated with the anti-Dystrophin siRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, blue dots) is significantly closer in phenotype to the DMD cell population treated with the scrambled siRNA and further away from non-DMD scrambled siRNA phenotype as measured by the Euclidean distance in the feature space and t-SNE plots (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-D</xref>). This implies that Dystrophin knockdown in non-DMD cells renders a morphological phenotype that is different from non-DMD scrambled phenotype but closer to the DMD-scrambled phenotype.</p>
<p>To further validate that hypothesis that anti-Dystrophin siRNA treatment in non-DMD donors results in a phenotype similar to a DMD patient cell, we developed a classification model between the non-DMD and DMD scrambled controls and used this model to bin the anti-Dystrophin siRNA population (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Very few myotubes from the anti-Dystrophin siRNA were classified into the non-DMD scramble class (5.2% for Non-DMD #3 and 19.8% for Non-DMD #1) indicating that knocking down Dystrophin creates a morphological phenotype that looks like DMD cells.</p>
<p>Taken together, we have demonstrated that morphological profiling in combination with the MyoScreen platform can be used to quantify disease relevant DMD phenotypes.</p>

<title>Restoration of Dystrophin expression in DMD cells reverses the phenotype associated with the lack of Dystrophin</title>
<p>While knocking down Dystrophin expression in non-DMD cells resulted in a profile movement towards the DMD population, we also tested whether restoration of Dystrophin expression in DMD cells could rescue the observed phenotype.</p>
<p>We used (vivo-Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligonucleomer) vivo-PMO to induce exon skipping in donor cells with permissive mutations as a method of partially restoring dystrophin. Exon skipping is a mechanism that results in restoration of a partial dystrophin in DMD myotubes with certain exon deletions. This PMO induces the spliceosome to ignore a specific exon thereby restoring the reading frame of the Dystrophin gene. We identified DMD donor DMD #1 as the one that is amenable for exon skipping using PMO – exon 45 skipping (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Like our previous analysis, we selected to stain for Utrophin and α-Sarcoglycan and quantified the effects of expressing partial dystrophin using exon skipping. For controls, we introduced a non-targeting PMO in cells from DMD donor DMD #1 (control treated DMD). As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, the expression of Dystrophin is negligible in the DMD control cells when compared to non- DMD donor cells. Treatment with the vivo-PMO resulted in restoration of Dystrophin expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>
<p>We determined that the non-DMD and the non-targeting PMO control treated DMD population displayed a high degree of separation (.99 F-Score), while the DMD and non-targeting PMO control treated DMD showed a lower separation (.88 F-Score) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Thus, we can infer that a non-targeting PMO does not affect the DMD phenotype.</p>
<p>The DMD and the Exon 45 skipped DMD population displayed a high separation (∼.98 F-score). However, the separation between the Exon 45 skipped DMD and non-DMD population was also high (.95 F-Score). The t-SNE plot in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> highlights the separation between the three populations – non-targeting PMO-treated DMD, non-DMD and vivo-PMO-treated DMD. As evident from the t-SNE plot, the vivo-PMO-treated DMD cells displayed a different morphological signature when compared to DMD or non-DMD populations. The vivo-PMO treated DMD population shifts towards the non-DMD population, although not completely merging with it. Further evidence of the shift can be obtained from the population mean Euclidean distance to the non-targeting PMO-treated DMD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). This partial shift can be likely due to restoration of a Dystrophin gene sequence that isn’t quite full length, compared to the entire functional dystrophin sequence in the non-DMD population. We built an SVM classifier based on non-DMD and DMD donor population morphological profile and classified individual cells from the Exon 45 skipping DMD population. We determined that 41.3% of the vivo-PMO treated DMD population was classified as non-DMD myotubes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, the results demonstrate the ability of the MyoScreen platform to quantify subtle functional differences between the different DMD populations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we demonstrate the impact that can be achieved by combining the MyoScreen platform with high-dimensional morphological profiling to enable screening for pathways and targets involved in muscular dystrophy cells with phenotypes established in vitro using physiological systems. Using classical machine learning, we were able to distinguish the DMD and non-DMD populations. Due to the multi-nucleated nature of myofibers, it is difficult to achieve single cell resolution due to challenges in image segmentation. This challenge was overcome using the MyoScreen platform which allowed an analysis of individual islands of cells as one data point, giving us physiological relevance at near single cell resolution.</p>
<p>Previously, several publications have identified Utrophin as a primary target for treating DMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Loro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Soblechero-Martin et al., 2021</xref>). This is based on the finding that Utrophin is upregulated in DMD patients’ skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kleopa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Taylor et al., 1997</xref>). While we observed higher Utrophin expression from one donor (DMD #4) compared to the non-DMD donor cells, this was not found to be consistent across all the DMD donor cells. One possibility for this discrepancy could be due to a biased selection of donors. Our selection process involved donor cells that could be frozen and passaged over time. Despite this discrepancy we also observed Utrophin to be highly relevant in distinguishing the donor populations using morphological profiling. We hypothesize that beyond changes in expression, morphological profiling detected changes in localization of Utrophin within the myofibers between the DMD and non-DMD populations. Beyond Utrophin, we evaluated 6 other proteins in the DAPC and identified Utrophin (Median Cross Validation F-Score: .98) and α-Sarcoglycan (Median Cross Validation F-Score: .92) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> and Supplementary S2.2) to be the top two DAPC proteins when trying to distinguish DMD and non-DMD populations, which is in agreement with previous cell genetic models for DMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Soblechero-Martin et al., 2021</xref>). Our method of data analysis not only identified disease relevant proteins/biomarkers but can also rank them based on relevance.</p>
<p>We further used the same method to rank combinations of DAPC proteins as signatures of dystrophic disease. The combination with utrophin for all the different DAPC proteins yielded higher F-scores compared to individual proteins. However, this was not the case with combining DAPC proteins with α-Sarcoglycan, implying less synergy for marker combination with α- Sarcoglycan. One hypothesis for this observation could be due to the location of these proteins in or near sarcolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gawor &amp; Proszynski, 2018</xref>) and limitations of microscopy resolution. While the sarcoglycans and dystroglycans are all embedded within the membrane (sarcolemma), Utrophin is localized within the cell near the sarcolemma. As a result, morphological profiling can capture the interaction of Utrophin with sarcoglycans.</p>
<p>We validated our ability to distinguish disease phenotype using two different approaches: (i) By Dystrophin knock down using siRNA in non-DMD donors, and (ii) By introducing Dystrophin in DMD donors by exon skipping (Exon 45).</p>
<p>In the first case, knocking down Dystrophin in non-DMD donor cells yielded a phenotype that is more similar to that of DMD. We observed variations in classification results amongst the donors following siRNA-based knockdown of Dystrophin (94.8% for Non-DMD #3 and 80.2% for Non- DMD #1 DMD like for siRNA dystrophin KD) <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>. This difference can be attributed to donor- to-donor variability even among seemingly “healthy” (non-DMD) donor populations as well as variable efficiency of Dystrophin knock down.</p>
<p>In the second case, we used a DMD donor amenable to exon 45 skipping (DMD #1) and observed that morphological profiling can rescue disease phenotype to a great extent (41.3% as non-DMD for exon 45 skipping treated DMD donor). This result can be explained by the fact that the classification model is binary and requires data to be binned in one of the classes. As shown previously in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref> B-D, the exon 45-skipped population (treated with vivo-PMO) is different from the DMD and the non-DMD population. A binary classification model will not be able to capture this unique population precisely. We can further attribute the observation can be further attributed to the partial restoration of Dystrophin expression (43% dystrophin expression by fluorescence intensity). While the classification percentage is not as high as KD with siRNA, we observe this to be significantly higher compared to the classification of DMD as non-DMD phenotype (0% DMD classified as non-DMD).</p>
<p>Overall, we have demonstrated that the MyoScreen platform together with high dimensional cell profiling enables rapid identification of perturbagens relevant to muscular dystrophy phenotype and could be easily adapted to large scale drug discovery screening.</p>

Then, an image clean-up step was performed on the myotubes images to remove myotubes that touch the border of the image.

<p>The first features extracted are the first-order statistics which are calculated from the image histograms. The common features used and proposed are among others: mean, variance, range, intensity on the edge of the ROI, quantile values. These features are extracted from both Cy3 and Alexa 488 channels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4l">
<title>Granularity features</title>
<p>This set of features is produced by a series of openings of the original image with structuring elements of increasing size. At each step, the volume of the open image is calculated as the sum of all pixels in the ROI. The difference in volume between the successive steps of opening is the granular spectrum. The distribution is normalized to the total volume (integrated intensity) of the ROI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4m">
<title>Texture features</title>
<p>Texture features measure the degree and nature of textures within the myotubes to quantify their roughness and smoothness. This set of features measures information regarding the spatial distribution of the various channel intensity levels. A region of interest without much texture has a smooth appearance; a region of interest with a lot of texture will appear rough and show a wide variety of pixel intensities. To calculate this set of features we used Haralick texture features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Haralick et al., 1973</xref>)that are derived from the co-occurrence matrix. The matrix contains information about the correlation of intensity between one pixel and the one placed n-pixel further.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4n">
<title>Intensity distribution features</title>
<p>This feature set measures the spatial distribution of intensities within each object. Given an image with identified ROI, this set of features measures the intensity distribution from each object’s center to its boundary within a set of rings. The distribution is measured from the center of the object, where the center is defined as the point farthest from any edge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4o">
<title>Profile generation</title>
<p>The generated datasets are standardized and balanced to have approximately the same number of ROI in non-DMD and DMD cells categories. The datasets used for the training of the model are composed solely of the control conditions and contain the set of detected myotubes with its extracted features.</p>
<p>The evaluation metric used to predict model’s efficacy to predict the category of a myotube is the F-score. The F-score is a measure that evaluates the model’s accuracy and is defined as: <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="542079v1_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> where TP = True Positive, FN = False Negative and FP = False Positive values.</p>
<p>A F-score of 1 depicts a perfect classification: the two categories, non-DMD and DMD, are completely distinguishable. A F-score below 0.9 is considered to be low and not allowing a good separation between the non-DMD and DMD phenotypes.</p>
<p>The evaluation of the model is performed 10 times over the dataset which is randomly split each time in 90% used for the training of the model and 10% that is used to test the model’s accuracy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4p">
<title>Machine learning algorithms</title>
<p>We chose the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to distinguish myotubes coming from non-DMD and DMD categories. In the SVM algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cortes &amp; Vapnik, 1995</xref>), each data item is plotted in the n-dimensional space of the features (n being the number of features extracted for each segmented ROI) and it aims at obtaining a hyperplane that will optimally separate the items from the two non-DMD and DMD categories.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4q">
<title>% Of non-DMD like myotubes readout definition</title>
<p>The % of non-DMD like myotubes is defined as the percentage of myotubes out of the total that are predicted to have a non-DMD phenotype by the model. The predictions are generated on the datasets that do not belong to the training set and the output for each myotube is a probability between 0 and 1 of belonging to one class or the other. If the probability for one myotube is below 0.5, we consider that this myotube belongs to one category while if it is higher or equal than 0.5 we consider that it belongs to the other category.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4r">
<title>Data visualization</title>
<p>The representation of a myotube features dataset is done using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) dimensionality reduction method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">van der Maaten &amp; Hinton, 2008</xref>). The data in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>, 4, 5 is represented using the t-SNE method for visualization of high- dimensional features in a 2D space.</p>

<p>In this report, Hariharan and colleagues describe a protocol based on machine learning to differentiate wild type and DMD myofibers differentiated on a micropattern. They use images generated by immunofluorescence against the proteins of the DAPC complex, (which is disrupted in absence of dystrophin) to train a classifier to recognize healthy and diseased myofibers. They show that combining images generated with utrophin and alpha-sarcoglycan provide the most effective discrimination. They then validate the approach by applying their pipeline to wild type cells treated with DMD siRNA to mimic the DMD mutation or with antisense oligonucleotides to restore the DMD coding frame by exon skipping. They show that their strategy groups the siRNA treated myofibers with the DMD ones efficiently. Grouping of the oligonucleotide treated DMD myofibers with the healthy also works but is less efficient.</p>
<p>Overall the work is well done and I don't have any significant technical critique. I found this highly technical study interesting for a specialized audience.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors have developed a Myoscreen platform, which is a scalable and physiologically relevant system for generating and characterizing patient-derived myotubes. The platform can be used to accurately predict the DMD disease phenotype in a disease-relevant cell type and has wide applications in the drug development process.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The Myoscreen platform is scalable, meaning that it can be used to generate and characterize a large number of patient-derived myotubes. This is important for drug discovery, as it allows researchers to test a wider range of potential treatments. The Myoscreen platform also uses a physiologically relevant system for generating and characterizing myotubes. This means that the results obtained from the platform are more likely to be relevant to the human disease. This compared for example to using C2C12 myotubes. The Myoscreen platform has been shown to be effective in predicting the DMD disease phenotype. This means that it can be used to identify potential treatments that are likely to be effective in patients with DMD.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The study has several limitations. The method and material section could be improved. The authors rely heavily on UMAP to identify differences between non-DMD and DMD donor myotubes. They do not validate their findings using pharmacological small drugs. Additionally, the biological replicates used are extremely low, which raises concerns about the reproducibility of the findings.</p>

<p>Summary: Hariharan et al. establish an analysis pipeline using automated microscopy to detect features identified by morphological profiling from images of common dystrophin complex proteins present in differentiated diseased and unaffected human myoblasts. Ultimately, using a machine learning algorithm to generate high dimensional phenotypes, the authors can distinguish Duchenne patient myotubes from unaffected patient controls based on the morphological features of several Dystrophin complex proteins. Initially analyzed on their own or in pairs the authors identify an optimal combination of Utrophin and a-sarcoglycan and subsequently test their ability to distinguish perturbations of Dystrophin either by knock down (siRNA) in unaffected controls or following treatment with a splicing modifier, vivo-phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleomer (vivo-PMO) to ameliorate the DMD phenotype. It is unclear whether this methodology will see widespread adoption due to the combination of unique methods (micro-patterned plates and machine learning based image analysis) combined with a lack of detail on the specific features responsible for supporting the high dimensional phenotypes generated using their machine learning algorithm.</p>
<p>Strengths: The overall concept of this paper is interesting in that subtle morphological phenotypes, not readily observable by the eye, exhibited by dystrophin complex associated proteins can distinguish DMD samples from unaffected controls. It is interesting In Fig. 3B to see Utrophin and a-Sarcoglycan distinguish DMD and non-DMD lines from each other. This finding is the core of the paper and yet little information on how or why this is detected by image analysis is presented. An argument could be made that Combinations 1-7 all &quot;work&quot; to a certain degree at segregating DMD from non-DMD lines. This finding is exciting and has broad applicability both within and beyond the muscle field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: Significantly more detail on the 235 features that are identified would greatly benefit the paper. What are the most critical features that give rise to high F-Scores for Utrophin and a-Sarcoglycan? What do the image masks display for the top ~10 features (or 5)? In Fig. 3B what metric(s) is critical in this segregation? What is the effect on the dimensional display if PCA is conducted as opposed to a tSNE?</p>
<p>Biological replicates are lacking to draw conclusions upon. Non-DMD #4 is present in certain figures and absent from others. With 2 replicates (non-DMD) and 2 replicates (DMD) it is difficult to draw statistical conclusions on the data. Non-DMD #4 is identified as a poor line (37% Desmin compared to the other lines being &gt;88%) in Table 1. If this line is a poor line please remove it from the data analysis.</p>
<p>It is not appropriate to calculate Euclidan distance based on tSNE plots. PCA, MDS or UMAP are the appropriate high dimensional visual representations that allow for Euclidian distance calculations. This brings into question the validity of Fig. 4D and Fig. 5D. The link below outlines the limitations of tSNE plots. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/">https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/</ext-link></p>
<p>It is unclear why treatment (siRNA) results in a statistically significant F-score (&gt;0.9) when comparing non-DMD samples treated with siRNA against Dystrophin with DMD samples. Given that the siRNA knock-down appears to be quite robust this was unexpected and brings into question whether Dystrophin protein is the primary driver for the high dimensional phenotypes observed.</p>
