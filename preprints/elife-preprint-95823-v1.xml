<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Longitudinal neuroimaging studies offer valuable insight into intricate dynamics of brain development, ageing, and disease progression over time. However, prevailing analytical approaches rooted in our understanding of population variation are primarily tailored for cross-sectional studies. To fully harness the potential of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we have to develop and refine methodologies that are adapted to longitudinal designs, considering the complex interplay between population variation and individual dynamics.</p><p>We build on normative modelling framework, which enables the evaluation of an individual’s position compared to a population standard. We extend this framework to evaluate an individual’s <italic>change</italic> compared to standard dynamics. Thus, we exploit the existing normative models pre-trained on over 58,000 individuals and adapt the framework so that they can also be used in the evaluation of longitudinal studies. Specifically, we introduce a quantitative metric termed <italic>“z-diff”</italic> score, which serves as an indicator of change of an individual compared to a population standard. Notably, our framework offers advantages such as flexibility in dataset size and ease of implementation.</p><p>To illustrate our approach, we applied it to a longitudinal dataset of 98 patients diagnosed with early-stage schizophrenia who underwent MRI examinations shortly after diagnosis and one year later.</p><p>Compared to cross-sectional analyses, which showed global thinning of grey matter at the first visit, our method revealed a significant normalisation of grey matter thickness in the frontal lobe over time. Furthermore, this result was not observed when using more traditional methods of longitudinal analysis, making our approach more sensitive to temporal changes.</p><p>Overall, our framework presents a flexible and effective methodology for analysing longitudinal neuroimaging data, providing insights into the progression of a disease that would otherwise be missed when using more traditional approaches.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Longitudinal neuroimaging studies provide a unique opportunity to gain insight into the temporal dynamics of a disease, over and above the insights offered by crosssectional studies. Efforts related to the acquisition of these datasets are non-trivial and require substantial time and funding while accounting for problems inherent to longitudinal studies such as the dropout of subjects between time points, standardisation over multiple clinical centres, and changes in imaging technology over time. Considering this challenging task, it is of great consequence to have tools to effectively analyse them whilst also making use of more widely available cross-sectional data to refine inferences.</p>
<p>Despite the significance of longitudinal data analysis and the need for appropriate tools, there is a notable shortage of suitable methods and their development lacks behind. Even though recent advances in the acquisition and publication of large neuroimaging datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] have significantly improved our understanding of population variation, the developed methodologies are largely focused on the cross-sectional nature of the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Indeed, these methods are essential for characterising an individual’s position in a population; however, the vital factor of longitudinal change is largely neglected. Consequently, efforts should be made to tailor the standing methods modelling population variation for a longitudinal context to advance our understanding of disease progression. This endeavour would create an alternative to the widely used mixed-effect models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], which may suffer from poor out-of-sample prediction and struggle with accommodating non-linear lifespan trajectories.</p>
<p>Among the promising cross-sectional techniques for modelling population variation, which emerged in recent years, is normative modelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. This framework models each image-derived phenotype (IDP) (i.e., voxel intensity, regional average, or regional volume) independently as a function of clinical variables (e.g., age, sex, scanning site) in a large healthy population. Subjects are subsequently compared to the healthy population, which enables us to evaluate the position of each individual, rather than just compare group differences between patients and controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Application of these models has already provided valuable insights into the individual neuroanatomy of various diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, autism, and other neurological and mental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Longitudinal studies are conceptually well suited for normative modelling since they analyse individual trajectories over time. If adjusted appropriately, normative models could not only improve predictive accuracy but also identify patterns of change, thereby enhancing our understanding of the disease. In contrast to traditional statistical methods that estimate the average change in the group, normative models could estimate individual deviations from healthy trajectories. This comprehensive approach would take into account both population heterogeneity and confounders, thus providing a more nuanced understanding of change over time.</p>
<p>Normative modelling is a relatively new area of research and thus, despite its potential, longitudinal normative models have not been systematically explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Indeed, virtually all large-scale normative models released to date are estimated on cross-sectional data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] and a recent report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] has provided empirical data to suggest that such cross-sectional models may underestimate the variance in longitudinal data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. However, from a theoretical perspective, it is very important to recognise that cross-sectional models describe group-level population variation across the lifespan, where such group level centiles are interpolated smoothly across time. It is well-known in the pediatric growth-charting literature (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]) that centiles in such cross-sectional models do not necessarily correspond to individual level trajectories, rather it is possible that individuals cross multiple centiles as they proceed through development, even in the absence of pathology. Crucially, classical growth charts, and current normative brain charts provide no information about how frequent such centile crossings are in general. In other words, they provide a <italic>trajectory of distributions</italic>, <bold>not</bold> a <italic>distribution over trajectories</italic>. There are different approaches to tackle this problem in the growth charting literature, including the estimation of ‘thrive lines’ that map centiles of constant velocity across the lifespan and can be used to declare ‘failure to thrive’ at the individual level (see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] for details). Unfortunately, this approach requires densely sampled longitudinal neuroimaging data to estimate growth velocity, that are not available across the human lifespan at present. Therefore, in this work, we adopt a different approach based on estimates of the uncertainty in the centile estimates themselves together with the uncertainty with which a point is measured (e.g. bounded by the test-retest reliability, noise etc.). By accounting for such variability, this provides a statistic to determine whether a centile crossing is large enough to be statistically different from the base level within the population.</p>
<p>We stress that our aim is not to build a longitudinal normative model <italic>per se</italic>. Considering the much greater availability of cross-sectional data relative to longitudinal data, we instead leverage existing models constructed from densely sampled cross-sectional populations and provide methods for applying these to longitudinal cohorts. We argue that although these models lack explicit intra-subject dynamics, they contain sufficient information to enable precise assessments of changes over time. Nevertheless, the inclusion of longitudinal data into existing models largely estimated from cross-sectional data is also an important goal and can be approached with hierarchical models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]; however, we do not tackle this problem here.</p>
<p>Our approach requires (i) a probabilistic framework to coherently manage uncertainty and (ii) cross-sectional models estimated on large reference cohort to accurately estimate population centiles. To this end, we utilise the Warped Bayesian Linear Regression normative model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] as a basis for our work. Training these models requires significant amounts of data and computational resources, limiting their use for smaller research groups. However, the availability of pre-trained models has made them more accessible to researchers from a wider range of backgrounds, as reported by Rutherford et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, in this work, we propose a framework for using pre-trained normative models derived from cross-sectional data to evaluate longitudinal studies. We briefly present the existing model and derive a novel set of difference (“<italic>z-diff</italic>”) scores for statistical evaluation of change between measurements. We then describe its implementation and showcase its practical application to an in-house longitudinal dataset of 98 patients in the early stages of schizophrenia who underwent fMRI examinations shortly after being diagnosed and one year after.</p>

<title>Original model for cross-sectional data</title>
<p>Here, we briefly present the original normative model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], developed to be trained and used on cross-sectional data. In the following subsection, we take this model pre-trained on a large cross-sectional database, and extend it so that it can be used on longitudinal data.</p>
<p>The original model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] is pre-trained on a cross-sectional database <bold>Y</bold> = (<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>nd</italic></sub>) <italic>∈</italic> ℝ <sup><italic>N ×D</italic></sup>, <bold>X</bold> = (<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>nm</italic></sub>) <italic>∈</italic> ℝ <sup><italic>N ×M</italic></sup> of <italic>N</italic> subjects, for whom we observe <italic>D</italic> IDPs and <italic>M</italic> covariates (e.g., age or sex). Thus, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>nd</italic></sub> is the <italic>d</italic>-th IDP of the <italic>n</italic>-th subject and <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>nm</italic></sub> is the <italic>m</italic>-th covariate of the <italic>n</italic>-th subject.</p>
<p>Since each IDP is treated separately, we focus on a fixed IDP <italic>d</italic> and drop this index for ease of exposition. To simplify notation, we denote <bold>y</bold> = (<italic>y</italic><sub>1</sub>, …, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub>) <sup><italic>T</italic></sup> the column of observations of this fixed IDP across subjects. The observations are assumed to be independent (across <italic>n</italic>). To model the relationship between IDP <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> and covariates <bold>x</bold><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> = (<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>n</italic>1</sub>, …, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>nM</italic></sub>) <sup><italic>T</italic></sup>, we want to exploit a normal linear regression model. However, we make a couple of adjustments first:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To accommodate non-Gaussian errors in the original space of dependent variables, we transform the original variable <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> by a warping function <italic>φ;</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>), which is parametrised by hyper-parameters <bold><italic>γ</italic></bold> (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] for technical details).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To capture non-linear relationships, we use a common B-spline basis expansion of the original independent variables <bold>x</bold><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] for technical details). To accommodate site-level effects, we append it with site dummies. We denote the resulting transformation of <bold>x</bold><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> <italic>ϕ</italic>(<bold>x</bold><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>) <italic>∈</italic> ℝ<sup><italic>K</italic></sup>.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We also treat the precision of measurements as a hyper-parameter and we denote it by <italic>β</italic>. Thus, we model the distribution of the transformed IDP <italic>φ</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>) conditional on covariates <bold>x</bold><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>, vector of parameters <bold>w</bold>, and hyper-parameters <italic>β</italic> and <bold><italic>γ</italic></bold> as
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="544217v3_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
We write this as
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="544217v3_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>ε</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> are independent from <bold>x</bold><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> and across <italic>n</italic>. In practical terms, <italic>ε</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> represents the deviation of subject <italic>n</italic> from the population mean, together with the measurement error. We further denote <bold>Λ</bold><sub><italic>β</italic></sub> = <italic>β</italic><bold>I</bold> <italic>∈</italic> ℝ <sup><italic>N ×N</italic></sup> and the design matrix <bold>Φ</bold> = (<italic>ϕ</italic>(<bold>x</bold><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>)<sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) <italic>∈</italic> ℝ <sup><italic>N ×K</italic></sup> (<italic>ϕ</italic>(<bold>x</bold><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>)<sub><italic>k</italic></sub> is the <italic>k</italic>-the element of vector <italic>ϕ</italic>(<bold>x</bold><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>)).</p>
<p>The estimation of parameters <bold>w</bold> is performed by empirical Bayesian methods. In particular, prior about <bold>w</bold>
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="544217v3_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
is combined with the likelihood function to derive the posterior

<graphic xlink:href="544217v3_eqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn5">

</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="544217v3_eqn6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The hyper-parameters <italic>α, β</italic>, <bold><italic>γ</italic></bold> are estimated by maximising the warped marginal loglikelihood.</p>
<p>The predictive distribution of <italic>φ</italic>(<italic>y</italic>) for a subject with <bold>x</bold> is
<disp-formula id="eqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="544217v3_eqn7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Hence, the <italic>z</italic>-score characterising the position of this subject within population is
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="544217v3_eqn8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>φ</italic>(<italic>y</italic>) is the realised warped observation of IDP <italic>d</italic> for this subject.</p>
<p>Note that formulae (7) and (8) implicitly evaluate only (potentially new) subjects measured at sites already present in the original database <bold>y, Φ</bold>. If we want to evaluate subjects measured at a new site, we will have to run an adaptation procedure to account for its effect. This adaptation procedure is described and readily accessible online in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. In short, a sample of a reference (healthy) cohort measured on the same scanner as the population of interest is needed to accommodate a site-specific effect.</p>
<p>In the following section, we develop a procedure that allows to extend the original cross-sectional framework pre-trained on database <bold>y, Φ</bold> to evaluate a new longitudinal dataset for assessment of changes in regional brain thickness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2a2">
<label>2.1.2</label>
<title>Adaptation to longitudinal data</title>
<p>We aim to adapt the original framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] in order to leverage its parameters pretrained on a large cross-sectional database <bold>y, Φ</bold>. We design a score for a change between visits (further referred to as <italic>z-diff</italic> score), based on which we can detect unusual changes in regional brain thickness. In other words, we extend the existing cross-sectional normative modelling framework to be useful in the evaluation of longitudinal data.</p>
<p>To utilise the normative model of the healthy population pre-trained on crosssectional data in the longitudinal setup, we have to make an assumption about the trajectory of healthy controls. The natural first assumption is that a <italic>healthy</italic> subject does not deviate substantially from their position within the population as time progresses, so the observed position changes between the visits of a healthy subject are assumed to stem from observation noise (due to technical or physiological factors) and are therefore constrained by the test-retest reliability of the measurement. Note that this does not imply that a healthy subject does not change over time, but rather that the change follows approximately the centile of distribution at which the individual is placed. We acknowledge that this is a relatively strong assumption, but it is reasonable to assume that a <italic>healthy</italic> subject’s brain activity or structure will remain relatively stable over short time periods (years, but not necessarily decades), and any significant changes in the pattern compared to the normative reference database may indicate disease progression or response to intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Also, it is very important to recognise that this model does not constrain a given subject to follow a population-level centile trajectory exactly because the model includes an error component (later denoted <italic>ξ</italic><sup>(<italic>i</italic>)</sup>) that allows for individual-level deviations from the population centile.</p>
<p>We connect to the cross-sectional model by invoking the above assumption through reinterpretation of the error term <italic>ε ∼ 𝒩</italic> (0, <italic>β</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>). In particular, we decompose it to a subject-specific factor <italic>η</italic> and a measurement error <italic>ξ</italic><sup>(<italic>i</italic>)</sup> in the <italic>i</italic>-th visit. While <italic>η</italic> is considered constant across the visits (of a healthy cohort subject) and captures the subject’s position within the population, <italic>ξ</italic><sup>(<italic>i</italic>)</sup> is specific for the <italic>i</italic>-th visit and captures a combination of movement, acquisition, processing noise, etc. Hence, the model for the <italic>i</italic>-th visit of a subject with given covariates <bold>x</bold><sup>(<italic>i</italic>)</sup> is

Note that we dropped the subject-specific index <italic>n</italic> used in (1). This should force the reader to distinguish between the data used for training the original model and a new set of longitudinal data, in which we want to evaluate the longitudinal change of subjects.</p>
<p>In our longitudinal data, we are interested in the change for a given individual across two visits. According to model (9), the difference in the transformed IDP between visits 1 and 2, <italic>φ</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sup>(2)</sup>) <italic>− φ</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sup>(1)</sup>), for a subject with covariates <bold>x</bold><sup>(1)</sup> and <bold>x</bold><sup>(2)</sup> is given by

<graphic xlink:href="544217v3_eqn10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
With <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="544217v3_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. We use the posterior distribution of <bold>w</bold> with hyperparameters <italic>α, β</italic>, <bold><italic>γ</italic></bold> estimated on the original cross-sectional database <bold>y, Φ</bold> (the estimates are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/predictive-clinical-neuroscience/braincharts">https://github.com/predictive-clinical-neuroscience/braincharts</ext-link>). Therefore, the posterior predictive distribution for the difference <italic>φ</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sup>(2)</sup>) <italic>− φ</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sup>(1)</sup>) for our subject is (for more detailed derivation, please refer to the supplement)
<disp-formula id="eqn11">
<graphic xlink:href="544217v3_eqn11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Hence, the <italic>z</italic>-score for the difference in the transformed IDP between visits 1 and 2 is
<disp-formula id="eqn12">
<graphic xlink:href="544217v3_eqn12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>φ</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sup>(2)</sup>)<italic>−φ</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sup>(1)</sup>) is the realised change in the warped observations of the IDP for this subject. Since this <italic>z-diff</italic> score is standard normal for the population of healthy controls, any large deviations may be used to detect suspicious changes.</p>
<p>The primary role of adaptation of the pre-trained cross-sectional model to longitudinal data is to account for the measurement noise variance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="544217v3_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. From the posterior predictive distribution (11), we have (denoting the set of conditionals Ω = <italic>{</italic><bold>x</bold><sup>(1)</sup>, <bold>x</bold><sup>(2)</sup>; <bold>y, Φ</bold>; <italic>α, β</italic>, <bold><italic>γ</italic></bold><italic>}</italic>)
<disp-formula id="eqn13">
<graphic xlink:href="544217v3_eqn13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Hence, by the Law of Iterated Expectations (to integrate out <bold>x</bold><sup>(1)</sup> and <bold>x</bold><sup>(2)</sup>), we obtain
<disp-formula id="eqn14">
<graphic xlink:href="544217v3_eqn14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Therefore, we estimate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="544217v3_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> by the sample analogue of the left-hand side in (14).</p>
<p>Specifically, we devote a subsample <italic>C</italic> of our controls to adaptation and we compute
<disp-formula id="eqn15">
<graphic xlink:href="544217v3_eqn15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Moreover, another useful feature of longitudinal data is that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="544217v3_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is negligible (especially with stable covariates, like sex and age). Sex (typically) does not change across the two visits and age relatively little (in our target application) with respect to the full span of ageing. Consequently, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="544217v3_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> in (15) is negligible in adult cohorts but must be treated with caution in developmental or aging groups. Finally, it is apparent from (5) that <bold>A</bold> scales with the number of subjects, and its inverse will be negligible for substantial training datasets, such as the one that was used for pre-training.</p>
<p>To conclude this subsection, we caution against the use of a naive difference of <italic>z</italic>-scores (instead of <italic>z-diff</italic>) to evaluate the longitudinal change. The problem with such an approach is apparent from (8): it does not properly account for the model uncertainty (the sandwich part with <italic>A</italic>), and even if the model uncertainty is negligible, it does not properly scale the difference of “residuals” because it ignores the common source of subject-level variability <italic>η</italic>.</p>

<title>Early stages of schizophrenia patients</title>
<p>The clinical data used for the analysis were part of the Early Stages of Schizophrenia study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. We analysed data from 98 patients in the early stages of schizophrenia (38 females) and 67 controls (42 females) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The inclusion criteria were as follows: The subjects were over 18 years of age and undergoing their first psychiatric hospitalisation. They were diagnosed with schizophrenia; or acute and transient psychotic disorders; and suffered from untreated psychosis for less than 24 months. Patients were medically treated upon admission, based on the recommendation of their physician. Patients suffering from psychotic mood disorders were excluded from the study.</p>

<p>Healthy controls over 18 years of age were recruited through advertisements unless: They had a personal history of any psychiatric disorder or had a positive family history of psychotic disorders in first- or second-degree relatives.</p>
<p>If a subject in either group (patient or control) had a history of neurological or cerebrovascular disorders or any MRI contraindications, they were excluded from the study.</p>
<p>The study was carried out in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study design was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Board. Each participant received a complete description of the study and provided written informed consent.</p>
<p>Data were acquired at the National Centre of Mental Health in Klecany, Czech Republic. The data were acquired at the National Institute of Mental Health using Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma 3T. The acquisition parameters of T1-weighted images using MPRAGE sequence were: 240 scans; slice thickness: 0.7 mm; repetition time: 2,400 ms; echo time: 2,34 ms; inversion time: 1000 ms; flip angle: 8°, and acquisition matrix: 320 mm × 320 mm.</p>

<title>Preprocessing and Analysis</title>
<p>Prior to normative modelling, all T1 images were preprocessed using the Freesurfer v.(7.2) recon-all pipeline. While in the context of longitudinal analysis the longitudinal Freesurfer preprocessing pipeline is appropriate, we additionally performed cross-sectional preprocessing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. The reason to conduct this analysis is threefold:</p>
<p>First, the impact of preprocessing on the <italic>z</italic>-scores of normative models lacks prior investigation. Second, the training database of 58,000 subjects initially underwent cross-sectional preprocessing, introducing a methodological incongruity. Third, certain large-scale studies, constrained by computational resources, exclusively employ cross-sectional preprocessing. Understanding the consistency of results between the two approaches becomes crucial in such cases.</p>
<p>In line with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], we performed a simple quality control procedure whereby all subjects having a rescaled Euler number greater than ten were labelled outliers and were not included in the analysis (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] for further details).</p>
<p>After preprocessing, patient data were projected into the adapted normative model (median Rho across all IDP was 0.3 and 0.26 for the first and the second visit, respectively—see <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>). The pre-trained model used for adaptation was the <monospace>lifespan_58K_82_sites</monospace> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. For each subject and visit, we obtained cross-sectional <italic>z</italic>-score, as well as the underlying values needed for its computation, particularly <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="544217v3_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the original <italic>z</italic>-scores to evaluate each measurement independently. We then tested for the difference in variance of the difference of the cross-sectional <italic>z</italic>-scores <italic>z</italic><sup>(2)</sup> <italic>− z</italic><sup>(1)</sup> in held-out controls using Mann-Whitney U testand corrected for multiple tests using the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction at the 5% level of significance.</p>
<p>Subsequently, following (12), we derived the <italic>z-diff</italic> scores of change between visits. We conducted two analyses: one to investigate the group-level effect, and another to link the <italic>z-diff</italic> to the changes in clinical scales.</p>
<p>At a group-level, we identified regions with <italic>z-diff</italic> scores significantly different from zero using the Wilcoxon test, accounting for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction.</p>
<p>Additionally, we performed a more traditional longitudinal analysis. As all visits were approximately one-year apart, we conducted an analysis of covariance (AN-COVA). The ANCOVA model combines a general linear model and ANOVA. Its purpose is to examine whether the means of a dependent variable (thickness in V2) are consistent across levels of a categorical independent variable (patients or controls) while accounting for the influences of other variables (age, gender, and thickness in V1). We conducted a separate test for each IDP and controlled the relevant p-values across tests using the FDR correction.</p>
<p>For linking the <italic>z-diff</italic> score to clinical change, we transformed the <italic>z-diff</italic> score across all IDPs using PCA to decrease the dimensionality of the data as well as to avoid fishing. We ran PCA with 10 components and using Spearman correlation related the scores with changes in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale.</p>

<title>Effect of preprocessing</title>
<p>After obtaining cross-sectional <italic>z</italic>-scores for both types of preprocessing, we visually observed a decrease in variance between the two visits in longitudinal preprocessing compared to the cross-sectional one (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). More specifically, we calculated the mean of the difference between <italic>z</italic>-scores of V2 and V1 for each individual IDP, stratified by preprocessing and group, across all subjects. We then visualised the distribution of these means using a histogram (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Alternatively, we also computed the mean difference between <italic>z</italic>-scores of V2 and V1 across all IDPs for each subject, and plotted a histogram of these values. Note that this step was only done to estimate the effect of preprocessing on <italic>z</italic>-scores for further discussion. Its impact on the results is elaborated on in the discussion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Longitudinal neuroimaging studies allow us to assess the effectiveness of interventions and gain deeper insights into the fundamental mechanisms of underlying diseases.</p>
<p>Despite the significant expansion of our knowledge regarding population variation through the availability of publicly accessible neuroimaging data, this knowledge, predominantly derived from cross-sectional observations, has not been adequately integrated into methods for evaluating longitudinal changes.</p>
<p>We propose an analytical framework that builds on normative modelling and generates unbiased features that quantify the degree of change between visits, whilst capitalising on information extracted from large cross-sectional cohorts.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<label>4.1</label>
<title>Methodological contribution</title>
<p>Our approach is rooted in the normative modelling method based on Bayesian regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], the pre-trained version of which recently became available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. We showed that the estimation of longitudinal changes is readily available based on a preexisting cross-sectional normative model and only requires a set of healthy controls on which the variance of healthy change might be estimated. We denoted the score obtained after running the procedure as a <italic>z-diff</italic> score; it quantifies the extent of change between visits beyond what one would expect in the healthy population.</p>
<p>The core assumption of the <italic>z</italic>-diff score is that, on average, the change in healthy controls is not significant. This assumption stems from the essential idea of normative modelling that, with respect to the reference population, the position of a healthy subject does not significantly deviate over time. To verify this assumption, we used the data of 33 healthy controls which were originally used for the site-specific adaptation (for more details, see the discussion part on implementation) and computed their <italic>z-diff</italic> scores. After averaging these scores across all subjects, the <italic>z-diff</italic> score of no region was statistically significant from zero (after FDR correction). However, as pointed out by a recent work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] studying the effect of cross-sectional normative models on longitudinal predictions, the cross-sectionally derived population centiles <italic>by design</italic> lack information about longitudinal dynamics. Consequently, what may appear as a population-level trajectory does not necessarily align with individual subjects’ actual trajectories.</p>
<p>To address this limitation, our model considers the variation in individual centiles. This is achieved by estimating the impact of noise and reliability, which manifests as apparent crossings of centiles observed in healthy controls. Naturally, by incorporating this element of uncertainty, the model’s ability to detect subjects who experienced substantial changes in their trajectory over time decreases. As evident from the clinical findings, only a fraction of subjects were identified as having undergone significant changes (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>). However, at the group level, the significance of the observed changes persisted. Hence, while we adopt a cautious approach when assessing individual changes, the method still effectively identifies group-level changes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, unlike in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], our approach does not aim to predict individual trajectories, but rather to quantify whether the observed changes over time exceed what would be expected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<label>4.2</label>
<title>Implementation</title>
<p>At the implementation level, our model requires two stages of adaptation: site-specific adaptation, as presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], and a second level where we compute the variance of healthy change (noise) in healthy controls. However, if the number of longitudinal controls is limited, the site-specific adaptation may be omitted. The purpose of site-specific adaptation is to generate unbiased cross-sectional <italic>z</italic>-scores that are zero-centered with a variance of one for healthy controls. However, in the case of longitudinal analysis, the offset and normalisation constant are irrelevant since they will be identical for both visits. Therefore, the estimation of healthy change is the only essential factor in producing the <italic>z-diff</italic> score. Note that in this scenario, the cross-sectional result should not be interpreted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<label>4.3</label>
<title>Clinical results</title>
<p>Examination of the effect of preprocessing on <italic>z</italic>-scores showed that longitudinal preprocessing indeed decreases intra-subject variability compared to cross-sectional preprocessing. However, to assess the added benefit of the preprocessing, we also computed the core results (regions that significantly changed in time) for the crosssectional data. The significant results were mostly consistent with a longitudinal pipeline: Six out of seven originally significant regions were still statistically significant (with the exception of the right middle frontal sulcus), and three other regions were labelled significant: the left superior frontal gyrus, the right inferior frontal sulcus, and the right medial or olfactory orbital sulcus (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>). Therefore, it is also possible to use cross-sectional preprocessing for longitudinal analysis; however, at a cost of increased between-visit variance and consequently decreased power (in comparison to the longitudinal preprocessing).</p>
<p>The observation of cortical normalisation between the visits of early schizophrenia patients is, to a degree, counterintuitive and inconsistent with other works, which mostly report grey matter thinning. However, a meta-analysis of 50 longitudinal studies examining individuals with a heightened risk of psychosis revealed that 15 of the 19 studies indicated deviations in grey matter developmental trajectories between those with persistent symptoms and those whose symptoms resolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. The authors propose that grey matter developmental trajectories may return to normal levels in individuals in the High-Risk Remitting group by early adulthood, whereas neurological irregularities may continue to advance in those whose symptoms do not resolve. Although our cohort had already received a diagnosis of schizophrenia, it is possible that early identification and treatment supported these compensatory mech-anisms, as demonstrated by the normalisation of grey matter thickness in frontal regions. Notably, the affected regions also increased in raw grey matter thickness (as measured in mm, see <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we observed significant correlations between the PCA components of the <italic>z-diff</italic> score and changes in clinical scales, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. Notably, each clinical scale exhibited distinct associations with separate PCA components, despite substantial intercorrelations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 (B))</xref>.</p>
<p>The first PCA component, which predominantly captured global changes in grey matter thickness, displayed a negative correlation with improvements in the GAF score (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 (C))</xref>. This unexpected inverse relationship would suggest that patients who demonstrated clinical improvement over time exhibited a more pronounced decrease in grey matter thickness, as quantified by the <italic>z-diff</italic> score. However, further investigation revealed that this correlation was primarily driven by the patients’ GAF scores in the initial visit. Specifically, the correlation between GAF scores at the first visit and the first PCA component yielded a coefficient of R = 0.19 (p = 0.06), whereas the correlation with scores at the second visit was R = -0.10 (p = 0.31). These findings suggest that lower GAF scores during the initial visit are predictive of subsequent grey matter thinning.</p>
<p>Conversely, the interpretation of the second PCA component, significantly correlated with changes in the PANSS score, was more straightforward (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 (D))</xref>. The observed normalisation of grey matter thickness in frontal areas was positively correlated with improvements in the PANSS scale, indicating that symptom amelioration was accompanied by the normalisation of grey matter thickness in these regions.</p>
<p>Finally, we conducted an analysis of change using conventional statistical approaches to compare the results with normative modelling. Out of 148 areas tested by ANCOVA, 6 were statistically significant. However, after controlling for multiple comparisons, no IDP persisted. This result highlights the advantages of normative models and shows improved sensitivity of our method in comparison with more conventional approaches.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Estimating the intra-subject variability is a complex task that might be affected by acquisition and physiological noise. Assumptions must be made about the longitudinal behaviour of healthy subjects. The former problem is unavoidable, whereas the latter might be addressed by constructing longitudinal normative models. However, the project necessary for such a task would have to map individuals across their lifespan consistently. The efforts to create such a dataset are already in progress through projects like the ABCD study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], but much more data are still needed to construct a full-lifespan longitudinal model.</p>
<p>Additionally, our clinical results may be affected by selection bias, where subjects experiencing a worsening of their condition dropped out of the study, whereas patients with lower genetic risk or more effective treatment continued to participate.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have developed a method that utilises pre-trained normative models to detect un-usual longitudinal changes in neuroimaging data. Our approach offers a user-friendly implementation and has demonstrated its effectiveness through a comprehensive analysis. Specifically, we observed significant grey matter changes in the frontal lobe of schizophrenia patients over time, surpassing the sensitivity of conventional statistical approaches. This research represents a significant advancement in longitudinal neuroimaging analysis and holds great potential for further discoveries in neurode-generative disorders.</p>

<p>
Summary:</p>
<p>This paper provides a methodology for normative trajectory modeling, using cross-sectional data to set the &quot;norms,&quot; and then applying these norms to longitudinal brain observations. An example of schizophrenia trajectories (two time points) is provided. The method assumes a Bayesian mixed effects model, which included some hyperparameters that need to be tuned. The longitudinal assumption is essentially a random intercept model, assuming that the age-based quantiles do not shift, and if they do that is a sign of disease-like trajectories.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Normative modeling of brain feature trajectories is an important topic. Bayesian models are a promising alternative to modeling these. Leveraging large-scale data to provide norms is also potentially useful.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The models described are not fundamentally novel, essentially a random intercept model (with a warping function), and some flexible covariate effects using splines (i.e., additive models). The assumption of constant quantiles is very strong, and limits the utility of the model to very short term data. The schizophrenia example leads to a counter-intuitive normalization of trajectories, which leads to suspicions that this is driven by some artifact of the data modeling/imaging pipelines. The method also assumes that the cross-sectional data is from a &quot;healthy population&quot; without describing what this population is (there is certainly every chance of ascertainment bias in large scale studies as well as small scale studies). This issue is completely elided over in the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors provide a method aiming to accurately reflect the individual deviation of longitudinal/temporal change compared to the normal temporal change characterized based on pre-trained population normative model (i.e., a Bayesian linear regression normative model), which was built based on cross-sectional data. This manuscript aims to solve a recently identified problem of using normative models based on cross-sectional data to make inferences about longitudinal change.</p>
<p>Although the proposed method was implemented with real data and shown to be more sensitive in capturing the differences confirmed by previous studies than conventional methods, there is still a lack of simulation studies to formally evaluate the performance of the proposed method in making accurate estimations and inferences about the longitudinal changes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The efforts of this work make a good contribution to addressing an important question of normative modeling. With the greater availability of cross-sectional studies for normative modeling than longitudinal studies, and the inappropriateness of making inferences about longitudinal subject-specific changes using these cross-sectional data-based normative models, it's meaningful to try to address this gap from the perspective of methodological development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>• The organization and clarity of this manuscript need enhancement for better comprehension and flow. For example, in the first few paragraphs of the introduction, the wording is quite vague. A lot of information was scattered and repeated in the latter part of the introduction, and the actual challenges/motivation of this work were not introduced until the 5th paragraph.</p>
<p>• There are no simulation studies to evaluate whether the adjustment of the cross-sectional normative model to longitudinal data can make accurate estimations and inferences regarding the longitudinal changes. Also, there are some assumptions involved in the modeling procedure, for example, the deviation of a healthy control from the population over time is purely caused by noise and constant variability of error/noise across x_n, and these seem to be quite strong assumptions. The presentation of this work's method development would be strengthened if the authors can conduct a formal simulation study to evaluate the method's performance when such assumptions are violated, and, ideally, propose some methods to check these assumptions before performing the analyses.</p>
<p>• The proposed &quot;z-diff score&quot; still falls in the common form of z-score to describe the individual deviation from the population/reference level, but now is just specifically used to quantify the deviation of individual temporal change from the population level. The authors need to further highlight the difference between the &quot;z-score&quot; and &quot;z-diff score&quot;, ideally at its first mention, in case readers get confused (I was confused at first until I reached the latter part of the manuscript). The z-score can also be called a measure of &quot;standardized difference&quot; which kind of collides with what &quot;z-diff&quot; implies by its name.</p>
<p>• Explaining that one component of the variance is related to the estimation of the model and the other is due to prediction would be helpful for non-statistical readers.</p>
<p>• It would be easier for the non-statistical reader if the authors consistently used precision or variance for all variance parameters. Probably variance would be more accessible.</p>
<p>• The functions psi were never explicitly described. This would be helpful to have in the supplement with a reference to that in the paper.</p>
<p>• What is the goal of equations (13) and (14)? The authors should clarify what the point of writing these equations is prior to showing the math. It seems like it is to obtain an estimate of \sigma_{\ksi}^2, which the reader only learns at the end.</p>
<p>• What is the definition of &quot;adaption&quot; as used to describe equation (15)? In this equation, I think norm on subsample was not defined.</p>
<p>• &quot;(the sandwich part with A)&quot; - maybe call this an inner product so that it is not confused with a sandwich variance estimator. This is a bit unclear. Equation (8) does have the inner product involving A and \beta^{-1} does include variability of \eta. It seems like you mean that equation (8) incorrectly includes variability of \eta and does not have the right term vector component of the inner product involving A, but this needs clarifying.</p>
<p>• One challenge with the z-diff score is that it does not account for whether a person sits above or below zero at the first time point. It might make it difficult to interpret the results, as the results for a particular pathology could change depending on what stage of the lifespan a person is in. I am not sure how the authors would address those challenges.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for the feedback on our manuscript; we are planning to address the raised concerns in the following manner:</p>
<p>We will be more explicit about the novelty of this method framing it more concretely within the scope of current research. From some comments of the reviewers, we understand that it is not clear that our method is an extension of an already existing method and model that has been extensively validated with pre-trained models brought online. Consequently, the details of the model as well as the training cohort are only covered briefly, referencing relevant published works on this topic. We will improve the clarity in this respect in the full responses. Nevertheless, we agree that the work would benefit from a simulation study that formally evaluates the performance of our method compared with more traditional approaches and will add it in our full responses. We will take care specifically of investigating the effect of assumptions like the centile-stability in healthy controls as suggested by the Reviewer 2.</p>
<p>The novelty of this work lies in introducing a mathematically transparent method to use normative modelling for evaluating studies with a longitudinal design, using normative models trained on cross sectional data. We emphasise strongly that this is otherwise not possible using current methods. Furthermore, by building on a pre-trained model, this method enjoys the benefits of big (cross-sectional) data (by the pre-trained model being fitted on an extensive population sample) without the need to have direct access to them, or a ‘big’ longitudinal dataset from the cohort at hand. This is crucial in neuroimaging, where longitudinal data are much more scarce than cross-sectional data.</p>
<p>We strongly disagree with the notion raised by Reviewer 1 that after the first episode cortical thickness alterations are expected to become more severe. There is now increasing evidence that: (i) trajectories of cortical thickness are highly variable across different individuals after the first psychotic episode and (ii) that individuals treated with second-generation antipsychotics and with careful clinical follow-up can show normalisation of cortical thickness atypicalities after the first episode. Indeed, we can provide evidence for this in an independent cohort, with different analytical methodologies, where precisely this occurs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.19.24306008v1">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.19.24306008v1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36805840/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36805840/</ext-link>). In the full revision, we would be happy to provide further discussion of evidence in support of this.</p>
<p>We  would also like to re-emphasise  that the data were processed with the utmost rigour using state of the art processing pipelines including quality control.</p>
<p>We will take care to improve the flow of the manuscript with special attention to the theoretical part and sections highlighted by the Reviewer 2.</p>
<p>We agree with the challenge outlined by the Reviewer 2 regarding the limitations in interpretation of overall trends when the position in the visit one is different between the subjects. However, this is a much broader challenge and is not specific to this study. The non-random sampling of large cohort studies is problematic for nearly all studies using such cohorts, and regardless of the  statistical approach used. We will explicitly acknowledge these limitations in the full response.</p>
