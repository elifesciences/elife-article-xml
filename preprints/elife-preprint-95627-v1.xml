<title>Abstract</title><p>Desmosterol and cholesterol are essential lipid components of the sperm plasma membrane. Cholesterol efflux is required for capacitation, a process through which sperm acquire fertilizing ability. In this study, using a transgenic mouse model overexpressing 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24), an enzyme in the sterol biosynthesis pathway responsible for the conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol, we show that disruption of sterol homeostasis during spermatogenesis led to defective sperm morphology characterized by incomplete mitochondrial packing in the midpiece, reduced sperm count and motility, and a decline in male fertility with increasing paternal age, without changes in body fat composition. Sperm depleted of desmosterol exhibit inefficiency in the acrosome reaction, metabolic dysfunction, and an inability to fertilize the egg. These findings provide molecular insights into sterol homeostasis for sperm capacitation and its impact on male fertility.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lipids are essential for mammalian fertility, contributing to both steroidogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Miller and Auchus, 2011</xref>) and germ cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shi et al., 2018</xref>). In humans and other mammalian species, cholesterol and desmosterol are major sterol components of the sperm plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Keber et al., 2013</xref>). To gain fertilization capability, the sperm plasma membrane undergoes changes that result in cholesterol efflux, allowing sperm to undergo capacitation, including the acrosome reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Leahy and Gadella, 2015</xref>). An appropriate species-dependent sterol composition of the sperm plasma membrane is essential for successful fertilization. Coincidentally, male obesity has been linked to reduced reproductive success and infertility in both humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Leisegang et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Craig et al., 2017</xref>) and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ghanayem et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Borges et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Han et al., 2023</xref>). During spermiation, when mature spermatids dissociate from Sertoli cells and enter the lumen of the seminiferous tubules, the cholesterol content of the sperm plasma membrane decreases. This reduction continues as sperm migrate through the epididymis and acquire fertilizing capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nikolopoulou et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Haidl and Opper, 1997</xref>). During sperm capacitation, the plasma membrane becomes more fluid, and cholesterol relocates to the apical margin of the sperm head before eventually translocated to the extracellular environment by albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Leahy and Gadella, 2015</xref>). A study in boar and mouse sperm demonstrated the importance of sterol oxidation and oxysterol formation, which is dependent on the bicarbonate-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway, for sterol removal from the plasma membrane during capacitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boerke et al., 2013</xref>). In sperm samples from infertile men, elevated levels of both cholesterol and its immediate precursor desmosterol were observed, but the cholesterol/desmosterol ratio was decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zalata et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that sperm sterol homeostasis is essential for male fertility in humans. However, the specific impact of the disruption of sterol homeostasis on sperm physiology remains largely unknown.</p>
<p>Two parallel pathways contribute to cellular cholesterol biosynthesis from lanosterol. Both pathways – the Bloch pathway and the Kandutsch-Russell pathways – are interconnected by the enzyme DHCR24, which reduces the double bond in the side chain of all Bloch pathway sterols and converts them to the Kandutsch-Russel pathway sterols (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, DHCR24 activity in various tissues is essential for the production of diverse bioactive sterols, crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and tissue physiology. The <italic>Dhcr24</italic>-null mouse model exhibits nearly undetectable levels of plasma cholesterol and abnormally high levels of desmosterol, leading to increased prenatal mortality, poor growth in males that persists into adulthood, degenerated testes, and infertility in both males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wechsler et al., 2003</xref>). In humans, mutations in the <italic>DHCR24</italic> gene cause desmosterolosis, a rare congenital disorder characterized by excessive desmosterol and insufficient cholesterol. This condition also affects brain and head development and causes cardiac malformations and arthrogryposis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">FitzPatrick et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andersson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schaaf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zolotushko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dias et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rohanizadegan &amp; Sacharow, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hill et al., 2023</xref>). Our previous studies demonstrated that DHCR24 overexpression in myeloid cells depletes desmosterol, increases inflammation and mitochondrial ROS production, and impairs LXR/RXR pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2021</xref><sup>a</sup>).</p>

<p>In this study, we report that whole-body overexpression of DHCR24 (<italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic>) leads to decreased fertility with reduced sperm count and motility in male mice, correlated with increasing paternal age. DHCR24 overexpression depletes sperm desmosterol and disrupts plasma membrane sterol homeostasis. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy of <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> spermatozoa revealed defects in the mitochondria and sperm tail, including incomplete mitochondrial packing and bent tails. IZUMO staining showed reduced efficiency of <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> sperm to undergo the acrosome reaction during capacitation, even in spermatozoa from young adult males. Furthermore, our findings suggest that metabolically, uncapacitated <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> sperm resemble capacitated sperm in their increased oxygen consumption and faster depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. Taken together, our results demonstrate that desmosterol depletion and/or altered sterol homeostasis during spermatogenesis impacts sperm morphology, number, motility, and metabolism, leading to reduced male fertility.</p>

<title>DHCR24 overexpression leads to an age-dependent decline in male fertility</title>
<p>In our previous study, we generated a myeloid-specific conditional knock-in mouse line overexpressing DHCR24 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2021</xref><sup>a</sup>). Here, we used a similar approach to generate a global <italic>Dhcr24</italic> transgenic mouse line by breeding the <italic>Dhcr24<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>mice (overexpression of the construct in the <italic>Rosa26</italic> genetic locus) with the <italic>EIla<sup>CRE</sup></italic>mice (which express <italic>Cre recombinase</italic> in the early mouse embryo) (Figure 1–figure Supplement 1A). We used male mice aged 2 to 10 months, categorizing them as young (2-4 months old), mature (5-7 months old) and middle-aged (8-10 months old) adults (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Flurkey et al., 2007</xref>). After establishing mating between wild-type (WT) and <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> (TG) animals, using young and mature adult males and young adult females, we found that mature adult TG males sired significantly smaller litters than young adult TG males, with no alterations in the pup sex ratio (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>– figure supplement 1B). Moreover, they exhibited delay in impregnating the females (Figure 1–figure Supplement 1C). In contrast, WT males displayed no fertility changes within this age range. In light of these observations, we delved into exploring the consequences of desmosterol depletion through DHCR24 overexpression on sperm physiology.</p>
<p>Analyzing publicly available human (GSE109037) and mouse (GSE109033) testis scRNA-seq data, we found that <italic>DHCR24</italic> mRNA in human testis is most abundantly expressed in spermatogonia and, to a lesser extent, in spermatocytes and late spermatids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). This pattern mirrors <italic>Dhcr24</italic> mRNA levels in mouse adult and postnatal day 6 (P6) testis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), where it is most abundant in spermatogonia and to a lesser extent in Sertoli cells and peritubular myoid cells. We examined DHCR24 protein expression in WT and TG testes and found increased protein level in samples from TG animals (Figure 1–figure Supplement 1D). In line with the scRNA-seq data, DHCR24 is not readily detected in WT spermatozoa, but is detected in young adult TG spermatozoa from caput, corpus and cauda epididymis, and to a lesser extent in mature adult TG spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate DHCR24 expression in male germ cells and suggest that disruption of sterol synthesis during spermatogenesis may explain the observed decline of male fertility in <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> animals.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>DHCR24 overexpression leads to dysregulation of sperm sterol composition and capacitation efficiency</title>
<p>Alterations in sperm cholesterol, desmosterol, and the cholesterol to desmosterol ratio have been associated with subfertility in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zalata et al., 2010</xref>). To assess changes in sperm sterol composition, we measured specific sterols in the Bloch and Kandutsch-Russel pathways in spermatozoa from mature adult WT and TG males. In the Bloch pathway, we observed decreased levels of desmosterol (Des), 7-dehydrodesmosterol (7-DHD), and zymosterol (ZyE) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In the Kandutsch-Russell pathway, both immediate cholesterol precursors –7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) and 8,9-dehydrocholesterol (8-DHC)– showed decreased levels compared to WT sperm. Notably, the levels of 24,25-dihydrolanosterol (24,25DHLan) were significantly increased albeit just above the detection range (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Although we did not directly measure sperm cholesterol by the mass spectrometry, we speculated that cholesterol might be increased in TG sperm, considering the predominant flux (97%) through the Bloch pathway in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mitsche et al., 2015</xref>). However, our results indicated no statistical difference in cholesterol levels isolated from the whole testis of young adult and mature adult WT or Dhcr24-TG males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This is consistent with our findings of no significant changes in mRNA expression in <italic>Abca1</italic> cholesterol transporter in the testis of young adult and mature adult WT and <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> males, nor <italic>Nr1h2</italic> and <italic>Nr1h3,</italic> which encode the ABCA1 transcriptional regulators, LXRβ and LXRα, respectively, (Figure 2–figure Supplement 2A). Additionally, the ABCA1 protein levels remained unchanged (Figure 2–figure Supplement 2B). Furthermore, EchoMRI results showed no changes in the fat mass to lean mass ratio in middle-aged TG males (Figure 2–figure Supplement 3A), consistent with unchanged plasma cholesterol levels between young adult WT and <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> males (Figure 2–figure Supplement 3B), further supporting these findings.</p>

<p>To determine whether the altered sterol composition of TG sperm affects their ability to undergo the acrosome reaction, we incubated them in the absence or presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) or methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD), both acting as a cholesterol sink during capacitation, with MBCD even more efficiently than BSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Visconti et al., 1999</xref>). As cholesterol efflux is required for the acrosome reaction to occur in a timely manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Leahy and Gadella, 2015</xref>), fixed spermatozoa were immunostained for IZUMO to examine the status of acrosome reaction. We found that TG spermatozoa did not undergo acrosome reaction as efficiently as WT spermatozoa, <italic>i.e.,</italic> the proportion of partially reacted TG spermatozoa was higher (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). These observations align with the experiment using spermatozoa from middle-aged adult animals, where a greater proportion of TG spermatozoa were only partially acrosome-reacted than WT spermatozoa (Figure 2–figure Supplement 3C). Notably, even sperm from young adult TG males demonstrated reduced efficiency during <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF). When TG sperm were capacitated at a high concentration (20×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL), the 2-cell cleavage rate dropped below 10%, whereas WT sperm still fertilized the oocytes with over 80% cleavage rate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, TG sperm capacitated at the standard concentration used for IVF (2×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL) fertilized the oocytes at 80%. Taken together, these results demonstrate that altered sterol composition affects the efficiency of sperm capacitation and impairs fertility.</p>

<title><italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> males have decreased sperm count and motility</title>
<p>As DHCR24 is globally overexpressed in our TG animals and not specifically in male germ cells, we investigated whether the changes in sterol composition have an impact on spermatogenesis and/or sperm motility. We found a lower epididymal sperm count in young adult TG males, although not statistically significant, but this difference became statistically significant with aging (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Consistently, hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed an overall normal testis histology, but mature adult TG testis and epididymis showed a decrease in sperm count (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). To assess sperm total and hyperactivated motility, we utilized the Computer Assisted Sperm Analyzer (CASA) on WT and TG spermatozoa. Both before and after capacitation, spermatozoa from either young or mature adult TG animals displayed reduced motility. Additionally, the hyperactivated motility of TG spermatozoa was also diminished (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Similar results were observed in middle-aged adult spermatozoa capacitated in the presence of BSA or MBCD (Figure 3–figure Supplement 4A and 4B). Notably, the percentage of hyperactivated WT spermatozoa decreased when capacitated at high concentration (5.1%, compared to 16% percent when capacitated at the standard concentration), and the percentage of hyperactivated TG sperm was 3-5 times lower than that of WT, regardless of sperm concentration (1.7% and 2.9% at high and standard concentrations, respectively) (Figure 3–figure Supplement 4D). Importantly, sperm concentration during capacitation did not affect the total motility of either WT or TG spermatozoa (Figure 3–figure Supplement 4C). Flagellar waveform analysis revealed that a fraction of TG spermatozoa exhibited altered flagellar beating that became more prominent during sperm capacitation, presumably due to defective flagellar bending that flips the head backward (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>–supplementary video 1). These motility defects prompted us to further investigate sperm morphology in more detail.</p>

<title>Defective mitochondria in <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> males cause alteration in sperm metabolism</title>
<p>Having observed defects in mitochondrial structure in TG sperm, we next set out to investigate mitochondrial function. Spermatozoa must meet high energy demands as they travel to deliver the paternal genome to the oocyte. ATP production in spermatozoa occurs through two spatially compartmentalized metabolic processes in the tail: mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the midpiece and glycolysis from the principal piece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Visconti, 2012</xref>). We measured sperm mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) using MitoTracker Red CMXRos dye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pendergrass et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Santiani et al., 2016</xref>), followed by antimycin treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ferreira et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). We found that uncapacitated TG sperm from young adult males exhibited similar ΔΨm depolarization to capacitated WT and TG sperm after antimycin treatment – faster and to a greater extent than that of uncapacitated WT sperm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). This suggests a metabolic similarity of uncapacitated TG sperm to capacitated sperm. There was no difference in the rate or amplitude of membrane depolarization of the capacitated spermatozoa. To investigate whether this change affects oxygen consumption rate (OCR), we measured extracellular flux using Seahorse. Basal respiratory OCR, the difference between the initial and post-antimycin/rotenone injection measurements, increased after incubation under capacitating conditions, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Balbach et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ferreira et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, TG sperm from middle-aged males exhibited higher basal respiratory OCR in both uncapacitated and capacitated conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>; Figure 5–figure Supplement 5), suggesting that uncapacitated TG spermatozoa have higher metabolic demands and are more comparable to capacitated spermatozoa, in line with our observations from ΔΨm measurements.</p>

<title>Dysregulation of lipid metabolism affects male fertility</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wechsler <italic>et al</italic>., (2003)</xref> previously reported that loss of DHCR24 function results in infertility in both female and male mice, with testicular abnormalities observed in <italic>Dhcr24<sup>-/-</sup></italic>male mice. In this study, we report that gain of DHCR24 function, leading to desmosterol depletion, renders males subfertile and this condition worsens with age, while females remain fertile. Interestingly, an age-associated decline in male fertility has been reported in several other mouse models with dysregulated cholesterol homeostasis. Examples include ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), a lipid transporter responsible for the efflux of excess cholesterol and phospholipids from Sertoli cells in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Selva <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Morales <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), and liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Volle <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), which regulates ABCA1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Venkateswaran <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Costet <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). Consistently, lipid droplets accumulated in Sertoli cells of <italic>Abca1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> males, reducing their fertility by 6 months of age with decreased sperm count and testosterone levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Selva <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Similarly, accumulation of cholesterol/lipid droplets was observed in the testes of LXR-β-null males with age-dependent spermatogenesis defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Robertson <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005</xref>). Since our previous study showed that desmosterol depletion in macrophages resulted in impaired LXR activation and lipid accumulation as well as reduced ABCA1 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2021</xref><sup>a</sup>), we initially speculated that impaired LXR/RXR activation and/or ABCA1 expression might contribute to the phenotypes we observed in <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> males. However, our data comparing <italic>Nr1h2</italic> (LXRβ), <italic>Nrhh3</italic> (LXRα), and <italic>Abca1</italic> mRNA levels, as well as ABCA1 protein levels in the testes of WT versus TG animals showed no significant changes in either young or mature adult males (Figure 2–figure Supplement 2A and 2B). It is possible that desmosterol does not transcriptionally activates LXR in the mouse male reproductive system, or that desmosterol-regulated LXR signaling only manifests in animals fed a high fat diet and/or overweight animals, but these factors may not be responsible for the observed phenotype in our <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> mouse model. Similarly, desmosterol does not activate LXR in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Muse <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>), suggesting that this intermediate of cholesterol biosynthesis is a specific LXR ligand in myeloid cells, but not in other cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Muse <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Spann <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref><sup>a</sup>).</p>
<p>Notably, DHCR24 overexpression in our mouse model had no observable effect on body fat mass (Figure 2–figure Supplement 3A) or plasma cholesterol levels (Figure 2–figure Supplement 3B). Consistently, there were only marginal changes in the immediate cholesterol precursors 7-DHC and 8,9-DHC in spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), and no differences in the cholesterol levels isolated from the testis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). These findings are likely attributed to the negative feedback mechanisms that occur during spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis, ensuring the maintenance of appropriate cholesterol levels, given its crucial role. Furthermore, the normal fat to lean mass ratio in <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> mice rules out any known effects of obesity on male fertility, such as increased inflammation or abnormalities in hormone synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Katib, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Han et al., 2023</xref>). Instead, the observed defects result directly from an imbalance in cellular cholesterol homeostasis, specifically desmosterol depletion. A previous study indicated alterations in the desmosterol to cholesterol ratio in sperm from infertile men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zalata et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the sterol imbalance in the <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> spermatozoa itself is likely the cause of the delayed acrosome reaction. Additionally, the global defects in lipid signaling, levels of desmosterol, and other cholesterol precursors in the testis and plasma may affect spermatogenesis or spermiogenesis, contributing to the observed sperm defects and reduced sperm counts in <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> animals.</p>

<title>Desmosterol-depleted sperm show defective cellular metabolism</title>
<p>We found abnormalities in the tail structure of sperm from <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> animals, particularly in the midpiece, as evidenced by mitochondrial packing defects and abnormally bent tail (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). It remains unclear whether these defects result from issues during spermatogenesis/spermiogenesis or are caused by changes in the lipid composition of the sperm plasma membrane and/or the mitochondrial membrane. Notably, these mitochondrial structural changes are associated with alterations in cellular metabolism in uncapacitated <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> spermatozoa. In previous studies, elevated OXPHOS levels are found in diabetic cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs), correlated with increased intracellular ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhang et al., 2021</xref><sup>b</sup>). We previously showed that desmosterol depletion in macrophages also leads to ROS accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2021</xref><sup>a</sup>). In spermatozoa, mitochondria are a source of ROS with a dual function: ROS is a signaling molecule during capacitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">O’Flaherty et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boerke et al., 2013</xref>), but high levels of ROS have the potential to damage sperm DNA and negatively affect fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aitken and Baker, 2006</xref>). Complex I and complex III are recognized as the major ROS producers in spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Koppers et al., 2008</xref>). Our OXPHOS measurements revealed an increase in basal OCR levels in uncapacitated <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> spermatozoa, approaching levels similar to capacitated WT spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Furthermore, uncapacitated <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> sperm membranes are depolarized after antimycin treatment at rates similar to those observed in capacitated WT and <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The sensitivity to antimycin in uncapacitated <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> spermatozoa and increased MMP could be explained by increased complex III activity, potentially leading to increased ROS production, which in turn may contribute to the observed sperm defects in TG spermatozoa.</p>
<p>In this study, we utilized a mouse model with DHCR24 overexpression to induce desmosterol deficiency, aiming to investigate significance of sterol homeostasis in sperm function and fertility, and explore the effects of sterols on sperm cell metabolism. Our findings revealed alterations in the sperm sterol composition, resulting in morphological and metabolic defects of spermatozoa, ultimately leading to impaired fertility. This underscores the impact of sterol imbalance on the fertilization ability of spermatozoa. Interestingly, we observed increased OCR and MMP. Whether <italic>Dhcr24-TG</italic> sperm accumulate more ROS as a result of sterol dysfunction remains to be investigated in the future. Importantly, our results establish a connection between cellular metabolism and sterol homeostasis, specifically highlighting the role of desmosterol. Furthermore, our studies suggest that deviations in sterol homeostasis may not always be correlated with obesity, at least in mice. If this finding extends to humans, it could have implications for how we understand and study sterol dysregulation and its relationship with infertility. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes encoding enzymes important for sterol synthesis may impact male fertility, even in the absence of increased body fat, while obesity in these individuals could worsen fertility outcomes.</p>

To induce capacitation, 2×10<sup>6</sup> sperm/mL were incubated in human tubular fluid (HTF) medium (EMD Millipore) at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 90 min. Sperm either under uncapacitating conditions (M2 or in HS) or under capacitating conditions (HTF) were treated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD, 1.3 mg/mL) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, 1 mg/mL) for 1 hour at 37°C to examine the efficiency of cholesterol efflux and its effect on capacitation (acrosome reaction) rate. In experiments where protein levels from lysates from cauda, corpus and caput sperm were compared, caput sperm were purified using Percoll gradients as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Krapf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Galan et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, sperm suspension is layered over a Percoll gradient containing 45% Percoll/PBS in upper phase, and 90% Percoll/PBS in lower phase, and centrifuged at 650 g for 25 minutes. Interphase contained purified caput sperm, which were washed in 1x PBS and prepared for protein extraction as described below.</p>

<title>Sperm motility analysis</title>
<p>Aliquots of sperm were placed in slide chamber (CellVision, 20 µm depth) and motility was examined on a 37°C stage of a Nikon E200 microscope under 10X phase contrast objective (CFI Plan Achro 10X/0.25 Ph1 BM, Nikon). Images were analyzed for spermatozoa by head tracing via computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA, Sperm Class Analyzer version 6.3, Microptic, Barcelona, Spain). Images were recorded (40 frames at 50 fps) using CMOS video camera (Basler acA1300-200um, Basler AG, Ahrensburg, Germany) and analyzed by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA, Sperm Class Analyzer version 6.3, Microptic, Barcelona, Spain). Sperm motility (%) was quantified, and motion parameters including curvilinear velocity (VCL, in mm/s) and amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH, in mM) were measured. Over 200 motile sperm were analyzed for each trial, with 3-4 biological replicates performed for each genotype, as denoted in figure legends.</p>

<title>Sperm immunocytochemistry</title>
<p>Sperm were washed in PBS twice, attached on glass coverslips, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS at room temperature (RT) for 10-15 minutes. Fixed samples were permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at RT for 10 minutes and blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS at RT for 1 hr. Cells were stained with DHCR24 (1:500, Cell Signaling Technology) or IZUMO (1:250, Bio-Academia) antibody in 10% goat serum in PBS at 4°C overnight. After washing in PBS, the samples were incubated with secondary antibody (1:1,000) in 10% goat serum in PBS at RT for 1 hr. Hoechst was used to counterstain nucleus. Immunostained samples were mounted with Prolong gold (Invitrogen) and cured for 24 h, or with VectaShield (Vector laboratories), followed by confocal imaging with Zeiss LSM710 using Plan-Apochrombat 63X/1.40 or alpha Plan-APO 100X/1.46 oil objective lens (Carl Zeiss).</p>

<title>LC-MS/MS analysis</title>
<p>Lipids were extracted from the samples by a modified Bligh–Dyer extraction, and sterols were analyzed by LC-MS/MS as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2021</xref><sup>a</sup>). Briefly, lipid extracts from samples were dried under nitrogen and reconstituted in 90% methanol. Sterols were analyzed using a Shimadzu LC20ADxr high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with an Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm, 2.7-μm particles; Agilent Technologies). The elution was done using a solvent gradient that transitioned linearly from 93% methanol/7% H2O to 100% methanol in 7 min. The column was washed for 5 min in 100% methanol and then returned to the initial solvent. Sterols were detected using a SCIEX API 5000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a Turbo V APCI source in positive mode with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization at a temperature of 350 °C. Data were acquired under multiple reaction monitoring for mass pairs optimized for each sterol. The internal standards were commercially available for all but four of the sterols (dihydro-ff-MAS, dihydro-t-MAS, dehydrolathosterol, and dehydrodesmosterol) in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway that were identified by their unique m/z values and retention times as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mitsche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">McDonald et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<p>Collected epididymal sperm cells were washed and pelleted by centrifugation and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% PFA in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer pH 7.4 for one hour at RT. Fixed sperm pellets were rinsed with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and spun down in 2% agar. The chilled blocks were trimmed, rinsed in the 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, and replaced with 0.1% tannic acid in the buffer for one hour. After rinsing in the buffer, the samples were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for one hour. The post-fixed samples were rinsed in the cacodylate buffer and distilled water, followed by en bloc staining in 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for one hour. Prepared samples were rinsed and dehydrated in an ethanol series to 100%. Dehydrated samples were infiltrated with epoxy resin Embed 812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences), placed in silicone molds, and baked for 24 hours at 60°C. The hardened blocks were sectioned in 60 nm thickness using Leica UltraCut UC7. The sections were collected on grids coated with formvar/carbon and contrast stained using 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The grids were imaged using FEI TecnaiBiotwin Transmission Electron Microscope (FEI, Hillsbroro, OR) at 80 kV. Images were taken using MORADA CCD camera and iTEM (Olympus) software.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Relovska and colleagues aims to decipher the importance of sterol homeostasis on male reproduction and, in particular, the impact of altered sterol homeostasis in sperm cells. To this end, they are generating a global line of Dhcr24 transgenic mice by mating Dhcr24fl/fl mice (overexpressing the construct in the Rosa269c gene locus) with EIla 100 CRE mice (expressing Cre recombinase in the early mouse embryo).</p>
<p>The data provided are robust, using a range of approaches from sperm analysis (structure, function) to lipid analysis. Results show that overexpression of DHCR24 (TG) leads to altered sterol homeostasis in spermatozoa. Sperm from TG mice have abnormal mitochondria and sperm tails. TG spermatozoa have reduced efficiency in undergoing the acrosomal reaction. Furthermore, the data suggest that TG spermatozoa have an altered metabolism with increased oxygen consumption. These data highlight that desmosterol depletion and/or altered sterol homeostasis impact sperm morphology, number, motility, and metabolism, resulting in reduced male fertility.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is clear and well-written, and the results are presented in high-quality figures.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main concern is the clear analysis of the rodent model. Indeed, the use of this particular Cre leads to whole-body overexpression, the remaining question is whether the observed effects are directly mediated by the testicular impacts of Dhcr24 overexpression. Even if it is a testicular effect, we can't conclude where it comes from. Is it at the level of spermatogenesis, as the authors speculate? Furthermore, the authors mention that normally, Dhcr24c is mainly expressed in spermatogonia, so it's not clear why they focus only on spermatozoa, which in WT males do not normally express dhcr24 according to the authors. It is worth clarifying the testicular phenotype in more detail.</p>
<p>The lower level of TG in aged mice could suggest an extinction of the transgene at least in sperm during aging, which could be difficult to reconcile with the observed phenotype. With this in mind, it would be interesting to define the penetrance of the phenotype during aging, to define variability between mice, and to clearly define potential correlations between sterol levels and fertility disorders, or altered sperm parameters.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Sterols, including desmosterol and cholesterol, play critical roles in male fertility including membrane rearrangements associated with sperm capacitation, steroidogenesis, and germ cell development. Relovska, Sona, et al. investigated the effects of global overexpression of classic cholesterol biosynthesis enzyme DHCR24 in a mouse model, focusing on the impacts on sperm function and male fertility. While mice were viable and did not exhibit altered plasma cholesterol levels or obesity, the authors demonstrated that concentrations of relevant sterols in sperm from transgenic mice were altered compared to WT mouse sperm, including the expected depletion of desmosterol. The transgenic males exhibited several indicators of reduced sperm function and fertility. Mitochondrial dysfunction was indicated by a noted depletion of localization in the distal middle-piece of up to approximately 20-25% of transgenic sperm flagella, and alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption rates in transgenic sperm were noted.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that DHCR24 overexpression was achieved and that sperm sterol levels are altered. The conclusions that global DHCR24 overexpression impacts mitochondrial localization and male fertility parameters are supported by the number of different supporting assessments utilized to reach these conclusions and this is a strength. Overall, the authors achieve their aim of demonstrating DHCR24 overexpression impacts on indicators of sperm function and fertility including reduced sperm counts and sperm motility, reduced fertility in mating trials with aged males, and reduced IVF success when sperm were capacitated in conditions of higher sperm concentrations in vitro. The authors further investigate sperm mitochondrial localization and function. While a mitochondrial sheath can form in sperm from transgenic mice, 25% of the sperm exhibit a shortened mitochondrial sheath where a distal portion of the middle piece of the sperm flagella lacks mitochondria and instead exhibits exposed outer dense fibers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In the current study, the authors conclude that desmosterol may not act as an LXR activator in testicular cells based on assessment of relevant mRNA levels in whole testis that indicated the relevant transcripts were not altered in transgenic testes. However, caution should be taken in utilizing whole testis transcriptomics to rule out a role in specific cell populations within the testis with minor relative representation, such as macrophages or undifferentiated spermatogonia. This is an important distinction for a few reasons. The authors reveal through single-cell assessments of DHCR24 expression in WT testis that it is most highly expressed in undifferentiated spermatogonia. Further, the authors previously reported that DHCR24 over-expression in myeloid/macrophage populations did impact LXR activation impacting atherosclerosis. Taken together with emerging evidence that testis macrophages may impact spermatogonial fate decisions, the potential for DHCR24 to impact these minor testicular cell populations should not yet be ruled out. The significance of individual observations needs to be clarified through improved reporting of methodologies, specific biological and technical replicates, and statistical significance for each individual assessment. The lack of these details obfuscates the ability of the reader to interpret or replicate several reported observations which is a weakness.</p>
<p>(1) The fertility trials indicate a reduced number of pups/litter in aged but not younger transgenic males. However, the data for the aged males includes three data points of 0 pups, which brings to question if the data points each represent the average pups/litter for individual males or individual litters with multiple litters separately included for fertile males. Clarification could help in interpreting whether litter sizes were reduced, or if litter frequency and/or fertility of individual males was reduced. In the latter case, behavioral infertility would not be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(2) The statistical significance is not clear for altered acrosome reaction data, hyperactivated motility data, waveform analysis, mitochondrial membrane potential, and some of the sperm morphology assessments. In many assessments, the biological and technical replicates assessed need to be clarified.</p>
<p>(3) Methods utilized for image assessment of waveform analysis and mitochondrial membrane potential are lacking detail sufficient for replication of the assessments or for reader interpretation of how conclusions were reached.</p>
<p>Summary of impact:</p>
<p>Overall, the novel observations in this study are consistent with a role for controlled sterol concentrations being important for male fertility and indicate that this model will be useful to further investigate sterol biosynthesis contributions to testis function including steroidogenesis, spermatogenesis, and sperm function including capacitation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have created DHCR24 knockin mice and noted changes in the sperm sterol composition. Concurrently, alterations in the quantity, motility, and function of the sperm in DHCR24 knockin mice were identified.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript offers an intriguing perspective on how disruptions in sperm sterol composition can lead to sperm abnormalities.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>From the current data, several issues remain to be clarified, including the fertility test results, which merit a more detailed presentation to ascertain whether differences stem from individual variability or overall changes. The authors suggest an increase in ROS in the sperm of DHCR24 knockin mice, leading to sperm damage, which also requires further confirmation. Moreover, the quality of some data requires verification or improvement, such as the morphological analysis of testicular sections and the OCR experiments.</p>
