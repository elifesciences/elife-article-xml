<title>Abstract</title><p>Formation of the skin barrier requires rapid proliferation coupled with differentiation and stratification of the embryonic epidermis. Basal progenitors give rise to progeny throughout development – first to intermediate cells, a transient proliferative suprabasal cell population, and later to spinous cells. Neither the function nor the differentiation trajectory of intermediate cells has been documented. We generated transcriptomes of intermediate and spinous cells and identified specific markers that distinguish these two populations. Further, we found that intermediate cells express a subset of genes in common with granular cells of the epidermis – the terminal living cell type that helps establish the barrier. Lineage tracing revealed that most intermediate cells directly transition to granular cells without expressing markers specific to spinous cells, thus revealing a distinct lineage pathway leading to granular fate. In addition to their transcriptional similarities, intermediate and granular cells both had hallmarks of increased actomyosin contractility. We found that rather than simply lying downstream of cell fate pathways, contractility was sufficient to suppress spinous fate and promote granular gene expression. Together, these data establish the molecular and mechanical characteristics of the developing epidermis that allow this tissue to rapidly develop barrier activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Development of many tissues is characterized by rapid proliferation coupled with morphogenesis and differentiation. This process often uses specialized and transient cell types that are not found in homeostatic tissue, necessitating distinct pathways for differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Singh and Tiwari, 2023</xref>). During the embryonic development of the epidermis, an initial single layer of progenitor cells gives rise to a multi-layered and differentiated tissue that acts as a chemical and mechanical barrier at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Moreci and Lechler, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sumigray and Lechler, 2015</xref>). This process begins at embryonic day (E) 14.5 in the mouse back skin when basal progenitor cells start to give rise to a suprabasal cell layer of intermediate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Damen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Smart, 1970</xref>). Subsequently, basal cells divide to generate spinous cells, which are post-mitotic. These cells then further differentiate into granular cells, the last living cell types in the epidermis which are integral to forming the epidermal barrier. Intermediate cells are a transient cell type that expresses differentiation markers like Keratin 1 and 10 but remain mitotically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Weiss and Zelickson, 1975</xref>). At this time point, the proliferation rate of intermediate cells is comparable to basal cells, suggesting that they are a significant contributor to tissue expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Damen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Smart, 1970</xref>). These cells lack basement membrane attachment, and thus, they proliferate in a tissue environment that is normally quiescent in the adult. Currently, we do not understand if they play functional roles outside of proliferation, their cell fate trajectory, or how they compare to later generated spinous cells at a molecular level. Further, we lack specific markers for intermediate cells despite recent scRNA-Seq data that has characterized the transcriptomes of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jacob et al., 2023</xref>). Generation of intermediate cells is transient (E14-15.5), and by E16.5 basal cells give rise to post-mitotic spinous cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). It is not known whether this switch in progeny type is driven by intrinsic changes in basal progenitors, changes in signals from the surrounding periderm, and/or by systemic signals (circulating factors or amniotic fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Huebner et al., 2012</xref>)).</p>

<p>In addition to chemical cues, mechanical information is assessed by cells and can instruct proliferation and differentiation decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Vining and Mooney, 2017</xref>). This has been most clearly demonstrated by substrates of differential stiffness eliciting altered differentiation pathways in mesenchymal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Engler et al., 2006</xref>). Whether intra-tissue mechanical information is also instructive in differentiation has not been as thoroughly addressed. That said, in many tissues, differentiation leads to changes in contractility and or stiffness. For example, in the epidermis, there is increased contractility in the granular cell layer, and this contractility is important for the formation of tight junctions in this cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Miroshnikova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rubsam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sumigray et al., 2012</xref>). While this flow of information from transcriptome to contractility has largely been assumed to be unidirectional, some works have demonstrated bidirectional interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Le et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Meyer-ter-Vehn et al., 2006</xref>). When physical linkages between the cytoskeleton and nucleus were removed, there was a premature differentiation of keratinocytes and this was hypothesized to involve alterations in the transcription of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC), a genetic locus that undergoes a change in localization in response to differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Carley et al., 2021</xref>). Further, increased contractility in differentiated cells of the epidermis results in a non-cell autonomous effect on proliferation of their progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ning et al., 2021</xref>). However, we lack clear evidence that contractility can directly affect differentiation in the epidermis.</p>
<p>Here, we used bulk sequencing to characterize the transcriptomes of intermediate and spinous cells, as well as their progenitors. We defined markers that are specific for intermediate and spinous cells and showed marked transcriptomic differences in the basal cell progenitors that give rise to these distinct cell types. Further, our data demonstrate that intermediate cells express many genes associated with granular cells – a cell type that emerges days later and is responsible for secreting lipids that constitute part of the epidermal barrier. Rather than moving through a spinous state, as has long been assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Koster and Roop, 2005</xref>), intermediate cells appear to directly transition to granular cells. Intermediate cells also show similarity to granular cells in having increased apparent actomyosin contractility. Using genetic models to induce contractility in spinous cells, we demonstrate that contractility is sufficient to induce a granular-like state. Together this work reveals the lineage pathways and the influences of contractility on epidermal barrier formation.</p>

<title>Transcriptomic analysis of embryonic epidermal differentiation</title>
<p>During early epidermal stratification at E14.5, intermediate cells (ICs) are the first layer of suprabasal cells that express the differentiation marker keratin 10 (K10) and proliferate at a rate similar to basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1A-C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Damen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Smart, 1970</xref>). The proliferation rate of suprabasal cells decreases over the next 48 hours, and these cells are largely postmitotic by E16.5. To further validate these suprabasal cell dynamics during epidermal stratification, we performed live imaging of back skin explants from K10-rtTA;TRE-H2B-GFP embryos, which express H2B-GFP in K10-positive suprabasal cells. Consistent with data from fixed embryos, we observed numerous suprabasal mitotic events in explants collected from E14.5 embryos, while suprabasal cells in explants from E16.5 embryos were mitotically inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Fig.1, Supplement 1</xref>). All divisions visualized were planar to the epithelium.</p>
<p>To understand the differences between suprabasal cells at E14.5 and E16.5, we explored the transcriptomic changes occurring between these two time points. We used K14-RFP;K10-rtTA;TRE-H2B-GFP mice and FACS to purify H2B-GFP<sup>+</sup> suprabasal cells and RFP<sup>+</sup> basal cells at E14.5 and E16.5 and performed bulk RNA sequencing of each of these cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1D</xref>). Given that granular cells also form part of the suprabasal compartment at E16.5, we excluded the more superficial cells that bind <italic>Ulex europaeus</italic> agglutinin I lectin from E16.5 samples in order to uniquely compare suprabasal cells that lie immediately above the basal layer (ICs and spinous cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brabec et al., 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) of the sequenced cell populations revealed that biological replicates grouped together and that samples were segregated by cell type (basal vs suprabasal) in the first component, and by age in the second component (E14.5 vs. E16.5). Notably, ICs at E14.5 and spinous cells at E16.5 were not clustered together, indicating that they are distinct populations, as are their corresponding basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1E</xref>). Though not addressed further here, the developmental transition in suprabasal cells from E14.5 to E16.5 may reflect the very different states of basal cells at these time points.</p>
<p>To identify specific molecular markers for ICs and spinous cells, we filtered the genes that were uniquely enriched in ICs (at E14.5 compared to both E16.5 spinous cells and E14.5 basal cells) and in spinous cells (compared to both E14.5 ICs and E16.5 basal cells). The IC gene signature consisted of 610 genes and included Scara5, a scavenger receptor, St8sia6, which encodes a sialyltransferase enzyme, and Tgm1 (transglutaminase 1), an enzyme involved in covalent cross-linking of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>). To validate these candidates, we performed RNAScope and detected mRNA of Scara5 and St8sia6 in ICs but not in suprabasal cells at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B-E</xref>). It is worthwhile to note that Scara5 expression was specific to ICs, while St8sia6 mRNA was also present in granular cells at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref>). This was also reflected in the presence of Loricrin and St8sia6 protein in the granular layers at E16.5 by antibody staining; however, we did not detect their fluorescence signal in ICs at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Fig 2, Supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that some granular genes are transcriptionally enriched in ICs but not yet appreciably expressed at the protein level. On the contrary, we found Tgm1 protein expression in intermediate cells, as described in more detail below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>There were 163 genes whose transcripts were specifically upregulated in spinous cells at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2F</xref>). Among this list, the transcription factor MafB was a prominent candidate since it has been implicated in epidermal differentiation in cultured human epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lopez-Pajares et al., 2015</xref>), and it is expressed in suprabasal cells <italic>in vivo</italic> during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Miyai et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with our transcriptional data, immunofluorescence staining of MafB at E16.5 revealed that it was present in the first suprabasal cell layers in the epidermis but was excluded from granular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2 G,I</xref>), and it was undetectable in ICs at E14.5. Another highly upregulated gene in this list, <italic>Ptgs1</italic>, which encodes the enzyme Cox1, was also enriched in spinous cells but not in ICs at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2H,J</xref>). Therefore, MafB and Cox1 are specific markers for spinous cells in the embryonic epidermis.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>MafB inhibits proliferation of intermediate cells</title>
<p>To test the functional role of Maf transcription factors in determining spinous cell fate, we prematurely induced MafB expression in ICs. For this, we collected K10-rtTA;TRE-MafB-HA (here after called K10-MafB) embryos that were collected at E14.5, when suprabasal cells are ICs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Fig 3, Supplement 1A</xref>). In these embryos, MafB-HA was expressed in about 30% of all suprabasal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Fig 3, Supplement 1B</xref>). Examination of EdU incorporation revealed that HA+ cells had a significantly lower rate of incorporation than ICs in controls, demonstrating that MafB expression is sufficient to decrease cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A,B</xref>). Notably, however, we found that there was increased proliferation of surrounding MafB-negative cells in mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A,B</xref>); while the overall suprabasal proliferation rate was not significantly different in mutants vs controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Fig 3, Supplement 1C</xref>). This suggests a potential homeostatic mechanism for maintaining total proliferation during the epidermal stratification process. To determine whether MafB expression was sufficient to repress IC-specific gene expression, we examined IC markers, including Tgm1 and Scara5. While we found a decrease in the levels of Tgm1 protein, Scara5 mRNA levels were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C-F</xref>). These data demonstrate that MafB may repress parts of the IC signature but does not globally repress all markers. Given that it altered the mitotic status of ICs into a spinous-like state, we also examined whether MafB expression was sufficient for induction of spinous markers. However, we found that the spinous marker Cox1 was not induced by MafB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3G,H</xref>). Therefore, MafB is sufficient for some aspects of spinous fate (like loss of proliferation), but not for the expression of all spinous marker genes.</p>

<title>Intermediate cells are granular cell precursors</title>
<p>Using the IC-specific gene signature we identified above, we turned to Gene Ontology (GO) analysis to determine biological pathways characteristic of these cells. Categories that were uniquely enriched in ICs at E14.5 included pathways involved in lipid metabolic processes and establishment of the skin barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>). These pathways are hallmarks of granular cells, which produce and secrete lipids that contribute to the formation of the watertight cornified layer that acts as the epidermal barrier. These findings were unexpected since granular cells have not formed yet at E14.5. Comparing the IC gene signature to a granular gene signature that we generated from published data ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Matsui et al., 2021</xref>) GSE168011) revealed a striking overlap with over 1/3 of the genes in the IC signature also being part of the granular cell signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>). GO analysis of these shared genes revealed pathways such as keratinocyte differentiation, endomembrane system (reminiscent of lamellar bodies) and lipid processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Fig 4, Supplement 1</xref>). Notably, both Grhl3 and Hopx, two transcription factors that control late epidermal differentiation were upregulated in both of these cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chalmers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Obarzanek-Fojt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ting et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ting et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yu et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>To validate the expression of canonical granular markers in ICs, we performed immunofluorescence staining of Tgm1, an enzyme that performs protein cross-linking of structural proteins for cornified envelope formation, and Abca12, which plays a role in transporting lipids into lamellar bodies and is disrupted in Harlequin Ichthyosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akiyama, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Thomas et al., 2006</xref>). Both proteins were already expressed at the protein level in ICs, but not in spinous cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C-F</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these data suggested that in addition to promoting rapid amplification of keratinocytes, intermediate cells may serve as progenitors for the first granular cells that form during development. To test this hypothesis, we performed a pulse-chase experiment in K10-rtTA;TRE-H2B-GFP embryos by injecting a low dose of doxycycline to induce the expression of H2B-GFP in K10-positive cells at E14.5 (i.e. only ICs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Fig 5, Supplement 1A</xref>). We followed the H2B-GFP+ cells over time, and we found that at E15.5, these cells were already more superficial, separated from basal cells by a layer of H2B-GFP negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5A</xref>). Based on their expression of MafB, these cells are the first spinous cells produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5A</xref>). Strikingly, about 95% of H2B-GFP+ cells did not stain for MafB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5A’</xref>). Thus, rather than converting to a spinous cell fate, they are displaced upwards. When we chased these cells until E16.5, they were located in the upper most layers of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5B</xref>), and they co-stained with loricrin, a granular cell marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Fig 5, Supplement 1A</xref>). This indicates that most ICs transition into granular cells without going through a MafB+ state. When labeled cells were chased until E18.5, GFP signal was clearly present in the cornified layer, demonstrating that the traced ICs had terminally differentiated before birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5C</xref>). The above data suggest that the first spinous cells arise from basal cells and not from differentiation of ICs. To test this, we generated K14-rtTA;TRE-H2B-GFP mice and pulsed them with low levels of doxycycline at E14.5. With these conditions, we specifically labeled basal cells at E14.5 and followed their progeny. In embryos chased to E15.5, we observed that 80% of basal cells and 70% of all MafB+ cells were H2B-GFP+, demonstrating that most spinous cells arise from basal divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5D,D’</xref>). Altogether, these data demonstrate that most ICs are direct precursors for granular cells and do not pass through a MafB+ spinous intermediate.</p>

<title>Contractility status changes through epidermal development and is sufficient to drive aspects of granular cell fate</title>
<p>Further analysis of our RNA-Seq dataset suggested that intermediate cells may be mechanically as well as molecularly distinct from spinous cells. We examined the list of genes that were upregulated in ICs versus spinous cells, regardless of their expression levels in basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6A</xref>). GO term analysis revealed that regulation of cell morphogenesis and the actin cytoskeleton were among the most highly upregulated pathways in ICs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6A</xref>). Heat map analysis of the contractome gene set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zaidel-Bar et al., 2015</xref>), demonstrated clear differences in suprabasal cell expression at E14.5 and E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B</xref>). To validate these findings, we stained for markers that indicate contractility status. We observed that F-actin levels were higher in basal and suprabasal cells at E14.5, as well as in granular cells at E16.5. However, they were low in spinous cells at this later time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6C-C’’</xref>). Myosin IIA, a major contributor to actomyosin contractility in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Miroshnikova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sumigray et al., 2012</xref>), was also higher in ICs than spinous cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6D-D’’</xref>). Similarly, α18, an antibody that recognizes an epitope of α-catenin that is exposed when adherens junctions are under tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yonemura et al., 2010</xref>), was also higher in basal and suprabasal cells at E14.5 vs E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6E-E’’</xref>). Furthermore, active nuclear YAP, a mechanoresponsive transcriptional co-activator, was present in ICs and granular cells at E16.5, but not in spinous cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Fig 6. Supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, the percentage of basal cells at E14.5 with active YAP was significantly higher than basal cells at E16.5. Apart from its role in mechanotransduction, the active form of YAP is an important driver of proliferation in the basal layers of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aragona et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Schlegelmilch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhang et al., 2011a</xref>). To test a potential role of YAP in IC proliferation, we used K10-rtTA;TRE-YAP1<sup>S112A</sup>-GFP (hereafter called K10-YAP<sup>CA</sup>) mice to induce an active form of YAP, marked by H2B-GFP, in suprabasal cells at E16.5.

<p>The apparent changes in contractility through epidermal development raised the question of whether the shared contractility between ICs and granular cells lies downstream of differentiation, or if it contributes to their similar gene expression. To test the effects of heightened contractility in the suprabasal cells, we turned to mouse models we previously developed that allow doxycycline-induced actomyosin contractility: K10-rtTA; TRE-Spastin and K10-rtTA, TRE-Arhgef11<sup>CA</sup>, hereafter referred as K10-Spastin and K10-Arhgef11<sup>CA</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hinnant et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Muroyama and Lechler, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Muroyama et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ning et al., 2021</xref>).In both cases this expression is confined to suprabasal cells. K10-Spastin expresses the active form of the microtubule severing protein Spastin which increases contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ning et al., 2021</xref>); and K10-Arhgef11<sup>CA</sup> induces expression of a constitutively active Rho-GEF that activates RhoA GTPase, a key positive regulator of actomyosin contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ning et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>We started by examining the transcriptomic changes that are induced by contractility (from K10-Spastin vs controls at E16.5, log2 fold change &gt;=1; GEO: GSE158786) and compared it with the intermediate and granular cell signatures. Remarkably, we found that 47% of contractility-induced genes overlapped with the granular gene signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Fig 7, Supplement 1A</xref>)– demonstrating a major change in gene expression and differentiation state by intracellular contractility (hypergeometric test representation factor 3.4, p=2X10<sup>-101</sup>). GO analysis revealed that the common signature was highly enriched in keratinocyte differentiation, cornified envelope, lamellar bodies and lipid processes – all hallmarks of granular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7A</xref>). When comparing with the IC signature, there was still significant overlap - 80 of the 610 genes in the IC signature (13%) were also found in the contractile signature, though less than that found in the granular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Fig 7, Supplement 1B</xref>). These included the late epidermal differentiation transcriptional regulars Grhl3 and Hopx. The most enriched terms for the overlapping genes between ICs and the contractile gene signature were lipid processing and transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>). In addition, mainly lipid metabolic genes were upregulated in the shared ICs, granular cell, and contractility signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Fig 7, Supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that these were the pathways commonly upregulated in IC and granular cells as a consequence of contractility. Notably, many EDC genes were enriched in the contractile and granular signatures (30/61), but many fewer in the IC signature (5/61). This demonstrates specific differentiation pathways are enriched in ICs, while the contractile gene signature is much more similar to the full granular gene expression program.</p>

<p>In contrast to an upregulation of granular gene markers in hypercontractile skin, we noted that about 1/3 of all the spinous signature genes were downregulated in this mutant (55/163) genes, demonstrating a partial suppression of the spinous cell fate.</p>
<p>We next examined the effects of increased contractility through analysis of specific markers for spinous cells we identified earlier in this study. We used both models of increased contractility in suprabasal cells: K10-Spastin and K10-Arhgef11<sup>CA</sup>, where expression of the transgene for both is detectable by HA staining. In both mouse models, suprabasal cells with increased contractility (at E16.5 and later) did not express the spinous marker MafB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7C,E</xref>), even when they were positioned in the first layers on top of basal cells, where they should clearly be spinous cells. In contrast, these cells precociously expressed the granular marker Tgm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7D,F</xref>). Similar results were obtained in back and glabrous skin of K10-Arhgef11<sup>CA</sup> adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Fig 7, Supplement 2</xref>), and at E17.5, when suprabasal contractility was induced after initial spinous cell specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Fig 7, Supplement 3</xref>). These latter results suggest that the effects of increased suprabasal contractility are the same regardless of the time of its induction.</p>
<p>Analysis of the IC marker Scara5 revealed that increasing suprabasal contractility did not alter Scara5 mRNA levels in HA+ cells compared to controls; suggesting that contractility induces a granular-like rather than intermediate-like cell type in mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7G</xref>).</p>
<p>YAP concentrates within the nucleus in suprabasal epidermal cells in both of our mouse models that increase contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ning et al., 2021</xref>), and YAP is also localized to the nucleus in granular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Fig 6, Supplement 1</xref>). To test the role of YAP in inducing a granular-like state, we again used the mouse model K10-YAP<sup>CA</sup>. We observed that inducing active YAP did not induce Tgm1 in spinous cells and did not suppress the expression of MafB, the spinous cell marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Fig 7, Supplement 4</xref>). These data suggest that YAP activation lies downstream of contractility but is not sufficient to induce the effects observed by increased contractility in spinous cells. In addition to YAP activation, stretching of keratinocytes results in epigenetic changes, including an increase in H3K27me3 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Le et al., 2016</xref>). However, inducing contractility did not cause a significant change in nuclear levels of this epigenetic mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Fig 7, Supplement 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Embryonic epidermal cells coordinate their growth and differentiation to allow rapid stratification and barrier formation. Our data here characterize intermediate cells in epidermal development, revealing novel trajectories of cell differentiation. Further, our data directly demonstrate that actomyosin contractility in the developing epidermis can play an instructive role in differentiation – promoting granular-like gene expression and suppressing spinous markers.</p>
<p>Bulk RNA-Seq analysis has allowed us to characterize embryonic epidermal cells in greater depth. This revealed that basal cells undergo significant changes between E14.5 and E16.5, consistent with the fact that they generate distinct cell progeny at these time points (intermediate vs spinous cells). In addition, like suprabasal cells, basal cells at these time points also show differences in mechanical properties. Whether this is in response to changes in their physical environment or is mediated by internal timers remains unknown. That said, understanding specific markers and transcriptional regulators of these maturing basal cells may allow us to manipulate these transitions to maintain or bypass distinct stages of epidermal development.</p>
<p>Analysis of the intermediate cell transcriptome revealed an unexpected expression of granular genes in these transient cells. This gene expression program was especially enriched for lipid-modifying enzymes that play a key role in barrier formation. Lipids are synthesized in granular cells and stored in lamellar bodies, before secreting them to the intercellular spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Prado-Mantilla and Lechler, 2023</xref>; Vietri <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rudan and Watt, 2021</xref>). Our data suggest that this process may begin early in intermediate cells. In contrast, few EDC genes were upregulated in intermediate cells, suggesting that only parts of the granular program are expressed early in these cells, and many of the structural components of the eventual barrier are expressed only later.</p>
<p>Further, our short-term lineage tracing suggests that most intermediate cells transition into granular cells without going through a MafB+ (a spinous cell marker) stage. This reveals two distinct differentiation pathways leading to the granular cell state, one through intermediate cells during development, and one through spinous cells post-natally. This raises questions about whether each route will require distinct regulatory and transcriptional pathways.</p>
<p>Finally, our data revealed mechanical similarities between intermediate and granular cells, in addition to their similarities at the transcriptomic level. Actomyosin regulators were transcriptionally upregulated in both of these cell types as compared to spinous cells, and we were able to validate these findings in intact skin. Importantly, we found that contractility was sufficient to induce granular-like gene expression and to repress some spinous cell markers. This reveals a rather direct effect of contractility lying upstream, as well as presumably downstream, of differentiation pathways. It also explains the observation that increased contractility results in premature formation of the epidermal barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Muroyama and Lechler, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ning et al., 2021</xref>). It has been appreciated for some time that granular cells have increased actomyosin contractility, which is important for the function and placement of tight junctions specifically in this layer of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Itoh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Prado-Mantilla and Lechler, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rubsam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sumigray et al., 2012</xref>). There are many intriguing possibilities for how contractility may affect cell fates, such as mechanosensitive transcriptional regulators that mediate this effect. We tested a possible role for YAP1, a transcriptional regulator whose activation is induced by contractility in the epidermis. We found that active YAP1 was insufficient to drive these gene expression changes. Future work is required to determine the mechanism of mechanosensitive differentiation in the epidermis. The epidermis increases contractility in response to externally applied forces that result in stretch, and in response to perturbation of cell adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aragona et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sumigray et al., 2014</xref>). It will be important to test whether these stimuli alter differentiation pathways through their effects on contractility.</p>
<p>Of note, we found that contractility had a strong effect on the EDC, whose positioning within the nucleus changes with differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gdula et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Mardaryev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Williams et al., 2002</xref>). This suggests that aspects of epigenetics and chromatin organization may be downstream of contractility, as shown by external forces directly stretching chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Tajik et al., 2016</xref>) and extrinsic topographical cues constricting the nucleus to induce chromatin reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Notably, we found that there is a decrease in mRNA levels of Sun1 and Nesprin1/3, parts of a complex that tether the actin cytoskeleton in the cytoplasm to chromatin in the nucleus when contractility is increased, in hypercontractile cells. Loss of Sun1/2 also leads to precocious differentiation in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Carley et al., 2021</xref>) through effects on integrin-mediated mechanical integration, though whether regulation of these connections mediates the contractility effect seen in suprabasal cells will require further investigation.</p>

<p>K10-rtTA;TRE-H2B-GFP;K14-RFP pregnant dams were all fed with doxycycline chow at E12.5, and then sacrificed at either E14.5 or E16.5. Embryos were checked under a dissecting microscope for GFP and RFP expression before use, and their tails were taken to confirm genotypes. E16.5 back skins were cut off and treated with 1.4 U/ml dispase II (Roche, 4942078001) in HBSS at room temperature for 1 hour, then peeled off the epidermis from the dermis. The epidermis of E14.5 back skin was not peeled off due to its low thickness. Both E16.5 epidermis and E14.5 skin samples were digested in 1:1 trypsin (GIBCO, 25200-056) with versene (GIBCO, 15040-066) at 37°C and rotated for 20 minutes. Samples were then mixed 1:1 with FACS buffer (HBSS with 2.5% FBS and 10 μg/ml DNAaseI) and centrifuged at low speed. The cell pellet was diluted into FACS buffer with propidium iodide solution (Sigma, P4864, to exclude dead cells), and filtered using sterile Celltrics 30 μm filters (Sysmex, 04-004-2326). The lectin UEA1 (Ulex europaeus agglutinin I) binds to carbohydrates in cell surfaces present in uppermost keratinocytes. To exclude them, we used biotinylated UEA1 (Vector Laboratories, B-1065) and detected them with APC-streptavidin (BioLegend, 405207). The E14.5 intermediate cells (K10-GFP<sup>+</sup>;K14-RFP<sup>-</sup>;APC-UEA1<sup>-</sup>), E16.5 spinous cells (K10-GFP<sup>+</sup>;K14-RFP<sup>-</sup>;APC-UEA1<sup>-</sup>), and basal cells at E14.5 and E16.5 (K10-GFP<sup>-</sup>;K14-RFP<sup>+</sup>) cells were FACS sorted separately. RNA was extracted using a QIAGEN RNAeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, 74104) following the manufacturer’s protocols, with DNA digested using RNase-Free DNase (QIAGEN, 79254). Biological replicates, three independent RNA samples from each cell population, were collected and sent for sequencing and analysis by Novogene.</p>

<title>RNA-Seq analysis</title>
<p>Differential expression analysis between two time points or cell types (three biological replicates per group) was performed using the DESeq2 R package. The gene signature of a cell population was obtained by the overlapping genes that were enriched compared to the suprabasal cells at a different time point and enriched compared to the basal cells at its corresponding time point. A significance threshold of adj p-value &lt; 0.05, log2 fold change≥ 1 and FPKM≥ 1 was used for defining marker genes of each cell population.</p>
<p>GO term analysis for differentially expressed genes and gene signatures was performed using the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>; Gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ontology et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>FPKM of differentially expressed genes in the contractome list were log2-transformed and used for heatmaps. Heatmaps were generated using the online resource Heatmapper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babicki et al., 2016</xref>), using the average linkage clustering method and Pearson’s distance measurement methods.</p>
<p>PCA plot of all cell population data was generated using the web tool Clustvis: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biit.cs.ut.ee/clustvis/">https://biit.cs.ut.ee/clustvis/</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Metsalu and Vilo, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Granular cell signature was determined from genes significantly upregulated in ETA sheets vs epidermal sheets (p-value &lt; 0.05, log2 fold change≥ 1) obtained from the previously published dataset: GSE168011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Matsui et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>Fresh tissue was embedded in OCT (Sakura), frozen, and sectioned at 10 μm using a cryostat. Sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 8 minutes at room temperature or ice-cold acetone (for Tgm1 and St8sia6 staining) for 2 minutes, washed with PBS containing 0.2% Triton (PBST) for 5 minutes, then blocked with blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin with 5% normal goat serum (Gibco, 16210064), and 5% normal donkey serum (Sigma-Aldrich, D9663) in PBST) for 15 minutes. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1h at room temperature (α18 antibody was incubated for 15 minutes), then three times washed with PBST, and incubated in secondary antibodies and stains, such as Hoechst 34580 or Phalloidin, for 15 minutes at room temperature. After three washes with PBST, sections were finally mounted in the anti-fade buffer (90% glycerol in PBS plus 2.5 mg/ml p-Phenylenediamine (Thermo Fisher, 417481000)) and sealed using clear nail polish in the borders.</p>
<p>Primary antibodies used in this study: rat anti-HA (Sigma-Aldrich, 11867423001), chicken anti-keratin 5/14 (generated in the Lechler lab), rabbit anti-keratin 10 (Covance, 905401), guinea pig anti-keratin 10 (Progen, GP-K10), rat anti-β4 integrin (BD Biosciences, 553745), rabbit anti-MyosinIIA (Biolegend, PRB-440P), rat anti-α18 (gift from Akira Nagafuchi, Kumamoto University), rabbit anti-YAP/TAZ (Cell Signaling Technology, 8418S), rabbit anti-Tgm1(Proteintech,12912-3-AP), rabbit anti-MafB (Novus, NBP1-81342), rabbit anti-St8sia6 (Sigma, HPA011635), rabbit anti-Abca12 (gift from Dr. Wong, University of Michigan). F-actin was stained with phalloidin-488 (Invitrogen, A12379).</p>

<title>EdU labeling</title>
<p>Pregnant dams were intraperitoneally injected with 10 mg/kg of EdU and sacrificed after 1 hour for tissue dissection. Back skins of embryos were collected, and tails were taken for genotyping. Tissue sections were fixed with 4% PFA and stained with primary and secondary antibodies, then EdU was detected following Click-iT EdU (Thermo Fisher, C10337) protocol.</p>

<sec id="s4h">
<title>Lineage tracing/pulse-chase</title>
<p>K10-rtTA;TRE-H2B-GFP pregnant dams were intraperitoneally injected with a low dose of doxycycline (1mg/kg) at E14.5 to label only intermediate cells. Dams were sacrificed, and their embryos were collected after 1 day (E15.5), 2 days (E16.5), or 4 days (E18.5) for tissue dissection. Their tails were kept for genotyping and K10-rtTA;TRE-H2B-GFP embryos were sectioned and analyzed.</p>

<title>RNA-Scope</title>
<p>RNAScope was performed using the Multiplex Fluorescent v1 and v2 systems (ACD, 323100) followed by antibody co-staining. Back skins from mouse embryos were freshly frozen in OCT and sectioned at 10 μm. Tissue sections were fixed for 1 hour with 4% PFA at 4°C. After fixation, standard RNAScope protocols were used according to manufacturer’s instructions. The following probes were used: St8sia6 (ACD, 887831-C1) and Scara5 (ACD, 522301-C1). TSA Vivid Fluorophore 570 (ACD, 323272) was used to develop probe signal. Then, antibody staining was performed to quantify the probe signal in suprabasal cells, using guinea pig anti-keratin 10 antibody, and in basal cells, using chicken anti-keratin 5/14. HA+ cells were marked with rat anti-HA or rabbit anti-MafB (for K10-MafB samples). Coverslips were mounted using Prolong Gold (Invitrogen, P10144).</p>

<title>Imaging</title>
<p>For live imaging of K10+ cell division, prepared skin explants were placed upside down in a Lumox dish 35 (Sarstedt, 94.6077.331) with the epidermal side facing toward the membrane. Samples were imaged at 15 minute-intervals overnight using the MetaMorph software on an Andor XD revolution spinning disc confocal microscope at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> using a 20x/0.5 UplanFl N dry objective.</p>
<p>For immunofluorescence staining, tissue sections were imaged on a Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope with Apotome.2 attachment, Plan-APOCHROMAT 20X/0.8 objective, Plan-NEOFLUAR 40X/1.3 oil objective, or Plan-NEOFLUAR 63X/1.4 oil objective, Axiocam 506 mono camera, and acquired using Zen software (Zeiss). When making intensity measurement comparisons, all images within one experiment were taken with identical exposure times.</p>

<sec id="s4k">
<title>Image quantification and statistics</title>
<p>All image quantifications were done using FIJI software. Quantifications of fluorescence intensity of cortical F-actin, Myosin IIA and α18 were measured by drawing 10-pixel wide lines across cell-cell boundaries. Maximum values from plot profiles were aligned to yield the final line scan plots. The mean of the maximum values of each line scan was calculated per mouse and compared between conditions or time points to determine statistical significance.</p>
<p>EdU, Scara5, St8sia6, YAP and MafB measurements were determined by calculating the percentage of the number of positive cells in the total number of suprabasal cells in the first two suprabasal layers adjacent to basal cells. Quantifications are from at least three fields per mouse.</p>
<p>Tgm1 average fluorescence intensity was calculated by measuring the mean value of suprabasal cells above basal cells. This area was defined by drawing 50-pixel width lines in the suprabasal area, along the labeled basal layer, using the Freehand line tool in FIJI.</p>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 10 software. Data shown in bar plots was presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and significance was determined using two-tailed Student’s t-test, or, for multiple comparisons, one-way or two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s or Sidak tests. Further details in statistical analysis were specified in figure legends. Data were determined to be statistically significant when p value &lt; 0.05. Asterisks denote statistical significance (ns = not significant, *: p &lt; 0.05, **: p &lt; 0.01, ***: p &lt; 0.001, ****: p &lt; 0.0001).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors address a fundamental question for cell and tissue biology using the skin epidermis as a paradigm and ask how stratifying self-renewing epithelia induce differentiation and upward migration in basal dividing progenitor cells to generate suprabasal barrier-forming cells that are essential for a functional barrier formed by such an epithelium. The authors show for the first time that an increase in intracellular actomyosin contractility, a hallmark of barrier-forming keratinocytes, is sufficient to trigger terminal differentiation. Hence the data provide in vivo evidence of the more general interdependency of cell mechanics and differentiation. The data appear to be of high quality and the evidences are strengthened through a combination of different genetic mouse models, RNA sequencing, and immunofluorescence analysis.</p>
<p>To generate and maintain the multilayered, barrier-forming epidermis, keratinocytes of the basal stem cell layer differentiate and move suprabasally accompanied by stepwise changes not only in gene expression but also in cell morphology, mechanics, and cell position. Whether any of these changes is instructive for differentiation itself and whether consecutive changes in differentiation are required remains unclear. Also, there are few comprehensive data sets on the exact changes in gene expression between different states of keratinocyte differentiation. In this study, through genetic fluorescence labeling of cell states at different developmental time points the authors were able to analyze gene expression of basal stem cells and suprabasal differentiated cells at two different stages of maturation: E14 (embryonic day 14) when the epidermis comprises mostly two functional compartments (basal stem cells and suprabasal so-called intermediate cells) and E16 when the epidermis comprise three (living) compartments where the spinous layer separates basal stem cells from the barrier-forming granular layer, as is the case in adult epidermis. Using RNA bulk sequencing, the authors developed useful new markers for suprabasal stages of differentiation like MafB and Cox1. The transcription factor MafB was then shown to inhibit suprabasal proliferation in a MafB transgenic model.</p>
<p>The data indicate that early in development at E14 the suprabasal intermediate cells resemble in terms of RNA expression, the barrier-forming granular layer at E16, suggesting that keratinocytes can undergo either stepwise (E16) or more direct (E14) terminal differentiation.</p>
<p>Previous studies by several groups found an increased actomyosin contractility in the barrier-forming granular layer and showed that this increase in tension is important for epidermal barrier formation and function. However, it was not clear whether contractility itself serves as an instructive signal for differentiation. To address this question, the authors use a previously published model to induce premature hypercontractility in the spinous layer by using spastin overexpression (K10-Spastin) to disrupt microtubules (MT) thereby indirectly inducing actomyosin contractility. A second model activates myosin contractility more directly through overexpression of a constitutively active RhoA GEF (K10-Arhgef11CA). Both models induce late differentiation of suprabasal keratinocytes regardless of the suprabasal position in either spinous or granular layer indicating that increased contractility is key to induce late differentiation of granular cells. A potential weakness of the K10-spastin model is the disruption of MT as the primary effect which secondarily causes hypercontractility. However, their previous publications provided some evidence that the effect on differentiation is driven by the increase in contractility (Ning et al. cell stem cell 2021). Moreover, the data are confirmed by the second model directly activating myosin through RhoA. These previous publications already indicated a role for contractility in differentiation but were focused on early differentiation. The data in this manuscript focus on the regulation of late differentiation in barrier-forming cells. These important data help to unravel the interdependencies of cell position, mechanical state, and differentiation in the epidermis, suggesting that an increase in cellular contractility in most apical positions within the epidermis can induce terminal differentiation. Importantly the authors show that despite contractility-induced nuclear localization of the mechanoresponsive transcription factor YAP in the barrier-forming granular layer, YAP nuclear localization is not sufficient to drive premature differentiation when forced to the nucleus in the spinous layer.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a well-written manuscript and a comprehensive dataset. Only the RNA sequencing result should be presented more transparently providing the full lists of regulated genes instead of presenting just the GO analysis and selected target genes so that this analysis can serve as a useful repository. The authors themselves have profited from and used published datasets of gene expression of the granular cells. Moreover, some of the previous data should be better discussed though. The authors state that forced suprabasal contractility in their mouse models induces the expression of some genes of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC). However, in their previous publication, the authors showed that major classical EDC genes are actually not regulated like filaggrin and loricrin (Muroyama and Lechler eLife 2017). This should be discussed better and necessitates including the full list of regulated genes to show what exactly is regulated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript from Prado-Mantilla and co-workers addresses mechanisms of embryonic epidermis development, focusing on the intermediate layer cells, a transient population of suprabasal cells that contributes to the expansion of the epidermis through proliferation. Using bulk-RNA they show that these cells are transcriptionally distinct from the suprabasal spinous cells and identify specific marker genes for these populations. They then use transgenesis to demonstrate that one of these selected spinous layer-specific markers, the transcription factor MafB is capable of suppressing proliferation in the intermediate layers, providing a potential explanation for the shift of suprabasal cells into a non-proliferative state during development. Further, lineage tracing experiments show that the intermediate cells become granular cells without a spinous layer intermediate. Finally, the authors show that the intermediate layer cells express higher levels of contractility-related genes than spinous layers and overexpression of cytoskeletal regulators accelerates the differentiation of spinous layer cells into granular cells.</p>
<p>Overall the manuscript presents a number of interesting observations on the developmental stage-specific identities of suprabasal cells and their differentiation trajectories and points to a potential role of contractility in promoting differentiation of suprabasal cells into granular cells. The precise mechanisms by which MafB suppresses proliferation, how the intermediate cells bypass the spinous layer stage to differentiate into granular cells, and how contractility feeds into these mechanisms remain open. Interestingly, while the mechanosensitive transcription factor YAP appears deferentially active in the two states, it is shown to be downstream rather than upstream of the observed differences in mechanics.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use a nice combination of RNA sequencing, imaging, lineage tracing, and transgenesis to address the suprabasal to granular layer transition. The imaging is convincing and the biological effects appear robust. The manuscript is clearly written and logical to follow.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the data overall supports the authors' claims, there are a few minor weaknesses that pertain to the aspect of the role of contractility, The choice of spastin overexpression to modulate contractility is not ideal as spastin has multiple roles in regulating microtubule dynamics and membrane transport which could also be potential mechanisms explaining some of the phenotypes. Use of Arghap11 overexpression mitigates this effect to some extent but overall it would have been more convincing to manipulate myosin activity directly. It would also be important to show that these manipulations increase the levels of F-actin and myosin II as shown for the intermediate layer. It would also be logical to address if further increasing contractility in the intermediate layer would enhance the differentiation of these cells.</p>
<p>The gene expression analyses are relatively superficial and rely heavily on GO term analyses which are of course informative but do not give the reader a good sense of what kind of genes and transcriptional programs are regulated. It would be useful to show volcano plots or heatmaps of actual gene expression changes as well as to perform additional analyses of for example gene set enrichment and/or transcription factor enrichment analyses to better describe the transcriptional programs</p>
<p>Claims of changes in cell division/proliferation changes are made exclusively by quantifying EdU incorporation. It would be useful to more directly look at mitosis. At minimum Y-axis labels should be changed from &quot;% Dividing cells&quot; to % EdU+ cells to more accurately represent findings</p>
<p>Despite these minor weaknesses the manuscript is overall of high quality, sheds new light on the fundamental mechanisms of epidermal stratification during embryogenesis, and will likely be of interest to the skin research community.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an interesting paper by Lechler and colleagues describing the transcriptomic signature and fate of intermediate cells (ICs), a transient and poorly defined embryonic cell type in the skin. ICs are the first suprabasal cells in the stratifying skin and unlike later-developing suprabasal cells, ICs continue to divide. Using bulk RNA seq to compare ICs to spinous and granular transcriptomes, the authors find that IC-specific gene signatures include hallmarks of granular cells, such as genes involved in lipid metabolism and skin barrier function that are not expressed in spinous cells. ICs were assumed to differentiate into spinous cells, but lineage tracing convincingly shows ICs differentiate directly into granular cells without passing through a spinous intermediate. Rather, basal cells give rise to the first spinous cells. They further show that transcripts associated with contractility are also shared signatures of ICs and granular cells, and overexpression of two contractility inducers (Spastin and ArhGEF-CA) can induce granular and repress spinous gene expression. This contractility-induced granular gene expression does not appear to be mediated by the mechanosensitive transcription factor, Yap. The paper also identifies new markers that distinguish IC and spinous layers and shows the spinous signature gene, MafB, is sufficient to repress proliferation when prematurely expressed in ICs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall this is a well-executed study, and the data are clearly presented and the findings convincing. It provides an important contribution to the skin field by characterizing the features and fate of ICs, a much-understudied cell type, at high levels of spatial and transcriptomic detail. The conclusions challenge the assumption that ICs are spinous precursors through compelling lineage tracing data. The demonstration that differentiation can be induced by cell contractility is an intriguing finding and adds a growing list of examples where cell mechanics influence gene expression and differentiation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A weakness of the study is an over-reliance on overexpression and sufficiency experiments to test the contributions of MafB, Yap, and contractility in differentiation. The inclusion of loss-of-function approaches would enable one to determine if, for example, contractility is required for the transition of ICs to granular fate, and whether MafB is required for spinous fate. Second, whether the induction of contractility-associated genes is accompanied by measurable changes in the physical properties or mechanics of the IC and granular layers is not directly shown. The inclusion of physical measurements would bolster the conclusion that mechanics lies upstream of differentiation.</p>
<p>Finally, whether the expression of granular-associated genes in ICs provides them with some sort of barrier function in the embryo is not addressed, so the role of ICs in epidermal development remains unclear. Although not essential to support the conclusions of this study, insights into the function of this transient cell layer would strengthen the overall impact.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors address a fundamental question for cell and tissue biology using the skin epidermis as a paradigm and ask how stratifying self-renewing epithelia induce diCerentiation and upward migration in basal dividing progenitor cells to generate suprabasal barrier-forming cells that are essential for a functional barrier formed by such an epithelium. The authors show for the first time that an increase in intracellular actomyosin contractility, a hallmark of barrier-forming keratinocytes, is suCicient to trigger terminal diCerentiation. Hence the data provide in vivo evidence of the more general interdependency of cell mechanics and diCerentiation. The data appear to be of high quality and the evidences are strengthened through a combination of diCerent genetic mouse models, RNA sequencing, and immunofluorescence analysis.</p>
<p>To generate and maintain the multilayered, barrier-forming epidermis, keratinocytes of the basal stem cell layer diCerentiate and move suprabasally accompanied by stepwise changes not only in gene expression but also in cell morphology, mechanics, and cell position. Whether any of these changes is instructive for diCerentiation itself and whether consecutive changes in diCerentiation are required remains unclear. Also, there are few comprehensive data sets on the exact changes in gene expression between diCerent states of keratinocyte diCerentiation. In this study, through genetic fluorescence labeling of cell states at diCerent developmental time points the authors were able to analyze gene expression of basal stem cells and suprabasal diCerentiated cells at two diCerent stages of maturation: E14 (embryonic day 14) when the epidermis comprises mostly two functional compartments (basal stem cells and suprabasal so-called intermediate cells) and E16 when the epidermis comprise three (living) compartments where the spinous layer separates basal stem cells from the barrier-forming granular layer, as is the case in adult epidermis. Using RNA bulk sequencing, the authors developed useful new markers for suprabasal stages of diCerentiation like MafB and Cox1. The transcription factor MafB was then shown to inhibit suprabasal proliferation in a MafB transgenic model.</p>
<p>The data indicate that early in development at E14 the suprabasal intermediate cells resemble in terms of RNA expression, the barrier-forming granular layer at E16, suggesting that keratinocytes can undergo either stepwise (E16) or more direct (E14) terminal diCerentiation.</p>
<p>Previous studies by several groups found an increased actomyosin contractility in the barrier-forming granular layer and showed that this increase in tension is important for epidermal barrier formation and function. However, it was not clear whether contractility itself serves as an instructive signal for diCerentiation. To address this question, the authors use a previously published model to induce premature hypercontractility in the spinous layer by using spastin overexpression (K10-Spastin) to disrupt microtubules (MT) thereby indirectly inducing actomyosin contractility. A second model activates myosin contractility more directly through overexpression of a constitutively active RhoA GEF (K10Arhgef11CA). Both models induce late diCerentiation of suprabasal keratinocytes regardless of the suprabasal position in either spinous or granular layer indicating that increased contractility is key to induce late diCerentiation of granular cells. A potential weakness of the K10-spastin model is the disruption of MT as the primary eCect which secondarily causes hypercontractility. However, their previous publications provided some evidence that the eCect on diCerentiation is driven by the increase in contractility (Ning et al. cell stem cell 2021). Moreover, the data are confirmed by the second model directly activating myosin through RhoA. These previous publications already indicated a role for contractility in diCerentiation but were focused on early diCerentiation. The data in this manuscript focus on the regulation of late diCerentiation in barrier-forming cells. These important data help to unravel the interdependencies of cell position, mechanical state, and diCerentiation in the epidermis, suggesting that an increase in cellular contractility in most apical positions within the epidermis can induce terminal diCerentiation. Importantly the authors show that despite contractility-induced nuclear localization of the mechanoresponsive transcription factor YAP in the barrier-forming granular layer, YAP nuclear localization is not suCicient to drive premature diCerentiation when forced to the nucleus in the spinous layer.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a well-written manuscript and a comprehensive dataset. Only the RNA sequencing result should be presented more transparently providing the full lists of regulated genes instead of presenting just the GO analysis and selected target genes so that this analysis can serve as a useful repository. The authors themselves have profited from and used published datasets of gene expression of the granular cells. Moreover, some of the previous data should be better discussed though. The authors state that forced suprabasal contractility in their mouse models induces the expression of some genes of the epidermal diCerentiation complex (EDC). However, in their previous publication, the authors showed that major classical EDC genes are actually not regulated like filaggrin and loricrin (Muroyama and Lechler eLife 2017). This should be discussed better and necessitates including the full list of regulated genes to show what exactly is regulated.</p>

<p>We thank all the reviewers for their suggestions and comments.</p>
<p>Thank you especially for the reminder to include gene lists. We had an excel document with all this data but neglected to upload it with the initial manuscript decision. This includes all the gene signatures for the diCerent cell compartments across development. We will also include a page that lists all EDC genes and whether they were up-regulated in intermediate cells and cells in which contractility was induced. Further, we note that all the RNA-Seq datasets are available for use on GEO.</p>
<p>In our previous publication, we indeed included images showing a lack of change in loricrin and filaggrin in the embryos where spastin was expressed in the diCerentiated epidermis. Consistent with this, there is no change in Lor mRNA levels by RNA-Seq, (it is one of the rare EDC genes that is unchanged). In contrast, Flg mRNA was up in the RNASeq, though we didn’t see a dramatic change in protein levels. We have not further pursued whether this reflects translational regulation.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript from Prado-Mantilla and co-workers addresses mechanisms of embryonic epidermis development, focusing on the intermediate layer cells, a transient population of suprabasal cells that contributes to the expansion of the epidermis through proliferation. Using bulk-RNA they show that these cells are transcriptionally distinct from the suprabasal spinous cells and identify specific marker genes for these populations. They then use transgenesis to demonstrate that one of these selected spinous layer-specific markers, the transcription factor MafB is capable of suppressing proliferation in the intermediate layers, providing a potential explanation for the shift of suprabasal cells into a non-proliferative state during development. Further, lineage tracing experiments show that the intermediate cells become granular cells without a spinous layer intermediate. Finally, the authors show that the intermediate layer cells express higher levels of contractilityrelated genes than spinous layers and overexpression of cytoskeletal regulators accelerates the diCerentiation of spinous layer cells into granular cells.</p>
<p>Overall the manuscript presents a number of interesting observations on the developmental stage-specific identities of suprabasal cells and their diCerentiation trajectories and points to a potential role of contractility in promoting diCerentiation of suprabasal cells into granular cells. The precise mechanisms by which MafB suppresses proliferation, how the intermediate cells bypass the spinous layer stage to diCerentiate into granular cells, and how contractility feeds into these mechanisms remain open. Interestingly, while the mechanosensitive transcription factor YAP appears deferentially active in the two states, it is shown to be downstream rather than upstream of the observed diCerences in mechanics.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use a nice combination of RNA sequencing, imaging, lineage tracing, and transgenesis to address the suprabasal to granular layer transition. The imaging is convincing and the biological eCects appear robust. The manuscript is clearly written and logical to follow.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the data overall supports the authors' claims, there are a few minor weaknesses that pertain to the aspect of the role of contractility, The choice of spastin overexpression to modulate contractility is not ideal as spastin has multiple roles in regulating microtubule dynamics and membrane transport which could also be potential mechanisms explaining some of the phenotypes. Use of Arghap11 overexpression mitigates this eCect to some extent but overall it would have been more convincing to manipulate myosin activity directly. It would also be important to show that these manipulations increase the levels of F-actin and myosin II as shown for the intermediate layer. It would also be logical to address if further increasing contractility in the intermediate layer would enhance the diCerentiation of these cells.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer that the development of additional tools to precisely control myosin activity will be of great use to the field. That said, our series of publications has clearly demonstrated that ablating microtubules results in increased contractility and that this phenocopies the eCects of Arhgef11 induced contractility (Ning et al, Cell Stem Cell 2021). Further, we showed that these phenotypes were rescued by myosin inhibition with blebbistatin. Our prior publications also showed a clear increase in junctional acto-myosin through expression of either spastin or Arhgef11, as well as increased staining for the tension sensitive epitope of alpha-catenin (alpha-18) (also in Ning et al, 2021).  We are not aware of tools that allow direct manipulation of myosin activity that currently exist in mouse models.</p>

<p>The gene expression analyses are relatively superficial and rely heavily on GO term analyses which are of course informative but do not give the reader a good sense of what kind of genes and transcriptional programs are regulated. It would be useful to show volcano plots or heatmaps of actual gene expression changes as well as to perform additional analyses of for example gene set enrichment and/or transcription factor enrichment analyses to better describe the transcriptional programs</p>

<p>We will include an excel document that lists all the gene signatures. Additionally, all of our data are deposited in GEO for others to perform their own analyses.</p>

<p>Claims of changes in cell division/proliferation changes are made exclusively by quantifying EdU incorporation. It would be useful to more directly look at mitosis. At minimum Y-axis labels should be changed from &quot;% Dividing cells&quot; to % EdU+ cells to more accurately represent findings</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an interesting paper by Lechler and colleagues describing the transcriptomic signature and fate of intermediate cells (ICs), a transient and poorly defined embryonic cell type in the skin. ICs are the first suprabasal cells in the stratifying skin and unlike laterdeveloping suprabasal cells, ICs continue to divide. Using bulk RNA seq to compare ICs to spinous and granular transcriptomes, the authors find that IC-specific gene signatures include hallmarks of granular cells, such as genes involved in lipid metabolism and skin barrier function that are not expressed in spinous cells. ICs were assumed to diCerentiate into spinous cells, but lineage tracing convincingly shows ICs diCerentiate directly into granular cells without passing through a spinous intermediate. Rather, basal cells give rise to the first spinous cells. They further show that transcripts associated with contractility are also shared signatures of ICs and granular cells, and overexpression of two contractility inducers (Spastin and ArhGEF-CA) can induce granular and repress spinous gene expression. This contractility-induced granular gene expression does not appear to be mediated by the mechanosensitive transcription factor, Yap. The paper also identifies new markers that distinguish IC and spinous layers and shows the spinous signature gene, MafB, is suCicient to repress proliferation when prematurely expressed in ICs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall this is a well-executed study, and the data are clearly presented and the findings convincing. It provides an important contribution to the skin field by characterizing the features and fate of ICs, a much-understudied cell type, at high levels of spatial and transcriptomic detail. The conclusions challenge the assumption that ICs are spinous precursors through compelling lineage tracing data. The demonstration that diCerentiation can be induced by cell contractility is an intriguing finding and adds a growing list of examples where cell mechanics influence gene expression and diCerentiation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A weakness of the study is an over-reliance on overexpression and suCiciency experiments to test the contributions of MafB, Yap, and contractility in diCerentiation. The inclusion of loss-of-function approaches would enable one to determine if, for example, contractility is required for the transition of ICs to granular fate, and whether MafB is required for spinous fate. Second, whether the induction of contractility-associated genes is accompanied by measurable changes in the physical properties or mechanics of the IC and granular layers is not directly shown. The inclusion of physical measurements would bolster the conclusion that mechanics lies upstream of diCerentiation.</p>

<p>We agree that loss of function studies would be useful. For MafB, these have been performed in cultured human keratinocytes, where loss of MafB and its ortholog cMaf results in a phenotype consistent with loss of spinous diCerentiation (Lopes-Pajares, Dev Cell 2015). Due to the complex genetics involved, generating these double mutant mice is beyond the scope of this study. Loss of function studies of myosin are also complicated by genetic redundancy of the non-muscle type II myosin genes, as well as the role for these myosins in actin cross linking in addition to contractility. In addition, we have found that these myosins are quite stable in the embryonic intestine, with loss of protein delayed by several days from the induction of recombination. Therefore, elimination of myosins by embryonic day e14.5 with our current drivers is not likely possible. Thus, generation of inducible inhibitors of contractility is a valuable future goal.</p>
<p>A number of recent papers have used AFM of skin sections to probe tissue rigidity. We have not attempted these studies and are unclear about the spatial resolution and whether, in the very thin epidermis at these stages we could spatially resolve diCerences. That said, we previously assessed the macro-contractility of tissues in which myosin activity was induced and demonstrated that there was a significant increase in this over a tissue-wide scale (Ning et al, Cell Stem Cell, 2021).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, whether the expression of granular-associated genes in ICs provides them with some sort of barrier function in the embryo is not addressed, so the role of ICs in epidermal development remains unclear. Although not essential to support the conclusions of this study, insights into the function of this transient cell layer would strengthen the overall impact.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>By traditional dye penetration assays, there is no epidermal barrier at the time that intermediate cells exist. One interpretation of the data is that cells are beginning to express mRNAs (and in some cases, proteins) so that they are able to rapidly generate a barrier as they become granular cells. We have attempted experiments to ablate intermediate cells with DTA expression - this resulted in ineCicient and delayed cell death and thus did not yield strong conclusions. Our findings that transcriptional regulators of granular diCerentiation (such as Grhl3 and Hopx) are also present in intermediate cells, should allow future analysis of the eCects of their ablation on the earliest stages of granular diCerentiation from intermediate cells.</p>
