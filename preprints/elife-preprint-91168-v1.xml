<title>Abstract</title><p>The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) is critical for the production of functional viral proteins during infection and, like many viral proteases, can also target host proteins to subvert their cellular functions. Here, we show that the human tRNA methyltransferase TRMT1 can be recognized and cleaved by SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>. TRMT1 installs the N2,N2-dimethylguanosine (m2,2G) modification on mammalian tRNAs, which promotes global protein synthesis and cellular redox homeostasis. We find that M<sup>pro</sup> can cleave endogenous TRMT1 in human cell lysate, resulting in removal of the TRMT1 zinc finger domain required for tRNA modification activity in cells. Evolutionary analysis shows that the TRMT1 cleavage site is highly conserved in mammals, except in Muroidea, where TRMT1 may be resistant to cleavage. In primates, regions outside the cleavage site with rapid evolution could indicate adaptation to ancient viral pathogens. We determined the structure of a TRMT1 peptide in complex with M<sup>pro</sup>, revealing a substrate binding conformation distinct from the majority of available M<sup>pro</sup>-peptide complexes. Kinetic parameters for peptide cleavage showed that the TRMT1(526-536) sequence is cleaved with comparable efficiency to the M<sup>pro</sup>-targeted nsp8/9 viral cleavage site. Mutagenesis studies and molecular dynamics simulations together indicate that kinetic discrimination occurs during a later step of M<sup>pro</sup>-mediated proteolysis that follows substrate binding. Our results provide new information about the structural basis for M<sup>pro</sup> substrate recognition and cleavage that could help inform future therapeutic design and raise the possibility that proteolysis of human TRMT1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection suppresses protein translation and oxidative stress response to impact viral pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Viral proteases can strategically target human proteins to manipulate host biochemistry during infection. Here, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) can specifically recognize and cleave the human tRNA methyltransferase enzyme TRMT1, which installs a modification on human tRNAs that is critical for protein translation. Our structural and functional analysis of the M<sup>pro</sup>-TRMT1 interaction shows how the flexible M<sup>pro</sup> active site engages a conserved sequence in TRMT1 in an uncommon binding mode to catalyze its cleavage and inactivation.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in over 6 million deaths worldwide since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). The development of mRNA and other vaccines has played a large and critical role in reducing mortality since their introduction in 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), but a fundamental understanding of coronavirus host-protein interactions and biology continues to be an important goal to inform ongoing and future therapeutic design. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) is a well-studied antiviral drug target because its activity is essential for viral replication. More than 600 M<sup>pro</sup> crystal structures – the majority with bound small molecule inhibitors – are currently available in the protein databank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). M<sup>pro</sup> is necessary for the proteolysis of 11 different cleavage sites in the two SARS-CoV-2 extended viral polypeptides, which results in the liberation of mature non-structural proteins (nsps) that are essential for host infection and viral propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Approximately twenty structures of M<sup>pro</sup> in complex with different viral cleavage sequences have been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), in which the M<sup>pro</sup> homodimer has a peptide substrate bound to its active site (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). However, a detailed understanding of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> substrate selectivity and cleavage efficiency remains poorly defined, and the structural characterization of interactions between the viral protease and human host protein targets remains underexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>).</p>

<p>Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Gordon <italic>et al.</italic> expressed tagged SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T/17) and employed affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to map proteome-wide virus-host protein interactions, in which a putative interaction between catalytically inactive SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> (Cys145Ala) and the human tRNA methyltransferase TRMT1 was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Analogous AP-MS experiments with wild-type M<sup>pro</sup> found no stable interaction with TRMT1, and subsequent mapping with SARS-CoV-1 proteins also found a TRMT1 interaction exclusively with Cys145Ala M<sup>pro</sup>, suggesting that coronavirus M<sup>pro</sup> may recognize and actively cleave human TRMT1 in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). TRMT1 is a tRNA-modifying enzyme responsible for installing N<sup>2</sup>,N<sup>2</sup>-dimethylguanosine (m2,2G), an abundant tRNA modification found at the G26 position of human tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Human HEK293T cells lacking TRMT1, and therefore the m2,2G26 modification, have significantly decreased global protein synthesis and reduced proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Human neural stem cells with TRMT1 knockdowns were found to have hypersensitivity to redox stress, implicating TRMT1 and the m2,2G26 modification in the regulation of redox homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>-directed cleavage of TRMT1, and subsequent downregulation of tRNA m2,2G26 modification during infection, could therefore have direct impacts on both host and viral protein synthesis, as well as phenotypes linked to redox stress.</p>
<p>Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> proteolyzes endogenous human TRMT1 in human cell lysate and cleaves an amino acid sequence located between methyltransferase and zinc finger domains in TRMT1 with similar kinetic parameters to known viral polypeptide cleavage sites. We have determined the structure of M<sup>pro</sup> in complex with a TRMT1 peptide that shows how the viral protease recognizes and cleaves this human protein sequence and reveals a unique binding mode for the TRMT1 peptide in the M<sup>pro</sup> active site. Further kinetic analysis and molecular dynamics simulations show how the flexible M<sup>pro</sup> active site can accommodate and cleave diverse peptide sequences and geometries, and suggest that kinetic discrimination between substrate sequences occurs during later steps in M<sup>pro</sup>-catalyzed amide bond cleavage reaction. Like many viruses, SARS-CoV-2 hijacks and disrupts diverse host biochemical pathways thereby promoting viral replication and avoiding host detection and immunological response. Recent studies have identified a large number of human proteins that may be targeted and cleaved by M<sup>pro</sup>, many of which are involved in regulation of cellular proliferation, inflammatory response, transcription, translation, ubiquitination, apoptosis, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Our biochemical and structural data show that TRMT1 can be targeted and cleaved by the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. SARS-CoVs employ multiple strategies to alter host translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), and cleavage of TRMT1 and corresponding loss of the tRNA m2,2G26 modification may be another mechanism by which the virus is able to disrupt regulation of host protein synthesis. Furthermore, it is possible that proteolysis of TRMT1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection could contribute to some cellular pathogenesis observed with COVID-19.</p>

<title>Full-length TRMT1 is cleaved by SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 proteome-wide virus-host protein interaction maps identified a putative interaction between catalytically inactive M<sup>pro</sup> (Cys145Ala) and human TRMT1, but no such stable interaction was found using wild-type protease, suggesting M<sup>pro</sup> may target and cleave TRMT1 in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Human TRMT1 contains a peptide sequence (527–534) consistent with the cleavage consensus for M<sup>pro</sup>, located in an AlphaFold-predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) surface-exposed region (<bold>Figure S1</bold>) linking the TRMT1 N-terminal SAM-dependent methyltransferase (MTase) domain and the C-terminal zinc finger (ZF) domain (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). To determine if full-length (FL) TRMT1 is susceptible to cleavage by M<sup>pro</sup>, we first measured proteolysis of human TRMT1 expressed and enriched from <italic>E. coli</italic> by recombinant purified SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). TRMT1 was incubated with either catalytically inactive M<sup>pro</sup> Cys145Ala or active wild-type M<sup>pro</sup>, and TRMT1 cleavage was monitored by Western-blot using two TRMT1-specific polyclonal antibodies: a dual-domain recognizing antibody specific for portions of both the methyltransferase and zinc finger domain (anti-TRMT1 460-659), and a single-domain recognizing antibody specific for only the zinc finger domain (anti-TRMT1 609-659). As expected, FL TRMT1 (∼75kDa) was stable during a 2-hour incubation with inactive Cys145Ala M<sup>pro</sup>. However, when incubated with wild-type M<sup>pro</sup>, the intensity of the band corresponding to FL TRMT1, as measured by both TRMT1 antibodies, was reduced by &gt;90% after 2 hours. In Western blots with cleaved TRMT1, the dual domain-recognizing anti-TRMT1(460–659) antibody showed the appearance of two new lower molecular weight bands, corresponding to the anticipated molecular weights of the M<sup>pro</sup>-mediated TRMT1 cleavage products (∼61 kDa TRMT1 methyltransferase domain and ∼14 kDa TRMT1 zinc finger domain). After demonstrating that recombinant FL TRMT1 isolated from <italic>E. coli</italic> could be cleaved by SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>, we next asked whether endogenous TRMT1 from human cells could be similarly cleaved by the viral protease. HEK293T cell lysate was incubated with either Cys145Ala or WT M<sup>pro</sup>, and endogenous TRMT1 levels were monitored over time by Western blot (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). Incubation with Cys145Ala M<sup>pro</sup> resulted in no change to the FL TRMT1 band over the course of 10 hours, while incubation with wild-type M<sup>pro</sup> resulted in time-dependent proteolysis of FL TRMT1. Unlike in cleavage assays with recombinant TRMT1, no build-up of cleavage products was observed during M<sup>pro</sup>-mediated proteolysis of endogenous TRMT1, suggesting instability and rapid degradation of cleaved TRMT1 fragments in human cell lysate. Together, these experiments demonstrate that both recombinant FL TRMT1 and endogenous FL TRMT1 in human cell lysate are viable substrates for cleavage by SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>.</p>

<title>Structure of TRMT1 peptide bound to the M<sup>pro</sup> active site</title>
<p>To visualize how TRMT1 is recognized and cleaved by the viral protease active site, we determined the co-crystal structure of catalytically inactive Cys145Ala mutant M<sup>pro</sup> in complex with the TRMT1 peptide sequence corresponding to the expected cleavage site, human TRMT1 residues 526-536 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>, <bold>Table S1</bold>). The 1.9 Å resolution structure shows clear density for the TRMT1 peptide bound to the active site in one protomer of the M<sup>pro</sup> dimer (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>, <bold>Figure S2</bold>). As expected based on alignment with the M<sup>pro</sup> consensus cleavage sequence, TRMT1 Gln530 occupies the critical S1 subsite pocket in the M<sup>pro</sup> active site (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>), positioning the Gln530-Ala531 peptide bond directly adjacent to the His41/Cys145 catalytic dyad for proteolytic cleavage (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). TRMT1 Leu529 corresponds to substrate position P2 and occupies the hydrophobic M<sup>pro</sup> S2 pocket. TRMT1 peptide binding to M<sup>pro</sup> is mediated by key hydrogen bonding contacts, including M<sup>pro</sup> residues Phe140, His163, and Glu166 that specifically recognize TRMT1 Gln530, in addition to other interactions including M<sup>pro</sup> Thr24-TRMT1 Thr534, M<sup>pro</sup> Thr26-TRMT1 Asn532, M<sup>pro</sup> Asn142-TRMT1 Asn532, M<sup>pro</sup> Glu166-TRMT1 Arg528, and M<sup>pro</sup> Gln189-TRMT1 Leu529, which position the TRMT1 peptide in the M<sup>pro</sup> active site. These primary hydrogen bonding contacts are consistent with previous structures of M<sup>pro</sup> bound to viral peptide substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Importantly, the identified M<sup>pro</sup>-targeted residues in human TRMT1 are conserved in the human population (<italic>i.e.</italic>no missense polymorphisms), showing that human TRMT1 can be recognized and cleaved by SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>.</p>

<title>TRMT1 engages the M<sup>pro</sup> active site in a distinct binding conformation</title>
<p>M<sup>pro</sup> has more than 10 native viral polypeptide substrates with relatively high sequence variability outside the conserved P1 Gln and the adjacent P2 and P1′ residues. We compared our human TRMT1-bound M<sup>pro</sup> structure with available SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> structures bound to known viral polypeptide cleavage sequences (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>; nsp4/5, nsp5/6, nsp6/7, nsp8/9, nsp9/10, nsp10/11, and nsp15/16). The overall structures of M<sup>pro</sup> are very similar for all peptide-bound structures, with M<sup>pro</sup> backbone RMSD values all below 1.6 (<bold>Figure S3</bold>). Analysis of aligned peptide substrates in the M<sup>pro</sup> active site shows that both TRMT1 and viral peptide backbones have nearly identical conformations for the N-terminal P4 ⃗ P1′ residues. In contrast, backbone geometries of C-terminal peptide residues (P2′ → P4′) diverge more significantly and fall into two distinct binding modes distinguished primarily by the P2′ ψ dihedral angle (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, C</xref></bold>). The majority of viral peptide substrates adopt a binding conformation with P2′ ψ ≥ 157 ° in which the P3′ sidechain is positioned away from the M<sup>pro</sup> surface (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>), which we have designated as the ‘P3′-out’ conformation. In contrast, TRMT1 and a single viral peptide substrate, nsp6/7, bind in a distinct conformation with P2′ ψ ≤ 116 ° (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>) in which the P3′ sidechain (Phe in TRMT1, Met in nsp6/7) is positioned toward the M<sup>pro</sup> surface where it displaces M<sup>pro</sup> Met49 to open and occupy pocket S3′ (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>).

<title>M<sup>pro</sup> cleaves TRMT1 peptide with comparable kinetics to known viral polypeptide cleavage sites</title>
<p>To further examine whether TRMT1 is a viable substrate for SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>, we compared kinetic parameters for proteolysis of the TRMT1 (526–536) peptide and the native N-terminal auto-processing sequence nsp4/5, using fluorogenic peptide cleavage assays. The TRMT1 peptide is cleaved noticeably slower than the nsp4/5 auto-processing sequence (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, Table S2</bold>), with an approximately 200-fold decrease in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>, 4-fold decrease in <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>, and 50-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency compared to M<sup>pro</sup>-mediated cleavage of the nsp4/5 substrate (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, Table S2</bold>). However, our measured catalytic efficiency for M<sup>pro</sup>-mediated TRMT1 cleavage (1.82 x 10<sup>-4</sup> µM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-</sup> <sup>1</sup>) is within two-fold of that recently reported by MacDonald <italic>et al.</italic> for cleavage of the known viral nsp8/9 cleavage sequence (3.6 x 10<sup>-4</sup> µM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) Although the cleavage assay conditions used by MacDonald <italic>et al</italic>. differ slightly from our assay conditions, we measure nearly identical cleavage kinetics for nsp4/5 (9.7 x10<sup>-3</sup> µM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> vs. 1.26 x 10<sup>-2</sup> µM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>), suggesting TRMT1 and nsp8/9 kinetic parameters are comparable. These kinetic experiments show that, while the TRMT1 M<sup>pro</sup> target sequence is cleaved less efficiently than the canonical nsp4/5 auto-processing site, the TRMT1 sequence is cleaved with kinetics very similar to the known nsp8/9 M<sup>pro</sup> cleavage site in the viral polypeptide. This suggests that TRMT1(526–536) is a viable substrate for M<sup>pro</sup>-targeted proteolysis.</p>

<title>M<sup>pro</sup> residues involved in TRMT1 substrate recognition have only small effects on cleavage efficiency</title>
<p>We next compared the M<sup>pro</sup>-peptide interactions observed in TRMT1-, nsp4/5-, and nsp8/9-bound structures and identified several M<sup>pro</sup> residues involved in direct substrate contacts that differ between the TRMT1- and nsp4/5- or nsp8/9-bound structures (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). In the TRMT1-bound structure, Met49 is shifted to accommodate P3′ substrate residue Phe533 binding in the S3′ pocket, and the M<sup>pro</sup> Asn142 and Gln189 sidechains are repositioned to form hydrogen bonds with the TRMT1 peptide backbone. To test how these M<sup>pro</sup> active site residues affect TRMT1 recognition and catalysis, we generated single alanine point mutations at each of these three sites and measured kinetic parameters for M<sup>pro</sup>-mediated proteolysis of nsp4/5 and TRMT1 peptides. Surprisingly, we saw no substantial changes in proteolysis kinetics for either nsp4/5 or TRMT1 substrates with any of the tested M<sup>pro</sup> mutants (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, Table S2</bold>), suggesting none of these residues play a significant role in determining differential cleavage rates for TRMT1 vs nsp4/5.</p>

<title>TRMT1 mutations predicted to alter peptide binding conformation have little effect on cleavage kinetics</title>
<p>Our TRMT1-bound M<sup>pro</sup> structure shows that in the unique P3′-in conformation, the TRMT1 P1′ Ala side chain is positioned within ∼3 Å of the P3′ Phe ring in the S3′ pocket. A bulkier residue in the P1′ position of TRMT1 would clash with this P3′ Phe orientation and disfavor the P3′-in binding mode. To test whether mutations that likely disfavor the P3′-in conformation would affect TRMT1 recognition and proteolysis, we mutated TRMT1 P1′ Ala to the viral P1′ consensus of Ser, and measured kinetic parameters for cleavage of the WT and Ala531Ser TRMT1 peptides. In these experiments, we saw no major change in cleavage kinetics for the Ala to Ser mutation at the P1′ position in TRMT1 (<bold>Table S2, Figure S4</bold>), suggesting that disfavoring TRMT1’s P3′-in binding conformation does not substantially alter M<sup>pro</sup>’s ability to cleave the peptide substrate. Together, our mutagenesis and kinetic experiments show that mutations to apparently key residues in either the peptide substrate or the M<sup>pro</sup> active site have little effect on proteolysis activity. Consistent with other recent kinetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), these data suggest M<sup>pro</sup> has a flexible active site that can accommodate cleavage of diverse substrate sequences and substrate geometries.</p>

<title>Molecular dynamics simulations suggest kinetic discrimination happens during later steps of M<sup>pro</sup>-catalyzed substrate cleavage</title>
<p>To further support the structural and biochemical data described above and better understand how peptide substrate binding geometry may or may not be linked to M<sup>pro</sup>-catalyzed cleavage efficiency, we carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using nsp4/5-, nsp8/9-, and TRMT1-bound M<sup>pro</sup> complexes. MD simulations show TRMT1 is stably-bound to the M<sup>pro</sup> active site and primarily adopts the P3′-in conformation observed in the crystal structure, where TRMT1 Phe533 occupies the S3′ pocket with a probability of ∼65% over the course of the 100 ns simulation (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). In contrast, simulations of the nsp4/5-M<sup>pro</sup> complex show the nsp4/5 peptide primarily adopts the P3′-out conformation, where nsp4/5 Phe531 is oriented away from the M<sup>pro</sup> surface with ∼70% probability, consistent with the observed nsp4/5 binding mode in the crystal structure. This computational analysis shows that while P3′-in and -out conformations can interconvert, the dominant binding modes for TRMT1 and nsp4/5 peptide substrates (P3′-in vs -out, respectively) are consistent across the crystal structures and MD simulations. Furthermore, because these conformations differ primarily at the C-terminal end of the peptide, but have very similar geometries at the scissile amide bond, we find that the computationally and experimentally determined substrate binding poses fail to explain the large differences in cleavage kinetics observed for TRMT1 versus nsp4/5.</p>

<p>Previous structural and geometric analysis of diverse serine protease substrate-inhibitor complexes has shown than the consensus nucleophilic attack angle in the reactive Michaelis complex is approximately 90° (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). We next asked whether differences in nucleophilic attack angle measured over the course of the MD simulation might be able to explain changes in M<sup>pro</sup>-mediated cleavage kinetics. The distribution of the S–C=O nucleophilic attack angle shows that the M<sup>pro</sup>-nsp4/5 complex has only ∼9% increased probability to fall within 89± 7°, as compared with the M<sup>pro</sup>-TRMT1 complex over the course of the simulation (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). Thus, while the nsp4/5 peptide shows slightly more favorable positioning for nucleophilic attack in the Michaelis complex during the first step of cleavage, this is not nearly sufficient to explain the large difference (∼200-fold in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) in experimentally observed cleavage kinetics between nsp4/5 and TRMT1. Taken together with our TRMT1-M<sup>pro</sup> structure and kinetic analysis of M<sup>pro</sup> and TRMT1 mutants, these results suggest that kinetic discrimination between peptide cleavage rates is likely to occur during a later step in the M<sup>pro</sup>-catalyzed cleavage reaction that follows substrate binding, Michaelis complex formation, and initial nucleophilic attack, similar to some serine proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recent studies mapping host-coronavirus protein interaction networks predicted high confidence interactions between the SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) and the human tRNA-modifying enzyme TRMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). In this work, we show that SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> can recognize and cleave the human TRMT1 526-536 sequence located between the TRMT1 methyltransferase and zinc finger domains. M<sup>pro</sup> is able to cleave this sequence in recombinant full-length TRMT1, as well as in endogenous TRMT1 from human cell lysate. The kinetic parameters determined for M<sup>pro</sup>-mediated TRMT1(526–536) peptide proteolysis are very similar to those measured for the known nsp8/9 viral polypeptide cleavage site. We also determined the structure of human TRMT1(526–536) in complex with SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> C145A, which reveals a distinct binding mode for the TRMT1 substrate peptide that engages the M<sup>pro</sup> S3′ pocket. Our results show that the human tRNA-modifying enzyme TRMT1 is a viable substrate for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and provide the structural basis for understanding TRMT1 recognition and proteolysis. Importantly, and concurrent with our own work, Zhang et al report that human TRMT1 is cleaved during SARS-CoV-2 infection and that this leads to loss of m2,2G modification in virally infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Together, our studies corroborate and characterize cleavage of human TRMT1 by SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> from the cellular to the atomic level, and raise important new questions about the roles of tRNA methylation during viral infection.</p>
<p>Viruses have evolved diverse strategies that subvert host protein synthesis in order to downregulate host translation and optimize the translation of viral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 employs multiple mechanisms to disrupt host protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), and M<sup>pro</sup>-mediated cleavage of human TRMT1 could contribute to the modulation of cellular translation during viral infection. TRMT1 is a tRNA methyltransferase whose m2,2G26 modification activity directly impacts global translational efficiency. Knockouts of TRMT1, or truncations of TRMT1 that remove its zinc finger domain, result in loss of the m2,2G26 tRNA modification and a significant decrease in translation levels in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Our results show that M<sup>pro</sup>-mediated cleavage of TRMT1 results in the removal of the zinc finger domain, which is expected to substantially weaken TRMT1-tRNA binding affinity and result in loss of enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Additionally, TRMT1-deficient human cells, or cells with inactivating TRMT1 truncations, exhibit increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and links to neurological dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Taken together, the observations that 1) SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> interacts with TRMT1 in human cells in a catalytic activity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), 2) full-length TRMT1 is cleaved by M<sup>pro</sup> in human cell lysate to excise the tRNA-binding zinc finger domain (this work), and 3) loss of the TRMT1 zinc finger domain results in TRMT1 inactivation, decreases in translation, and increased cellular sensitivity to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), suggest that M<sup>pro</sup>-mediated cleavage of TRMT1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to the downregulation of host translation and oxidative stress-related pathogenesis and phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Future experiments in virally infected cell types will be required to definitively establish how M<sup>pro</sup>-directed TRMT1 cleavage impacts cellular and viral translation, viral infectivity and propagation, and oxidative stress phenotypes during infection.</p>
<p>TRMT1 displays signatures of rapid evolution in primates, potentially driven by adaptation to ancient viral pathogens, including coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). While rapidly evolving sites can be found near the N- and C-termini of primate TRMT1, we found no evidence of positive selection at the M<sup>pro</sup>-mediated TRMT1(526–536) cleavage sequence, which is highly conserved (<bold>Figure S5A, Dataset S1</bold>). This evolutionary analysis raises several possibilities regarding the relationship of SARS-CoV and TRMT1. First, it may be that TRMT1(526–536) is targeted for cleavage by M<sup>pro</sup> during coronavirus infection, but that this TRMT1 motif cannot easily mutate during evolution, due to structural constraints or essential function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), and therefore cannot evade viral proteolysis. Indeed, although the TRMT1(526–536) cleavage sequence is found in a linker region between structured domains, an AlphaFold-predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) TRMT1 structure suggests that many of these residues make contacts with the surface of the TRMT1 MTase domain (<bold>Figure S1</bold>), which may be important for enzyme stability, domain orientation, or function. Second, it may be that TRMT1 cleavage by coronavirus M<sup>pro</sup> exerts insufficient adaptive pressure on the host. In this case, TRMT1 rapid evolution may be driven by other selective pressure or may be due to intrinsically disordered regions. Third, rapidly evolving sites in primate TRMT1 outside of the cleavage site may reflect evasion of SARS-CoV by providing structural escape through within-protein epistasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>).</p>
<p>A TRMT1 sequence analysis at the mammalian level further showed that the M<sup>pro</sup> cleavage site of human TRMT1 (residues 526-536) is highly conserved in most mammals, including in bats that are the reservoir of SARS-CoVs (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>, S5A</bold>). However, one exception is in rodents, where there has been a Q to K substitution fixed in all Muroidea (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, S5B, Dataset S1</bold>). This TRMT1 Q530K substitution impacts the cleavage motif at the invariant P1 glutamine residue, suggesting it would prevent SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup>-directed TRMT1 cleavage in Muroidea. During the preparation of this manuscript, an independent study has confirmed that human TRMT1 is cleaved by M<sup>pro</sup>, but that TRMT1 from <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (mouse) and <italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic> (hamster), which both contain a Q530K substitution, are not cleaved in cells when co-expressed with M<sup>pro</sup> in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). As coronaviruses infect multiple mammalian species, it would be informative to our understanding of SARS-CoV evolution and function to decipher whether Muroidea TRMT1 is naturally resistant to M<sup>pro</sup>-mediated cleavage, if this resistance confers host advantages or disadvantages during coronavirus infection, and whether this change results from adaptation to ancient coronavirus infection.</p>

<p>Independent of the roles for human TRMT1 and m2,2G RNA modification during SARS-CoV-2 infection, our structural and kinetic results combined with computational analysis highlight distinct features of substrate-protease binding, recognition, and cleavage for SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>. First, our TRMT1-M<sup>pro</sup> structure shows an uncommon peptide binding mode in which the P3′ TRMT1 Phe residue is buried in the S3′ pocket on the M<sup>pro</sup> surface (‘P3′-in’ conformation). Of the currently known M<sup>pro</sup>-peptide substrate structures, this unique M<sup>pro</sup> P3′-in binding mode is only seen for TRMT1 and nsp6/7, though notably the ‘P3′-in’ conformation has also been observed in a crystal structure of SARS-CoV-1 M<sup>pro</sup> in complex with its C-terminal auto-processing site (VTFQGKFK), which like TRMT1, contains a phenylalanine at the P3′ site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). This unique binding mode demonstrates the flexible accommodation of diverse substrate that binding poses in the M<sup>pro</sup> active site and highlights the availability of the S3′ pocket for inhibitor binding and therapeutic design. Second, consistent with previous mutagenesis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) of M<sup>pro</sup>, we find that mutations to residues on the surface of M<sup>pro</sup> involved in direct binding and recognition of substrate, including Met49, Asn142, and Gln189, have little impact on cleavage kinetics. Similarly, the large differences in catalytic efficiency observed for M<sup>pro</sup>-mediated cleavage of nsp4/5 versus nsp8/9 and TRMT1 are not easily explained by structural analysis of the substrate-bound M<sup>pro</sup> structures or the M<sup>pro</sup>-peptide geometries and conformations observed in the MD simulations. Comparing nsp4/5-, nsp8/9-, and TRMT1-bound M<sup>pro</sup> crystal structures, the scissile amide bond that links substrate residues P1 and P1′ are positioned almost identically in the active site and located at similar distances from the Cys145Ala residue (<bold>Figure S6A</bold>). Likewise, deviations away from 180 degrees in the dihedral angle of the scissile amide bond in these M<sup>pro</sup>-peptide structures, which could indicate ground state destabilization and help explain accelerated proteolysis for nsp4/5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>), are also inconsistent with the observed trends in peptide cleavage rates (<bold>Figure S6B</bold>). Molecular dynamics simulations of nsp4/5 and TRMT1 peptide substrates bound to M<sup>pro</sup> support the observation that the unique P3′- in conformation is favored for TRMT1 binding, but that only subtle differences in geometry are present at the nucleophilic Cys145 residue and scissile peptide bond in the M<sup>pro</sup>-substrate complexes, which cannot account for the order of magnitude differences in observed cleavage kinetics between ns4/5 and TRMT1 substrates. These observations suggest that kinetic discrimination of substrate cleavage happens during later steps of the M<sup>pro</sup>-mediated proteolysis reaction.</p>
<p>Our work defines the structural basis for understanding recognition and cleavage of the human tRNA methyltransferase TRMT1 by the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Zhang et al provide evidence that TRMT1 is proteolyzed and inactivated during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which would be predicted to affect host and viral translation and increase cellular sensitivity to redox stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). TRMT1 cleavage may therefore have important implications for understanding the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to hijack host protein synthesis and impact cellular phenotypes and COVID-19 pathogenesis. Additionally, our TRMT1-M<sup>pro</sup> structure highlights a distinct substrate binding mode that reveals the S3′ pocket on the surface of the main protease. SARS-Cov-2 M<sup>pro</sup> is vital for viral propagation and is thus a major target for antiviral drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). Consideration of the often-hidden S3′ pocket on the M<sup>pro</sup> surface could aid in the design of potent and specific SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors. Currently, the vast majority of inhibitors target the S2 and S1 sites of M<sup>pro</sup>, with peptidyl inhibitors designed with glutamine and leucine analogs for the P2 and P1 positions, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Our structural results suggest the flexible S3′ pocket could be utilized in future therapeutic design, and together with our kinetic analysis adds to the growing understanding of M<sup>pro</sup> substrate recognition and cleavage efficiency that is critical for potent and specific targeting of M<sup>pro</sup> to prevent or treat infection.</p>

<p>Full-length human TRMT1 expression constructs used for proteolysis experiments were generated using a codon optimized gBlock obtained from IDT containing the human full-length TRMT1 sequence which was subcloned into a pET28a expression vector with an N-terminal His-tag and TEV protease cleavage site (ENLYFQGS). The TRMT1 construct was transformed into Rosetta™(DE3)pLysS <italic>E. coli</italic> as described above. Harvested cells were sonicated in lysis buffer (PBS, cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, 0.5mg/mL lysozyme), clarified at 14,500 x g, and recovered lysate was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated Cytiva 5mL HisTrap column. The loaded HisTrap column washed with lysis buffer + 25mM Imidazole, and protein was eluted using a gradient elution with lysis buffer + 300mM Imidazole. Fractions containing TRMT1 were identified by Western blotting and were pooled, concentrated, buffer exchanged into 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70°C.</p>

<title>Peptide Cleavage Kinetic Assays</title>
<p>Fluorogenic assays measuring kinetic parameters for cleavage of peptide substrates were carried out in triplicate in Corning Low Volume 384-well Black Flat Bottom Polystyrene NBS Microplates following a similar procedure as Lee, <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). Peptide cleavage reactions were carried out at 50 nM M<sup>pro</sup> enzyme in 50mM Tris pH 7.3, 1mM EDTA, 2mM DTT, and 20% DMSO, with quenched fluorescent peptide substrates ranging in concentration from 0.097 – 100 µM. Synthetic peptide substrates were obtained from Peptide 2.0: TRMT1 (MCA-EPRLQANFTIR-K(Dnp)K) or nsp4/5 (MCA-SAVLQSGFRKM-K(Dnp)K), where MCA = 7-Methoxycoumarin-4-acetic acid and Dnp = dinitrophenyl. Using a Tecan Spark microplate reader, the fluorescence intensity was monitored every 10 seconds over a 3-minute time course, with excitation at 320 nm and emission at 405 nm. A calibration curve of MCA-AVLQ product fluorescence intensities from 12 to 0.006 µM was measured and used to generate an RFU to µM conversion factor. A correction for the inner filter effect (IFE<sub>corr</sub>) was determined using the formula IFE<sub>corr</sub> = [fluorescence<sub>MCA_product+peptide</sub> – fluorescence<sub>peptide</sub>] / fluorescence<sub>MCA</sub> where fluorescence<sub>MCA_product+peptide</sub> = the fluorescence of MCA-AVLQ mixed with quenched peptide substrate, fluorescence<sub>peptide</sub> = the fluorescence of the peptide alone, fluorescenceMCA = fluorescence of MCA-AVLQ product alone (<bold>Dataset S2</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>).

<title>Mammalian Cell Culture</title>
<p>Freshly passaged HEK293T cells were gifted from Prof. Catherine Grimes (University of Delaware). Cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in growth media (DMEM media with 10% FBS and Penicillin (100 U/mL)/Streptomycin (100 µg/mL)). Growth media was replaced every 3 days, and cells were trypsinized and passaged approximately every 7 days, when cells reached 80-90% confluency. To passage, growth media was aspirated, and cells were gently washed with prewarmed PBS. PBS was then aspirated and a 1:2.5 mixture of 0.25% Trypsin in HBSS with 0.2 g/L EDTA to PBS was added to adherent cells and incubated at 37°C for 2 minutes to disaggregate. A 3X dilution with growth media was used to inactivate trypsin. The cells were gently mixed to attain a homogenous suspension and diluted 1:20 with growth media and added into a new cell culture plate. For lysis, cells were trypsinized as described above, and the resulting cell suspension was spun down at 1250 RPM for 3 minutes. Cell pellets were washed in ice cold PBS 3 times, and spun at 1250 RPM for 3 minutes, aspirating PBS in between each wash. Lysis was performed on a PBS suspension of cells by performing 3 consecutive freeze/thaw cycles by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 37°C. Lysate was collected after centrifugation at 13,000 RPM for 10 minutes and stored at -70°C.</p>

<title>Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
<p>Extensive molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water have been carried out to investigate M<sup>pro</sup>-nsp4/5 and M<sup>pro</sup>-TRMT1 complexes starting from their corresponding crystal structures (PDB id: 7MGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) and 8D35), respectively. In original crystal structures, the catalytic Cys145 has been mutated to Ala, M<sup>pro</sup>-nsp4/5 is in the monomer form, while the M<sup>pro</sup>-TRMT1 complex is in the dimer form. Since the active form of M<sup>pro</sup> should be dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>), the structure of the M<sup>pro</sup>-nsp4/5 (PDB id: 7MGS) was superimposed to the M<sup>pro</sup>-TRMT1 (PDB id: 8D35) to model the dimer form of M<sup>pro</sup>-nsp4/5, and the catalytic Cys145 in both complexes has been modeled using ‘swapaa’ command in ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). The original crystal water molecules and ions within 5 Å of the protein-substrate complex are kept. PDB2PQR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>) was employed to add hydrogen atoms to both complexes at pH 7. Subsequently, the His41 was manually changed to Hip41(positively charged) by adding an additional hydrogen atom to the imidazole ring in ChimeraX, and Cys145 was manually changed to Cym(negatively charged) by removing the hydrogen atom on the thiol group in ChimeraX. Each system was neutralized by adding counterions for Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>, and solvated in a rectangular water box of TIP3P water molecules with 12 Å buffer.</p>
<p>For each prepared simulation system, 3000 steps of steepest descent plus 2000 steps of conjugate minimization was performed with harmonic restraints using a force constant of 20 kcal·mol<sup>−1</sup>·Å<sup>−2</sup> applied to all heavy atoms coming from the crystal structure, and then the whole system was minimized without restraints by 7000 steps of steepest descent and 3000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. After minimization, three independent equilibration and MD replicas were carried out for 100ns with the same starting structural configuration but different initial velocities. The equilibration was conducted in five steps: (i) 50 ps constant volume ensemble(NVT) MD simulation with 10 kcal·mol<sup>−1</sup>·Å<sup>−2</sup> restraints on all heavy atoms from the crystal, and the whole system was heated from 10 to 300K gradually. (ii) 50 ps isothermal isobaric ensemble (NPT) MD with 10 kcal·mol<sup>−1</sup>·Å<sup>−2</sup> restraints on all heavy atoms from the crystal at 300 K. (iii) 200 ps NPT MD with 5 kcal·mol<sup>−1</sup>·Å<sup>−2</sup> restraints on all heavy atoms from the crystal at 300 K. (iv) 200 ps NPT MD with 2 kcal·mol<sup>−1</sup>·Å<sup>−2</sup> restraints on all heavy atoms from the crystal at 300 K. (v) 200 ps NPT MD with 1 kcal·mol<sup>−1</sup>·Å<sup>−2</sup> restraints on all heavy atoms from the crystal at 300 K. Finally, production MD simulations were carried out for 100 ns at a constant temperature of 300 K and a constant pressure of 1 atm. Langevin thermostat and Berendsen barostat methods were employed to maintain the temperature and pressure, respectively. The atomic coordinates of the complexes were saved every 1ps to obtain the trajectories for analysis.</p>
<p>All MD simulations were conducted with Amber 20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>) package using Amber FF 14SB force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>). AmberTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>) was utilized for preparing topology and coordinate files for the simulated systemsA cutoff of 10 Å was set for calculating van der Waals interactions, and the particle mesh Ewald (PME) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>) method with a cutoff of 10 Å was employed to treat electrostatic interactions. The SHAKE algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>) was used to constrain covalent bonds to allow the integration time step of 2 fs.</p>

<p>D'Oliviera et al. have demonstrated cleavage of human TRMT1 by the SARS-CoV-2 main protease in vitro. Following this, they solved the structure of Mpro-C145A bound to TRMT1 substrate peptide, revealing binding conformation distinct from most viral substrates. Overall, this work enhances our understanding of substrate specificity for a key drug target of CoV2. The paper is well-written and the data is clearly presented. It complements the companion article by demonstrating the interaction between Mpro and TRMT1 and TRMT1 cleavage under isolated conditions in vitro. Importantly, the revelation of flexible substrate binding of Nsp5 is fundamental for understanding Nsp5 as a drug target. Trmt1 cleavage assays revealed similar kinetics for TRMT1 cleavage as compared to the nsp8/9 viral polyprotein cleavage site, however, it would have been more rigorous for the authors to independently reproduce the kinetics reported for nsp8/9 using their specific experimental conditions. The finding that murine TRMT1 lacks a conserved consensus sequence is interesting, but is not experimentally tested here and is reported elsewhere. I am unable to comment critically on the structural analyses as it is outside of my expertise. Overall, I think that these findings are important for confirming TRMT1 as a substrate of Mpro and defining substrate binding and cleavage parameters for an important drug target of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript 'Recognition and Cleavage of Human tRNA Methyltransferase TRMT1 by the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease' from Angel D'Oliviera et al., uncovers that TRMT1 can be cleaved by SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and defines the structural basis of TRMT1 recognition by Mpro. They use both recombinant TRMT1 and Mpro as well as endogenous TRMT1 from HEK293T cell lysates to convincingly show cleavage of TRMT1 by the SARS-CoV-2 protease. To understand how Mpro recognizes TRMT1, they solved a co-crystal structure of Mpro bound to a peptide derived from the predicted cleavage site of TRMT1. This structure revealed important protein-protein interfaces and highlights the importance of the conserved Q530 for cleavage by Mpro. They then compared their structure with previous X-ray crystal structures of Mpro bound to substrate peptides derived from the viral polyprotein and proposed the concept of two distinct binding conformations to Mpro: P3´-out and P3´-in conformations (here P3´ stands for the third residue downstream of the cleavage site). It remains unknown what is the physiological role of these two binding conformations on Mpro function, but the authors established that Mpro has dramatically different cleavage efficiencies for three distinct substrates. In an effort to rationalize this observation, a series of mutations in Mpro's active site and the substrate peptide were tested but unexpectedly had no significant impact on cleavage efficiency. While molecular dynamic simulations further confirmed the propensity of certain substrates to adopt the P3´-out or P3´-in conformation, they did not provide additional insights into the dramatic differences in cleavage efficiencies between substrates. This led the authors to propose that the discrimination of Mpro for preferred substrates might occur at a later stage of catalysis after binding of the peptide. Overall, this work will be of interest to biologists studying proteases and substrate recognition by enzymes as well as help efforts to target Mpro with peptide-like drugs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
• The authors' statements are well supported by their data, and they used relevant controls when needed. Indeed, they used the Mpro C145A inactive variant to unambiguously show that the TRMT1 cleavage detected in vitro is solely due to Mpro's activity. Moreover, they used two distinct polyclonal antibodies to probe TRMT1 cleavage.</p>
<p>• Their 1.9 Å crystal structure is of high quality and increases the confidence in the reported protein-protein contacts seen between TRMT1-derived peptide and Mpro.</p>
<p>• Their extensive in vitro kinetic assay was performed in ideal conditions although it is unclear how many replicates were performed.</p>
<p>• The authors test multiple hypotheses to rationalize the preference of Mpro for certain substrates.</p>
<p>• While this reviewer is not able to comment on the rigor of the MD simulations, the interpretations made by the authors seem reasonable and convincing.</p>
<p>• The concept of two binding conformations (P3´-out or P3´-in) for the substrate in the active site of Mpro is significant and can guide drug design.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
• While the authors convincingly show that TRMT1 is cleaved by Mpro, the exact cleavage site was never confirmed experimentally. It is most likely that the predicted site is the main cleavage site as proposed by the authors (region 527-534). Nevertheless, in Fig 1C (first lane from the right) there are two bands clearly observed for the cleavage product containing the MT Domain. If the predicted site was the only cleavage site recognized by Mpro, then a single band for the MT domain would be expected. This observation suggests that there might be two cleavage sites for Mpro in TRMT1. Indeed, residues RFQANP (550-555) in TRMT1 might be a secondary weaker cleavage site for Mpro, which would explain the two observed bands in Fig 1C. A mass spectrometry analysis of the cleaved products would clarify this.</p>
<p>• A control is missing in Fig 1D. Since the authors use western blots to show the gradual degradation of endogenous TRMT1, a control with a protein that does not change in abundance over the course of the measurement is important. This is required to show that the differences in intensity of TRMT1 by western blotting are not due to loading differences etc.</p>
<p>• The two polyclonal antibodies used by the authors seem to have strong non-specific binding to proteins other than TRMT1 but did not impact the author's conclusions. This is a limitation of the commercially available antibodies for TRMT1, and unless the authors select a new monoclonal antibody specific to TRMT1 (costly and lengthy process), this limitation seems out of their control.</p>
<p>• The recombinantly purified TRMT1 seems to have some non-negligible impurities (extra bands in Fig 1C). This does not impact the conclusions of the authors but might be relevant to readers interested in working with TRMT1 for biochemical, structural, or other purposes.</p>
<p>• Despite the reasonable efforts of the authors, it remains unknown why Mpro shows higher cleavage efficiency for the nsp4/5 sequence compared to TRMT1 or nsp8/9 sequences.</p>
<p>• The peptide cleavage kinetic assay used by the authors relies on a peptide labelled with a fluorophore (MCA) on the N-terminus and a quencher (Dpn) on the C-terminus. This design allows high-throughput measurements compatible with plate readers and is a robust and convenient tool. Nevertheless, the authors did not control for the impact of the labels (MCA and Dpn) on the activity of Mpro. It is possible that the differences in cleavage efficiencies between peptides are due to unexpected conformational changes in the peptide upon labelling. Moreover, the TRMT1 peptide has an E at the N-terminus and an R at the C-terminus (while the nsp4/5 peptide has an S and M, respectively). It is possible that these two terminal residues form a salt bridge in the TRMT1 peptide that might constrain the conformation of the peptide and thus reduce its accessibility and cleavage by Mpro. Enzymatic assays in the absence of labels and MD simulations with the bona fide peptides (including the labels) used in the kinetic measurements are needed to prove that the cleavage efficiencies are not biased by the fluorescence assay.</p>
<p>• The authors used A431S variant in TRMT1-derived peptide to disrupt the P3´-in conformation. While this reviewer agrees with the rationale behind A431S design, it is important to confirm experimentally that the mutation disrupted the P3´-in conformation in favor of the P3´-out conformer. The authors could use their MD simulations to determine if the TRMT1 A431S variant favors the P3´-out conformation.</p>
<p>• An unanswered question not addressed by the authors is if the peptides undergo conformational changes upon Mpro binding or if they are pre-organized to adopt the P3´-out and P3´-in conformations.</p>
<p>• While the authors describe at great length the hydrogen bonds involved in the substrate recognition by Mpro, they occluded to highlight important stacking interactions in this interface. For instance, Phe533 from TRMT1 stacks with Met49 while L529 from TRMT1 packs against His41 of Mpro. Both hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions seem important for TRMT1-derived peptide recognition by Mpro.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, the authors have used a combination of enzymatic, crystallographic, and in silico approaches to provide compelling evidence for substrate selectivity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro for human TRMT1.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
In my opinion, the authors came close to achieving their intended aim of demonstrating the structural and biochemical basis of Mpro catalysis and cleavage of human TRMT1 protein. The combination of orthogonal approaches is highly commendable.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
It would have been of high scientific impact if the consequences of TRMT1 cleavage by Mpro on cellular metabolism were provided. Furthermore, assays to investigate the effect of inhibition of this Mpro activity on SARS-CoV-2 propagation and infection would have been extremely useful in providing insights into host- SARS-CoV-2 interactions.</p>

<p>We very much appreciate all the reviewers’ positive feedback and additional comments and suggestions for this manuscript!</p>
<p>In this provisional reply, we’d like to quickly address only one selected key point, for which we have already collected relevant experimental data:</p>
<p>Reviewer 1 suggests that ‘it would have been more rigorous for the authors to independently reproduce the kinetics reported for nsp8/9 using their specific experimental conditions.’ We absolutely agree with this and have already carried out these kinetic experiments while our paper was under review. We have now measured kinetic parameters for cleavage of the nsp8/9 peptide in our own hands under the same conditions as we used for nsp4/5 and TRMT1. We measured kcat and KM values of 0.019 +/- 0.002 s-1 and 40 +/- 7.5 µM, respectively, for nsp8/9 cleavage; these data are very much in line with the previously reported values from MacDonald et al (kcat = 0.013 +/- 0.001 s-1, KM = 36 +/- 6.0 µM) that we used for comparison in Figure 4 and listed in Table S2. We will add our own measured kinetic values for nsp8/9 in the next version of our manuscript, but wanted to report these numbers as soon as possible, because this further supports and validates our claim that the human TRMT1 sequence is cleaved at a similar rate to the known nsp8/9 viral polypeptide cleavage site.</p>
<p>We will provide a detailed, point-by-point reply to all reviewer comments accompanying the forthcoming revised manuscript, in which we intend to have new and updated data and additional MD simulations that directly address key questions raised by the reviewers.</p>
