<title>Abstract</title><p>Injured axons in the central nervous system (CNS) usually fail to regenerate, causing permanent disabilities. However, the knockdown of PTEN or treatment of neurons with hyper-IL-6 (hIL-6) transforms neurons into a regenerative state, allowing them to regenerate axons in the injured optic nerve and spinal cord. Transneuronal delivery of hIL-6 to the injured brain stem neurons even enables functional recovery after severe spinal cord injury. Here we demonstrate that the beneficial hIL-6 and PTEN knockout effects on axon growth are limited by the induction of tubulin detyrosination in axonal growth cones. Hence, cotreatment with parthenolide, a compound blocking microtubule detyrosination, synergistically accelerates neurite growth of cultured murine and primary RGCs isolated from adult human eyes. Systemic application of the prodrug dimethylamino-parthenolide (DMAPT) enables axon regeneration in the injured optic nerve and spinal cord. Moreover, combinatorial treatment further improves hIL-6 induced axon regeneration and locomotor recovery after severe SCI. Thus, DMAPT facilitates functional CNS regeneration and reduces the limiting effects of pro-regenerative treatments, making it a promising drug candidate for treating CNS injuries.</p>

<title>Significance statement</title>
<p>Injured axons in the CNS usually fail to regenerate, causing permanent disabilities. No clinically approved drugs are currently available to improve or accelerate axon regeneration. We demonstrate that pro-regenerative treatments’ induced tubulin detyrosination in axonal growth cones limits axon growth. Hence, cotreatment with parthenolide, a compound blocking detyrosination, synergistically accelerates neurite growth of primary murine and, demonstrated for the first time, <underline>human</underline> retinal ganglion cells. Furthermore, systemic application of the parthenolide’s prodrug DMAPT accelerates hIL-6-mediated optic nerve regeneration and locomotor recovery after severe spinal cord injury. Thus, DMAPT facilitates functional CNS regeneration and reduces the limiting effects of pro-regenerative treatments, making it a potential (adjuvant) drug candidate for treating CNS injuries.</p>

<sec id="s1">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Traumatic CNS injuries often lead to irreversible impairments, such as blindness or loss of motor and sensory function, due to the inability of severed axons to regrow. This regenerative failure is mainly caused by an insufficient intrinsic growth capacity of mature CNS neurons and the inhibitory environment for axonal growth cones at the injury site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>].</p>
<p>Although there is currently no clinically applicable treatment available to human patients, various strategies exist to promote axon regeneration in experimental models of CNS injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. For example, targeting the inhibitory environment at the lesion site by neutralizing myelin-derived factors or chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) led to axonal regeneration and, in some cases, induced functional recovery after incomplete spinal cord lesions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. On the other hand, it became evident that not only disinhibition but also strategies to stimulate cell-intrinsic signaling pathways are essential to promote robust axon growth. Among these, lens injury-induced expression and release of the IL-6-type cytokines ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) from retinal astrocytes transforms retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) into a regenerative state and enables moderate axon growth in the injured optic nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. The designer cytokine hyper-IL-6 (hIL-6), a fusion protein of IL-6 and the soluble IL-6 receptor α (IL-6Rα), can enormously increase these effects. In contrast to natural cytokines, hIL-6 directly binds to the gp130 receptor and does not rely on previous interaction with cytokine-specific alpha-receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. This enables a more potent activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK/STAT3) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. As a result, AAV-mediated hIL-6 expression in RGCs elicits a more vigorous optic nerve regeneration over long distances than most other single treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Similarly, hIL-6 expression in corticospinal neurons simultaneously promotes axon regeneration of multiple descending tracts and partially restores motor function after a complete spinal cord crush [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>].</p>
<p>Another way to stimulate CNS axon regeneration is to directly activate the PI3K/AKT pathway by knockout phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN<sup>-/-</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. This approach stimulated axon regeneration in the corticospinal tract even when applied one year after injury and induced functional recovery of voluntary skilled movements after incomplete spinal cord injury or pyramidotomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. PTEN<sup>-/-</sup> or hIL-6-mediated AKT activation causes phosphorylation of several substrates, including inactivating phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. The specific GSK3β knockout (GSK3β<sup>-/-</sup>) in RGCs facilitates optic nerve regeneration by reducing collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) phosphorylation in axons, while constitutively active GSK3 (GSK3<sup>S/A</sup>) compromises PTEN<sup>-/-</sup> and cytokineinduced regeneration, underlining the relevance of the AKT/GSK3/CRMP2 pathway for CNS regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>].</p>
<p>Besides CRMP2, GSK3 phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B). Phosphorylated MAP1B keeps microtubules in a dynamic state by blocking the removal of the C-terminal tyrosine from α-tubulin subunits (detyrosination) in axonal growth cones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. In addition, inhibition of tubulin detyrosination accelerates peripheral nerve regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. This was achieved by local or systemic application of the sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide, an inhibitor of VASH1/2, which mediates detyrosination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>].</p>
<p>The current study addressed whether parthenolide affects axon regeneration in the CNS. It shows that it markedly accelerates neurite outgrowth of primary CNS neurons by reducing tubulin detyrosination in axonal tips. Moreover, intraperitoneal application of its prodrug dimethylamino-parthenolide (DMAPT) facilitates axon regeneration after optic nerve and spinal cord injuries <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, hIL-6 and PTEN<sup>-/-</sup> were found to increase tubulin detyrosination. At the same time, parthenolide antagonized this effect, thereby further enhancing hIL-6-induced optic nerve and spinal cord regeneration and functional recovery of hindlimb locomotion after severe spinal cord injury. The effects of parthenolide on detyrosination and neurite outgrowth were reproducible in human adult RGCs, suggesting it is a promising drug candidate in patients suffering CNS injuries. In particular, parthenolide is an ideal cotreatment to accelerate axon regeneration and functional recovery in combination with other treatment strategies.</p>

<title>Optic nerve crush and intravitreal injections</title>
<p>Adult C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (120 mg/kg) and xylazine (16 mg/kg). For western blot and cell culture experiments, RGCs were transduced 3 weeks before tissue isolation by intravitreal injection of 2 µl AAV2-hIL-6. For <italic>in vivo</italic> regeneration experiments, the left optic nerve was intraorbitally crushed 1 mm behind the eyeball for 10 s using a jeweler’s forceps (Hermle), as described previously (Leibinger et al. 2009). Mice received intravitreal injections of 2 µl AAV2-hIL-6 directly after optic nerve crush. Two days before tissue isolation, regenerating axons were anterogradely labeled by intravitreal injection of 2 µl Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated cholera toxin β subunit (CTB, 0.5% in PBS; Invitrogen).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Intracortical viral injections</title>
<p>Adult 129/Ola mice were placed in a stereotactic frame and continuously supplied with 1.5 – 2% isoflurane for anesthesia. A midline incision was made over the skull to open the skin and reveal bregma. A micro drill with a 0.5 mm bit was used to open a 2 x 2 mm window on each side of the skull to expose the sensorimotor cortex. AAV2-hIL-6 was injected into the cortex layer V to transduce corticospinal neurons. Four injections of 500 nl each were applied into the left cortex through a glass capillary attached to a nanoliter injector (Nanoject III, Drummond) at the following coordinates: 1.5 mm lateral, 0.6 mm deep, and 0.5 mm anterior; 0.0 mm, 0.5 mm, and 1.0 mm posterior to bregma. At each injection site, five pulses of 100 nl were applied at a rate of 10 nl/s. A pause of 10 s was made after each pulse to allow the distribution of the virus solution. The needle was left in place for 1 min before moving to the next site.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Complete spinal cord crush</title>
<p>A complete spinal cord crush was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. Adult 129/Ola mice were continuously supplied with 1.5 - 2 % isoflurane for anesthesia. A midline incision of ∼1.5 cm was made over the thoracic vertebrae. The fat and muscle tissue were cleared from thoracic vertebrae 7 and 8 (T7, T8). While holding onto T7 with forceps, a laminectomy was performed at T8 to expose the spinal cord. The complete spinal cord was then crushed for 2 s with forceps that had been filed to a width of 0.15 mm for the last 5 mm of the tips to generate a homogeneously thin lesion site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. After surgery, muscle layers were sutured with 5.0 resorbable sutures, and the skin was secured with wound clips.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>DHT injection</title>
<p>To deplete serotonergic inputs to the spinal cord, mice received bilateral intracerebroventricular injections of 30 μg of the serotonin neurotoxin 5, 7-dihydroxytryptamine (DHT, Biomol). DHT was dissolved in 0.5 μl of 0.2 % ascorbic acid in saline, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. To this end, mice were anesthetized and fixed under a stereotactic frame described above for intracortical injections. In addition, the tip of a glass micropipette attached to a nanoject III (Drummond) was positioned at the following coordinates: 0.6 mm posterior, 1.6 mm lateral to bregma, and 2 mm deep from the cortical surface. DHT was injected at the same rate as AAV2 injections, and the pipette was left for 1 minute before the withdrawal. Thirty minutes before the DHT injection, the monoamine uptake inhibitor desipramine (Sigma) was intraperitoneally administered at 25 mg/kg to prevent DHT uptake into noradrenergic neurons.</p>

<title>Preparation of AAV2</title>
<p>AAV plasmids carrying cDNA for hIL-6 downstream of a CMV promoter were co-transfected with pAAV-RC (Stratagene) encoding the AAV genes rep and cap, and the helper plasmid (Stratagene) encoding E24, E4, and VA into AAV-293 cells (Stratagene) for recombinant AAV2 generation. In addition, purifying virus particles was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>].</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>Western blot assays</title>
<p>For protein lysate preparation, optic nerves from adult C57BL/6 mice, either untreated or 3 weeks after intraperitoneal AAV2-hIL-6 injection, were dissected and homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 250 mM sucrose, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) with protease inhibitors (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) using 5 sonication pulses at 40% power (Bandelin Sonoplus, Berlin, Germany). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation in an Eppendorf tabletop centrifuge at 4150 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Proteins were separated by sodium-dodecyl-sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using Mini TGX gels (10%, Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA) according to standard protocols and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μm, Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). Blots were blocked in 5% dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) (Sigma, St Louis, USA) and incubated with antibodies against S21-phosphorylated GSK3α (1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology, RRID: AB_11166651), S9-phosphorylated GSK3β (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, RRID:AB_2115196), total GSK3α/β (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, RRID: AB_10547140), T514-phosphorylated CRMP2 (1:1000; Abcam, RRID:AB_942229), total CRMP2 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, RRID:AB_2094339), detyrosinated tubulin (1:1000; Millipore, RRID:AB_177350) and βIII-tubulin (1:2000; BioLegend, RRID:AB_2313773) at 4°C overnight. All antibodies were diluted in PBS-T containing 5% BSA (Sigma). A conformation-specific HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:4000; Cell Signaling Technology) was used as a secondary antibody. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Bio-Rad) on a FluorChem E detection system (ProteinSimple). Western blots were repeated at least three times to verify the results. Band intensities were quantified relative to respective loading controls by using ImageJ software.</p>

<title>Dissociated mouse retinal cell cultures</title>
<p>Adult C57BL/6 mice were used for all cell culture experiments. Some experiments included animals that had received intravitreal AAV2-hIL-6 injections 3 weeks before dissociation. Retinal cultures were prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. In brief, retinae were dissected from the eyecups and digested in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher) containing papain (10 U/ml; Worthington) and L-cysteine (0.2 μg/ml; Sigma) at 37°C for 30 minutes. After digestion, retinae were washed with DMEM, triturated, and centrifuged in 50 ml DMEM (500 g, 7 minutes). Cell pellets were resuspended in a medium containing B27 supplement (1:50; Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin (1:50; Merck) and passed through a cell strainer (40 µm; Greiner Bio-One). Cells were treated with parthenolide (Sigma; 0.25-5.0 nM in dimethyl sulfoxide), recombinant rat CNTF (Peprotech; 200 ng/ml), DMAPT (Abcam; 0.25-5.0 nM in dimethyl sulfoxide), or a combination of parthenolide or CNTF. 300 µl cell suspension was added to each well on 4-well plates (Nunc), which were coated with poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg/ml, molecular weight 70,000-150,000 Da; Sigma) and laminin (20 µg/ml; Sigma). Retinal cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5 % CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>After 4 days in culture, retinal cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma). Cells were stained with primary antibodies against βIII-tubulin (1:2000; BioLegend, RRID:AB_2313773), detyrosinated tubulin (1:2000; Millipore), and phosphorylated (Tyr705) STAT3 (1:200; Cell Signaling Technology, RRID:AB_2491009). Secondary antibodies included donkey-anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 (1:1000; ThermoFisher).</p>
<p>For studying neurite growth, all RGC neurites were photographed under a fluorescent micro-scope (200x; Axio Observer.D1, Zeiss), and neurite length was determined using ImageJ software. To evaluate microtubule detyrosination, at least 30 axonal tips per well were photo- graphed (400x; Axio Observer.D1, Zeiss) and analyzed using ImageJ software. Axon tips were defined as the last 15 µm of βIII-tubulin positive neurites. For the quantification of STAT3 phosphorylation, at least 30 RGCs per well were evaluated (400x; Axio Observer.D1, Zeiss).</p>

<title>Quantification of pCRMP2 staining intensity in murine RGC cultures</title>

After 4 d in culture, cells were fixed and immunostained against βIII-tubulin (1:1,000; BioLegend; RRID:AB_2313773) and phospho(T514)-CRMP2 (1:2,000; Abcam; RRID:AB_942229). The staining intensity of pCRMP2 in βIII-tubulin–positive RGCs were analyzed using ImageJ software and calculated according to the following formula: Corrected total cell fluorescence = integrated density − (area of selected cell × mean fluorescence of background reading). Data represent means ± SEM of three independent experiments. In each experiment, 80 RGCs per group were analyzed in two replicate wells.</p>

<title>Dissociated human retinal cell cultures</title>
<p>Primary human retinal cultures were generated in two independent experiments with retinae isolated from two adult human patients’ enucleated eyes.</p>
<p>The retinae were dissected from the eyecups, and the vitreous body was removed. Afterward, the retinae were cut into 8 pieces and digested separately, each in 10 ml Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher) containing papain (10 U/ml; Worthington) and L-cysteine (0.2 μg/ml; Sigma) at 37 °C for 45 minutes. After digestion, retinae were washed with DMEM, triturated, and centrifuged in 50 ml DMEM (900 g, 5 minutes). Cell pellets were resuspended in a medium containing B27 supplement (1:50; Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin (1:50; Merck) and passed through a cell strainer (40 µm; Greiner Bio-One). Retinal cultures were incubated with parthenolide (Sigma; 0.25-5.0 nM in dimethyl sulfoxide) or the vehicle. Some groups received recombinant rat CNTF (Peprotech; 200 ng/ml), either solely or in combination with parthenolide. Cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5 % CO<sub>2</sub> on 4-well plates (Nunc) (300 µl/well; 4 wells/group), which were coated with poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg/ml, molecular weight 70,000-150,000 Da; Sigma). After 4 days in culture, retinal cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma) and stained with primary antibodies against βIII-tubulin (1:2000; Bio-Legend) and detyrosinated tubulin (1:2000; Millipore). Secondary antibodies included donkey-anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 (1:1000; ThermoFisher). For studying neurite growth, and the percentage of detyrosinated axon tips, cultures were analyzed in the same way as described above for murine RGCs.</p>

<title>Intraperitoneal injections of DMAPT</title>
<p>Due to its high oral bioavailability of ∼70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] and the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], DMAPT can be delivered to the CNS via a systemic route of administration. Mice were given daily intraperitoneal injections of either DMAPT (0.2, 2, or 20 µg/kg; Abcam; dissolved in DMSO and further diluted in sterile PBS) or vehicle (DMSO diluted in sterile PBS). All spinal cord regeneration experiments were performed using the 2 µg/kg dosage. Treatment started directly after the optic nerve or spinal cord crush and was continued until the day of perfusion.

<title>Basso Mouse Scale (BMS)</title>
<p>We scored mice according to the Basso Mouse Scale to assess locomotor behavior after spinal cord injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. To this end, each mouse was placed separately into a round open field of 1 m in diameter and observed by two testers for 4 minutes. Scoring was based on different parameters, including ankle movement, paw placement, stepping pattern, coordination, trunk instability, and tail position, with a minimum score of 0 (no movement) to a maximum of 9 (normal locomotion). Before testing, mice were acclimated to the open field environment. BMS tests were performed before the injury or 1, 3, and 7 days after the injury, and then weekly. As quality criteria for lesion completeness, we used a BMS score of 0 on day 1 after injury and the absence of BDA or serotonin staining in transverse spinal cord sections (as described below). Mice that did not meet these criteria were excluded from the experiment. BMS tests were performed under blinded conditions.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Animals were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with cold PBS, followed by 4 % PFA in PBS. Brains, spinal cords, and eyes with attached optic nerves were isolated, post-fixed overnight in 4 % PFA at 4 °C, and subsequently transferred to 30 % sucrose for at least 4 h for eyes and optic nerves or 5 days for brains and spinal cords.</p>
<p>Tissues were embedded in the KP-cryo compound (Klinipath) and frozen at -20 °C (retina, optic nerve, spinal cord) or on dry ice (brain). Sections were cut using a CM3050 S cryostat (Leica Biosystems). Optic nerves were cut into longitudinal sections (14 µm). For spinal cords of mice subjected to T8 crush, a segment from 3 mm rostral to 8 mm caudal from the injury site was cut into sagittal sections (20 µm). Spinal cord tissue, just rostral and caudal from this segment, was used for transverse sections (20 µm) to evaluate lesion completeness by identifying potentially spared axons. Tissue from the medullary pyramids ∼1 mm above the pyramidal decussation was cut into coronal sections (20 µm). Sections were thaw-mounted onto charged glass slides (Superfrost Plus, VWR) and stored at -20 °C until further use.</p>

<title>Parthenolide and CNTF synergistically promote neurite growth of adult RGCs</title>
<p>In contrast to adult RGCs, sensory neurons usually show spontaneous neurite growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>].

To investigate whether parthenolide has similar effects on CNS neurons, we cultured murine RGCs in the presence of increasing compound concentrations for 4 days. As in sensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], parthenolide significantly enhanced neurite extension concentration-dependently with maximum effects at 0.5 and 1 nM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A, B</xref>). Expectedly RGC survival remained unaffected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>) since RGCs do not undergo axotomy-induced cell death as early as 4 days after culturing. Moreover, cotreatment of parthenolide with CNTF showed a significant additive effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D, E</xref>), resulting in a 3.5-fold higher average neurite length than vehicle-treated controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D, E</xref>). Although parthenolide reportedly reduces JAK/STAT3 signaling at micromolar concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>], the nanomolar concentrations used in our experiments did not alter CNTF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in RGCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F, G</xref>). Conversely, CNTF did not measurably affect parthenolide’s inhibitory effect on microtubule detyrosination in axon tips (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H, I</xref>). We also tested parthenolide on human RGCs. To this end, we prepared and cultured primary RGCs from adult human eyes. Parthenolide and CNTF significantly enhanced the average neurite length at similar concentrations as in mouse RGCs, while cotreatment enhanced neurite growth sixfold compared to controls after 4 days (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 J, K</xref>). Parthenolide also reduced microtubule detyrosination in axonal growth cones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1 M, N</xref>) without affecting the number of RGCs per well (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 L</xref>).</p>

<title>Parthenolide counteracts hIL-6 and PTEN<sup>-/-</sup>-induced microtubule detyrosination</title>
<p>Due to its direct binding of the signal-transducing gp130 receptor, hIL-6 promotes neurite growth of RGCs more efficaciously than CNTF and, contrary to CNTF, also measurably induces PI3K/AKT signaling in these neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. However, AKT inactivates GSK3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), which promotes CRMP2 activity (Leibinger et al., 2017, 2019). While enhanced CRMP2 activity is favorable for axon growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], GSK3 inhibition might also elevate tubulin detyrosination via reduced MAP1B activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). However, as shown in the previous experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), reducing microtubule detyrosination promotes neurite growth, suggesting that this effect of AKT/GSK3 might limit optimal axonal growth. To test these possibilities, we intravitreally injected AAV2-hIL-6 into mice 3 weeks before tissue isolation. Subsequent western blot analysis of respective optic nerve lysates indeed revealed increased inhibitory phosphorylation of both GSK3 isoforms (pGSK3α, pGSK3β) by hIL-6 compared to untreated controls, without affecting total GSK3 expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B-E). Moreover, while hIL-6 reduced inhibitory phosphorylation of CRMP2 at threonine 514 (T514) without changing total CRMP2 levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B, F, G</xref>), it expectedly elevated tubulin detyrosination (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B, H</xref>). Since parthenolide specifically acts on tubulin detyrosination without influencing CRMP2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">supplementary Fig. 1 A, B</xref>), it should be suitable to counteract an hIL-6-mediated increase in axonal tubulin detyrosination. To test this hypothesis, we cultured RGCs from AAV-hIL-6-treated mice or respective controls for 4 days without or presence of different parthenolide concentrations. Confirmingly, microtubule detyrosination in axonal tips was significantly higher in hIL-6-treated cultures than in controls, and parthenolide cotreatment reversed this effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 I, J</xref>). Furthermore, the increased detyrosination in hIL-6-treated neurons also affected the effective parthenolide concentration on neurite extension in these cultures. Compared to the control cultures, where parthenolide showed the most substantial increase between 0.5 and 1 nM, followed by a decrease at 5 nM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A, B</xref>), neurite growth of hIL-6-stimulated RGCs was increased even at higher parthenolide concentrations (up to 5 nM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 K, L</xref>). The hIL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation remained unaffected by any parthenolide concentration applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">supplementary Fig. 2 A, B</xref>). AKT is also activated by PTEN<sup>-/-</sup>, another regeneration-promoting approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. To investigate microtubule detyrosination in PTEN<sup>-/-</sup> RGC neurites, we prepared RGC cultures from PTEN-floxed mice after intravitreal AAV2-Cre injection. As expected, PTEN<sup>-/-</sup> enhanced tubulin detyrosination in axon tips (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A, B, C</xref>). This effect was counteracted by parthenolide, which further improved neurite outgrowth of PTEN<sup>-/-</sup>-RGCs concentration-dependently (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B, C, D, E</xref>). Moreover, activation of the mTOR pathway, a significant contributor to the PTEN<sup>-/-</sup>-mediated effects on axon growth, was not compromised by parthenolide, reflected by unaltered activation of ribosomal protein S6 in these RGC cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">supplementary Fig. 2 C, D</xref>). Thus, parthenolide counteracts AKT/GSK3-induced microtubule detyrosination and synergistically enhances hIL-6, or PTEN<sup>-/-</sup>-stimulated neurite growth.</p>

To this end, adult mice were subjected to an optic nerve crush (ONC) and received daily intraperitoneal injections of either vehicle or DMAPT (2 µg/kg) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). The number of CTB-labeled, regenerated axons was quantified in optic nerve sections 2 weeks post-injury. Compared to vehicle-treated controls, more axons reached distances of up to 0.5 mm distal to the lesion site after DMAPT application, indicating a slight but significant effect on regeneration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B-E). At the same time, the RGC survival was not affected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F, G</xref>). We then repeated these experiments in combination with intravitreally applied AAV2-hIL-6 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 H</xref>). Two weeks after injury, retinal cross-sections revealed robust phosphorylation of STAT3 in AAV2-hIL-6-treated RGCs, which remained unaffected by DMAPT treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 I</xref>). As reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], hIL-6 treatment alone enabled substantial regeneration with CTB-labeled axons reaching distances of up to 1.5 mm 2 weeks after injury (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> J-O). Notably, additional DMAPT application at 2 µg/kg increased the number of axons at 1.5 mm fivefold, with some axons reaching distances of 2.5 mm within the same time after injury (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 J, K, N, O</xref>). As observed in RGC cultures, DMAPT acted dose-dependently, with less pronounced effects at lower (0.2 µg/kg) or higher (20 µg/kg) dosages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Fig. 3 A, B</xref>). Thus, the systemic application of DMAPT sufficiently enhances and accelerates the effect of hIL-6 on optic nerve regeneration.</p>

<title>Systemic DMAPT application accelerates raphespinal regeneration after spinal cord crush</title>
<p>Hyper-IL-6-mediated axonal regeneration of raphespinal fibers enables functional recovery after a severe spinal cord crush (SCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated whether systemic DMAPT treatment also affects raphespinal regeneration or functional recovery. To this end, we performed a complete SCC at the thoracic vertebra 8 (T8) level, followed by daily intraperitoneal injections of either vehicle or DMAPT at 2 µg/kg (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Hindlimb movement was analyzed using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] over 8 weeks after injury. One day after SCC, BMS scores dropped to 0, indicating the absence of hindlimb movement (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B, C</xref>). After 2 weeks, most vehicle-treated animals recovered from the injury-induced spinal shock and reestablished typical extensive ankle movement (BMS: 2) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B,C</xref>; supplementary video 1). In contrast, DMAPT treatment slightly but significantly improved functional recovery. Most of these animals showed plantar hind paw placement as early as 2 weeks after injury, occasionally accompanied by bodyweight support (BMS: 3) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B,C</xref>; supplementary video 2). For this reason, the spinal cord tissue of some animals was analyzed for serotonergic fiber regeneration at this early time. The absence of serotonergic fibers at ∼10 mm distal to the lesion site verified the lesion completeness in each animal included in this study to rule out the presence of spared raphespinal axons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">supplementary Fig. 4 A-H</xref>). Vehicle-treated control animals showed only typical short-distance sprouting of serotonergic axons less than 2 mm distal to the lesion site (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> E-G, K). At the same time, DMAPT treatment increased the number and length of axons, with the longest axons reaching 4 mm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>, H-K). When analyzed 8 weeks after SCC (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>), DMAPT further accelerated raphespinal regeneration, with the longest axons reaching &gt;7 mm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B-M). However, despite the more pronounced anatomical regeneration, the BMS score was only slightly further increased compared to 14 days after SCC (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 N</xref>). In addition, the lesion size and CSPG expression at the glial scar remained unaffected by DMAPT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">supplementary Fig. 5 A-D</xref>). Thus, systemic DMAPT application accelerates raphespinal regeneration and some functional recovery after a severe spinal cord injury.</p>

<title>Raphespinal regeneration contributes to DMAPT-mediated functional recovery</title>
<p>We prepared additional mice to investigate whether the DMAPT-mediated effects on functional recovery depend on serotonergic fiber regeneration, as previously shown for hIL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. To this end, we performed SCC with either vehicle or DMAPT treatment. After the DMAPT group had reached maximum functional recovery, we injected the serotonergic neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (DHT), which depletes raphe neurons as early as one day after injection, as shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>].

<title>DMAPT accelerates hIL-6-induced functional recovery after complete spinal cord crush</title>
<p>Intracortical injection of AAV2-hIL-6 promotes axon regeneration and functional recovery after SCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. To test for synergistic effects, as seen in the optic nerve (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), we combined hIL-6 and DMAPT treatment. To this end, we subjected wild-type mice to SCC and injected AAV2-hIL-6 into the sensorimotor cortex. Mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of either vehicle or DMAPT for 8 weeks (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>). As determined by immunostaining, AAV2-hIL-6-mediated transduction of layer V cortical motorneurons induced robust phosphorylation of STAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">supplementary Fig. 7 A-E</xref>). Consistent with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], intracortical AAV2-hIL-6 also transneuronally stimulated medullary raphe neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">supplementary Fig. 7 I-M</xref>).

Consistent with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], AAV2-hIL-6 treatment restored plantar hind paw placement and stepping with lift-off, followed by forwarding limb advancement and re-establishment of bodyweight support, reaching a maximum BMS score of 4-5 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B-C). Interestingly, combinatorial treatment with DMAPT accelerated functional recovery, allowing plantar steps in most animals already 14 d after SCC. These mice reached the maximum effect already at 21 days after injury, while animals solely treated with hIL-6 needed 42 days (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B-C; supplementary video 5, 6). Moreover, additional DMAPT treatment also reduced the variance, with fewer weakly responding animals, resulting in a higher average final score of 4 compared to 3.5 in the hIL-6 control group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we demonstrate that the systemic application of DMAPT facilitates axon regeneration in the injured optic nerve and accelerates functional recovery after severe spinal cord injury. Parthenolide’s effects on CNS regeneration in vivo were confirmed in cell culture using primary RGCs from adult mice and humans. As on sensory neurons (preprint server) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], parthenolide reduces microtubule detyrosination in axonal tips, which increases their dynamics and promotes axon extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. As for sensory neurons, this effect is likely mediated by the inhibition of VASH1/VASH2, the enzymes catalyzing the detyrosination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Consistently, the effective concentration range and doses of parthenolide/DMAPT to accelerate axon regeneration of RGC, serotonergic fibers in the spinal cord, and functional recovery was similar to sensory neurons and regeneration in the injured peripheral nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Parthenolide did not affect CRMP2 or STAT3 activity at the nanomolar concentrations used in this study, both critical for CNS axon regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] and suggesting the reduction of microtubule detyrosination causes the axon growth-promoting effect.</p>
<p>Systemic DMAPT treatment significantly promotes axon extension in the optic nerve and regeneration of serotonergic fibers beyond the injury site. The selective elimination of serotonergic fibers by DHT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] abolishes the recovered locomotion, demonstrating that the improved regeneration of serotonergic fibers is essential for recovery after SCC. These data are consistent with previously published data, showing a similar effect on AAV-hIL-6 mediated recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Despite the fact that DMAPT-mediated functional improvement depends on the regeneration of serotonergic fibers, we cannot exclude the possibility that spinal tracts other than the raphespinal tract contributed as well. The fact that DMAPT improved axon regeneration in the optic nerve and the spinal cord also implies that sufficient amounts of the drug reached the axonal growth cones, where the drug affects the microtubule detyrosination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. It is likely that an oral application of DMAPT, which reportedly is &gt;60% bioavailable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>], has similar effects on nerve regeneration, bolstering the potential as a drug to treat axonal CNS damage.</p>
<p>Another significant finding of the current study is that pro-regenerative hIL-6 and PTEN<sup>-/-</sup> treatments induce microtubule detyrosination in RGC axons. Given that a parthenolide-mediated reduction of microtubule detyrosination promotes axon growth, these observations suggest that this effect of hIL-6 or PTEN<sup>-/-</sup> compromises their full axon regeneration-promoting potential. hIL-6 and PTEN<sup>-/-</sup> induced microtubule detyrosination is likely caused by inhibitory GSK3 phosphorylation via increased PI3K/AKT activity. As a result, MAP1B activity is decreased, and the axonal detyrosination rate is elevated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. However, CNTF does not affect detyrosination due to its lower AKT activation than hIL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. At the same time, hIL-6 and PTEN<sup>-/-</sup> mediated GSK3 inhibition confers disinhibitory effects toward myelin-associated molecules because less CRMP2 is inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Thus, the disinhibitory effect of GSK3 inhibition promotes regeneration, while the detyrosinating effect on microtubules rather compromises it. Therefore, by counteracting detyrosination, parthenolide/DMAPT cotreatment further increases the axon growth-promoting effect of hIL-6. Consistently, effective parthenolide concentrations reduce detyrosination levels in hIL-6-treated and PTEN<sup>-/-</sup> RGCs, and combined treatment leads to more substantial neurite growth than each treatment alone. This notion is also supported by the fact that PTEN<sup>-/-</sup> and hIL-6-stimulated neurons sustain parthenolide-induced additive elevation of axon growth even at higher parthenolide concentrations, which already diminish outgrowth on naïve or CNTF-stimulated RGCs. The level of detyrosinated tubulin at the maximal applied parthenolide concentration in hIL-6 treated RGCs was still similar to untreated control RGCs. The synergistic effects of DMAPT and hIL-6 were also reproduced <italic>in vivo</italic>, in the optic nerve and spinal cord. Thus, parthenolide/DMAPT neutralizes the hIL-6-mediated limiting effect of decreased microtubule dynamics and synergistically accelerates CNS regeneration.</p>
<p>Our findings also indicate that DMAPT mainly accelerates axon growth and has little effect on the intrinsic regenerative state of neurons. Therefore, the RGC regeneration-promoting effects of parthenolide on its own are only moderate but synergistically increase hIL-6-mediated axon extension. Thus, DMAPT enabled substantial regeneration of serotonergic RpST after complete SCC. Furthermore, the length of regenerating RpST axons after SCC further increased from 2 to 8 wpc, while the functional recovery was already almost maximal in the early phase. This observation might be based on the different possibilities of achieving active recovery. On the one hand, descending supraspinal axons might need to grow over long distances to reestablish functional connections within the lumbar central pattern generator (CPG), a network of neurons responsible for generating stereotyped hindlimb movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. On the other hand, it is also possible that severed axons only need to overcome short distances of a few spinal segments and then connect to existing propriospinal neurons, which might serve as a relay station to the CPG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. An observation accounting for the latter possibility is increased axonal sprouting in the region of the lumbar CPG (∼6-7 mm distal to the lesion) at 8 wpc, whereas the substantial increase in functional recovery occurred already earlier (∼2-3 wpc) before the axons had reached the CPG. Thus, DMAPT-induced long-distance RpST regeneration might not be essential for its beneficial effects on functional recovery, whereas DHT experiments showed that RpST regeneration, in general, is crucial.</p>
<p>In conclusion, systemically applied DMAPT measurably accelerates CNS regeneration and functional recovery and overcomes the limiting effect of AKT/GSK3 on elevating microtubule detyrosination. Whether DMAPT treatment can also improve functional recovery in more clinically relevant injury models, such as contusion injuries, or even more effective in combination with other regeneration-promoting strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] will be investigated in the future. Finally, the axon growth-promoting effects on primary adult human CNS neurons underline the potential of parthenolide/DMAPT as a possible future treatment strategy for CNS injury in humans.</p>

<p>The primary goal of this paper is to examine microtubule detyrosination as a potential therapeutic target for axon regeneration. Using dimethylamino-parthenolide (DMAPT), this study extensively examines mechanistic links between microtubule detyrosination, hyper-interleukin-6 (hIL-6), and PTEN in neurite outgrowth in retinal ganglion cells in vitro. These findings provide convincing evidence that parthenolide has a synergistic effect on hIL-6- and PTEN-related mechanisms of neurite outgrowth in vitro. The potential efficacy of systemic DMAPT treatment to promote axon</p>
<p>
regeneration in mouse models of optic nerve crush and spinal cord injury was also examined.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. The examination of synergistic activities between parthenolide, hyperIL-6, and PTEN knockout is leveraged not only for potential therapeutic value, but also to validate and delineate mechanism of action.</p>
<p>2. The in vitro studies utilize a multi-level approach that combines cell biology and biochemistry approaches to dissect the mechanistic link from parthenolide to microtubule dynamics.</p>
<p>3. The studies provide a basis for others to test the role of DMAPT in other settings, particularly in the context of other effective pro-regenerative approaches.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. In vivo studies are limited to select outcomes of recovery and do not validate or address mechanism of action in vivo.</p>
<p>2. Known activities of DMAPT beyond microtubule detyrosination, such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial function and NFkB inhibition, are not considered in experimental examinations or in the interpretation of findings.</p>

<p>Response: Our research indicates that parthenolide exhibits a regenerative effect within a nanomolar range and with a bell-shaped concentration-response curve in culture. Moreover, we demonstrate a close correlation between the inhibition of detyrosinated microtubules and regeneration and consider the effects of hIL-6 or PTEN-KO on detyrosination in mouse and human RGCs. Therefore, we offer a coherent and satisfactory mechanistic explanation for the effects of parthenolide. We, therefore, feel the request to experimentally explore additional, somewhat speculative possibilities is not reasonable or helpful, and this issue should not be considered as a weakness.</p>
<p>Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no evidence suggests profound antioxidative effects of DMAPT or parthenolide within these low-concentration ranges and that these would affect axon regeneration. Antioxidative effects may also not explain the observed bell-shaped curve. Furthermore, we have already considered the effect of NFkappaB in our previous work (Gobrecht et al., 2016) and shown that NFkappaB remains unaffected by low concentrations of parthenolide. Hence, conducting additional experiments addressing oxidative stress or other speculative causes will not strengthen our findings and do not justify the additional sacrifice of animal lives. Nevertheless, we will consider discussing these points in a revised version.</p>
