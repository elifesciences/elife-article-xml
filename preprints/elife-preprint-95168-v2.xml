<title>Abstract</title><p>Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is an emerging imaging modality that resolves microvasculature in deep tissues with high spatial resolution. However, existing preclinical ULM applications are largely constrained to anesthetized animals, introducing confounding vascular effects such as vasodilation and altered hemodynamics. As such, ULM quantifications (e.g., vessel diameter, density, and flow velocity) may be confounded by the use of anesthesia, undermining the usefulness of ULM in practice. Here we introduce a method to address this limitation and achieve ULM imaging in awake mouse brain. Pupillary monitoring was used to support the presence of the awake state during ULM imaging. Vasodilation induced by isoflurane was observed by ULM. Upon recovery to the awake state, reductions in vessel density and flow velocity were observed across different brain regions. In the cortex, the effects induced by isoflurane are more pronounced on venous flow than on arterial flow. In addition, serial <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of the same animal brain at weekly intervals demonstrated the highly robust longitudinal imaging capability of the proposed technique. The consistency was further verified through quantitative analysis on individual vessels, cortical regions of arteries and veins, and subcortical regions. This study demonstrates longitudinal ULM imaging in the awake mouse brain, which is crucial for many ULM brain applications that require awake and behaving animals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sensitive imaging of correlates of activity in the awake brain is fundamental for advancing our understanding of neural function and neurological diseases. In the field of neuroscience, there is a growing interest in utilizing imaging techniques to study the rodent brain, which serves as a valuable model for investigating brain function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Brain imaging modalities for rodents encompass a wide range of techniques, including but not limited to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, positron emission tomography (PET)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, one- and two-photon imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, photoacoustic imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, and more recently ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. ULM is uniquely capable of imaging microvasculature situated in deep tissue (e.g., at a depth of several centimeters). ULM can also be combined with the principles of functional ultrasound (fUS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> to image whole-brain neural activity at a microscopic scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. The structural and functional imaging capabilities of ULM have opened new doors for numerous basic research and clinical applications that involve cerebral microvasculature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>At present, a key limitation associated with existing ULM brain imaging studies is the use of anesthesia, which induces profound alterations to cerebral blood flow (CBF), including changes in vessel size (e.g., diameter) and flow velocity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. As such, CBF measurements under anesthesia do not reflect the blood flow under the normal physiological state of the brain. In addition, anesthetics also have a significant attenuating effect on neural responses to sensory inputs, thereby impacting the neurovascular coupling process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, in neuroscience research, brain imaging in the awake state is often preferred over imaging under anesthesia (e.g., fluorescence imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, photoacoustic imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, fMRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, PET<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, and fUS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>). As ULM is gaining traction in many preclinical brain imaging applications, enabling ULM for awake animals has become crucial to eliminate the confounding vascular effects of anesthetics and obtain accurate structural and functional cerebrovascular measurements.</p>
<p>Another challenge associated with preclinical ULM brain imaging is to conduct long-term, longitudinal studies, which are essential for tracking disease progression or therapeutic impacts for many neurological disease applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. The key technical challenge for longitudinal ULM brain imaging is to find the same imaging plane and reconstruct consistent ULM images across different imaging sessions. Misalignment of imaging planes or tissue movement will undermine ULM imaging quality and result in inconsistent cerebrovascular quantifications. Although intact skull imaging has been shown to be feasible for short-term studies (e.g., over a few days)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, long-term monitoring can be challenging because changes in skull properties over time (e.g., thickness and composition) could negatively impact ULM imaging quality. Currently there is a strong need for methodological developments to enable longitudinal brain imaging with ULM.</p>
<p>In this study, we developed a method for awake and longitudinal ULM brain imaging in a mouse model to eliminate the confounding vascular effects of anesthesia and enable monitoring of cerebral vasculature over a three-week period in the same animal. We constructed a head-fixed awake imaging platform and established a ULM image reconstruction metric to allow comparisons of ULM images acquired at different states of wakefulness (e.g., awake vs. anesthesia). Our method allowed detailed comparisons of local and global variations of the cerebral vasculature and blood flow under awake and anesthesia conditions. Detailed quantitative analysis of vessel diameter and blood flow velocity was performed. We also demonstrated robust longitudinal ULM brain imaging on same animals with high repeatability over multiple weeks.</p>

<title>ULM brain imaging can be performed in head-fixed awake mice</title>
<p>To achieve consistent ULM brain imaging while allowing limited movement in awake animals, a head-fixed imaging platform with a chronic cranial window was used in this study. Pre-surgery handling and post-surgery habituation were employed to alleviate animal stress and facilitate awake imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. To further minimize tissue motion, a 3D-printed body tube was adopted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> for animal immobilization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). A headpost was implanted during cranial window surgery to fix the animalâs head to the body tube. In this procedure, the skull was removed, and the brain tissue was protected using a polymethyl pentene (PMP) membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, which was further protected by a layer of silicone rubber (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Animals were imaged after one week of surgical recovery and head-fixation habituation. Prior to each imaging session, the silicone rubber was gently removed with forceps, and the transparent PMP membrane allowed detailed examination of the brain surface to ensure absence of tissue damage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>

<p>Contrast enhancing microbubbles (MBs) were administered intravenously via tail vein in this study (details provided in Methods). Isoflurane anesthesia was terminated right after microbubble (MB) injection, marking the beginning of the data acquisition (i.e., T = 0s). Mice were allowed to gradually regain consciousness. Throughout the awakening process, an infrared camera was used to monitor the pupil to provide a reference for the state of arousal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref> shows the change in pupillary area over time, which reveals a gradual enlargement of the pupil after the cessation of anesthesia. Due to differences in tail vein injection timing and anesthesia depth, the time required for each mouse to fully awaken varied. Although it was not feasible to get pupil size stabilized just after 500 seconds for each animal, ULM reconstruction only used the data that acquired after the animal reached full pupillary dilation, to ensure that ULM accurately captures the cerebrovascular characteristics in the awake state. Ultrafast plane wave imaging data were collected for ULM reconstruction (details provided in Methods) and a representative awake ULM brain image is presented in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>.</p>

<title>Microbubble count serves as a quantitative metric for awake ULM image reconstruction</title>
<p>Due to the stochastic nature of MB localization and fluctuations of MB concentration in the blood stream, it is challenging to compare ULM images acquired at different states of wakefulness with different cerebral blood flow conditions. Therefore, to obtain complete, fully saturated ULM images under different physiological conditions and MB concentrations, we used MB count as a measure of vessel saturation to determine the completeness of ULM reconstructions. To ensure high quality ULM imaging, only MBs that were successfully tracked by the uTrack algorithm (details provided in Methods) were considered as effective MB signals that were utilized for ULM image quantification.</p>
<p>To facilitate equitable comparison of brain perfusion at different states, a practical saturation point enabling stable quantification of most vessels needs to be established. Our observations indicated that when the cumulative MB count reached 5 million, ULM images achieved a relatively stable state. Accordingly, in this study, the saturation point was defined as a cumulative MB count of 5 million. There are also possible alternatives for ULM image normalization. For example, different ULM images can be normalized to have the same saturation rate. However, the proposed method of using the same number of cumulative MB count for normalization enables the analysis of blood flow distribution across different brain regions from a probabilistic perspective. The following analysis substantiates this criterion.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> compares ULM directional vessel density maps and flow speed maps generated with 1, 3, 5, and 6 million MBs, using the same animal as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. To quantitatively confirm saturation, multiple vessel segments were selected for further analysis. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> presents the measured vessel diameter for a specific segment at various MB counts. After binarizing the ULM map, the vessel diameter was measured by calculating the distance from the vessel centerline to the edge. Each point along the centerline of the segment provided a diameter measurement, enabling calculation of the mean and standard error. At low MB counts, vessels appeared incompletely filled, leading to inaccurate estimation of vessel diameter due to incomplete profiles. For example, at 1â2 million MBs, the binarized ULM map displayed a width of only one or two pixels along the segment. As a result, the measurements always yielded the same diameter values (two pixels, â¼10um) with a consistently low standard error of the mean across the entire segment. With increased MB counts, the measured vessel diameter gradually rose, ultimately reaching saturation. The plots in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> show that vessel diameter stabilized at 5 million MB count. Additionally, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> illustrates the changes in flow velocity measured at different cumulative MB counts. The violin plots display the distribution of flow speed estimates for all valid centerline pixels within the selected segment. At low MB counts (1â3 million), flow velocity estimates fluctuated, but they stabilized as the MB count increased (4â6 million MBs). At 5 million MBs, flow velocity estimates were nearly identical to those at 6 million MBs, corroborating previous findings that vessel velocity measurements stabilize as MB count grows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. To assess the generalizability of the 5 million MB saturation condition, vessel segments from three different mice across various brain regions were examined. The results, shown in <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>, confirm that this saturation criterion applies broadly. Although the 5 million MB threshold may not ensure absolute saturation for all vessels, it is generally effective for vessels larger than 15 Î¼m. This MB count threshold was therefore adopted as a practical criterion.</p>

The x-axis for <bold>d-f</bold> begins at 500 seconds because, at this point, the mouseâs pupil size stabilized, indicating it had recovered to an awake state. Consequently, ULM images were accumulated starting from this time. It is important to note that not every mouse requires 500 seconds to fully awaken; the time to reach a stable awake state varies across individual mice.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>To further verify that the proposed MB bolus injection method can help to achieve ULM image saturation shortly after mice awaken from anesthesia, an analysis on the change in MB concentration over time was conducted once pupil size had stabilized (T = 500s). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref> shows a clear trend of decreasing MB concentration in the blood stream and increasing cumulative MB count with time. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref> demonstrates a flattened vessel saturation curve and a rapidly reducing vessel filling rate, which is typical for ULM reconstruction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. The pixel filling rate dropped below 5% of the initial rate after 300 seconds of ULM data accumulation (T = 800s), indicating ULM image saturation. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref> further examines the relationship between the pixel filling rate and the cumulative MB count, which is independent of data acquisition time. The pixel filling rate at 5 million cumulative MBs is always below 5% of the initial rate for each experiment, ensuring image saturation. In summary, all the quantitative measurements indicate that ULM images obtained using the proposed metric (i.e., 5 million MBs) were complete and can be used to consistently measure cerebral vascular properties such as vessel diameter and blood flow velocity. All subsequent ULM images in this study were produced using this criterion.</p>

<title>ULM reveals increase in blood flow induced by isoflurane anesthesia</title>
<p><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> presents a comparison of ULM directional vessel density maps and flow velocity maps in awake and anesthetized states for three different coronal planes from three animals. Four regions of interest (ROIs) were selected within each imaging plane to provide detailed comparisons. When comparing vessel density maps, ULM images that were acquired in the awake state demonstrate a global reduction of vascularity, which refers to percentage of pixels that occupied by blood vessels. The reduction is also clearly observed in magnified local regions especially for regions 5, which encompasses the pretectal region. In addition to reduced vascularity, ULM also reveals decreased vessel diameter which reflects vasoconstriction after the animals woke up (e.g., white arrows in regions 1, 3, and 6, corresponding to the thalamus, cortex and midbrain/cortex overlap region). Focusing on ULM flow speed maps, a global reduction in flow speed can be clearly observed when transitioning from anesthetized to awake. Regional maps further revealed the significant flow speed reduction for most of the vessels throughout the brain (e.g., blue arrows).</p>

<p>To quantitatively compare the results from <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, we performed various analyses in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. Since previous studies have shown that isoflurane induces different effects on arteries and veins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, we first selected a cortical artery and vein for comparison. In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a, a</xref> cortical region near Region 3 from <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> was selected, and one artery and one vein in this region were analyzed. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref> compares the vessel diameters of these segments in anesthetized and awake states. For the selected artery, no significant change in diameter was observed, with both anesthetized and awake states showing an average diameter of 22 Âµm. In contrast, the selected vein displayed a notable response to isoflurane, with its diameter decreasing significantly from 54 Âµm under isoflurane anesthesia to 41 Âµm in the awake state. Flow velocity analysis of the same vessels further suggests that isoflurane may have a greater impact on venous blood flow velocity: arterial flow velocity increased slightly from 7.33 mm/s under anesthesia to 8.04 mm/s in the awake state, whereas venous flow velocity decreased from 10.48 mm/s to 8.11 mm/s, with both the magnitude and statistical significance of the decrease greater in the vein.</p>

<p>While single-vessel analysis provides valuable insights, its generalizability is limited. To validate the broader applicability of our findings, we conducted ROI-based analyses of cortical arteries and veins, using vascularity and mean velocity as primary metrics. The relationship between arteriovenous classification and blood flow direction is more straightforward to infer on cortex, with downward flow representing cortical arteries and upward flow representing cortical veins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref> shows, for Mouse 1, the comparison of cortical upward (venous) and downward (arterial) flow density maps under different states. <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> also provides a detailed comparison of upward and downward flow for all three mice in both anesthetized and awake conditions. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref> demonstrates that transitioning from isoflurane anesthesia to the awake state led to a reduction in vascularity for both arteries and veins within the selected cortical ROI across all three mice. However, the decrease in venous vascularity (averaging 55% across mice) was greater than that of arterial vascularity (averaging 35%). <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref> further illustrates the change in mean velocity within the selected ROI, where both arteries and veins showed a decreasing trend; however, venous flow velocity reduced by an average of 38%, compared to a 19% reduction in arterial flow velocity across the cortical ROI. These results underscore the different responses of arteries and veins to isoflurane anesthesia, which is also indicated by previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To visualize flow velocity changes more clearly, we highlighted the flow velocity comparison for the same region in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref> and provided a violin plot of velocity estimates within the ROI in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>. The violin plots reveal a consistently greater reduction in venous flow velocity from anesthesia to the awake state across all three mice.</p>
<p>For deeper brain regions, flow analyses were conducted without separating arteries and veins, as this physiological separation is not established for ULM in these regions. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref> displays the selected ROIs for each mouse, while <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4k</xref> present the trends in vascularity and flow velocity changes across different brain regions. Results indicate that vascularity and flow velocity decreased across the brain as mice transitioned from anesthetized to awake states, with subcortical ROIs showing more pronounced changes than cortical ROIs. For example, in the thalamus and midbrain regions, average vascularity decreased by 37% and average flow velocity by 17%, whereas cortical ROIs exhibited smaller decreases of 4% in vascularity and 11% in flow velocity. This work is consistent with a previous fMRI study, where it was also observed that isoflurane-induced cerebral hyperemia was not most pronounced in the cerebral cortex compared with other deeper brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In summary, statistical analysis revealed a decrease in individual vessel diameter, vascularity, and blood flow velocity (particularly in venules) after awakening. These findings align with existing research, indicating higher blood perfusion during isoflurane anesthesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>To quantitatively evaluate the consistency of ULM imaging in longitudinal studies, we conducted a similar analysis to that shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. First, a case study was performed on individual vessels by selecting an artery and a vein in the cortex of Mouse 4 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>) and measuring vessel diameter (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>) and flow velocity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>) along the selected segments. The results show small variation in measurements across weeks. For vessel diameter, both arterial and venous segments demonstrated statistical equivalence across the three weekly measurements. Statistical testing of equivalence was conducted using the two one-sided test (TOST) procedure, which evaluates the null hypothesis that the difference between the two weeks is larger than three times the standard deviation of one week. Large p-values from the TOST analyses indicate rejection of the null hypothesis, supporting that the measurements are equivalent. For flow velocity, apart from a slight decrease in the venous flow during the second week (4.49 mm/s, compared to 6.03 mm/s in the first week and 6.00 mm/s in the third week), no other significant differences were observed. Overall, quantitative measurements maintained high consistency, though slight variations were expected due to differences in probe positioning and physiological variations among the mice.</p>

<p>To further generalize these findings and examine longitudinal variation in ROI-based analysis, we used Mouse 4 as an example to show the consistency of blood flow density across different flow directions in the cortex (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>) and extended the quantitative analysis to all three mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>). In <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>, we present a comparison of upward and downward flow images for all three mice over the three-week longitudinal study period. In the comparative study shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, clear differences were seen between arterial and venous responses under various conditions, while in the longitudinal study, both arteries and veins exhibited similar levels of variation. For instance, in Mouse 6, both arterial and venous vascularity showed a notable decrease from around 60% in the first week to around 40% in the second week, which is a relatively large variation compared with other measurements. This quantitative analysis aims to inform readers of the expected range of variation of this technique. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref> displays the flow velocity map for the same region as in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>, with flow velocity distributions inside the selected ROI for all three mice shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>. While arterial and venous flow velocity distributions exhibit clear distinctions, their variations over the three weeks remained acceptable. Even in the previously mentioned case of Mouse 6 during Week 1 and Week 2, arterial mean flow velocity only shifted from 6.31 mm/s in the first week to 7.00 mm/s in the second week.</p>
<p>We also conducted ROI analyses without distinguishing between arteries and veins for subcortical regions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6hâk</xref>), using the same ROIs as those shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. Although subcortical regions show larger difference to anesthesia-induced changes, they maintained relatively stable values in the longitudinal study. In terms of vascularity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i</xref>), Mouse 5 exhibited the greatest variation among the three mice, with vascularity increasing from 55% in the first week to 67% in the third week. Compared to the maximum 40% reduction seen from anesthesia to awake states in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j</xref>, vascularity measurement in subcortical regions remained consistent. This observation also applied to mean velocity measurements.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we introduced a method for performing ULM brain imaging in awake mice under a longitudinal study setting. Our method enabled high-resolution imaging of deep cerebral micro-vasculature with the animal under the awake state. We translated the awake imaging techniques previously described in fUS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> to our study to enable awake ULM, and established a quantitative metric for ULM image reconstruction. Based on the setup above, we studied CBF changes induced by anesthesia, which aligned well with literature. Isoflurane has been shown to increase vascular diameter and CBF in mice, as validated by multiple imaging modalities including optical coherence tomography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, photoacoustic microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, two-photon microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, and laser speckle imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. These effects have also been validated in larger animal models such as rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, dogs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, and marmosets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. In human, vasodilation and increased CBF caused by volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane have also been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis from <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> shows that certain vessels exhibit a larger diameter under isoflurane anesthesia, and the vascularity, calculated as the percentage of vascular area within selected brain region ROIs, is also higher in the anesthetized state. These findings suggest a vasodilation effect induced by isoflurane, consistent with existing research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. It is worth noting that although our data indicate a global elevation of CBF under isoflurane anesthesia, individual vessels exhibit large discrepancies in behavior. For example, the vessel at the left lower corner from Mouse 3 in the entorhinal cortex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) shows almost no blood flow during anesthesia but then exhibits high vessel pixel density after awakening. The wide range of vessel behaviors were also previously reported in literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Our results indicate that awake ULM imaging has ample spatial resolution and imaging depth of penetration to resolve individual vessel variations down to micron-sized vessels deep into the brain. This is a unique capability that is not available from other biomedical imaging modalities.</p>
<p>Increased blood flow velocity induced by isoflurane has also been reported by other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. However, previous research presented different speculations on the predominant factor contributing to the increase in CBF induced by anesthesia, specifically whether the increase is attributed to vasodilation or increase in blood flow velocity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. One study found significant changes in both blood flow and vessel diameter but minor changes in flow velocity, suggesting that the increase in blood flow was largely driven by vasodilation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Conversely, another study drew the opposite conclusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Benefitting from the large field of view (FOV) of ULM and its capability to directly quantify microvascular blood flow velocity, we can make a more comprehensive inference regarding the relationship among the changes in vessel diameter, flow speed, and flow volume from anesthetized to awake states. For arteries, the change in blood flow velocity is not significant, indicating that the alteration in blood flow may be primarily due to vasodilation instead of velocity change. Isoflurane causes vasodilation by acting on the ion channels (e.g., potassium channel) of smooth muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, which is more abundantly found in arteries than in veins. In the case of veins, which do not actively dilate or constrict, their vessel diameter and blood flow variations are more likely controlled by passive mechanisms. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> reveals significant differences in flow velocity of veins between anesthesia and awake state, suggesting that the changes in flow velocity may have a greater impact on venous blood flow volume compared with arterial volume.</p>
<p>The differences in cerebral vasculature between anesthetized and awake states observed using ULM are also in agreement with other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. However, previous studies mostly used optical imaging techniques, which have limited penetration depth and can only observe surface pial vessels in the cortex. Some other studies using fMRI can detect deeper CBF changes in the whole brain, but they do not provide insights about small vessel blood flow variations due to insufficient spatial resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. As a bridging imaging modality between MRI and optical techniques, awake ULM enables observations of detailed microvascular variations induced by anesthesia across the whole depth of the brain, which provides complementary information to existing biomedical imaging modalities.</p>
<p>Although isoflurane is widely used in ultrasound imaging because it provides long-lasting and stable anesthetic effects, it is important to note that the vasodilation observed with isoflurane is not representative of all anesthetics. Some anesthesia protocols, such as ketamine combined with medetomidine, do not produce significant vasodilation and are therefore preferred in experiments where vascular stability is essential, such as functional ultrasound imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Therefore, in future studies, it would be valuable to design more rigorous control experiments with larger sample sizes to systematically compare the effects of isoflurane anesthesia, awake states, and other anesthetics that do not induce vasodilation on cerebral blood flow.</p>
<p>Our proposed method enabled repeatable longitudinal brain imaging over a three-week period, addressing a key limitation of conventional ULM imaging and offering potential for various preclinical applications. However, there are still some limitations in this study.</p>
<p>One of the limitations is the lack of objective measures to assess the effectiveness of head-fix habituation in reducing anxiety. This may introduce variability in stress levels among mice. Recent studies suggest that tracking physiological parameters such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and corticosterone levels during habituation can confirm that mice reach a low stress state prior to imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. This approach would be highly beneficial for future awake imaging studies. Furthermore, alternative head-fixation setups, such as air-floated balls or treadmills, which allow the free movement of limbs, have been shown to reduce anxiety and facilitate natural behaviors during imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Adopting these approaches in future studies could enhance the reliability of awake imaging data by minimizing stress-related confounds.</p>
<p>Another limitation of this study is the potential residual vasodilatory effect of isoflurane anesthesia on awake imaging sessions. The awake imaging sessions were conducted shortly after the mice had emerged from isoflurane anesthesia, required for the MB bolus injections. The lasting vasodilatory effects of isoflurane may have influenced vascular responses, potentially contributing to an underestimation of differences in vascular dynamics between anesthetized and awake state. Future applications of awake ULM in functional imaging using an indwelling jugular vein catheter presents a promising alternative to enable more accurate functional imaging in awake animals, addressing current limitations associated with anesthesia-induced vascular effects.</p>
<p>In our longitudinal study, consistent imaging results were obtained over a three-week period, demonstrating the feasibility of awake ULM imaging for this duration. However, for certain research applications, a monitoring period of several months would be valuable. Extending the duration of longitudinal awake ULM imaging to enable such long-term studies is a potential direction for future development.</p>
<p>Tissue motion is also a critical concern of ULM imaging. Benefiting from the robust head-fixing protocols and successful habituation, we did not observe significant motion artifacts in the ULM images. Nevertheless, we still employed the correlation method to register the ULM images<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> in order to remove subtle tissue movement and improve the ULM image quality. This method preserves the maximum fidelity for the MB tracks, but may not be adequate for non-rigid motion. While rigid motion correction is often effective in anesthetized animals, awake animal imaging presents greater challenges due to the more prominent non-rigid motion, particularly in deeper brain regions. This is evidenced in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> (Mouse 7), where cortical vessels remain relatively stable, but regions around the colliculi and mesencephalon exhibit more noticeable motion artifacts, indicating that displacement is more pronounced in deeper areas. To address these deeper, non-rigid motions, recent studies suggest estimating non-rigid transformations from unfiltered tissue signals before applying corrections to ULM vascular images<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Such advanced motion correction strategies may be more effective for awake ULM imaging, which experiences higher motion variability. The development of more robust and effective motion correction techniques will be crucial to reduce motion artifacts in future awake ULM applications. Meanwhile, with 2D imaging, we cannot correct for out-of-plane motion, which necessitates 3D imaging. In the future, 3D motion correction techniques that account for complex tissue motions and are computationally efficient need to be developed for awake and longitudinal ULM imaging.</p>
<p>Based on the maximum linking distance and gap closing parameters outlined in the Methods section, blood flow with velocities below 50 mm/s can be detected. However, the use of a directional filter to estimate flow direction may introduce aliasing. MBs moving at higher velocities may be subject to incorrect flow direction estimation due to aliasing effects. Given that the compounded frame rate is 1000 Hz, with an ultrasound center frequency of 20 MHz and a sound speed of 1540 m/s, the relationship between Doppler frequency and the axial blood flow velocity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> indicates that aliasing will not occur for axial flow velocities below 19.25 mm/s. In all flow velocity maps presented in this study, the range is limited to a maximum of 15 mm/s, remaining below the critical threshold for aliasing. Additionally, all vessels analyzed in the violin plots for arteriovenous flow comparisons fall within this range. While cortical arterioles and venules generally exhibit moderate flow speeds, aliasing remains a factor to consider when combining directional filtering with velocity analysis.</p>
<p>Advances in ULM imaging methods can benefit longitudinal awake imaging. For instance, dynamic ULM can differentiate between arteries and veins by leveraging pulsatility features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. 3D ULM, with volumetric imaging array<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, enables the reconstruction of whole-brain vascular network, providing a more comprehensive understanding of vessel branching patterns. Meanwhile, 3D ULM also helps to mitigate the challenge of aligning the identical coronal plane for longitudinal imaging, a process that requires precise manual alignment in 2D ULM to ensure consistency. Additionally, this alignment issue can also be alleviated in 2D imaging using backscattering amplitude method, which may assist in estimating out-of-plane positioning during longitudinal imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Longitudinal brain imaging in the awake state offers a promising tool for neuroscience research as it not only avoids the confounding effects of anesthesia on cerebral vasculature, but also enables observations of intrinsic dynamics of the vasculature within the same subject, minimizing potential sources of bias associated with inter-subject variability. In the future, this technique is expected to be further integrated with disease models to study the changes in cerebral vasculature during the development of diseases. Also, this technique can be further combined with the latest functional ULM (fULM) studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> to allow awake fULM imaging. Our study laid the foundation for these studies with awake fULM, which is expected to improve the sensitivity of conventional fULM techniques because hemodynamic responses are much stronger in the awake state than in anesthesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>

Specifically, a commercially available polycarbonate mouse transfer tube (TRANS-TUBE 130X50MM, Braintree Scientific, Inc.) was used for the initial three days. The mice were encouraged to enter the tube from their cage, after which the tube was lifted, allowing the mouse to remain inside for 30 seconds. The mouse was then returned to its cage for free movement for one minute, before a second identical tunnel handling was carried out. This procedure was done twice daily. Approximately three days into this routine, the mice were accustomed to the tunnel handling method. The animals were then picked up using the commercial tunnel, and then a 3D-printed body tube was attached to the other end of the tunnel. The mice were allowed to enter the body tube voluntarily. Subsequently, the body tube was utilized for handling the mice in the following 5 days as a replacement for the commercial tunnel.</p>

<title>Cranial window surgery</title>
<p>The entire procedure closely followed a previously published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. To minimize brain swelling, the animal received an intraperitoneal injection of Dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg body weight). The mouse was anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane (3% for induction and 1%-1.5% for maintenance). After confirming that the mouse was anesthetized, the head of the animal was fixed in the stereotaxic frame. Afterward, the scalp of the mouse was incised, and the temporalis muscle was dissected from the skull using forceps. Tissue adhesive (3M, cat. no. 70200742529) was applied to secure the retracted muscles and incision edges, ensuring proper closure of the skin. Subsequently, a headpost was fixed to the skull using tissue adhesive and dental cement (Sun Medical Co., Ltd, cat. no. Super-Bond C&amp;B). The skull was then carefully thinned using a high-speed rotary micromotor (Foredom, cat. no. K.1070) to create a cranial window with a width of approximately 8 mm laterally and which extending from bregma to lambda in the anterior-posterior direction. The skull was continuously thinned along this outline until it became loose, allowing for separation of the bone from the dura mater using forceps. After removing the skull, a polymethyl pentene plastic sheet (Goodfellow, cat. no. ME311051) was placed over the cranial window and fixed to the bone using tissue adhesive and dental cement. To provide protection, the window was covered with biocompatible silicone rubber (Smooth-on, cat. no. Body Double-Fast Set). Once the silicone rubber was secure, the anesthesia was discontinued, and the mouse was allowed to regain consciousness.</p>

<title>Post-surgical care and head-fix habituation</title>
<p>Following the surgery, subcutaneous administration of Carprofen (5-10 mg/kg body weight) was provided to the animals for immediate post-operative pain management. The animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia in their individual cages, with a heating pad provided to maintain optimal body temperature during the recovery period. Observations were made every 15 minutes until the animals reached sternal recumbency. To aid in their recovery, dry food soaked in water was provided, along with the use of recovery gel (ClearH2O, cat. no. 72-06-5022) to facilitate chewing and hydration. In the case that any signs of pain were observed, additional subcutaneous doses of 5-10 mg/kg Carprofen were administered every 12 to 24 hours to alleviate surgical discomfort for 3 days. Post-operative monitoring of the animals was performed daily for a duration of 14 days following the surgery. Once the animals had fully recovered from the surgical procedure, the animals were habituated daily to head fixation after walking through the body tube. The duration of the head-fixation periods was gradually increased over time, starting at approximately 10 minutes on day 1 and extending to up to 1 hour after 3 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. If any signs of discomfort, such as excessive movement or vocalization, were observed during the head-fixation sessions then the sessions would be immediately discontinued.</p>

<title>The use of 3D-printed body tube</title>
<p>The body tube was secured to the table using four screws on the outer side, while two small screws on the top were used to clamp the headpost. Two semicircular grooves that fit the size of the small screws were made on the headpost (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). During the process of head-fixing the animal, the experimenter guided the animal to enter the body tube from the rear. Once the animal protruded its head from the front end, the experimenter manually grasped the headpost, gently restrained the head of the animal, and subsequently aligned the semicircular grooves with the screws to immobilize the animal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f">
<title>Experimental procedure of imaging sessions</title>
<p>On the day of imaging, the animal was guided to walk into the body tube, and the headpost was firmly secured to the tube. The protective silicone rubber and headpost were cleaned using 70% ethanol, followed by rinsing with sterile saline. Then, forceps were inserted between the silicone rubber and the cement to detach the silicone rubber from the headpost. Due to the challenges of conducting continuous infusion in awake animals, contrast microbubbles were administered via tail vein bolus injection in this study. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (3% for induction and 1% for maintenance) before tail vein catheterization to alleviate pain and stress. Ultrasound coupling gel was applied, and the transducer was positioned to find the imaging plane. When the imaging plane was identified, the relative position of the probe and the headpost was recorded, serving as a reference point for subsequent longitudinal studies. B-mode and power Doppler images were also saved as references to facilitate the identification of the same imaging plane in the following weeks.</p>
<p>Once the imaging plane was confirmed, the isoflurane anesthesia was terminated, and 0.1 ml of DEFINITYÂ® (Lantheus, North Billerica, MA) microbubble was administered via the tail vein catheter. The completion of the injection was considered as the starting point, denoted as T = 0. From T = 0 onwards, continuous ultrasound data was saved. After completion of the imaging session, the cranial window was filled with the same biocompatible silicone rubber described above, allowing approximately 10 minutes for solidification. The headpost was then removed from the body tube, and the animal was returned to its home cage. Imaging sessions were conducted once per week over a three-week period.</p>
<p>For the experiment of comparing differences between anesthesia and awake state (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), once the mice were fixed to the body tube, they were continuously anesthetized with 2% isoflurane for more than 15 minutes. During this process, the tail vein catheterization was completed, and the imaging plane was confirmed. Following the bolus injection of 0.1 ml MB, ULM data under anesthesia was acquired for 1000 seconds. The tail vein catheter was remained in place. After the ULM acquisition under anesthesia, it was essential to wait until no bubbles were circulating within the blood stream before terminating anesthesia. Once the animal approached full arousal, another bolus injection of 0.1 ml MB was administered. The catheter was then removed, and ULM acquisition started (marked as T = 0). Other procedures were the same as those described in the previous two paragraphs. For the ULM data collected under anesthesia, since there was no specific time point at which mice achieved full pupillary dilatation, we consistently employed the RF dataset starting from T = 500s until the cumulative MB count reached 5 million for ULM reconstruction to make the MB concentration similar as in the awake cases.</p>

<title>Pupillary recording and measurement</title>
<p>Monitoring the pupillary area of rodents is commonly used to determine their level of arousal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. The pupils constrict under isoflurane anesthesia and enlarge upon awakening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. In this study, video recording of pupillary area performed using a camera (ace acA800-510um, Basler Inc., Exton, PA) placed in front of the mouse, with timestamps synchronized to the ultrasound acquisition. The ULM imaging session was carried out in a dark room. An infrared (IR) flashlight (EVOLVA Future Technology T20) was positioned above the camera. Since mice are functionally blind to IR wavelengths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, the use of IR illumination can minimize the effect of light exposure on pupil changes so that the pupillary area is mostly influenced by anesthesia. The videos recorded by the camera were analyzed using ImageJ software, and the contour of the pupil was manually circled. The equivalent area of a single pixel was calibrated, which allowed for the quantification of the pupillary area according to the number of pixels occupied by the pupil.</p>

<title>Ultrasound imaging sequence</title>
<p>A Vantage 256 system (Verasonics Inc., Kirkland, WA) was used for this experiment. The ultrasound system was connected to a linear-array transducer (L35-16vX, Verasonics Inc.), which was fixed onto a 3D-printed holder attached to a translation motor (VT-80, Physik Instrumente, Auburn, MA). The motor allowed precise control of transducer movement in the elevational direction, enabling adjustment of the imaged coronal plane. Ultrasound was transmitted at a center frequency of 20 MHz. A 9-angle compounded plane wave technique was used (angles: -8Â°, -6Â°, -4Â°, -2Â°, 0Â°, 2Â°, 4Â°, 6Â°, and 8Â°), with a post-compounded frame rate of 1000 Hz. Interleaved sampling is employed to capture high-frequency echoes more effectively. With the systemâs sampling rate limited to 62.5 MHz, the upper limit of the center frequency of the transducer passband is 15.625 MHz. To mitigate aliasing, two transmissions are sent per angle, staggered in time. This approach effectively doubles the sampling rate, ensuring more accurate image reconstruction. The ensemble size of each dataset was 800 frames, and the acquired radiofrequency (RF) data was saved for ofline reconstruction. Beamforming was conducted using the Verasonics built-in program to reconstruct the in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data. The IQ data had a pixel size of half the wavelength in the axial direction and one wavelength in the lateral direction.</p>

<title>ULM image processing</title>
<p>To ensure consistent localization of bubbles at different depths, a noise equalization method was employed to adjust signal intensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. High pass filtering with a cutoff frequency of 30Hz was applied to the IQ data to enhance sensitivity for MB extraction. MBs moving toward and away from the transducer were separated into two distinct datasets (upward flow and downward flow) based on the positive and negative Doppler shifts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Subsequently, singular value decomposition (SVD) filtering was applied to the IQ data to further eliminate clutter signals from tissue and extract MB signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. The singular value cutoff was adaptively determined to achieve objective and stable filtering results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. The filtered MB data was then spline interpolated to a resolution with a lateral and axial pixel size of one-tenth of the wavelength (4.928 Âµm). Each interpolated frame was subjected to 2D normalized cross-correlation with the point spread function of the imaging system, which was empirically determined. Regional maxima in the cross-correlation results indicated the center position of MBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Thresholding of image intensity was applied to reject low-intensity values and prevent noise from being erroneously identified as bubbles. The coordinates of the microbubble center points obtained from each frame were tracked using the uTrack algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. To ensure the detection of reliable MB tracks, only tracks with a minimum length of 10 consecutive frames were considered valid. The choice of 10 consecutive frames (10 ms) was based on established practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> but can be adjusted as needed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. For the uTrack algorithm, two additional key parameters were specified: the maximum linking distance and the gap-filling distance, both set to 10 pixels (â¼50 microns). This configuration means that only bubble centroids within 10 pixels of each other across consecutive frames are considered part of the same bubble trajectory. Additionally, when the start and end points of two tracks fall within this threshold, the gap-filling parameter merges them into a single, continuous track. It is important to select these parameters carefully, as overly large values could lead to an overestimation of flow velocity. By setting the maximum linking distance to 10 pixels, we effectively limited the measurable velocity to 50 mm/s, under the assumption that no bubble would exceed a 50-micron displacement within the 1 ms interval between frames. Considering the velocity distribution across the mouse brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, this 50 mm/s limit ensures that most of the blood flow is captured accurately. After determining bubble tracks with the specified parameters for uTrack algorithm, accumulating the MB tracks resulted in the flow intensity map. The final values were square-root transformed to compress the dynamic range of the image for display. Furthermore, the distance traveled by MB between adjacent frames was calculated during the tracking process to determine blood flow velocity, which was then assigned to each individual bubble track. The average velocity computed from multiple tracks was used to generate a comprehensive flow speed map.</p>

<title>Quantitative analysis of ULM images</title>
<p>For single-vessel analysis, the vessel density map (either bidirectional or unidirectional) was binarized, and the center line of the vessel was extracted using MATLAB âbwskelâ function. The radius of each vessel was defined as the distance from the central line to the nearest vessel edge on the binarized map, with diameter calculated by doubling this radius. Given a pixel size of approximately 4.928 Âµm, the minimum detectable vessel diameter using this approach is 9.856 Âµm, explaining why the smallest measured radius in unsaturated conditions, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, always falls into this value. To analyze a specific vessel, we manually selected a vessel segment. Each point on the central line provided a diameter measurement. For flow velocity, each non-zero pixel within the chosen segment was used to estimate effective blood flow velocity in the vessel.</p>
<p>For ROI-based analysis, ROIs were manually defined based on a brain atlas to ensure consistency across both anesthetized and awake states, as well as across weekly imaging sessions, enhancing comparability of results. In ROI-based analysis, we focused on two primary parameters: vascularity and mean velocity. Vascularity was defined as the proportion of the pixel count occupied by blood vessels within each ROI, obtained by binarizing the ULM vessel density maps and calculating the percentage of the pixels with MB signal. Mean velocity was calculated by averaging all non-zero pixel of velocity estimates within the ROI. The velocity distribution within each ROI was also visualized using violin plots, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, to illustrate the range and density of flow velocity estimates across different acquisition.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wang and Colleagues present a study aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of repeated ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) recording sessions on mice chronically implanted with a cranial window transparent to US. They provided quantitative information on their protocol, such as the required number of Contrast enhancing microbubbles (MBs) to get a clear image of the vasculature of a brain coronal section. Also, they quantified the co-registration quality over time-distant sessions and the vasodilator effect of isoflurane.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Strengths: the study showed a remarkable performance in recording precisely the same brain coronal section over repeated imaging sessions. In addition, it sheds light on the vasodilator effect of isoflurane (an anesthetic whose effects are not fully understood) on the different brain vasculature compartments, although, as the Authors stated, some insights in this aspect have already been published with other imaging techniques. The experimental setting and protocol are very well described.</p>
<p>Wang and co-authors submitted a revised version of their study, which shows improvements in the clarity of the data description.</p>
<p>
However, the flaws and limitations of this study are substantially unchanged.</p>
<p>The main issues are:</p>
<p>
- Statistics are still inadequate. The TOST test proposed in this revised version is not equivalent to an ANOVA. Indeed, multivariate analyses should be the most appropriate, given that some quantifications were probably made on multiple vessels from different mice. The 3 reviewers mentioned the flaws in statistics as the primary concern.</p>
<p>
- No new data has been added, such as testing other anesthetics.</p>
<p>
- The Authors still insist on using the term Vascularity which they define as: 'proportion of the pixel count occupied by blood vessels within each ROI, obtained by binarizing the ULM vessel density maps and calculating the percentage of the pixels with MB signal.'. Why not use apparent cerebral blood volume or just CBV? Introducing an unnecessary and redundant term is not scientifically acceptable. In this revised version, vascularity is also used to indicate a higher vascular density (Line 275), which does not make sense: blood vessels do not generate from the isoflurane to the awake condition in a few minutes. Rev2 also raised this point.</p>
<p>
- The long-term recordings mentioned by the Authors refer to the 3-week time frame analyzed in this study. However, within each acquisition, the time available from imaging is only a few minutes (&lt; 10', referring to most of the plots showing time courses) after the animals' arousal from isoflurane and before bubbles disappear. This limitation should be acknowledged.</p>
<p>
- The more precise description of the number of mice and blood vessels analyzed in Figure 6 makes it apparent the limited number of independent samples used to support the findings of this work. A limitation that should be acknowledged. The newly provided information added as Supplementary Figure 1 should be moved to the main text, eventually in the figure legends. The limited data in support of the findings was also highlighted by Rev2 and, indirectly, by Rev3.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors present a very interesting collection of methods and results using brain ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) in awake mice. They emphasize the effect of the level of anesthesia on the quantifiable elements assessable with this technique (i.e. vessel diameter, flow speed, in veins and arteries, area perfused, in capillaries) and demonstrate the possibility of achieving longitudinal cerebrovascular assessment in one animal during several weeks with their protocol.</p>
<p>
The authors made a good rewriting of the article based on the reviewers' comments. One of the message of the first version of the manuscript was that variability in measurements (vessel diameter, flow velocity, vascularity) were much more pronounced under changes of anesthesia than when considering longitudinal imaging across several weeks. This message is now not quite mitigated, as longitudinal imaging seems to show a certain variability close to the order of magnitude observed under anesthesia. In that sense, the review process was useful in avoiding hasty conclusion and calls for further caution in ULM awake longitudinal imaging, in particular regarding precision of positioning and cancellation of tissue motion.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Even if the methods elements considered separately are not new (brain ULM in rodents, setup for longitudinal awake imaging similar to those used in fUS imaging, quantification of vessel diameters/bubble flow/vessel area), when masterfully combined as it is done in this paper, they answer two questions that have been long-running in the community: what is the impact of anesthesia on the parameters measured by ULM (and indirectly in fUS and other techniques)? Is it possible to achieve ULM in awake rodents for longitudinal imaging? The manuscript is well constructed, well written, and graphics are appealing.</p>
<p>
The manuscript has been much strengthened by the round of review, with more animals for the longitudinal imaging study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some weaknesses remain, not hindering the quality of the work, that the authors might want to answer or explain.</p>
<p>
- When considering fig 4e and fig 4j together: it seems that in fig 4e the vascularity reduction in the cortical ROI is around 30% for downward flow, and around 55% for upward flow; but when grouping both cortical flows in fig 4j, the reduction is much smaller (~5%), even at the individual level (only mouse 1 is used in fig 4e). Can you comment on that?</p>
<p>
- When considering fig4e, fig 4j, fig6e and fig6i altogether, it seems that vascularity can be highly variable, whether it be under anesthesia or vascular imaging, with changes between 5 to 40%. Is this vascularity quantification worth it (namely, reliable for example to quantify changes in a pathological model requiring longitudinal imaging)?</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>â¢ While the title is fair with respect to the data shown, in the summary and the rest of the paper, the comparison between anesthetized and awake conditions is systematically stated, while more caution should be used.</p>
<p>First, isoflurane is one of the (many) anesthetics commonly used in pre-clinical research, and its effect on the brain vasculature cannot be generalized to all the anesthetics. Indeed, other anesthesia approaches do not produce evident vasodilation; see ketamine + medetomidine mixtures. Second, the imaged awake state is head-fixed and body-constrained in mice. A condition that can generate substantial stress in the animals. In this study, there is no evaluation of the stress level of the mice. In addition, the awake imaging sessions were performed a few minutes after the mouse woke up from isoflurane induction, which is necessary to inject the MB bolus. It is known that the vasodilator effects of isoflurane last a long time after its withdrawal. This aspect would have influenced the results, eventually underestimating the difference with respect to the awake state.</p>
<p>These limitations should be clearly described in the Discussion.</p>
<p>Looking at Figure 2e, it takes more than 5' to reach the 5 Millions MB count useful for good imaging. However, the MB count per pixel drops to a few % at that time. This information tells me that (i) repeated measurements are feasible but with limited brain coverage since a single 'wake up' is needed to acquire a single brain section and (ii) this approach cannot fit the requirements of functional ULM that requires to merge the responses to multiple stimuli to get a complete functional image. Of course, a chronic i.v. catheter would fix the issue, but this configuration is not trivial to test in the experimental setup proposed by the authors, hindering the extension of the approach to fULM.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for highlighting these limitations, as they address aspects that were not fully considered during the experimental design and manuscript writing. In response, we have added the following paragraphs to the discussion section, addressing these limitations of our study:</p>
<p>(Line 310) âAlthough isoflurane is widely used in ultrasound imaging because it provides long-lasting and stable anesthetic effects, it is important to note that the vasodilation observed with isoflurane is not representative of all anesthetics. Some anesthesia protocols, such as ketamine combined with medetomidine, do not produce significant vasodilation and are therefore preferred in experiments where vascular stability is essential, such as functional ultrasound imaging(47). Therefore, in future studies, it would be valuable to design more rigorous control experiments with larger sample sizes to systematically compare the effects of isoflurane anesthesia, awake states, and other anesthetics that do not induce vasodilation on cerebral blood flow.</p>
<p>Our proposed method enabled repeatable longitudinal brain imaging over a three-week period, addressing a key limitation of conventional ULM imaging and offering potential for various preclinical applications. However, there are still some limitations in this study.</p>
<p>One of the limitations is the lack of objective measures to assess the effectiveness of head-fix habituation in reducing anxiety. This may introduce variability in stress levels among mice. Recent studies suggest that tracking physiological parameters such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and corticosterone levels during habituation can confirm that mice reach a low stress state prior to imaging(48). This approach would be highly beneficial for future awake imaging studies. Furthermore, alternative head-fixation setups, such as air-floated balls or treadmills, which allow the free movement of limbs, have been shown to reduce anxiety and facilitate natural behaviors during imaging(30). Adopting these approaches in future studies could enhance the reliability of awake imaging data by minimizing stress-related confounds.</p>
<p>Another limitation of this study is the potential residual vasodilatory effect of isoflurane anesthesia on awake imaging sessions. The awake imaging sessions were conducted shortly after the mice had emerged from isoflurane anesthesia, required for the MB bolus injections. The lasting vasodilatory effects of isoflurane may have influenced vascular responses, potentially contributing to an underestimation of differences in vascular dynamics between anesthetized and awake state. Future applications of awake ULM in functional imaging using an indwelling jugular vein catheter presents a promising alternative to enable more accurate functional imaging in awake animals, addressing current limitations associated with anesthesia-induced vascular effects.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>â¢ Statistics are often poor or not properly described.</p>
<p>The legend and the text referring to Figure 2 do not report any indication of the number of animals analyzed. I assume it is only one, which makes the findings strongly dependent on the imaging quality of THAT mouse in THAT experiment. Three mice have been displayed in Figure 3, as reported in the text, but it is not clear whether it is a mouse for each shown brain section. Figure 5 reports quantitative data on blood vessels in awake VS isoflurane states but: no indication about the number of tested mice is provided, nor the number of measured blood vessels per type and if statistics have been done on mice or with a multivariate method.</p>
<p>Also, a T-test is inappropriate when the goal is to compare different brain regions and blood vessel types.</p>
<p>Similar issues partially apply to Figure 6, too.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that the statistical analyses were not clearly explained in the original version. In the revised manuscript, we have ensured that the statistical methods are clearly described.</p>
<p>(Fig.4 caption) âb,c, Comparisons of vessel diameter (b) and flow velocity (c) for the selected arterial and venous segments. Statistical analysis was conducted using t-test at each measurement point along the segments.â</p>
<p>(Fig.6 caption) âb,c, Comparisons of vessel diameter (b) and flow velocity (c) for the selected arterial and venous segments. Statistical analysis was conducted using the two one-sided test (TOST) procedure, which evaluates the null hypothesis that the difference between the two weeks is larger than three times the standard deviation of one week.â</p>
<p>Additionally, we corrected an error in the previous comparison of the violin plots on flow velocities, where a t-test was incorrectly applied; this has now been removed.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that the original version did not clearly indicate the numbers of animals in the statistical analysis. In the revised manuscript, we have added Supplementary Figure 1 to specify the mice used, and we have labeled each mouse accordingly in the figures or captions. In the revised Figures 4 and 6, we have ensured that each quantitative analysis figure or its caption clearly indicate the specific mice.</p>
<p>For original Figures 1 and 2, these are presented as case studies to illustrate the methodology. Since the anesthesia time required for tail vein injection for each animal varies slightly, it is challenging to have the consistent time taken for each mouse to recover from anesthesia across all mice. For instance, in Figure 1, the mouse took nearly 500 seconds to recover from anesthesia, but this duration is not consistent across all animals, which is a limitation of the bolus injection technique. We have noted this point in the discussion (discussion on the limitation of bolus injection), and we have also clarified in the results section and figure captions that these figures represent a case study of a single mouse rather than a standardized recovery time for all animals.</p>
<p>We further clarified this point in the end of the Figure 2 caption:</p>
<p>(Fig.2 caption) âThis figure presents a case study based on the same mouse shown in Fig 1. The x-axis for d-f begins at 500 seconds because, at this point, the mouseâs pupil size stabilized, indicating it had recovered to an awake state. Consequently, ULM images were accumulated starting from this time. It is important to note that not every mouse requires 500 seconds to fully awaken; the time to reach a stable awake state varies across individual mice.â We added the following statement before introducing Figure 1e:</p>
<p>(Line 93) âDue to differences in tail vein injection timing and anesthesia depth, the time required for each mouse to fully awaken varied. Although it was not feasible to get pupil size stabilized just after 500 seconds for each animal, ULM reconstruction only used the data that acquired after the animal reached full pupillary dilation, to ensure that ULM accurately captures the cerebrovascular characteristics in the awake state.â</p>
<p>We added the following statement before introducing Figure 2d:</p>
<p>(Line 139) âTo further verify that the proposed MB bolus injection method can help to achieve ULM image saturation shortly after mice awaken from anesthesia, an analysis on the change in MB concentration over time was conducted once pupil size had stabilized (T = 500s).â</p>
<p>For Figures 3, 4, and 5 (in the revised version, Figures 4 and 5 have been combined into a single Figure 4), the data represents results from three individual mice, with each coronal plane corresponding to a different mouse. In the revised version, we have added labels to indicate the specific mouse in each image to improve clarity. We also recognize that some analyses in the original submission (original Figure 5) may have lacked sufficient statistical power due to the small sample size. Therefore, in the revised version, we have focused only on findings that were consistently observed across the three mice to ensure robust conclusions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Recommendations For the Authors):</bold></p>
<p>â¢ If the study's main goal is to compare awake vs anesthetized ULM, the authors should test at least another anesthetic with no evident vasodilator effect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this valuable suggestion. We would like to clarify that the primary aim of our study is not to comprehensively compare the effects of anesthesia versus the awake state, as a rigorous comparison would indeed require a more controlled experimental design, including additional anesthetics, a larger cohort of mice, and broader controls to ensure sufficient statistical power. We also add the following statement in the Discussion to clarify this point:</p>
<p>(Line 314) âTherefore, in future studies, it would be valuable to design more rigorous control experiments with larger sample sizes to systematically compare the effects of isoflurane anesthesia, awake states, and other anesthetics that do not induce vasodilation on cerebral blood flow.â</p>
<p>We acknowledge that the initial organization of Figures 3â5 placed excessive emphasis on comparisons between the awake and anesthetized states, but without yielding consistently significant findings. Meanwhile, our longitudinal observations in original Figure 6 were underrepresented, despite their potential importance.</p>
<p>In the revised version, we shifted our focus toward the main goal of awake longitudinal imaging. By consolidating the previous Figures 4 and 5 into the new Figure 4, we emphasize conclusions that are both more consistent and broadly applicable, avoiding areas that may lack sufficient rigor or consensus. Additionally, we expanded the quantitative analysis related to longitudinal imaging, highlighting its role as the ultimate objective of this study. The awake vs. anesthetized ULM comparison was intended to demonstrate the value of awake imaging and introduce the importance of awake longitudinal imaging. In the revised text, we have reframed this comparison to emphasize the specific response to isoflurane rather than a general response to anesthesia. For example, in Figures 3 and 4, we have replaced the original term &quot;Anesthetized&quot; with &quot;Isoflurane&quot;. We have also added a discussion noting that isoflurane may induces more vasodilation than other anesthetic agents.</p>
<p>(Line 310) âAlthough isoflurane is widely used in ultrasound imaging because it provides long-lasting and stable anesthetic effects, it is important to note that the vasodilation observed with isoflurane is not representative of all anesthetics. Some anesthesia protocols, such as ketamine combined with medetomidine, do not produce significant vasodilation and are therefore preferred in experiments where vascular stability is essential, such as functional ultrasound imaging(47).â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>â¢ The claims made about the proposed experimental protocol to be suitable for the &quot;long-term&quot; (line 255) are not supported by the data and should be modified according to the presented evidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. We agree that our current three-week experimental results do not yet fulfill the requirements for extended longitudinal imaging that may span several months. We have revised the relevant text accordingly. For instance, the phrase âOur proposed method enabled long-term, repeatable longitudinal brain imagingâ has been modified to âOur proposed method enabled repeatable longitudinal brain imaging over a threeweek period.â (Similar changes also in Line 67, Line 318, and Line 337) Additionally, we have added the following paragraph in the discussion section to indicate that extending the monitoring period to several months is a meaningful direction for future exploration:</p>
<p>(Line 337) âIn our longitudinal study, consistent imaging results were obtained over a three-week period, demonstrating the feasibility of awake ULM imaging for this duration. However, for certain research applications, a monitoring period of several months would be valuable. Extending the duration of longitudinal awake ULM imaging to enable such long-term studies is a potential direction for future development.â</p>

<p>Thank you for your comment. We apologize for any confusion caused by the phrase âvascularity reduction from anesthesiaâ in the abstract.

<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We acknowledge the limitations of our setup regarding reducing animal anxiety.

<p>(Line 321) âOne of the limitations is the lack of objective measures to assess the effectiveness of head-fix habituation in reducing anxiety. This may introduce variability in stress levels among mice. Recent studies suggest that tracking physiological parameters such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and corticosterone levels during habituation can confirm that mice reach a low stress state prior to imaging(48). This approach would be highly beneficial for future awake imaging studies. Furthermore, alternative head-fixation setups, such as air-floated balls or treadmills, which allow the free movement of limbs, have been shown to reduce anxiety and facilitate natural behaviors during imaging(30). Adopting these approaches in future studies could enhance the reliability of awake imaging data by minimizing stress-related confounds.â</p>

<p>â¢ Figure: is there a reason why the plots start at 500 sec? What happened before that time?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your question regarding the starting time in the plots. Figures 1 and 2 are case studies using a single mouse to demonstrate the feasibility of our method. The âzeroâ timepoint was defined as the moment when anesthesia was stopped, and the microbubble injection began. However, the mouse does not fully recover immediately after anesthesia is stopped. As shown in Figure 1e, there is a period of approximately 500 seconds during which the pupil gradually dilates, indicating recovery. Only after this period does the mouse reach a relatively stable physiological state suitable for ULM imaging, which is why the plots in Figure 2 begin at T = 500 seconds.</p>
<p>We recognize that this was not sufficiently explained in the main text and figure captions. In the revised manuscript, we have clarified this timing rationale in both the results section and the figure captions. We added the following sentence to the result section to introduce Fig.2d:</p>
<p>(Line 139) âTo further verify that the proposed MB bolus injection method can help to achieve ULM image saturation shortly after mice awaken from anesthesia, an analysis on the change in MB concentration over time was conducted once pupil size had stabilized (T = 500s).â</p>
<p>We also added the following statement to note that this recover time varies across individual mice:</p>
<p>(Line 154, Fig.2 caption) âThis figure presents a case study based on the same mouse shown in Fig 1. The x-axis for d-f begins at 500 seconds because, at this point, the mouseâs pupil size stabilized, indicating it had recovered to an awake state. Consequently, ULM images were accumulated starting from this time. It is important to note that not every mouse requires 500 seconds to fully awaken; the time to reach a stable awake state varies across individual mice.â</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>â¢ The only major comment (calling for further work) I would like to make is the relative weakness of the manuscript regarding longitudinal imaging (mostly Figure 6), compared to the exhaustive review of the effect of isoflurane on the vasculature (3 rats, 3 imaging planes, quantification on a large number of vessels, in 9 different brain regions). The 6 cortical vessels evaluated in Figure 6 feel really disappointing. As longitudinal imaging is supposed to be the salient element of this manuscript (first word appearing in the title), it should be as good and trustworthy as the first part of the paper. Figure 6c. is of major importance, and should be supported by a more extensive vessel analysis, including various brain areas, and validated on several animals to validate the robustness of longitudinal positioning with several instances of the surgical procedure. Figure 6d estimates the reliability of flow measurements on 3 vessels only. Therefore I recommend showing something similar to what is done in Figures 4 and 5: 3 animals, and more extensive quantification in different brain regions.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. We acknowledge that the first version of the manuscript lacked in-depth quantitative analysis in the section on the longitudinal study, which should have been a focal point. It also did not provide a sufficient number of animals to demonstrate the reproducibility of the technique. In this revised version, we have included results from more animals and conducted a more comprehensive quantitative analysis, with the corresponding text updated accordingly. Specifically, we combined the previous Figures 4 and 5 into the current Figure 4 (corresponding revised text from Line 169 to Line 207). The revised Figures 5 and 6</p>
<p>compare the results of the longitudinal study, presenting data from three mice (corresponding revised text from</p>

Detailed information about the mice used has been added to Supplementary Figure 1, and Supplementary Figure 4 further provides a detailed display of the results for the three mice in longitudinal study. We hope that these adjustments will provide a more thorough validation of the longitudinal imaging.</p>

<p>â¢ There is very little motion in the images presented, except for the awake &quot;Bregma -4.2 mm&quot; (Figure 3, directional maps), especially in the area including colliculi and mesencephalon, while the cortical vessels do not move. Can you comment on that?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for highlighting this important aspect of motion in awake animal imaging. Motion correction is indeed a critical factor in such studies. In the original version of our discussion, we briefly addressed this issue (from Line 342 to Line 346), but we agree that a more detailed discussion is needed.</p>
<p>To minimize motion artifacts, we conducted habituation to acclimate the animals to the head-fixation setup, which helps reduce anxiety during imaging. With thorough head-fixed habituation, the imaging quality is generally well-preserved. We also applied correlation-based motion correction techniques based on ULM images, which can partially correct for overall brain motion, as stated in the previous version. However, this ULM-images-based correction is limited to addressing only rigid motion.</p>
<p>In the revised discussion, we have expanded on the limitations of our current motion correction approach and referenced recent work about more advanced motion correction methods:</p>
<p>(Line 346) âWhile rigid motion correction is often effective in anesthetized animals, awake animal imaging presents greater challenges due to the more prominent non-rigid motion, particularly in deeper brain regions. This is evidenced in Supplementary Fig. 1 (Mouse 7), where cortical vessels remain relatively stable, but regions around the colliculi and mesencephalon exhibit more noticeable motion artifacts, indicating that displacement is more pronounced in deeper areas. To address these deeper, non-rigid motions, recent studies suggest estimating nonrigid transformations from unfiltered tissue signals before applying corrections to ULM vascular images(16,50). Such advanced motion correction strategies may be more effective for awake ULM imaging, which experiences higher motion variability. The development of more robust and effective motion correction techniques will be crucial to reduce motion artifacts in future awake ULM applications.â</p>

<p>Thank you for your detailed suggestions. We agree that the original Fig. 2b appeared messy and confusing. Based on this feedback and other comments, we decided to replace the FWHM-based vessel diameter measurement with a more stable binarization-based approach. In the revised version, we selected a specific segment of each vessel and measured the diameter by calculating the distance from the vesselâs centerline to both side after binarization. Each point on the centerline of this segment provides a diameter measurement, which can be further used to calculate the mean and standard error. This updated method is more stable and reproducible, providing reliable measurements even for vessels that are not fully saturated. It also facilitates comparison across more vessels, helping to further demonstrate the generalizability of our saturation standard. We believe these adjustments make the revised Fig. 2b clearer and more readable.</p>

<p>Thank you for your insightful comments on our vessel classification method. We recognize the limitations of the previous approach and, in order to enhance the rigor of the study, we have opted not to continue using this method in the revised manuscript. We have removed all content related to vessel classification based on branchin and branch-out criteria.

<p>In the revised analysis, for the comparison between arteries and veins, we focus solely on penetrating vessels in the cortex. For these vessels, it is generally accepted that downward-flowing vessels are arterioles, while upwardflowing vessels are venules. Accordingly, in the revised Figures 4 and 6, we analyze arterioles and venules exclusively in the cortex, without relying on the previous classification method that could be considered controversial.</p>

These established methods could be helpful for longitudinal imaging. Below is the revised text in the discussion section:</p>
<p>(Line 370) âAdvances in ULM imaging methods can benefit longitudinal awake imaging. For instance, dynamic ULM can differentiate between arteries and veins by leveraging pulsatility features(51). 3D ULM, with volumetric imaging array(52,53), enables the reconstruction of whole-brain vascular network, providing a more comprehensive understanding of vessel branching patterns. Meanwhile, 3D ULM also helps to mitigate the challenge of aligning the identical coronal plane for longitudinal imaging, a process that requires precise manual alignment in 2D ULM to ensure consistency. Additionally, this alignment issue can also be alleviated in 2D imaging using backscattering amplitude method, which may assist in estimating out-of-plane positioning during longitudinal imaging(54).â</p>

<p>â¢ The section &quot;Microbubble count serves as a quantitative metric for awake ULM image reconstruction&quot; had several issues that I think should be addressed. Mainly, the authors make the case that after detecting 5 million microbubbles, there is no clear gain in detecting more. The argument is not very convincing as we know many vessels will not have had a microbubble circulate in them within that timeframe, which will be especially true in smaller vessels. While the analysis in Figure 2 shows nicely that the diameter estimate for vessels in the 20-30 um range is stable at 5 million microbubbles, it is not necessarily the case for smaller vessels. A better approach here might be to select, e.g., a total of 5 million detected microbubbles for practical reasons and then to determine which vessel parameters estimation (e.g., diameter, flow velocity) remain stable. In addition:</p>
<p>a. Terms such as 'complete ULM reconstruction', 'no obvious change', 'ULM image saturation' are not well defined within the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out these issues and for offering a more rigorous approach. We completely agree with your suggestion. While our analysis demonstrated stable diameter estimates for vessels with diameter around 20 Âµm at 5 million microbubbles, this does not necessarily ensure stability for smaller vessels. Therefore, the choice of 5 million microbubbles was primarily for practical reasons. In the revised version, we have provided a more objective description and clarification of this limitation. We also recognize that terms such as âcomplete ULM reconstruction,â âno obvious change,â and âULM image saturationâ were not well defined and may have caused confusion, reducing the rigor of this manuscript. Based on your feedback, we have clearly defined âULM image saturationâ within the context of our study, removed absolute and ambiguous terms like âcomplete ULM reconstructionâ and âno obvious changeâ. We revised the entire section accordingly:</p>
<p>(Line 109) âTo facilitate equitable comparison of brain perfusion at different states, a practical saturation point enabling stable quantification of most vessels needs to be established. Our observations indicated that when the cumulative MB count reached 5 million, ULM images achieved a relatively stable state. Accordingly, in this study, the saturation point was defined as a cumulative MB count of 5 million. There are also possible alternatives for ULM image normalization. For example, different ULM images can be normalized to have the same saturation rate. However, the proposed method of using the same number of cumulative MB count for normalization enables the analysis of blood flow distribution across different brain regions from a probabilistic perspective. The following analysis substantiates this criterion.</p>
<p>Fig. 2a compares ULM directional vessel density maps and flow speed maps generated with 1, 3, 5, and 6 million MBs, using the same animal as shown in Fig. 1. To quantitatively confirm saturation, multiple vessel segments were selected for further analysis. Fig. 2b presents the measured vessel diameter for a specific segment at various MB counts. After binarizing the ULM map, the vessel diameter was measured by calculating the distance from the vessel centerline to the edge. Each point along the centerline of the segment provided a diameter measurement, enabling calculation of the mean and standard error. At low MB counts, vessels appeared incompletely filled, leading to inaccurate estimation of vessel diameter due to incomplete profiles. For example, at 1â2 million MBs, the binarized ULM map displayed a width of only one or two pixels along the segment. As a result, the measurements always yielded the same diameter values (two pixels, ~10um) with a consistently low standard error of the mean across the entire segment. With increased MB counts, the measured vessel diameter gradually rose, ultimately reaching saturation. The plots in Fig. 2b show that vessel diameter stabilized at 5 million MB count. Additionally, Fig. 2c illustrates the changes in flow velocity measured at different cumulative MB counts. The violin plots display the distribution of flow speed estimates for all valid centerline pixels within the selected segment. At low MB counts (1â3 million), flow velocity estimates fluctuated, but they stabilized as the MB count increased (4â6 million MBs). At 5 million MBs, flow velocity estimates were nearly identical to those at 6 million MBs, corroborating previous findings that vessel velocity measurements stabilize as MB count grows(39). To assess the generalizability of the 5 million MB saturation condition, vessel segments from three different mice across various brain regions were examined. The results, shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, confirm that this saturation criterion applies broadly. Although the 5 million MB threshold may not ensure absolute saturation for all vessels, it is generally effective for vessels larger than 15 Î¼m. This MB count threshold was therefore adopted as a practical criterion.â</p>

This configuration means that only bubble centroids within 10 pixels of each other across consecutive frames are considered part of the same bubble trajectory. Additionally, when the start and end points of two tracks fall within this threshold, the gap-filling parameter merges them into a single, continuous track. It is important to select these parameters carefully, as overly large values could lead to an overestimation of flow velocity. By setting the maximum linking distance to 10 pixels, we effectively limited the measurable velocity to 50 mm/s, under the assumption that no bubble would exceed a 50-micron displacement within the 1 ms interval between frames. After determining bubble tracks with the specified parameters for uTrack algorithm, accumulating the MB tracks resulted in the flow intensity map. Considering the velocity distribution across the mouse brain, this 50 mm/s limit ensures that the vast majority of blood flow is captured accurately.â</p>

<p>c. 'The plots (Figure 2b) clearly indicate that the vessel diameter stabilized beyond 5 million MB count.' This is true for one vessel. To generalize that claim, the analysis should be performed quantitatively on a larger sample of vessels in various areas of the brain, across multiple animals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this limitation. We agree that conclusions drawn from a single vessel cannot be generalized across all regions. Following your suggestion, we have added <italic>Supplementary Figure 2</italic>, where we analyzed multiple vessels from different brain regions across three mice. This expanded analysis further confirms that a 5 million MB count is sufficient to stabilize vessel diameter measurements across various samples.</p>
<p>(Line 133) âTo assess the generalizability of the 5 million MB saturation condition, vessel segments from three different mice across various brain regions were examined. The results, shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, confirm that this saturation criterion applies broadly. Although the 5 million MB threshold may not ensure absolute saturation for all vessels, it is generally effective for vessels larger than 15 Î¼m. This MB count threshold was therefore adopted as a practical criterion.â</p>

<p>â¢ &quot;Statistical analysis validates the increase in blood flow induced by anesthesia&quot; is a very interesting section but even though a quantitative analysis was conducted in Figure 5, the language used remains mostly qualitative. I think this section should include quantitative conclusions from the statistical analysis to increase the impact of this work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. We recognize that some aspects of the original quantitative analysis (Figures 4 and 5 in the previous version) lacked rigor, such as the classification of arteries, veins, and capillaries, and that the data presented in each row of Figure 5 represented only one mouse per coronal section, limiting the generalizability of statistical conclusions.</p>
<p>In response to the reviewersâ feedback, the revised version incorporates a new approach by merging the previous Figure 4 and Figure 5 into a single, consolidated figure (now Figure 4). This updated figure aims to present our findings from multiple dimensions, ranging from individual vessels to individual cortical ROI of arteries and veins, and ultimately to broader brain regions. We have focused on quantitative analyses that consistently show similar trends across all animals. For instance, as illustrated in the revised Figure 4f, the average cortical arterial flow speed decreases by approximately 20% from anesthesia to wakefulness, while venous flow speed decreases by an average of 40%, with the reduction in venous flow speed being significantly greater than that of arterial flow. We believe that this approach offers more insightful analysis and enhances the overall impact of the study.</p>
<p>For more examples, please refer to the revised Results section where Figure 4 are described (from Line 169 to Line 212). These sections have been extensively rewritten to emphasize quantitative interpretation of the data. Each part of the analysis now focuses more heavily on quantitative analyses that consistently show similar trends across all animals.</p>

<p>â¢ In the methods, it is claimed that 6 healthy female C57 mice were used in the study, but it is hard to tell whether more than one animal is shown in the figures. It is also unclear whether the statistics were performed within or across animals. Since one of the major strengths of the manuscript is that it shows the feasibility of performing reproducible measurements using ULM, most figures should be repeated for each individual animal and provided in supplementary data and statistics should be performed across animals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We acknowledge that the original version did not clearly indicate the use of individual animals. In the revised manuscript, we have added Supplementary Figure 1 to specify the mice used, and we have labeled each mouse accordingly in the figures or captions. Additionally, we included statistics across animals in the revised Figures 4 and 6, and detailed data for each individual mouse are now provided in Supplementary Figures 3 and 4.</p>

<p>â¢ The effect of aliasing should be discussed given that 1) a high-frequency probe is used along with a correspondingly relatively low frame rate (1000 fps) and 2) Doppler filtering is used to separate upward from downward-moving microbubbles. There will be microbubbles that circulate faster than the Nyquist limit, which will thus appear as moving in the opposite direction in the Doppler spectrum. It would be important to double-check that the effect is not too important and to report this as a limitation in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for highlighting this important point. Aliasing is indeed a relevant issue to consider, especially for higher flow velocities in large vessels. We have added a discussion on this limitation in the revised manuscript:</p>
<p>(Line 359) âBased on the maximum linking distance and gap closing parameters outlined in the Methods section, blood flow with velocities below 50 mm/s can be detected. However, the use of a directional filter to estimate flow direction may introduce aliasing. MBs moving at higher velocities may be subject to incorrect flow direction estimation due to aliasing effects. Given that the compounded frame rate is 1000 Hz, with an ultrasound center frequency of 20 MHz and a sound speed of 1540 m/s, the relationship between Doppler frequency and the axial blood flow velocity(12) indicates that aliasing will not occur for axial flow velocities below 19.25 mm/s. In all flow velocity maps presented in this study, the range is limited to a maximum of 15 mm/s, remaining below the critical threshold for aliasing. Additionally, all vessels analyzed in the violin plots for arteriovenous flow comparisons fall within this range. While cortical arterioles and venules generally exhibit moderate flow speeds, aliasing remains a factor to consider when combining directional filtering with velocity analysis.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>â¢ The method used to classify vessels may be incorrect and may not be needed. I would recommend the authors not use it and describe the vessels as vessels that branch in or out, etc. Applying an arbitrary threshold of 2 to detect capillaries is also not very convincing. I understand that the authors might decide to maintain this nomenclature, in which case I would recommend clearly explaining it at the beginning of the manuscript along with some of the caveats that are already reported in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments on our vessel classification method. We recognize the limitations of the previous approach and, in order to enhance the rigor of the study, we have opted not to continue using this method in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>In the revised analysis regarding artery and vein, we focus solely on penetrating vessels in the cortex. For these vessels, it is generally accepted that downward-flowing vessels are arterioles, while upward-flowing vessels are venules. Accordingly, in the revised Figures 4 and 6, we analyze arterioles and venules exclusively in the cortex, without relying on the previous classification method that could be considered controversial.</p>
<p>Additionally, we agree that classifying vessels with values below 2 as capillaries was not a robust approach. Thus, we have removed all related analyses from the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>â¢ Line 16: &quot;resolves capillary-scale ...&quot;; it is not clear that the resolution that is achieved in this work is at the capillary scale.</p>

<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. We understand that âcapillary-scaleâ may overstate the achieved resolution in our work. To clarify, we have revised the sentence as follows:</p>
<p>(Line 18) âUltrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is an emerging imaging modality that resolves microvasculature in deep tissues with high spatial resolution.â</p>

<p>â¢ Line 22: 'vascularity' is not well defined in the manuscript. Consider defining or using another term.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out the need for clarification on vascularity. We acknowledge that our initial use of the term âvascularityâ may have been unclear and potentially confusing. In the revised manuscript, we have included a clear definition of âvascularityâ in the Methods section under Quantitative Analysis of ULM Images (Line 534).</p>
<p>The following sentence shows the definition of vascularity:</p>
<p>(Line 547) âVascularity was defined as the proportion of the pixel count occupied by blood vessels within each ROI, obtained by binarizing the ULM vessel density maps and calculating the percentage of the pixels with MB signal.â</p>
<p>We have also added an instant definition when it was firstly used in Results part:</p>
<p>(Line 161) âWhen comparing vessel density maps, ULM images that are acquired in the awake state demonstrate a global reduction of vascularity, which refers to percentage of pixels that occupied by blood vessels.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>â¢ Line 30: I'm not convinced the first two sentences are useful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this issue. The opening sentence of the article lacked focus and was too broad. We have rewritten the sentence as follows:</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>â¢ Line 37: 'micron-scale capillaries': this expression is unclear. Capillaries are typically micron-scaled, so it gives the impression that ULM can image ULM at the one-micron scale, which is not the case.</p>

<p>Thank you for your helpful comment. We agree that âmicron-scale capillariesâ could be misleading, as it might imply a resolution at the single-micron level. To clarify, we have revised the sentence as follows:</p>
<p>(Line 40) âULM is uniquely capable of imaging microvasculature situated in deep tissue (e.g., at a depth of several centimeters).â</p>
<p>This revised wording more accurately describes ULMâs capability without implying single-micron level resolution.</p>

<p>Thank you for pointing out the potential issue with the term âmotion-freeâ. We agree that achieving entirely motion-free imaging is challenging, especially in the context of awake animals. In response to your suggestion, we have revised the sentence to better reflect this limitation:</p>
<p>(Line 76) âTo achieve consistent ULM brain imaging while allowing limited movement in awake animals, a headfixed imaging platform with a chronic cranial window was used in this study.â</p>

With the systemâs sampling rate limited to 62.5 MHz, the upper limit of the center frequency of the transducer passband is 15.625 MHz.

<p>We acknowledge that the original version did not clearly indicate the numbers of animals in the statistical analysis. In the revised manuscript, we have added Supplementary Figure 1 to specify the mice used, and we have labeled each mouse accordingly in the figures or captions. In the revised Figures 4 and 6, we have ensured that each quantitative analysis figure or its caption clearly indicate the specific mice.</p>
<p>For original Figures 1 and 2, these are presented as case studies to illustrate the methodology. Since the anesthesia time required for tail vein injection for each animal varies slightly, it is challenging to have the consistent time taken for each mouse to recover from anesthesia across all mice. For instance, in Figure 1, the mouse took nearly 500 seconds to recover from anesthesia, but this duration is not consistent across all animals, which is a limitation of the bolus injection technique. We have noted this point in the discussion (discussion on the limitation of bolus injection), and we have also clarified in the results section and figure captions that these figures represent a case study of a single mouse rather than a standardized recovery time for all animals.</p>
<p>We further clarified this point in the end of the Figure 2 caption:</p>
<p>(Fig.2 caption) âThis figure presents a case study based on the same mouse shown in Fig 1. The x-axis for d-f begins at 500 seconds because, at this point, the mouseâs pupil size stabilized, indicating it had recovered to an awake state. Consequently, ULM images were accumulated starting from this time. It is important to note that not every mouse requires 500 seconds to fully awaken; the time to reach a stable awake state varies across individual mice.â We added the following statement before introducing Figure 1e:</p>
<p>(Line 93) âDue to differences in tail vein injection timing and anesthesia depth, the time required for each mouse to fully awaken varied. Although it was not feasible to get pupil size stabilized just after 500 seconds for each animal, ULM reconstruction only used the data that acquired after the animal reached full pupillary dilation, to ensure that ULM accurately captures the cerebrovascular characteristics in the awake state.â</p>
<p>We added the following statement before introducing Figure 2d:</p>
<p>(Line 139) âTo further verify that the proposed MB bolus injection method can help to achieve ULM image saturation shortly after mice awaken from anesthesia, an analysis on the change in MB concentration over time was conducted once pupil size had stabilized (T = 500s).â</p>
<p>For Figures 3, 4, and 5 (in the revised version, Figures 4 and 5 have been combined into a single Figure 4), the data represents results from three individual mice, with each coronal plane corresponding to a different mouse. In the revised version, we have added labels to indicate the specific mouse in each image to improve clarity. We also recognize that some analyses in the original submission (original Figure 5) may have lacked sufficient statistical power due to the small sample size. Therefore, in the revised version, we have focused only on findings that were consistently observed across the three mice to ensure robust conclusions.</p>
