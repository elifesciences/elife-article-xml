<title>Abstract</title><p>Wnt signaling plays a crucial role in the early embryonic patterning and development, to regulate convergent extension during gastrulation and the establishment of the dorsal axis. Further, Wnt signaling is a crucial regulator of craniofacial morphogenesis. The adapter proteins Dact1 and Dact2 modulate the Wnt signaling pathway through binding to Disheveled. However, the distinct relative functions of Dact1 and Dact2 during embryogenesis remain unclear. We found that <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> genes have dynamic spatiotemporal expression domains that are reciprocal to one another and to <italic>wnt11f2</italic>, that suggest distinct functions during zebrafish embryogenesis. We found that both <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> contribute to axis extension, with compound mutants exhibiting a similar convergent extension defect and craniofacial phenotype to the <italic>wnt11f2</italic> mutant. Utilizing single-cell RNAseq and <italic>gpc4</italic> mutant that disrupts noncanonical Wnt signaling, we identified <italic>dact1/2</italic> specific roles during early development. Comparative whole transcriptome analysis between wildtype, <italic>gpc4</italic> and <italic>dact1/2</italic> mutants revealed a novel role for <italic>dact1/2</italic> in regulating the mRNA expression of the classical calpain <italic>capn8</italic>. Over-expression of <italic>capn8</italic> phenocopies <italic>dact1/2</italic> craniofacial dysmorphology. These results identify a previously unappreciated role of <italic>capn8</italic> and calcium-dependent proteolysis during embryogenesis. Taken together, our findings highlight the distinct and overlapping roles of <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> in embryonic craniofacial development, providing new insights into the multifaceted regulation of Wnt signaling.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Wnt signaling is a crucial regulator of embryogenesis through its regulation of body axis patterning, cell fate determination, cell migration, and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Logan and Nusse 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Steinhart and Angers 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mehta, Hingole et al. 2021</xref>). Current mechanistic understanding of Wnt signaling during embryogenesis includes an extensive catalog of ligands, receptors, co-receptors, adaptors, and effector molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Clevers and Nusse 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Niehrs 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Loh, van Amerongen et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mehta, Hingole et al. 2021</xref>). The intricate spatiotemporal integration of Wnt signaling combinations is an important focus of developmental biology and tissue morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Petersen and Reddien 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Clevers and Nusse 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Loh, van Amerongen et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Wiese, Nusse et al. 2018</xref>). Disruptions of Wnt signaling-associated genes lead to several congenital malformations which often affect multiple organ systems given their pleotropic developmental functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hashimoto, Morita et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Shi 2022</xref>). Craniofacial anomalies are among the most common structural congenital malformations and genes in the Wnt signaling pathway are frequently implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ji, Hao et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Reynolds, Kumari et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huybrechts, Mortier et al. 2020</xref>). The roles of certain Wnt signaling components may change in different temporal and spatial contexts, requiring detailed developmental and genetic analyses.</p>
<p>Genetic approaches in zebrafish have identified a number of key Wnt regulators of early development, with gastrulation and craniofacial phenotypes (Brand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Heisenberg et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hammerschmidt, Pelegri et al. 1996</xref>, Heisenberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brand et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Piotrowski, Schilling et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Solnica-Krezel, Stemple et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schilling and Le Pabic 2009</xref>). The <italic>silberblick (slb)</italic> mutant, later identified as a <italic>wnt11f2</italic> mutant allele, exhibited gastrulation and midline craniofacial phenotypes that encompassed aspects of multiple mutant classes (Heisenberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brand et al. 1996</xref>). During early segmentation in the somite stage, the <italic>wnt11f2</italic> mutant developed a shortened anterior-posterior axis and partially fused eyes (Heisenberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brand et al. 1996</xref>). Subsequently, as the cranial prominences converge and the ethmoid plate (EP) formed, instead of a fan-shaped structure observed in wildtype embryos, the <italic>wnt11f2</italic> mutant formed a rod-like EP with significant deficiency of the medio-lateral dimension (Heisenberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brand et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Heisenberg and Nusslein-Volhard 1997</xref>). Another mutant kny<italic>pek (kny)</italic>, identified as having a nonsense mutation in <italic>gpc4</italic>, an extracellular Wnt co-receptor, was identified as a gastrulation mutant that also exhibited a shortened body axis due to a defect in embryonic convergent extension (CE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Solnica-Krezel, Stemple et al. 1996</xref>). In contrast to the <italic>slb</italic>/<italic>wnt11f2 mutant</italic>, the <italic>gpc4</italic> mutant formed an EP that is wider in the medio-lateral dimension than the wildtype, in the opposite end of the EP phenotypic spectrum compared to <italic>wnt11f2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Topczewski, Sepich et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rochard, Monica et al. 2016</xref>). These observations beg the question how defects in early patterning and CE of the embryo may be associated with later craniofacial morphogenesis. The observation that <italic>wnt11f2</italic> and <italic>gpc4</italic> mutant share similar CE dysfunction and axis extension phenotypes but contrasting craniofacial morphologies was previously pondered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Heisenberg and Nusslein-Volhard 1997</xref>). This observation supports a hypothesis that CE mechanisms regulated by these Wnt pathway genes are specific to the temporal and spatial contexts during embryogenesis. As such, there may be Wnt signaling modifiers that act in specific temporal windows during development.</p>
<p>Dact (aka Frodo, Dapper) are scaffolding proteins that were identified to regulate Dishevelled (Dvl)-mediated Wnt signaling, both positively and negatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cheyette, Waxman et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gloy, Hikasa et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Waxman, Hocking et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gao, Wen et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wen, Chiang et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ma, Liu et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lee, Cheong et al. 2018</xref>). Dact proteins bind directly to Dvl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gloy, Hikasa et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brott and Sokol 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lee, Cheong et al. 2018</xref>) and have been found to interact with and inhibit members of TGFβ and Nodal signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Zhang, Zhou et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Su, Zhang et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Meng, Cheng et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kivimae, Yang et al. 2011</xref>). In chick and Xenopus, <italic>Dact2</italic> and <italic>Dact1</italic> are expressed (respectively) in the neural folds during neural crest delamination and these were found to be important in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), Wnt, and Tgfβ signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hikasa and Sokol 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Schubert, Sobreira et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rabadan, Herrera et al. 2016</xref>). In mouse embryos, Dact1 expression was reported predominantly in mesodermal tissues as well as ectodermal-derived tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hunter, Hikasa et al. 2006</xref>) and ablation of Dact1 resulted in defective EMT and morphogenesis at the primitive streak and subsequent posterior defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wen, Chiang et al. 2010</xref>). Mouse embryonic Dact2 expression has been described in the oral epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Li, Florez et al. 2013</xref>) and ablation of <italic>Dact2</italic> causes increased cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Li, Florez et al. 2013</xref>) and re-epithelialization in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Meng, Cheng et al. 2008</xref>) as well as zebrafish (Kim, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kim et al. 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous experiments using morpholinos to disrupt <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> in zebrafish found <italic>dact1</italic> morphants to be slightly smaller and to develop a normal body. In contrast, <italic>dact2</italic> morphants were found to phenocopy described zebrafish gastrulation mutants, with impaired CE, shortened body axis, and medially displaced eyes. Importantly, prior work using morpholino-mediated gene disruption of <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> did not examine craniofacial morphogenesis except to analyze <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> morphants head and eye shapes from light microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Waxman, Hocking et al. 2004</xref>). These experiments were carried out at a time when morpholino was the accessible tool of gene disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nasevicius and Ekker 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Corey and Abrams 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Heasman 2002</xref>). Since CRISPR/Cas9 targeted gene mutagenesis became popularized, many reports of germline mutant phenotypes being discrepant from prior morpholino studies warranted revisiting many of the prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kok, Shin et al. 2015</xref>) and careful interpretation given the caveats of each technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Morcos, Vincent et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Rossi, Kontarakis et al. 2015</xref>). More recently, a zebrafish CRISPR/Cas9 genetic <italic>dact2</italic> mutant has been generated and studied, but unlike in the <italic>dact2</italic> morphant, no developmental phenotypes were described (Kim, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kim et al. 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we investigated the genetic requirement of <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> during embryogenesis and craniofacial development, using germline mutant alleles generated by CRISPR-targeted mutagenesis. We found an early developmental role for <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> during gastrulation and body axis elongation. We also characterized the resulting craniofacial defect in the <italic>dact1/2</italic> compound mutants. Differential single-cell RNA sequencing between wildtype, <italic>dact1/2,</italic> and <italic>gpc4</italic> mutants revealed distinct transcriptome profiles and the discovery of <italic>calpain 8</italic> (<italic>capn8)</italic> calcium-dependent protease to be ectopically expressed in the <italic>dact1/2</italic> mutants and functions to modify Wnt signaling and craniofacial morphogenesis.</p>

<p>During gastrulation at 8 hours post-fertilization (hpf; 75% epiboly), some regions of <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> gene expression were shared and some areas are distinct to each <italic>dact</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Further, <italic>dact</italic> gene expression was distinct from <italic>wnt11f2</italic> in that <italic>wnt11f2</italic> expression was not detected in the presumptive dorsal mesoderm. Transcripts of <italic>dact1</italic>, <italic>dact2,</italic> and <italic>wntllf2</italic> were all detected in the blastoderm margin, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gillhouse, Wagner Nyholm et al. 2004</xref>). Transcripts of <italic>dact2</italic>, and to a lesser extent <italic>dact1</italic>, were also detected in the prechordal plate and chordamesoderm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Additionally, <italic>dact2</italic> gene expression was concentrated in the shield and presumptive organizer or Nieuwkoop center along with <italic>wnt11f2</italic>. This finding is consistent with previously described expression patterns in zebrafish and supports a role for <italic>dact1 and dact2</italic> in mesoderm induction and <italic>dact2</italic> in embryo dorsalization (Thisse 2001, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gillhouse, Wagner Nyholm et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Muyskens and Kimmel 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Oteiza, Koppen et al. 2010</xref>). At the end of gastrulation and during somitogenesis the differences in the domains of <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> gene expressions became more distinct (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B,C</xref>). At tailbud stage, <italic>dact1</italic> transcripts were detected in the trunk and the posterior paraxial mesoderm, whereas <italic>dact2</italic> transcripts were detected in the anterior neural plate, notochord, and tailbud, similar to <italic>wnt11f2</italic> gene expression. However, <italic>dact2</italic> was unique in that its expression demarcated the anterior border of the neural plate. As <italic>dact2</italic> morphants exhibited a craniofacial defect with medially displaced eyes and midfacial hypoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Waxman, Hocking et al. 2004</xref>), we examined <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> expression in the orofacial tissues. At 24 hpf we found some overlap but predominantly distinct expression patterns of <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> with <italic>dact1</italic> being more highly expressed in the pharyngeal arches and <italic>dact2</italic> being expressed in the midbrain/hindbrain boundary. Both <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> appeared to be expressed in the developing oral cavity. At 48 hpf <italic>dact1</italic> expression is consistent with expression in the developing craniofacial cartilage elements, while <italic>dact2</italic> expression appears within the developing mouth. The distinct cellular expression profiles of <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> were more clear in histological sections through the craniofacial region at 72 hpf. Utilizing RNAscope <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, we found that <italic>dact2</italic> and the epithelial gene <italic>irf6</italic> were co-expressed in the surface and oral epithelium that surround the cartilaginous structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). This is in contrast to <italic>dact1</italic> which was expressed in the developing cartilage of the anterior neurocranium/EP and palatoquadrate of the zebrafish larvae (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>We examined the differences in expression pattern between <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> using Daniocell single-cell sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Farrell, Wang et al. 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). During embryogenesis, <italic>dact2</italic> was more highly expressed in anterior structures including cephalic mesoderm and neural ectoderm while <italic>dact1</italic> was more highly expressed in mesenchyme and muscle (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). We also utilized this tool to compare <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> expression to <italic>wnt11f2</italic> and <italic>gpc4</italic> expression, known noncanonical Wnt pathway members with craniofacial phenotypes (Heisenberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brand et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Solnica-Krezel, Stemple et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Heisenberg and Nusslein-Volhard 1997</xref>). In general, we found <italic>dact1</italic> spatiotemporal gene expression to be more similar to <italic>gpc4</italic> while <italic>dact2</italic> gene expression was more similar to <italic>wnt11f2</italic>. These results of shared but also distinct domains of spatiotemporal gene expression of <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> suggest that the <italic>dact</italic> paralogs may have some overlapping developmental functions while other roles are paralog specific.</p>

<p>Body axis truncation has been attributed to impaired CE during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tada and Heisenberg 2012</xref>). To delineate CE hallmarks in the <italic>dact1</italic>-/-;<italic>dact2</italic>-/-mutants, we performed wholemount RNA ISH detecting genes that are expressed in key domains along the body axis. At bud stage, <italic>dact1-/-; dact2-/-</italic> embryos demonstrate bifurcated expression of <italic>pax2a</italic> and decreased anterior extension of <italic>gsc</italic> expression, suggesting impaired midline convergence and anterior extension of the mesoderm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).

However, the spacing of these genes clearly revealed the shortening of the anteroposterior body axis in the <italic>dact1-/-; dact2-/-</italic> embryos. Midline convergence is decreased and the anterior border of the neural plate (marked by <italic>zic1</italic> expression) was narrower in the <italic>dact1-/-; dact2-/-</italic> embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).

<p>Given the defective converge phenotype and shortened axis in the <italic>dact</italic> mutants during gastrulation, we examined the fish at 4 dpf for axis defects and for evidence of defective morphogenesis in the craniofacial cartilages. Craniofacial morphology is an excellent model for studying CE morphogenesis as many craniofacial cartilage elements develop through this cellular mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kamel, Hoyos et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mork and Crump 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sisson, Dale et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rochard, Monica et al. 2016</xref>).

However, in-crossing to generate <italic>dact1-/-; dact2-/-</italic> compound homozygotes resulted in dramatic craniofacial malformation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Specificity of this phenotype to <italic>dact1/2</italic> was confirmed via rescue with <italic>dact1</italic> or <italic>dact2</italic> mRNA injection (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). The <italic>dact1-/-;dact2-/-</italic> mutant embryos exhibited fully penetrant midfacial hypoplasia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) however the degree of eye field convergence in the midline varied between individuals. The forebrain protruded dorsally and the mouth opening and ventral cartilage structures were displaced ventrally (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Alcian blue staining of cartilage elements revealed severe narrowing of the EP into a rod-like structure in 100 percent of double mutants, while the ventral cartilage elements were largely unaffected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).

<p>As axis lengthening was found to be affected by loss of <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) we measured body length in 5 dpf <italic>dact1/2</italic> compound mutants. Using the length of the vertebral spine as a measure of body length we found a trend (p=0.06) towards an effect of <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> on shortening of the body length. Similar to axis length during gastrulation/segmentation, the shortening was most pronounced in <italic>dact1-/-; dact2-/-</italic> double homozygous mutants versus wildtype clutch-mates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A,B</xref>).</p>

We hypothesized that the shared phenotypes between <italic>wnt11f2</italic> and <italic>dact1/2</italic> mutants point to these genes acting in the same signaling pathway. To test for genetic epistasis between <italic>wnt11f2</italic>, <italic>dact1,</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> genes we generated <italic>wnt11f2-/-; dact1-/-; dact2-/-</italic> triple homozygous mutants. If <italic>wnt11f2</italic> and <italic>dact1/2</italic> had independent developmental requirements, the <italic>wnt11f2-/-; dact1-/-; dact2-/-</italic> mutant may exhibit a phenotype distinct from <italic>wnt11f2-/-</italic> or <italic>dact1-/-; dact2-/-</italic> mutants.

<p>The EP forms from the convergence of a central frontal prominence-derived structure with bilateral maxillary prominence-derived elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wada, Javidan et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Swartz, Sheehan-Rooney et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dougherty, Kamel et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mork and Crump 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rochard, Monica et al. 2016</xref>).The stereotypic convergent migration of cranial neural crest cells and their derivatives presents an excellent model to examine CE movements and their effects on tissue morphogenesis. The zebrafish EP is formed from the joining of a midline frontal prominence derived from the anteromost cranial neural crest (NCC) cell population that migrate over the eyes and turn caudally, to join paired lateral maxillary prominences derived from the second stream of cranial NCC population that migrate rostrally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kimmel, Miller et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wada, Javidan et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schilling and Le Pabic 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dougherty, Kamel et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mork and Crump 2015</xref>). The EP that forms is a planar fan-shaped structure where we and others have shown that the morphology is governed by Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kimmel, Miller et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rochard, Monica et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the rod-like EP we observed in the <italic>dact1-/-; dact2-/-</italic> double mutants, we hypothesized that the dysmorphology could be due to aberrant migration of the anteromost midline stream of cranial NCCs resulting in fusion of the lateral maxillary components. Conversely, an abrogated contribution from the second paired stream of maxillary NCCs could lead to an EP composed entirely of the medial component. To distinguish between these possibilities, we carried out lineage tracing of the cranial NCC populations in wildtype and <italic>dact1/2</italic> mutants. The <italic>dact1/2</italic> compound mutants were bred onto a <italic>sox10:kaede</italic> transgenic background, where we and others have shown that the <italic>sox10</italic> reporter is a reliable driver of cranial neural crest labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wada, Javidan et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dutton, Antonellis et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Swartz, Sheehan-Rooney et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dougherty, Kamel et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kague, Gallagher et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mork and Crump 2015</xref>). Cranial NCC populations in wildtype and <italic>dact1/2</italic> mutants were targeted at 19 hpf to photoconvert Kaede reporter protein in either the anterior cranial NCCs that contribute to the frontal prominence, or the second stream of NCCs that contribute to the maxillary prominence, where the labeled cells were followed longitudinally over 4.5 days of development (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). We found that the anterior NCCs of wildtype embryos migrated antero-dorsally to the eye and populated the medial EP. To our surprise, the anterior cranial NCC also migrated to contribute to the median element of the rod-like EP, suggesting the complex anterior then caudal migration of the anterior NCC is not disrupted by <italic>dact1/2</italic> mutation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, arrows). This finding is in contrast to lineage tracing in another midline mutant with a similarly shaped rod-like EP, the <italic>syu</italic> (<italic>sonic hedgehog</italic> null) mutant, where the anterior NCCs failed to populate the ANC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wada, Javidan et al. 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Genetic interaction of <italic>dact1/2</italic> with <italic>gpc4</italic> and <italic>wls</italic> to determine facial morphology</title>
<p>Given the role of Dact/dapper as modifiers of Wnt signaling, we hypothesized that genetic interaction of <italic>dact1/2</italic> with <italic>wls</italic> and <italic>gpc4</italic> will modify facial morphology. Gpc4 is a glycoprotein that binds Wnt ligands and modulates Wnt signaling. <italic>gpc4</italic> zebrafish mutants (<italic>kny</italic>) have impaired CE which leads to a shortened body axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Topczewski, Sepich et al. 2001</xref>). Wls is a posttranslational modifier of Wnt ligands which promotes their secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Banziger, Soldini et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bartscherer, Pelte et al. 2006</xref>). We previously described that these components of the Wnt/PCP pathway (<italic>gpc4</italic> receptor, <italic>wls</italic> intracellular ligand chaperon, and Wnt ligands <italic>wnt9a</italic> and <italic>wnt5b)</italic> are required for craniofacial morphogenesis, where each gene affects particular morphologic aspects of chondrocytes arrangement in the cardinal axis of the ANC and Meckel’s cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rochard, Monica et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ling, Rochard et al. 2017</xref>). Using the EP as a morphologic readout, we examined the genetic interaction of <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> with <italic>wls</italic> and <italic>gpc4</italic>. Compound mutants of <italic>dact1</italic>, <italic>dact2, gpc4</italic> or <italic>wls</italic> were generated by breeding the single alleles. Compared to wildtype ANC morphology, abrogation of <italic>gpc4</italic> led to increased width in the transverse axis, but shorter in the antero-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rochard, Monica et al. 2016</xref>). Disruption of <italic>wls</italic> leads to ANC morphology that is also wider in the transverse dimension, but to a lesser degree than observed in <italic>gpc4</italic>. Additionally, in the <italic>wls</italic> mutant, chondrocytes stack in greater layers in the sagittal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rochard, Monica et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Disruption of <italic>gpc4</italic> or <italic>wls</italic> in addition to <italic>dact1/2</italic> generated EP morphology that contained phenotypic attributes from each single mutant, so that the resultant ANC morphology represented a novel ANC form. The EP of a triple homozygous <italic>dact1-/-; dact2-/-; gpc4-/-</italic> mutant was triangular, wider in the transverse axis and shorter in the antero-posterior axis compared to the rod-like ANC observed in the <italic>dact1-/-;dact2-/-</italic> double mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A,B</xref>). Similarly, the ANC of a triple homozygous <italic>dact1-/-; dact2-/-; wls-/-</italic> mutant was in the shape of a rod, shorter in the antero-posterior axis and thicker in the sagittal axis compared to the <italic>dact1-/-;dact2-/-</italic> double mutant, reflecting attributes of the <italic>wls</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C,D</xref>). In addition to the EP phenotypes, the triple homozygous <italic>dact1-/-; dact2-/-; gpc4-/-</italic> mutant also had a short body axis and truncated tail similar but more severe than the <italic>gpc4</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Since compound disruption of <italic>dact1</italic>, <italic>dact2</italic>, and <italic>gpc4</italic> or <italic>wls</italic> resulted in a new phenotype we conclude that these genes function in different components of Wnt signaling during craniofacial development.</p>

<title><italic>dact1/2</italic> and <italic>gpc4</italic> regulate axis extension via overlapping and distinct cellular pathways</title>
<p>Our analyses of axis extension and the hallmarks of a CE defect (namely decreased length and increased width between early tissues) demonstrate that <italic>dact1</italic> and/or <italic>dact2</italic> are required for CE and anterior-posterior axis lengthening during gastrulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). An axis lengthening and CE defect has also been described in <italic>gpc4</italic> (aka kny) mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Topczewski, Sepich et al. 2001</xref>). We also observe a defect in axis lengthening in <italic>gpc4-/-</italic> in our hands (representative image <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) that is grossly similar to the <italic>dact1/2-/-</italic> mutants. Interestingly, the midfacial hypoplasia of the <italic>wnt11f2</italic> (slb) mutant has been attributed to a defect in axis extension and anterior neural plate patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Heisenberg and Nusslein-Volhard 1997</xref>), whereas defective axis extension does not lead to midfacial hypoplasia in the <italic>gpc4-/-</italic> mutant. Therefore, we hypothesized that by comparing and contrasting the gene expression changes in <italic>dact1/2</italic> versus <italic>gpc4</italic> mutants during axis extension we could identify cell programs specifically responsible for the anterior axis defect and subsequent midfacial hypoplasia. We performed single-cell transcriptional analysis to compare <italic>dact1/2</italic> mutants, <italic>gpc4</italic> mutants, and wildtype embryos during the segmentation stage. Single-cell encapsulation and barcoded cDNA libraries were prepared from individual dissociated 4 ss wildtype, <italic>dact1-/-;dact2-/-</italic> compound mutant and <italic>gpc4-/-</italic> mutant embryos using the 10X Genomics Chromium platform and Illumina next-generation sequencing. Genotyping of the embryos was not possible but quality control analysis by considering the top 2000 most variable genes across the dataset showed good clustering by genotype, indicating the reproducibility of individuals in each group. Twenty clusters were identified using Louvain clustering and identity was assigned by reviewing cluster-specific markers in light of published expression data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Farrell, Wang et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Farnsworth, Saunders et al. 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bradford, Van Slyke et al. 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B,C</xref>).

<p>To assess the relative differences in gene expression between genotype groups, we merged clusters into broader cell lineages: ectoderm, axial mesoderm, and paraxial mesoderm (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). We focused on these cell types because they contribute significantly to CE processes and axis establishment. For each of these cell lineages, we performed independent pseudo-bulk differential expression analyses (DEA) of wildtype vs. <italic>dact1-/-;dact2-/-</italic> mutant and wildtype vs. <italic>gpc4-/-</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). In all 3 cases, we found differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were commonly in <italic>dact1-/-;dact2-/-</italic> and <italic>gpc4-/-</italic> mutant relative to wildtype (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). To address the hypothesis that <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> regulate molecular pathways distinct from those regulated by <italic>gpc4</italic> we also identified genes that were differentially expressed only in <italic>dact1/2-/-</italic> mutants or only in <italic>gpc4-/-</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>).

We also found that loss of <italic>dact1/2</italic> causes significant changes to <italic>capn8</italic> expression pattern (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). Whereas <italic>capn8</italic> gene expression is principally restricted to the epidermis of wildtype embryos, loss of <italic>dact1/2</italic> leads to significant expansion of ectopic <italic>capn8</italic> gene expression in broader cell types such as in mesodermal tissues (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>).

In wildtype zebrafish, exogenous <italic>capn8</italic> mRNA caused the distinct <italic>dact1/2</italic>-/-craniofacial phenotype including a rod-like ANC at a very low frequency (1 in 142 injected embryos).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we examined the genetic requirement of <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> during early embryogenesis and craniofacial morphogenesis in zebrafish. Wnt signaling is central to the orchestration of embryogenesis and numerous proteins have been identified as modulators of Wnt signaling, including <italic>Dact1</italic> and <italic>Dact2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cheyette, Waxman et al. 2002</xref>). Several studies across <italic>Xenopus</italic>, zebrafish, and mouse have ascribed roles to <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2,</italic> including both promoting and antagonizing Wnt signaling, depending on the developmental context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cheyette, Waxman et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gloy, Hikasa et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Waxman, Hocking et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gao, Wen et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wen, Chiang et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ma, Liu et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lee, Cheong et al. 2018</xref>). Here, we show that <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> are required for axis extension during gastrulation and show an example of CE defects during gastrulation associated with craniofacial defects. During axis extension, we show that genetic disruption of <italic>dact2,</italic> but not <italic>dact1,</italic> resulted in a significantly shortened axis relative to wildtype. This result is similar to what was previously found using morpholinos to disrupt <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Waxman, Hocking et al. 2004</xref>). Interestingly, genetically disrupted mutants of <italic>dact1</italic> or <italic>dact2</italic> developed to be phenotypically normal whereas <italic>dact1/2</italic> compound mutants displayed a severe dysmorphic craniofacial phenotype. Again, this is largely similar to the previous morpholino study that found disruption of each gene to cause only a slight and occasional dysmorphic cranial phenotype at 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Waxman, Hocking et al. 2004</xref>). Notably, embryos injected with a mixture of <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> morpholino were not characterized after 10 ss, and the singly injected embryos were not characterized after 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Waxman, Hocking et al. 2004</xref>). Therefore, by analyzing genetic mutants of dact1 and dact2 our findings have largely validated the previous morpholino literature as well as added new data on later developmental outcomes.</p>
<p>The gene expression and genetic epistasis experiments carried out here support that the <italic>dact</italic> paralogs are not redundant and have unique functions during different stages of embryonic and larval development. We observed that <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> have distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns throughout embryogenesis, suggesting unique roles for each paralog in developmental processes. Differential expression of <italic>Dact1</italic> and <italic>Dact2</italic> was also described during odontogenesis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kettunen, Kivimae et al. 2010</xref>). This aligns with previous findings of differential roles of <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> in canonical vs. non-canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Waxman, Hocking et al. 2004</xref>) and a specific role for <italic>dact2</italic>, but not <italic>dact1</italic>, in TGF-beta signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Su, Zhang et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Schubert, Sobreira et al. 2014</xref>). However, the lack of a resultant phenotype upon genetic ablation of <italic>dact1</italic> or <italic>dact2</italic> individually suggests the capability of functional compensation. This is puzzling given their distinct expression patterns and needs to be examined further.</p>
<p>We found that <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> contribute to axis extension, and their compound mutants exhibit a shortened and widened body axis that is consistent with a CE defect during gastrulation. This finding aligns with previous studies that have implicated <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> in non-canonical Wnt signaling and regulation of embryonic axis extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Waxman, Hocking et al. 2004</xref>). Based on our gene expression and combinatorial genetic analyses, we offer the hypothesis that <italic>dact1</italic> expression in the paraxial mesoderm is required for dorsal CE during gastrulation through its role in noncanonical Wnt/PCP signaling, similar to the defect observed upon <italic>gpc4</italic> disruption. Conversely, we posit that <italic>dact2</italic> functions in the prechordal mesoderm to promote anterior migration during gastrulation, a function which has also been ascribed to <italic>wntllf2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Heisenberg and Nusslein-Volhard 1997</xref>). It is only upon loss of both <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> functions that the axis is significantly truncated and a craniofacial malformation results. Further experiments with spatially restricted gene ablation or cell transplantation are required to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Our results underscore the crucial roles of <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> in embryonic development and suggest a connection between gastrulation movements and subsequent craniofacial morphogenesis. Our finding that in <italic>dact1-/-;dact2-/-</italic> compound mutants the first stream of CNCC migrate and contribute to the ANC, while the second stream fails to contribute suggests the possibility of an anatomical barrier to migration, rather than an autonomous defect of the CNCCs. Disruption of the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway in zebrafish results in a similar phenotype to <italic>dact1-/-;dact2-/-</italic> and <italic>wntllf2-/-</italic> mutants where the eyes converge medially and the EP narrows to a rod shape. Interestingly, lineage tracing analysis in hedgehog-disrupted embryos found the rod-like EP to consist solely of second stream-derived CNCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wada, Javidan et al. 2005</xref>). This is in contrast to the <italic>dact1-/-;dact2-/-</italic> mutants, demonstrating two different cellular mechanisms that result in a similar anatomical dysmorphology. It will be important to test the generality of this phenomenon and determine if other mutants with craniofacial abnormalities have early patterning differences. Further, a temporally conditional genetic knockout is needed to definitively test the connection between early and later development.</p>
<p>By comparing the transcriptome across different Wnt genetic contexts, i.e. <italic>gpc4</italic>-/-with that of the <italic>dact1-/-;dact2-/-</italic> compound mutant, we identified a novel role for <italic>dact1/2</italic> in the regulation of proteolysis, with significant misexpression of <italic>capn8</italic> in the mesoderm of <italic>dact1-/-;dact2-/-</italic> mutants. Although at a very low frequency, ectopic expression of <italic>capn8</italic> mRNA recapitulated the <italic>dact1-/-;dact2-/-</italic> mutant craniofacial phenotype, suggesting that inhibition of <italic>capn8</italic> expression in the mesoderm by dact is required for normal morphogenesis. Genes involved in calcium ion binding were also differentially expressed in the <italic>dact1-/-;dact2-/-</italic> mutants and we predict that altering intracellular calcium handling in conjunction with <italic>capn8</italic> overexpression would increase the frequency of the recapitulated <italic>dact1-/-;dact2-/-</italic> mutant phenotype.</p>
<p>Capn8 is described as a stomach-specific calpain and a role during embryogenesis has not been previously described. Calpains are typically calcium-activated proteases and it is feasible that Capn8 is active in response to Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. A close family member, Capn2 has been found to modulate Wnt signaling by degradation of beta-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zanardelli, Christodoulou et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Konze, van Diepen et al. 2014</xref>). These findings suggest that dact-dependent suppression of <italic>capn8</italic> expression is necessary for normal embryogenesis and craniofacial morphogenesis, further expanding the functional repertoire of <italic>dact1/2</italic>. Further research is required to examine the direct regulatory role of dacts on <italic>capn8</italic> expression. Our findings also warrant investigation into the role of <italic>capn8</italic> during embryogenesis and possible implications for known craniofacial or other disorders. Recently, Capn8 has been implicated in EMT associated with cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Zhong, Xu et al. 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Song, Cui et al. 2024</xref>) and Xenopus capn8 was found to be required for CNCC migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cousin, Abbruzzese et al. 2011</xref>). Together these findings support a role of <italic>capn8</italic> in CNCC migration and craniofacial morphogenesis.</p>
<p>Another gene identified in our scRNA-seq data to be differentially expressed in the <italic>dact1-/-,dact2-/-</italic> but not the <italic>gpc4-/-</italic> embryos was <italic>smad1</italic>. Smad1 acts in the TGF-β signaling pathway and dact2 has been described to inhibit TGF-β and Nodal signaling by promoting the degradation of Nodal receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Zhang, Zhou et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Su, Zhang et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Meng, Cheng et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kivimae, Yang et al. 2011</xref>). Zebrafish Nodal pathway mutants (<italic>cyc/ndr2</italic>, <italic>oep/tdgf1</italic>, <italic>sqt/ndr1</italic>) exhibit medially displaced eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hatta, Kimmel et al. 1991</xref>, Brand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Heisenberg et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Heisenberg and Nusslein-Volhard 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Feldman, Gates et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zhang, Talbot et al. 1998</xref>) and it is robustly feasible that dysregulation of TGF-β signaling in the <italic>dact1</italic>-/-;<italic>dact2</italic>-/-mutant contributes to the craniofacial phenotype. Future research will examine the role of <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> in the coordination of Wnt and TGF-β signaling and the importance of this coordination in the context of craniofacial development. Of note, Sonic Hedgehog (shh) signaling is a principal regulator to the vertebrate midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chiang, Litingtung et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Ribes, Balaskas et al. 2010</xref>), and important in the development of the zebrafish floorplate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Halpern, Hatta et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Odenthal, van Eeden et al. 2000</xref>). Mutants with disrupted <italic>shh</italic> expression or signaling (<italic>cyc/ndr2</italic>, <italic>smo, oep/tdgf1</italic>) exhibit medially displaced eyes similar to the <italic>dact1/2</italic> mutants (Brand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Heisenberg et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen, Burgess et al. 2001</xref>). We did not find any genes within the sonic hedgehog pathway to be differentially expressed in <italic>dact1/2</italic> mutants, though post-transcriptional interactions cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>This study has uncovered the genetic requirement of <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> in embryonic CE and craniofacial morphogenesis, delineated the genetic interaction with Wnt genes and identified capn8 as a modifier of this process. As with most studies, this work has contributed some new knowledge but generated more questions than answers. Future work will delineate the molecular differences across the different <italic>dact1/2</italic> and other Wnt mutants to further identify determinants of craniofacial morphogenesis; and to connect these findings to clinically important Wnt regulators of facial morphology and pathology.</p>

<title>Animals and CRISPR/Cas9 targeted mutagenesis</title>
<p>All animal husbandry and experiments were performed in accordance with approval from Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee. Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) embryos and adults were maintained in accordance with institutional protocols. Embryos were raised at 28.5 C in E3 medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carroll, Macias Trevino et al. 2020</xref>) and staged visually and according to standardized developmental timepoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Westerfield 1993</xref>). All zebrafish lines used for experiments and gene editing were generated from the Tubingen or AB strain. The <italic>wnt11f2</italic> mutant line and gpc4-/-mutant line were obtained from Zebrafish International Resource Center (wnt11f2<sup>tx226/+</sup> and gpc4<sup>hi1688Tg/+</sup> respectively). The <italic>wls</italic>-/-mutant line was originally gifted to the lab and independently generated, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rochard, Monica et al. 2016</xref>). The <italic>sox10</italic>:kaede transgenic line was previously generated and described by our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dougherty, Kamel et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>CRISPR sgRNA guides were designed using computational programs ZiFiT Targeter v4.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zifit.partners.org/ZiFit">zifit.partners.org/ZiFit</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sander, Zaback et al. 2007</xref>), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.mit.edu">crispr.mit.edu</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zlab.bio/guide-design-resouces">https://zlab.bio/guide-design-resouces</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Ran, Hsu et al. 2013</xref>), and ChopChop (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no">https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Montague, Cruz et al. 2014</xref>) with traditional sequence constraints. Guides were chosen that were predicted to give high efficiency and specificity. Guides best meeting these parameters were selected in exon 2 of <italic>dact1</italic> and exon 4 of <italic>dact2</italic>. No suitable gRNA with sufficient efficiency were identified for <italic>dact2</italic> 5’ of exon 4 and the resulting phenotype was reassuring compared to previous morpholino published results. Guides for <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> and Cas9 protein were prepared and microinjected into 1 cell-stage zebrafish embryos and founders were identified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carroll, Macias Trevino et al. 2020</xref>). Primers flanking the sgRNA guide site were designed for genotyping and fragment analysis was performed on genomic DNA to detect base pair insertion/deletion.

<title>Microinjection of mRNA</title>
<p>Template DNA for <italic>in vivo</italic> mRNA transcription was generated by PCR amplification of the gene of interest from a zebrafish embryo cDNA library and cloning into pCS2+8 destination plasmid. mRNA for injection was generated using an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription kit (Invitrogen mMessage mMachine). One-cell stage zebrafish embryos were injected with 2 nL of mRNA in solution. To test genetic knockout specificity, 150 or 300 pg or dact1, dact2 or dact1 and dact2 mRNA was injected. For capn8 overexpression analysis 200 pg or GFP or capn8 mRNA was injected. Following phenotyping analysis, genotypes were determined by fragment analysis of <italic>dact1</italic> and <italic>dact2</italic> genotyping PCR products.</p>

<title>Wholemount and RNAscope <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization</title>
<p>Wholemount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carroll, Macias Trevino et al. 2020</xref>). Zebrafish embryonic cDNA was used as a template to generate riboprobes. Primers were designed to PCR amplify the specific riboprobe sequence with a T7 promoter sequence linked to the reverse primer. <italic>In vitro</italic> transcription was performed using a T7 polymerase and DIG-labeled nucleotides (Roche). RNAscope was performed on sectioned zebrafish larvae as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carroll, Macias Trevino et al. 2020</xref>). Probes were designed by and purchased from ACD Bio. Hybridization and detection was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

<title>Alcian blue staining and imaging</title>
<p>Alcian blue staining and imaging were performed at 4 dpf as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carroll, Macias Trevino et al. 2020</xref>). Briefly, larvae were fixed in 4% v/v formaldehyde overnight at 4°C. Larvae were dehydrated in 50% v/v ethanol and stained with Alcian blue as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Walker and Kimmel 2007</xref>). Whole and dissected larvae were imaged in 3% w/v methylcellulose using a Nikon Eclipse 80i compound microscope with a Nikon DS Ri1 camera. Z-stacked images were taken and extended depth of field was calculated using NIS Element BR 3.2 software. Images were processed using Fiji software. After image capture embryos were genotyped by PCR and fragment analysis.</p>

<title>Axis measurements</title>
<p>Compound <italic>dact1+/-</italic>; <italic>dact2+/-</italic> zebrafish were in-crossed and progeny were collected from 2 separate clutches and fixed in 4% formaldehyde at approximately 8ss. Embryos were individually imaged using a Zeiss Axiozoom stereoscope and processed for DNA extraction and genotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Westerfield 1993</xref>). Images were analyzed using Fiji. A circle was drawn to overlay the yolk and the geometric center was determined using the function on Fiji. Using the Fiji angle tool, lines were drawn from the center point to the anterior-most point of the embryo and from the center to the posterior-most point of the embryo. The resulting inner angle of these lines was determined. Each angle measurement was then calculated as a ratio to the average angle of the wildtype embryos. ANOVA was performed to determine statistical significance, p&lt;0.05.</p>

<title>Lineage analysis of CNCCs</title>
<p>Live embryos were mounted in 1% w/v low melt agarose and covered with E3 medium containing 0.013% w/v tricaine. Wildtype control and dact1/2-/-compound mutants on a Tg(<italic>soxI0</italic>:kaede) background were imaged on a Leica DMi8 confocal microscope and photoconverted using the UV laser (404 nm) until the green kaede fluorescence disappeared. For each embryo, one side was photoconverted and the contralateral side served as an internal control. After photoconversion, embryos were removed from the agarose and raised in E3 medium at 28.5 C until the required developmental timepoint, at which time they were similarly re-mounted and re-imaged. Z-stacked images were processed as maximum-intensity projections using Fiji software.</p>

<title>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)</title>
<p>Single-cell transcriptomic analyses were performed on 10 zebrafish embryos, including 4 wildtype, 3 <italic>dact1-/-;dact2-/-</italic> compound mutant, and 3 <italic>gpc4-/-</italic> mutant embryos. Embryos were collected at 4 ss with <italic>dact1-/-,dact2-/-</italic> and <italic>gpc4-/-</italic> mutants being identified by their truncated body axis. Embryos were dechorionated with a short (approximately 10 min) incubation in 1 mg/ml Pronase and then washed 3x in embryo medium. Cell dissociation was performed with modifications as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Farrell, Wang et al. 2018</xref>). Each embryo was transferred to 50 μl DMEM/F12 media on ice. To dissociate cells, media was replaced with 200 μl DPBS (without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>) with 0.1% w/v BSA. Embryos were disrupted by pipetting 10x with a P200 pipette tip. 500 μl of DPBS + 0.1% BSA was added and cells were centrifuged at 300xg for 1 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl DPBS + 0.1% BSA and kept on ice. Just prior to encapsulation, cells were passed through a 40 μm cell strainer, and cell counts and viability were measured. After droplet encapsulation, barcoding, and library preparation using the 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3’ kit (version 3), data were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer.</p>
<p>FASTQ files were demultiplexed and aligned to the GRCz11 build of the zebrafish genome using Cellranger (version 6.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Zheng, Terry et al. 2017</xref>). Raw Cellranger count matrices were imported into R (version 4.1.2) using Seurat (version 4.1.0) (Hao, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hao et al. 2021</xref>). First, we reviewed data for quality and excluded any droplet that did not meet all of the following criteria: (i) have at least 1,500 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), (ii) covering at least 750 distinct genes; (iii) have &lt;5% of genes mapping to the mitochondrial genome; and (iv) have a log10 of detected genes per UMI &gt;80%. After quality control, the dataset was also filtered to exclude genes with a detection rate below 1 in 3,000 cells, leaving a total of 20,078 distinct genes expressed across 19,457 cells for analysis.</p>
<p>The quality-controlled count data were normalized using Pearson’s residuals from the regularized negative binomial regression model, as implemented in Seurat::SCTransfrom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hafemeister and Satija 2019</xref>). When computing the SCT model, the effect of the total number of UMIs and number of detected genes per cell were regressed out. After normalization, the top 3,000 most variably expressed genes were used to calculate principal components (PCs). Data were then integrated by source sample using Harmony (version 0.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Korsunsky, Millard et al. 2019</xref>). A two-dimensional uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Becht, McInnes et al. 2018</xref>) was then derived from the first 40 Harmony embeddings for visualization. Using the integrated Harmony embeddings, clusters were defined with the Louvain clustering method, as implemented within Seurat. A resolution of 0.3 was used for cluster definition. Cluster identities were assigned by manually reviewing the results of Seurat::FindAllMarkers, searching for genes associated to known developmental lineages. Gene expression data for key markers that guided cluster identity assignment were visualized using Seurat::DotPlot.</p>
<p>Following this detailed annotation, some clusters were grouped to focus downstream analyses on 3 major lineages: ventral mesoderm (grouping cells from the pronephros, vasculogenic/myeloid precursors, hematopoietic cells, heart primordium, and cephalic mesoderm clusters), dorsal mesoderm (adaxial cells, segmental plate, and paraxial mesoderm), ectoderm (CNS, mid/hindbrain boundary, spinal cord, and neural crest). For those 3 lineages, single-cell level data were aggregated per sample and cluster to perform pseudobulk differential expression analyses (DEA) contrasting genotypes. Independent pairwise comparisons of <italic>dact1-/-;dact2-/-</italic> versus wildtype and <italic>gpc4-/-</italic> vs wildtype were performed using DESeq2 (v1.34.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Love, Huber et al. 2014</xref>). P-values were corrected for multiple testing using the default Benjamini-Hochberg method; log2 fold change values were corrected using the apeglm shrinkage estimator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Zhu, Ibrahim et al. 2019</xref>). Significance was defined as an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.1 and log2 fold change &gt; 0.58 in absolute value. Heatmaps of the top most significant differentially expressed genes were generated from the regularized log transformed data using pheatmap (version 1.0.12). Overlap in significant genes across pairwise comparisons were determined and visualized in Venn diagrams. Over-representation analyses against the Gene Ontology (GO) database were ran using clusterProfiler (version 4.2.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Wu, Hu et al. 2021</xref>), using as input the set of genes found to be differentially expressed in the comparison of <italic>dact1-/-;dact-/-</italic> versus wildtype but not <italic>gpc4-/-</italic> versus wildtype. Sequencing data have been deposited in GEO under accession code GSE240264.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study confirms the roles of Dact1 and Dact2, two factors involved in Wnt signaling, during zebrafish gastrulation and demonstrates their genetic interactions with other Wnt components to modulate craniofacial morphologies. The limitation of the study is that it does not distinguish primary from secondary effects for each factor, precluding an unambiguous interpretation of their roles in craniofacial morphogenesis. The findings of a new potential target of dact1/2-mediated Wnt signaling are potentially of value; however, experimental evidence supporting their functional significance remains <bold>incomplete</bold> due to inconsistent results and the inherent limitations of the overexpression study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study explores the roles of dact1 and dact2 in zebrafish embryonic axis formation and craniofacial morphogenesis. The researchers aim to uncover the mechanisms by which dact1/2 modulates Wnt signaling during embryonic development and patterning. They propose distinct spatiotemporal roles for Dact1 and Dact2 proteins in zebrafish embryonic development, particularly their involvement in modulating noncanonical Wnt signaling during convergent extension events. The findings demonstrate that dact1 and dact2 have unique spatiotemporal expression domains during development and that mutations in dact1/2 lead to convergent extension defects. Furthermore, the study attempts to link these defects to craniofacial abnormalities resulting from dact1/2 mutations. Compound mutants were used to investigate the connection between dact1 and dact2, as single mutants did not exhibit craniofacial phenotypes. The research also includes comprehensive transcriptomics and pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes in dact1/2 mutants, revealing the overexpression of calpain 8, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease. The study suggests that the upregulation of calpain 8 is linked to the observed craniofacial dysmorphology in dact1/2 mutants, implying a potential connection between calpain 8 expression and craniofacial abnormalities.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>• The study effectively recapitulates previous findings on the role of dact1/2 in modulating convergent extension during zebrafish embryogenesis.</p>
<p>
• A combination of multiple approaches, including in vivo time-lapse imaging, is used to elucidate the etiology of the rod-like neurocranial phenotype in dact1/2 double mutants.</p>
<p>
• The study utilizes both traditional and newly created mutant lines, analyzing them through single-cell transcriptomics.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors successfully addressed reviewers' suggestions with revised experiments and explanations. However, the overall narrative struggles to build a more coherent storyline.</p>
<p>
(2) The potential activity of truncated and upregulated dact mRNAs (Fig S2) and partially functional dact proteins needs further clarification.</p>
<p>
(3) Data-rich figures, specifically Figs 6, 7, and 8D, could be simplified for better clarity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Non-canonical Wnt signaling plays an important role in morphogenesis, but how different components of the pathway are required to regulate different developmental events remains an open question. This paper focuses on elucidating the overlapping and distinct functions of dact1 and dact2, two Dishevelled-binding scaffold proteins, during zebrafish axis elongation and craniofacial development. By combining genetic studies, detailed phenotypic analysis, lineage tracing, and single cell RNA-sequencing, the authors aimed to understand (1) the relative function of dact1/2 in promoting axis elongation, (2) their ability to modulate phenotypes caused by mutations in other non-canonical wnt components, and (3) pathways downstream of dact1/2.</p>
<p>
Corroborating previous findings, this paper showed that dact1/2 is required for convergent extension during gastrulation and body axis elongation. Strong qualitative evidence was also provided to support dact1/2's role in genetically modulating non-canonical wnt signaling to regulate body axis elongation and the morphology of the ethmoid plate (EP). However, the spatiotemporal function of dact1/2 remains unknown. The use of scRNA-seq identified novel pathways and targets downstream of dact1/2. Calpain 8 is one such example, and its overexpression in some of the dact1/2+/- embryos was able to phenocopy the dact1/2-/- mutant EP morphology, pointing to its sufficiency in driving the EP phenotype in a few embryos. However, the same effect was not observed in dact1-/-; dact2+/- embryos, leading to the question of how significant calpain 8 really is in this context. The requirement of calpain 8 in mediating the phenotype is unclear as well. This is the most novel aspect of the paper, but some weaknesses remain in convincingly demonstrating the importance of calpain 8.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The generation of dact1/2 germline mutants and the use of genetic approaches to dissect their genetic interactions with wnt11f2 and gpc4 provide unambiguous and consistent results that inform the relative functions of dact1 and dact2, as well as their combined effects.</p>
<p>
(2) Because the ethmoid plate exhibits a spectrum of phenotypes in different wnt genetic mutants, it is a useful system for studying how tissue morphology can be modulated by different components of the wnt pathway, as demonstrated in this study.</p>
<p>
(3) The authors leveraged lineage tracing by photoconversion to dissect how dact1/2 differentially impacts the ability of different cranial neural crest populations to contribute to the anterior neurocranium. This revealed that distinct mechanisms via dact1/2 and shh can lead to similar phenotypes.</p>
<p>
(4) The use of scRNA-seq was a powerful approach and identified potential novel pathways and targets downstream of dact1/2.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Expression of dact1/2 and wnt11f2: Certain claims regarding the expression similarity between dact2 and wnt11f2 is not clearly demonstrated in figures and the text description of dact1/2 and wnt11f2 expression for the Daniocell scRNA-seq tool is also somewhat confusing. As the paper makes claim that dact1/2 may function in the same pathway as wnt11f2, their expression should be accurately described and used to draw conclusion on what tissue types such a signaling may take place.</p>
<p>
(2) Spatiotemporal function of dact1/2: Germline mutations limit the authors' ability to study a gene's spatiotemporal functional requirement. They, therefore, cannot concretely attribute nor separate early-stage phenotypes (during gastrulation) to/from late stage phenotypes (EP morphological changes), which the authors postulated to result from secondary defects in floor plate and eye field morphometry.</p>
<p>
(3) The functional significance of calpain 8: The authors showed that calpain 8 was upregulated in the mutant and subsequently tested its function by overexpressing dact1/2 mRNA in embryos. While only 1 out of 142 calpain-overexpressing wild type animals phenocopied dact1/2 mutants, 7.5% of dact1/2+/- embryos did exhibit the phenotype. However, the same effect was not observed in dact1-/-; dact2+/- embryos and the requirement of calpain 8 in driving the phenotype remains unclear.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript the authors explore the roles of dact1 and dact2 during zebrafish gastrulation and craniofacial development. Previous studies used morpholino (MO) knockdowns to show that these scaffolding proteins, which interact with dishevelled (Dsh), are expressed during zebrafish gastrulation and suggested that dact1 promotes canonical Wnt/B-catenin signaling, while dact2 promotes non-canonical Wnt/PCP-dependent convergent-extension (Waxman et al 2004). This study goes beyond this work by creating loss-of-function mutant alleles for each gene and unlike the MO studies finds little (dact2) to no (dact1) phenotypic defects in the homozygous mutants. Interestingly, dact1/2 double mutants have a more severe phenotype, which resembles those reported with MOs as well as homozygous wnt11/silberblick (wnt11/slb) mutants that disrupt non-canonical Wnt signaling (Heisenberg et al., 1997; 2000). Further analyses in this paper try to connect gastrulation and craniofacial defects in dact1/2 mutants with wnt11/slb and other wnt-pathway mutants. scRNAseq conducted in mutants identifies calpain 8 as a potential new target of dact1/2 and Wnt signaling.</p>
<p>Previous comments:</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>When considered separately the new mutants are an improvement over the MOs and the paper contains a lot of new data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, the hypotheses are very poorly defined and misinterpret key previous findings surrounding the roles of wnt11 and gpc4, which results in a very confusing manuscript. Many of the results are not novel and focus on secondary defects. The most novel result overexpressing calpain8 in dact1/2 mutants is preliminary and not convincing.</p>
<p>Comment on the revised version:</p>
<p>The authors addressed some of our comments, but not our main criticisms, which we reiterate here:</p>
<p>(1) The authors argue that morpholino studies are unreliable and here they made new mutants to solve this uncertainty for dap 1/2. However, creating stable mutant lines to largely confirm previous results obtained by using morpholino knock-down phenotypes does not justify publication in eLife.</p>
<p>(2) The authors argue that since it has not been shown conclusively that craniofacial defects in wnt11 and dap1/2 mutants are secondary to gastrulation defects there is no solid evidence preventing them from investigating these craniofacial defects. However, since it is extremely likely that the rod-like ethmoid plates of wnt11f2- and dact1/2 mutants focused on here are secondary to gastrulation defects previously described by others (Heisenberg and NussleinVolhard 1997; Waxman et al., 2004), the burden of proof is on the authors to provide much stronger evidence against this interpretation.</p>
<p>(3) The data for calpain overexpression remains too preliminary.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Weakness 1. Enhancing Reproducibility and Robustness: To enhance the reproducibility and robustness of the findings, it would be valuable for the authors to provide specific numbers of animals used in each experiment. Explicitly stating the penetrance of the rod-like neurocranial shape in dact1/2-/- animals would provide a clearer understanding of the consistency of this phenotype.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 animal numbers were added to the figure and figure legend (line 1111). In Fig. 5 animal numbers were added to the figure. We now state that dact1/2-/- animals exhibit the rod-like neurocranial shape that is completely penetrant (Line 260).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weakness 2. Strengthening Single-Cell Data Interpretation: To further validate the single-cell data and strengthen the interpretation of the gene expression patterns, I recommend the following:</p>
<p>-Provide a more thorough explanation of the rationale for comparing dact1/2 double mutants with gpc4 mutants.</p>
<p>-Employ genotyping techniques after embryo collection to ensure the accuracy of animal selection based on phenotype and address the potential for contamination of wild-type &quot;delayed&quot; animals.</p>
<p>-Supplement the single-cell data with secondary validation using RNA in situ or immunohistochemistry techniques.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>An explanation of our rationale was added to the results section (Lines 391403) and a summary schematic was added to Figure 6 (panel A).</p>
<p>Genotyping of the embryos was not possible but quality control analysis by considering the top 2000 most variable genes across the dataset showed good clustering by genotype, indicating the reproducibility of individuals in each group (See Supplemental Fig. 4).</p>
<p>The gene expression profiles obtained in our single-cell data analysis for gpc4, dact1, and dact2 correlate closely with our in situ hybridization analyses. Further, our data is consistent with published zebrafish single-cell data. We validated our finding of increased capn8 expression in dact1/2 mutants by in situ hybridization. Therefore we are confident in the robustness of our single-cell data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weakness 3. Directly Investigating Non-Cell-Autonomous Effects: To directly assess the proposed non-cell-autonomous role of dact1/2, I suggest conducting transplantation experiments to examine the ability of ectodermal/neural crest cells from dact1/2 double mutants to form wild-type-like neurocranium.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer’s suggestion is an excellent experiment and something to consider for future work. Cell transplant experiments between animals of specific genotypes are challenging and require large numbers. It is not possible to determine the genotype of the donor and recipient embryos at the early timepoint of 1,000 cell stage where the transplants would have to be done in the zebrafish. So that each transplant will have to be carried out blind to genotype from a dact1+/-; dact2+/- or dact1-/-; dact2+/- intercross and then both animals have to be genotyped at a subsequent time point, and the phenotype of the transplant recipient be analyzed. While possible, this is a monumental undertaking and beyond the scope of the current study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weakness 4. Further Elucidating Calpain 8's Role: To strengthen the evidence supporting the critical role of Calpain 8, I recommend conducting overexpression experiments using a sensitized background to enhance the statistical significance of the findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion and have now performed capn8 overexpression experiments in embryos generated from dact1/2 double heterozygous breeding. We found a statistically significant effect of capn8 overexpression in the dact1+/-,dact2+/- fish (Lines 462-464 and Fig. 8C,D).</p>

<p>Comment: Discussion:</p>
<p>The overall discussion requires more references and additional hypotheses. On page 20, when mentioning 'as single mutants develop normally,' does this refer to the entire animals or solely the craniofacial domain? Are these mutants viable? If they are, it's crucial to discuss this phenomenon in relation to prior morpholino studies and genetic compensation.</p>
<p>Observing how the authors interpret previously documented changes in nodal and shh signaling would be beneficial. While Smad1 is discussed, what about other downstream genes? Is shh signaling altered in the dact1/2 double mutants?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the Discussion to include more references (Lines 473, 476, 483, 488, 491, 499, 501, 502, 510, 515, 529, 557, 558) and additional hypotheses (Lines 503-505, 511-519, 522-525). We have added more specific information regarding the single mutants (Lines 270-275, 480-493, Fig. S3). We have added discussion of other downstream genes, including smad1 (Lines 561-572) and shh (Lines 572-580).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Weakness(1) While the qualitative data show altered morphologies in each mutant, quantifications of these phenotypes are lacking in several instances, making it difficult to gauge reproducibility and penetrance, as well as to assess the novel ANC forms described in certain mutants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 animal numbers were added to the figure legend. In Fig. 5 animal numbers were added to the figure to demonstrate reproducibility. We now state that dact1/2-/- animals exhibit the rod-like neurocranial shape that is completely penetrant (Line 260). As the altered morphologies that we report are qualitatively significant from wildtype we did not find it necessary to make quantitative measurements. For experiments in which it was necessary to in-cross triple heterozygotes (Fig 3, Fig. 5), we dissected and visually analyzed the ANC of at least 3 compound mutant individuals. At least one individual was dissected for the previously published or described genotypes/phenotypes (i.e. wt, wntllf2-/-, dact1/2-/-, gpc4-/-, wls/-). We realize quantitative measurements may identify subtle differences between genotypes. However, the sheer number of embryos needed to generate these relatively rare combinatorial genotypes and the amount of genotyping required prevented quantitative analyses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weakness 2) Germline mutations limit the authors' ability to study a gene's spatiotemporal functional requirement. They therefore cannot concretely attribute nor separate early-stage phenotypes (during gastrulation) to/from late-stage phenotypes (ANC morphological changes).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that we cannot concretely attribute nor separate early and latestage phenotypes. Conditional mutants to provide temporal or cell-specific analysis are beyond the scope of this work. Here we speculate based on evidence obtained by comparing and contrasting embryos with grossly similar early phenotypes and divergent late-stage phenotypes. We believe our findings contribute to the existing body of literature on zebrafish mutants with both early convergent extension defects and craniofacial abnormalities.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weakness (3) Given that dact1/2 can regulate both canonical and non-canonical wnt signaling, this study did not specifically test which of these pathways is altered in the dact1/2 mutants, and it is currently unclear whether disrupted canonical wnt signaling contributes to the craniofacial phenotypes, even though these phenotypes are typical non-canonical wnt phenotypes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Previous literature has attributed canonical wnt, non-canonical wnt, and nonwnt functions to dact, and each of these likely contributes to the dact mutant phenotype (Lines 87-89). We performed cursory analyses of tcf/lef:gfp expression in the dact mutants and did not find evidence to support further analysis of canonical wnt signaling in these fish. Single-cell RNAseq did not identify differential expression of any canonical or non-canonical wnt genes in the dact1/2 mutants.</p>
<p>Further research is needed to parse out the intracellular roles of dact1 and dact2 in response to wnt and tgf-beta signaling. Here we find that dact may also have a role in calcium signaling, and further experiments are needed to elaborate this role.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weakness (4) The use of single-cell RNA sequencing unveiled genes and processes that are uniquely altered in the dact1/2 mutants, but not in the gpc4 mutants during gastrulation. However, how these changes lead to the manifested ANC phenotype later during craniofacial development remains unclear. The authors showed that calpain 8 is significantly upregulated in the mutant, but the fact that only 1 out of 142 calpainoverexpressing animals phenocopied dact1/2 mutants indicates the complexity of the system.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To further test whether capn8 overexpression may contribute to the ANC phenotype we performed overexpression experiments in the resultant embryos of dact1/dact2 double het incross. We found the addition of capn8 caused a small but statistically significant occurrence of the mutant phenotype in dact1/2 double heterozygotes (Fig.8D). We agree with the reviewer that our results indicate a complex system of dysregulation that leads to the mutant phenotype. We hypothesize that a combination of gene dysregulation may be required to recapitulate the mutant ANC phenotype. Further, as capn8 activity is regulated by calcium levels, overexpression of the mRNA alone likely has a small effect on the manifestation of the phenotype.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weakness (5) Craniofacial phenotypes observed in this study are attributed to convergent extension defects but convergent extension cell movement itself was not directly examined, leaving open if changes in other cellular processes, such as cell differentiation, proliferation, or oriented division, could cause distinct phenotypes between different mutants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although convergent extension cell movements were not directly examined, our phenotypic analyses of the dact1/2 mutant are consistent with previous literature where axis extension anomalies were attributed to defects in convergent extension (Waxman 2004, Xing 2018, Topczewski 2001). We do not attribute the axis defect to differentiation differences as in situ analyses of established cell type markers show the existence of these cells, only displaced relative to wildtype (Figure 1). We agree that we cannot rule out a role for differences in apoptosis or proliferation however, we did not detect transcriptional differences in dact1/2 mutants that would indicate this in the single-cell RNAseq dataset. Defects in directed division are possible, but alone would not explain that dact1/2 mutant phenotype, particularly the widened dorsal axis (Figure 1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>Comment (1) The author examined and showed convergent extension phenotype (CE) during body axis elongation in dact1/dact2-/- homozygous mutants. Given that dact2-/- single mutants also displayed shortened axis, the authors should either explain why they didn't analyze CE in dact2-/- (perhaps because that has been looked at in previously published dact2 morphants?) or additionally show whether CE phenotypes are present in dact1 and dact2 single mutants.</p>
<p>The authors should quantify the CE phenotype in both dact2-/- single mutants and dact1/dact2-/- double mutants, and examine whether the CE phenotypes are exacerbated in the double mutants, which may lend support to the authors' idea that dact1 can contribute to CE. The authors stated in the discussion that they &quot;posit that dact1 expression in the mesoderm is required for dorsal CE during gastrulation through its role in noncanonical Wnt/PCP signaling&quot;. However, no evidence was presented in the paper to show that dact1 influences CE during body axis elongation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Because any axis shortening in shortening in dact2-/- single mutants was overcome during the course of development and at 5 dpf there was no noticeable phenotype, we did not analyze the single mutants further.</p>
<p>We have added data to demonstrate the resulting phenotype of each combinatorial genotype to provide a more clear and detailed description of the single and compound mutants (Fig. S3).</p>
<p>Our hypothesis that dact1 may contribute to convergent extension is based on its apparent ability to compensate (either directly or indirectly) for dact2 loss in the dact2-/- single mutant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment (2) Except in Fig. 2, I could not find n numbers given in other experiments. It is therefore unclear if these mutant phenotypes were fully or partially penetrant. In general, there is also a lack of quantifications to help support the qualitative results. For example, in Fig. 4, n numbers should be given and cell movements and/or contributions to the ANC should be quantified to statistically demonstrate that the second stream of CNCC failed to contribute to the ANC.</p>
<p>Similarly, while the fan-shaped and the rod-shaped ANCs are very distinct, the various rod-shaped ANCs need to be quantified (e.g. morphometry or measurements of morphological features) in order for the authors to claim that these are &quot;novel ANC forms&quot;, such as in the dact1/2-/-, gpc4/dact1/2-/-, and wls/dact1/2-/- mutants (Fig. 5).</p>

<p>We have added n numbers for each experiment and stated that the rod-like phenotype of the dact1/2-/- mutant was fully penetrant.</p>
<p>Regarding CNCC experiments, we repeated the analysis on 3 individual controls and mutants and did not find evidence that CNCC migration was directly affected in the dact1/2 mutant. Rather, differences in ANC development are likely secondary to defects in floor plate and eye field morphometry. Therefore we did not do any further analyses of the CNCCs.</p>
<p>Regarding figure 5, we have added n numbers. We dissected and analyzed a minimum of three triple mutants (dact1/2-/-,gpc4-/- and dact1/2-/-,wls-/-) and numerous dact1/s double mutants and found that the triple mutant ANC phenotype was consistent and recognizably different enough from the dact1/2-/-, or gpc4 or wls single mutant that morphometry measurements were not needed. Further, the triple mutant phenotype (narrow and shortened) appears to be a simple combination of dact1/2 (narrow) and gpc4/wls (shortened) phenotypes. As we did not find evidence of genetic epistasis, we did not analyze the novel ANC forms further.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment (3): The authors have attributed the ANC phenotypes in dact1/2-/- to CE defects and altered noncanonical wnt signaling. However, no evidence was presented to support either. The authors can perhaps utilize diI labelling, photoconversionmediated lineage tracing, or live imaging to study cell movement in the ANC and compare that with the cell movement change in the gpc4-/- , and gpc4/dact1/2-/- mutants in order to first establish that dact1/2 affect CE and then examine how dact1/2 mutations can modulate the CE phenotypes in gpc4-/- mutants.</p>
<p>Concurrently, given that dact1 and dact2 can affect (perhaps differentially) both canonical and non-canonical wnt signaling, the authors are encouraged to also test whether canonical wnt signaling is affected in the ANC or surrounding tissues, or at minimum, discuss the potential role/contribution of canonical wnt signaling in this context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Given the substantial body of research on the role of noncanonical wnt signaling and planar cell polarity pathway on convergent extension during axis formation (reviewed by Yang and Mlodzik 2015, Roszko et al., 2009) and the resulting phenotypes of various zebrafish mutants (i.e. Xing 2018, Topczewski 2001), including previous research on dact1 and 2 morphants (Waxman 2004), we did not find it necessary to analyze CE cell movements directly.</p>
<p>Our finding that CNCC migration was not defective in the dact1/2 mutants and the knowledge that various zebrafish mutants with anterior patterning defects (slb, smo, cyc) have a similar craniofacial abnormality led us to conclude that the rod-like ANC in the dact1/2 mutant was secondary to an early patterning defect (abnormal eye field morphology). Therefore, testing dact1/2 and convergent extension or wnt signaling in the ANC itself was not an aim of this paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment (4) The authors also have not ruled out other possibilities that could cause the dact1/2-/- ANC phenotype. For example, increased cell death or reduced proliferation in the ANC may result in the phenotype, and changes in cell fate specification or differentiation in the second CNCC stream may also result in their inability to contribute to the ANC.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that we cannot rule out whether cell death or proliferation is different in the dact1/2 mutant ANC. However, because we do not find the second CNCC stream within the ANC, this is the most likely explanation for the abnormal ANC shape. Because the first stream of CNCC are able to populate the ANC and differentiate normally, it is most likely that the inability of the second stream to populate the ANC is due to steric hindrance imposed by the abnormal cranial/eye field morphology. These hypotheses would need to be tested, ideally with an inducible dact1/2 mutant, however, this is beyond the scope of this paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment (5) The last paragraph of the section &quot;Genetic interaction of dact1/2 with Wnt regulators...&quot; misuses terms and conflates phenotypes observed. For instance, the authors wrote &quot;dact2 haploinsuffciency in the context of dact1-/-; gpc4-/- double mutant produced ANC in the opposite phenotypic spectrum of ANC morphology, appearing similar to the gpc4-/- mutant phenotype&quot;. However, if heterozygous dact2 is not modulating phenotypes in this genetic background, its function is not &quot;haploinsuffcient&quot;. The authors then said, &quot;These results show that dact1 and dact2 do not have redundant function during craniofacial morphogenesis, and that dact2 function is more indispensable than dact1&quot;. However this statement should be confined to the context of modulating gpc4 phenotypes, which is not clearly stated.</p>

<p>Comment (6) For the scRNA-seq analysis, the authors should show the population distribution in the UMAP for the 3 genotypes, even if there are no obvious changes. The authors are encouraged, although not required, to perform pseudotime or RNA velocity analysis to determine if differentiation trajectories are changed in the NC populations, in light of what they found in Fig. 4. The authors can also check the expression of reporter genes downstream of certain pathways, e.g. axin2 in canonical wnt signaling, to query if these signaling activities are changed (also related to point #3 above).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added population distribution data for the 3 genotypes to Supplemental Figure 4. Although RNA velocity analysis would be an interesting additional analysis, we would hypothesize that the NC population is not driving the differences in phenotype. Rather these are likely changes in the anterior neural plate and mesoderm.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment (7) While the phenotypic difference between gpc4-/- and dact1/2-/- are in the ANC at a later stage, ssRNA-seq was performed using younger embryos. The authors should better explain the rationale and discuss how transcriptomic differences in these younger embryos can explain later phenotypes. Importantly, dact1, dact2, and capn8 expression were not shown in and around the ANC during its development and this information is crucial for interpreting some of the results shown in this paper. For example, if dact1 and dact2 are expressed during ANC development, they may have specific functions during that stage. Alternatively, if dact1 and dact2 are not expressed when the second stream CNCCs are found to be outside the ANC, then the ANC phenotype may be due to dact1/2's functions at an earlier time point. The author's statement in the discussion that &quot;embryonic fields determined during gastrulation effect the CNCC ability to contribute to the craniofacial skeleton&quot; is currently speculative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have reworded our rationale and hypothesis to increase clarity (Lines 391-405). We believe that the ANC phenotype of the dact1/2 mutants is secondary to defective CE and anterior axis lengthening, as has been reported for the slb mutant (Heisenberg 1997, 2000). We utilized the gpc4 mutant as a foil to the dact1/2 mutant, as the gpc4 mutant has defective CE and axis extension without the same craniofacial phenotype.</p>
<p>We have added dact1 and dact2 WISH of 24 and 48 hpf (Fig1. D,E) to show expression during ANC development.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment (8) The functional testing of capn8 did not yield a result that would suggest a strong effect, as only 1 in 142 animals phenocopied dact1/2. Therefore, while the result is interesting, the authors should tone down its importance. Alternatively, the authors can try knocking down capn8 in the dact1/2 mutants to test how that affects the CE phenotype during axis elongation, as well as ANC morphogenesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As overexpression of capn8 in wildtype animals did not result in a significant phenotype, we tested capn8 overexpression in compound dact1/2 mutants as these have a sensitized background. We found a small but statistically significant effect of exogenous capn8 in dact1+/-,dact2+/- animals. While the effect is not what one would expect comparing to Mendelian genetic ratios, the rod-like ANC phenotype is an extreme craniofacial dysmorphology not observed in wildtype or mRNA injected embryos hence significant. The experiment is limited by the available technology of over-expressing mRNA broadly without temporal or cell specificity control. It is possible that if capn8 over-expression was restricted to specific cells (floor plate, notochord or mesoderm) and at the optimal time period during gastrulation/segmentation that the aberrant ANC phenotype would be more robust. We agree with the reviewer that although the finding of a new role for capn8 during development is interesting, its importance in the context of dact should be toned down and we have altered the manuscript accordingly (Lines 455-467).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses: The hypotheses are very poorly defined and misinterpret key previous findings surrounding the roles of wnt11 and gpc4, which results in a very confusing manuscript. Many of the results are not novel and focus on secondary defects. The most novel result of overexpressing calpain8 in dact1/2 mutants is preliminary and not convincing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for not presenting the question more clearly. The Introduction was revised with particular attention to distinguish this work using genetic germline mutants from prior morpholino studies. Please refer to pages 4-5, lines 106-121.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weakness 1) One major problem throughout the paper is that the authors misrepresent the fact that wnt11f2 and gpc4 act in different cell populations at different times. Gastrulation defects in these mutants are not similar: wnt11 is required for anterior mesoderm CE during gastrulation but not during subsequent craniofacial development while gpc4 is required for posterior mesoderm CE and later craniofacial cartilage morphogenesis (LeClair et al., 2009). Overall, the non-overlapping functions of wnt11 and gpc4, both temporally and spatially, suggest that they are not part of the same pathway.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have reworded the text to add clarity. While the loss of wnt11 versus the loss of gpc4 may affect different cell populations, the overall effect is a shortened body axis. We stressed that it is this similar impaired axis elongation phenotype but discrepant ANC morphology phenotypes in the opposite ends of the ANC morphologic spectrum that is very interesting and leads us to investigate dact1/2 in the genetic contexts of wnt11f2 and gpc4.  Pls refer to page 4, lines 73-84. Further, the reviewer’s comment that wnt11 and gpc4 are spatially and temporally distinct is untested. We think the reviewer’s claim of gpc4 acting in the posterior mesoderm refers to its requirement in the tailbud (Marlow 2004). However this does not exclude gpc4 from acting elsewhere as well. Further experiments would be necessary. Both wnt11f2 and gpc4 regulate non-canonical wnt signaling and are coexpressed during some points of gastrulation and CF development (Gupta et al., 2013; Sisson 2015). This data supports the possibility of overlapping roles.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weakness 2) There are also serious problems surrounding attempts to relate single-cell data with the other data in the manuscript and many claims that lack validation. For example, in Fig 1 it is entirely unclear how the Daniocell scRNA-seq data have been used to compare dact1/2 with wnt11f2 or gpc4. With no labeling in panel 1E of this figure these comparisons are impossible to follow. Similarly, the comparisons between dact1/2 and gpc4 in scRNA-seq data in Fig. 6 as well as the choices of DEGs in dact1/2 or gpc4 mutants in Fig. 7 seem arbitrary and do not make a convincing case for any specific developmental hypothesis. Are dact1 and gpc4 or dact2 and wnt11 coexpressed in individual cells? Eyeballing similarity is not acceptable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have moved the previously published Daniocell data to Figure S1 and have added labeling. These data are meant to complement and support the WISH results and demonstrate the utility of using available public Daniocell data. Please recommend how we can do this better or recommend how we can remediate this work with specific comment.</p>
<p>Regarding our own scRNA-seq data, we have added rationale (line 391-403) and details of the results to increase clarity (Lines 419-436). We have added a panel to Figure 6 (panel A) to help illustrate or rationale for comparing dact1/2 to gpc4 mutants to wt. The DEGs displayed in Fig.7A are the top 50 most differentially expressed genes between dact1/2 mutants and WT (Figure 7 legend, line 422-424).</p>
<p>We have looked at our scRNA-seq gene expression results for our clusters of interest (lateral plate mesoderm, paraxial mesoderm, and ectoderm). We find dact1, dact2, and gpc4 co-expression within these clusters. Knowing whether these genes are coexpressed within the same individual cell would require going back and analyzing the raw expression data. We do not find this to be necessary to support our conclusions. The expression pattern of wnt11f2 is irrelevant here.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weakness 3) Many of the results in the paper are not novel and either confirm previous findings, particularly Waxman et al (2004), or even contradict them without good evidence. The authors should make sure that dact2 loss-of-function is not compensated for by an increase in dact1 transcription or vice versa. Testing genetic interactions, including investigating the expression of wnt11f2 in dact1/2 mutants, dact1/2 expression in wnt11f2 mutants, or the ability of dact1/2 to rescue wnt11f2 loss of function would give this work a more novel, mechanistic angle.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We clarified here that the prior work carried out by Waxman using morppholinos, while acceptable at the time in 2004, does not meet the rigor of developmental studies today which is to generate germline mutants. The reviewer’s acceptance of the prior work at face value fails to take the limitation of prior work into account. Further, the prior paper from Waxman et al did not analyze craniofacial morphology other than eyeballing the shape of the head and eyes. Please compare the Waxman paper and this work figure for figure and the additional detail of this study should be clear. Again, this is by no means any criticism of prior work as the prior study suffered from the technological limitations of 2004, just as this study also is the best we can do using the tools we have today. Any discrepancies in results are likely due to differences in morpholino versus genetic disruption and most reviewers would favor the phenotype analysis from the germline genetic context. We have addressed these concerns as objectively as we can in the text (Lines 482-493). The fact that dact1/2 double mutants display a craniofacial phenotype while the single mutants do not, suggests compensation (Lines 503-505), but not necessarily at the mRNA expression level (Fig. S2C).</p>
<p>This paper tests genetic interaction through phenotyping the wntll/dact1/dact2 mutant.</p>
<p>Our results support the previous literature that dact1/2 act downstream of wnt11 signaling. There is no evidence of cross-regulation of gene expression. We do not expect that changes in wnt11 or dact would result in expression changes in the others.</p>
<p>RNA-seq of the dact1/2 mutants did not show changes in wnt11 gene expression. Unless dact1 and/or dact2 mRNA are under expressed in the wnt11 mutant, we would not expect a rescue experiment to be informative. And as wnt11 is not a focus of this paper, we have not performed the experiment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weakness 4) The identification of calpain 8 overexpression in Dact1/2 mutants is interesting, but getting 1/142 phenotypes from mRNA injections does not meet reproducibility standards.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the occurrence of the mutant phenotype in wildtype animals with exogenous capn8 expression was below what would meet reproducibility standards, we performed an additional experiment where capn8 was overexpressed in embryos resulting from dact1/dact2 double heterozygotes incross (Fig. 8). We reasoned that an effect of capn8 overexpression may be more robust on a sensitized background. We found a statistically significant effect of capn8 in dact1/2 double heterozygotes, though the occurrence was still relatively rare (6/80). These data suggest dysregulation of capn8 contributes to the mutant ANC phenotype, though there are likely other factors involved.</p>

<p>Thank you, we agree that the ANC and ethmoid plate terminology has been confusing in the literature and we should endeavor to more clearly describe that the phenotypes in question are all in the ethmoid plate and the trabeculae are not affected.

<p>Comment: &quot;...the gpc4 mutant formed an ANC that is wider in the transverse dimension than the wildtype, in the opposite end of the ANC phenotypic spectrum compared to wnt11f2...These observations beg the question how defects in early patterning and convergent extension of the embryo may be associated with later craniofacial morphogenesis.&quot;</p>
<p>This statement is broadly representative of the general failure to distinguish primary from secondary defects in this manuscript. Focusing on secondary defects may be useful to understand the etiology of a human disease, but it is misleading to focus on secondary defects when studying gene function. The rod-like ethmoid of slb mutant results from a CE defect of anterior mesoderm during gastrulation(Heisenberg et al. 1997, 2000), while the wide ethmoid plate of kny mutants results from CE defects of cartilage precursors (Rochard et al., 2016). Based on this evidence, wnt11f2 and gpc4 act in different cell populations at different times.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is true that the slb mutant craniofacial phenotype has been stated as secondary to the CE defect during gastrulation and the kny phenotype as primary to chondrocyte CE defects in the ethmoid, however the direct experimental evidence to conclude only primary or only secondary effects does not yet exist. There is no experiment to our knowledge where wnt11f2 was found to not affect ethmoid chondrocytes directly. Likewise, there is no experiment having demonstrated that dysregulated CE in gpc4 mutants does not contribute to a secondary abnormality in the ethmoid.</p>
<p>Here, we are analyzing the CE and craniofacial phenotypes of the dact1/2 mutants without any assumptions about primary or secondary effects and without drawing any conclusions about wnt11f2 or gpc4 cellular mechanisms.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment: &quot;The observation that wnt11f2 and gpc4 mutants share similar gastrulation and axis extension phenotypes but contrasting ANC morphologies supports a hypothesis that convergent extension mechanisms regulated by these Wnt pathway genes are specific to the temporal and spatial context during embryogenesis.&quot;</p>
<p>This sentence is quite vague and potentially misleading. The gastrulation defects of these 2 mutants are not similar - wnt11 is required for anterior mesoderm CE during gastrulation and has not been shown to be active during subsequent craniofacial development while gpc4 is required for posterior mesoderm CE and craniofacial cartilage morphogenesis (LeClair et al., 2009). Here again, the non-spatially overlapping functions of wnt11 and gpc4 suggest that are not part of the same pathway.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Though the cells displaying defective CE in wnt11f2 and gpc4 mutants are different, the effects on the body axis are similar. The dact1/2 showed a similar axis extension defect (grossly) to these mutants. Our aim with the scRNA-seq experiment was to determine which cells and gene programs are disrupted in dact1/2 mutants. We found that some cell types and programs were disrupted similarly in dact1/2 mutants and gpc4 mutants, while other cells and programs were specific to dact1/2 versus gpc4 mutants. We can speculate that these that were specific to dact1/2 versus gpc4 may be attributed to CE in the anterior mesoderm, as is the case for wnt11.</p>

<p>This result is intriguing in light of (1) the similar craniofacial phenotype previously reported by Waxman et al (2004) using morpholino- based knock-down of dact2, and the phenomenon of genetic compensation demonstrated by Jakutis and Stainier 2001 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-genet-071719-020342">https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-genet-071719-020342</ext-link>). The authors should make sure that dact2 loss-of-function is not compensated for by an increase in dact1 transcription, as such compensation could lead to inaccurate conclusions if ignored.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that genetic compensation of dact2 by dact1 likely explains the different result found in the dact2 morphant versus CRISPR mutant. We found increased dact1 mRNA expression in the dact2-/- mutant (Fig S2X) however a more thorough examination is required to draw a conclusion. Interestingly, we found that in wildtype embryos dact1 and dact2 expression patterns are distinct though with some overlap. It would be informative to investigate whether the dact1 expression pattern changes in dact2-/- mutants to account for dact2 loss.</p>

<p>Comment: The rationale for investigating NC migration in mutants where there is a gastrula-stage failure of head mesoderm convergent extension is unclear. The whole head is deformed even before neural crest cells migrate as the eye field does not get split in two (Heisenberg et al., 1997; 2000), suggesting that the rod-like ethmoid plate is a secondary defect of this gastrula-stage defect. In addition, neural crest migration and cartilage morphogenesis are different processes, with clear temporal and spatial distinctions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We carried out the lineage tracing experiment to determine which NC streams contributed to the aberrantly shaped EP, whether the anteromost NC stream frontal prominence, the second NC stream of maxillary prominence, or both.  We found that the anteromost NCC did contribute to the rod-like EP, which is different from when hedgehod signaling is disrupted,  So while it is possible that the gastrula-effect head mesoderm CE caused a secondary effect on NC migration, how the anterior NC stream and second NC stream are affected differently between dact1/2 and shh pathway is interesting.  We added discussion of this observation to the manuscript (page 23, Lines 514-520).</p>

<p>Comment: Based on the heavy suspicion that the rod-like ethmoid plate of the dact1/2 mutant results from a gastrulation defect, not a primary defect in later craniofacial morphogenesis, the prospect of crossing dact1/2 mutants with other wnt-pathway mutants for which craniofacial defects result from craniofacial morphogenetic defects is at the very least unlikely to generate any useful mechanistic information, and at most very likely to generate lots of confusion. Both predictions seem to take form here.</p>
<p>However, the ethmoid plate phenotype observed in the gpc4-/-; dact1+/-; dact2-/- mutants (Fig. 5E) does suggest that gpc4 may interact with dact1/2 during gastrulation, but that is the case only if dact1+/-; dact2-/- mutants do not have an ethmoid cartilage defect, which I could not find in the manuscript. Please clarify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The perspective that the rod-like EP of the dact1/2 is due to gastrulation defect is being examined here. Why would other mutants such as wnt11f2 and gpc4 that have gastrulation CE defects have very different EP morphology, whether primary or secondary NCC effect?  Further dact1 and dact2 were reported as modifiers of Wnt signaling, so it is logical to genetically test the relationship between dact1, dact2, wnt11f2, gpc4 and wls. The experiment had to be done to investigate how these genetic combinations impact EP morphology. This study found that combined loss of dact1, dact2 and wls or gpc4 yielded new EP morphology different than those previously observed in either dact1/2, wls, gpc4, or any other mutant is important, suggesting that there are distinct roles for each of these genes contributing to facial morphology, that is not explained by CE defect alone.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment: I encourage the authors to explore ways to test whether the rod-like ethmoid of dact1/2 mutants is more than a secondary effect of the CE failure of the head mesoderm during gastrulation. Without this evidence, the phenotypes of dact1/2 -gpc4 or - wls are not going to convince us that these factors actually interact.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Actually, we find our results to support the hypothesis that the ethmoid of the dact1/2 mutants is a secondary effect of defective gastrulation and anterior extension of the body axis. However, our findings suggest (by contrasting to another mutant with impaired CE during gastrulation) that this CE defect alone cannot explain the dysmorphic ethmoid plate. Our single-cell RNA seq results and the discovery of dysregulated capn8 expression and proteolytic processes presents new wnt-regulated mechanisms for axis extension.</p>

<p>Comment: &quot;Here we show that dact1 and dact2 are required for axis extension during gastrulation and show a new example of CE defects during gastrulation associated with craniofacial defects.&quot;</p>
<p>Waxman et al. (2004) previously showed that dact2 is involved in CE during gastrulation.</p>
<p>Heisenberg et al. (1997, 2000), previously showed with the slb mutant how a CE defect during gastrulation causes a craniofacial defect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Waxman paper using morpholino to disrupt dact2 is produced limited analysis of CE and no analysis of craniofacial morphogenesis. We generated genetic mutants here to validate the earlier morpholino results and to analyze the craniofacial phenotype in detail. We have removed the word “new” to make the statement more clear (Line 475).</p>

<p>Comment: &quot;Our data supports the hypothesis that CE gastrulation defects are not causal to the craniofacial defect of medially displaced eyes and midfacial hypoplasia and that an additional morphological process is disrupted.&quot;</p>
<p>It is unclear to me how the authors reached this conclusion. I find the view that medially displaced eyes and midfacial hypoplasia are secondary to the CE gastrulation defects unchallenged by the data presented.</p>

<p>Comment: The discussion should try to reconcile the different expression patterns of dact1 and dact2, and the functional redundancy suggested by the absence of phenotype of single mutants. Genetic compensation should be considered (and perhaps tested).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The different expression patterns of dact1 and dact2 along with our finding that dact1 and dact2 genetic deficiency differently affect the gpc4 mutant phenotype suggest that dact1 and dact2 are not functionally redundant during normal development. This is in line with the previously published data showing different phenotypes of dact1 or dact2 knockdown. However, our results that genetic ablation of both dact1 and dact2 are required for a mutant phenotype suggests that these genes can compensate upon loss of the other. This would suggest then that the expression pattern of dact1 would be changed in the dact2 mutant and visa versa. We find that this line of investigation would be interesting in future studies. We have addressed this in the Discussion (Lines 485498).</p>

<p>Comment: &quot;Our results underscore the crucial roles of dact1 and dact2 in embryonic development, specifically in the connection between CE during gastrulation and ultimate craniofacial development.&quot;</p>
<p>How is this novel in light of previous studies, especially by Waxman et al. (2004) and Heisenberg et al. (1997, 2000). In this study, the authors fail to present compelling evidence that craniofacial defects are not secondary to the early gastrulation defects resulting from dact1/2 mutations.  p. 22</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have not claimed that the craniofacial defects are not secondary to the gastrulation defects. In fact, we state that there is a “connection”. Further, we do not claim that this is the first or only such finding. We believe our findings have validated the previous dact morpholino experiments and have contributed to the body of literature concerning wnt signaling during embryogenesis.</p>
