<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Mammals harbor a limited number of sound-receptor hair cells (HCs) that cannot be regenerated after damage. Thus, investigating the underlying molecular mechanisms that maintain HC survival is crucial for preventing hearing impairment. Intriguingly, <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> or <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>HCs form initially but then rapidly degenerate, whereas <italic>Rbm24<sup>-/-</sup></italic>HCs degenerate considerably later. However, the transcriptional cascades involving Pou4f3, Gfi1, and Rbm24 remains undescribed. Here, we demonstrate that <italic>Rbm24</italic> expression is completely repressed in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>HCs but unaltered in <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs, and further that the expression of both POU4F3 and GFI1 is intact in <italic>Rbm24<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs. Moreover, by using <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse transgenic reporter assays, we identify three <italic>Rbm24</italic> enhancers to which POU4F3 binds. Lastly, through <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic testing of whether Rbm24 restoration alleviates the degeneration of <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs, we show that ectopic Rbm24 alone cannot prevent <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs from degenerating. Collectively, our findings provide new molecular and genetic insights into how HC survival is regulated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Housed in the mammalian cochlea, the auditory epithelium—also known as the organ of Corti—contains the mechanosensory receptors hair cells (HCs) that detect sound information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Two types of HCs exist, the inner HCs (IHCs) and outer HCs (OHCs), and these appear in, respectively, a single row and three rows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Both OHCs and IHCs are derived from cochlear progenitors expressing high levels of ATOH1, a master transcription factor (TF) in HC development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, and no HCs form in the <italic>Atoh1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>cochlea, highlighting the essential role of ATOH1 in specifying the general HC fate in the undifferentiated progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Whereas OHCs uniquely express the motor protein PRESTIN (encoded by <italic>Slc26a5</italic>) and function as sound amplifiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], IHCs specifically express FGF8, vGLUT3 (encoded by <italic>Slc17a8</italic>), and OTOFERLIN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref> and act as the primary sensory cells that form synapses with distinct subtypes of type I spiral (auditory) neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>. Moreover, INSM1 is necessary for stabilizing the OHC fate, and ∼50% of <italic>Insm1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> OHCs tend to transdifferentiate into IHC-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]; conversely, IKZF2 is not required in early OHC development but is essential for consolidating the OHC fate, and <italic>Ikzf2<sup>cello/cello</sup></italic> mutant OHCs are dysfunctional and misexpress IHC genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. INSM1 is an epistatic but indirect positive regulator of <italic>Ikzf2</italic>, and restoration of IKZF2 expression can partially mitigate the phenotypes of <italic>Insm1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> OHCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. In contrast to INSM1 and IKZF2, TBX2 is required in IHC fate specification, differentiation, and maintenance, and IHCs convert into OHCs in the absence of TBX2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>.</p>
<p>The survival of cochlear HCs must be maintained after their production. POU4F3, a POU-domain family TF encoded by the hearing-loss gene <italic>DFNA15</italic>, is essential for HCs to survive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>. However, unlike ATOH1, POU4F3 is not involved in the fate determination of HCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. As a target gene regulated by ATOH1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], <italic>Pou4f3</italic> is expressed in HCs between embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) and E16 in a basal-to-apical gradient, and POU4F3 then activates the expression of <italic>Gfi1</italic>, which encodes a zinc-finger TF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]; Gfi1 is undetectable in <italic>Pou4f3</italic>-deficient HCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], and HCs, particularly OHCs, degenerate in <italic>Pou4f3</italic> and <italic>Gfi1</italic> mutants by birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Besides POU4F3 and Gfi1, the RNA-binding protein RBM24 is also specifically expressed in cochlear HCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. We recently showed that RBM24 is indispensable for maintaining OHC survival, but the OHC death in <italic>Rbm24</italic> mutants occurs considerably later than in <italic>Pou4f3</italic> and <italic>Gfi1</italic> mutants; OHCs develop normally until birth but most OHCs undergo cell death by postnatal day 19 (P19) in <italic>Rbm24<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. How <italic>Rbm24</italic> expression is regulated during cochlear HC development is unknown.</p>
<p>The similar but delayed phenotype of OHC death in <italic>Rbm24</italic> mutants relative to that in <italic>Pou4f3-</italic> and <italic>Gfi1</italic>-deficient mice prompted us to dissect the potential genetic interactions among them by using an <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic approach. Our results showed that the onset of RBM24 expression was completely repressed in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs, but that, unexpectedly, RBM24 expression was normal in <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs. Moreover, the expression of neither POU4F3 nor GFI1 was altered in <italic>Rbm24<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs. Thus, POU4F3, but not GFI1, is required in <italic>Rbm24</italic> expression. Furthermore, we identified three <italic>Rbm24</italic> enhancers that were sufficient to drive specific EGFP reporter expression in HCs, and these enhancers are likely bound by POU4F3. Lastly, we found that restoration of RBM24 expression alone cannot alleviate the degeneration of <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs, which indicates that the expression of additional POU4F3-targeted genes must be restored to enable <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs to survive. Our study provides new insights into the genetic interactions among <italic>Pou4f3</italic>, <italic>Gfi1</italic>, and <italic>Rbm24</italic>, which hold potential applications in HC protection.</p>

<title>RBM24 expression is completely repressed in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cochlear HCs</title>
<p>HC degeneration occurs in both <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Rbm24<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice, with the phenotype appearing earlier and being more severe in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. This led us to speculate that genetic interaction exists between <italic>Pou4f3</italic> and <italic>Rbm24</italic>. We reasoned that if POU4F3 is an upstream positive regulator of <italic>Rbm24</italic>, RBM24 expression would be downregulated in the absence of POU4F3. To rapidly test this possibility, we exploited our previously established CRISPR-stop approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. CRISPR-stop allows early stop codons to be introduced without inducing DNA damage through Cas9, which can cause deleterious effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. More importantly, the CRISPR-stop approach can generate Founder 0 (F0) mice carrying homozygous or mosaic homozygous gene mutations, and the F0 mice are thus immediately ready for phenotypic analysis, considerably faster than in the case with traditional gene-targeting methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Co-injecting one sgRNA (sgRNA-1) against <italic>Pou4f3</italic> and base-editor components into one-cell-stage mouse zygotes yielded F0 mice, whose tail DNA was subject to Sanger sequencing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 1A). Relative to wild-type (WT) mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 1B), the F0 mice with homozygous premature emergence of the stop codon TAG were defined as <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and were immediately ready for phenotypic analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 1C).</p>

<p>Triple staining of POU4F3, RBM24, and INSM1 revealed that OHCs in WT mice at E16.5 were POU4F3+/RBM24+/INSM1+, whereas IHCs expressed POU4F3 and RBM24 but not INSM1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 1D-D’’’). Conversely, POU4F3 expression was absent in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 1E-E’’’), confirming that POU4F3 translation was blocked, and unlike in WT mice, RBM24 expression was undetectable in the <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice at E16.5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 1E-E’’’). Notably, INSM1 expression appeared normal in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (arrows in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 1E-E’’’). Moreover, the presence of INSM1+ OHCs in the <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice eliminated the possibility that the absence of RBM24 was due to a secondary effect of OHC death or delayed differentiation, and also agreed with previous reports that initial HC differentiation can occur without POU4F3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Thus, the rapid <italic>Pou4f3</italic> loss-of-function analysis by using CRISPR-stop supported our hypothesis that POU4F3 is required for turning on RBM24 expression.</p>
<p>To further validate the observation described above, we constructed germ-line-stable <italic>Pou4f3</italic> mutants in which the entire <italic>Pou4f3</italic> genomic region between sgRNA-2 and sgRNA-3 was deleted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The three obtained genotypes, <italic>Pou4f3<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, <italic>Pou4f3<sup>+/-</sup></italic>, and <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, were readily distinguished using tail-DNA PCR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Relative to WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice again completely lacked RBM24 expression at E16.5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Similar to INSM1, BCL11B is an OHC marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], and triple staining of RBM24, POU4F3, and BCL11B revealed that as in WT HCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-E</xref>’’’), BCL11B was normally expressed in OHCs lacking both POU4F3 and RBM24 at E16.5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-F</xref>’’’). This result again confirmed that nascent OHCs were normally produced in the absence of POU4F3. Moreover, in contrast to WT mice at P1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 2A-A’’), the germline <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants showed HC degeneration at P0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 2B-B’’) and P1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 2C-C’’). Normalizing the numbers of the remaining HCs in the <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice at P0 or P1 against those in WT mice at P1 revealed that in P0 <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, 35.94% ± 4.52%, 38.16% ± 2.79%, and 63.8% ± 5.28% of the HCs survived in basal, middle, and apical cochlear turns, respectively, whereas in P1 <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, 5.54% ± 3.11%, 15.79% ± 3.65%, and 65.64% ± 7.95% of the HCs survived. HC degeneration in the middle and basal turns, but not the apical turn, was significantly more severe at P1 than at P0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 2D). Lastly, unlike in WT cochleae in which all MYO7A+ HCs expressed RBM24 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 2E-E’’), in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cochleae, the remaining HCs lacked RBM24 expression (arrows in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 2F-F’’). Collectively, our results obtained using two distinct <italic>Pou4f3-</italic>deficient models indicated that POU4F3 is indispensable for turning on RBM24 expression. However, whether GFI1 is also essential for RBM24 expression remained unknown.</p>

<title>Construction of <italic>Gfi1-3×HA-P2A-Cre/+</italic> knockin mouse strain</title>
<p>We sought to determine whether POU4F3 regulates <italic>Rbm24</italic> expression through GFI1 or independently of GFI1. Because a suitable commercial GFI1 antibody for immunostaining was unavailable, we constructed a knockin mouse strain, <italic>Gfi1<sup>3×HA-P2A-Cre/+</sup></italic> (<italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/+</sup></italic> in brief), by using our routine CRISPR/Cas9 approach (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1A-C); here, the GFI1 C-terminus was tagged with three Hemagglutinin (HA) fragments and Cre expression was under the control of endogenous <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (CREs) of <italic>Gfi1</italic>. The obtained WT (<italic>Gfi1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>), heterozygous (<italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/+</sup></italic>), and homozygous (<italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/HA-Cre</sup></italic>) mice were readily distinguished using tail-DNA PCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1D). Southern blotting revealed that in addition to being inserted in the <italic>Gfi1</italic> locus, the targeting vector (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1B) was randomly inserted in an unknown genomic region; however, the random insertion likely occurred in a silent genomic region as indicated by the analysis discussed below.</p>

<p>Dual staining of HA (GFI1) and the pan-HC marker MYO7A revealed that, similar to <italic>Gfi1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1E-E’’), <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/HA-Cre</sup></italic>mice showed normal HC development at P1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1F-F’’). Moreover, HA (GFI1) was highly expressed in all MYO7A+ IHCs and OHCs in <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/HA-Cre</sup></italic> mice (arrows in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1F-F’’). This finding confirmed that Gfi1 endogenous expression is unaffected in <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/HA-Cre</sup></italic>mice, which represents an advantage over the previous <italic>Gfi1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>strain in which one copy of <italic>Gfi1</italic> is lost and early onset of hearing loss occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>].</p>
<p>We also performed fate-mapping analysis in <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/+</sup>; Rosa26-loxp-stop-loxp-tdTomato</italic> (Ai9)/+ (<italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/+</sup>;</italic> Ai9/+) mice at P2. The <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/+</sup>;</italic> Ai9<italic>/+</italic> model allowed us to both visualize the temporal GFI1 protein-expression pattern and permanently mark cells expressing <italic>Gfi1</italic> by using tdTomato. Neither tdTomato nor HA was detected in the MYO7A+ HCs of control Ai9/+ mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1G-G’’’ and I-I’’), whereas the majority of MYO7A+ HCs expressed tdTomato and HA in the <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/+</sup>;</italic> Ai9<italic>/+</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1H-H’’’ and J-J’’). HA (GFI1) was generally expressed more highly in IHCs than OHCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1J-J’’), and the HA (GFI1) expression level exhibited manifest heterogeneity among the OHCs. We identified the OHCs expressing the highest (#1), intermediate (#2), and lowest (#3) levels of HA (GFI1) (arrows in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1J-J’’), and we observed that, notably, such heterogenous GFI1 expression in neonatal HCs was not detected in <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/HA-Cre</sup></italic>mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1F-F’’), likely due to the higher level of HA-tagged GFI1 in <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/HA-Cre</sup></italic> than <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/+</sup></italic>mice. Besides the tdTomato+ HCs, we detected tdTomato+ cells in nonsensory regions (arrows in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1H), consistent with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Collectively, these results indicated that the <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/+</sup></italic>strain was suitable for visualizing GFI1 protein by using an anti-HA antibody, although random insertion of the targeting vector also exists here. Alternatively, <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/+</sup></italic>can at least be treated as a pseudo-transgenic mouse strain that can be used to reliably visualize GFI1 and trace cells expressing <italic>Gfi1</italic>.</p>

<title>GFI1 expression is prevented in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cochlear HCs</title>
<p>Because HA faithfully represented GFI1 expression in the <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/+</sup></italic> strain, we expected to observe repression of HA expression in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs, as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. We confirmed this by using our CRISPR-stop approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. The experimental pipeline was mostly identical to that used for producing the <italic>Pou4f3</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 1), except that the zygotes here were derived from male <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/+</sup></italic>mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 2A). We obtained mosaic (or chimeric) <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, as confirmed through Sanger sequencing of tail-DNA PCR samples (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 2B and C), partly because the injection time was the late stage of the one-cell-stage zygotes. In control <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/+</sup></italic>mice, a pure “C” base was present (blue arrow in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 2B), but a mixture of “C” and “T” double peaks existed in <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/+</sup>; Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (mosaic) mice (red arrow in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 2C).</p>
<p>In control <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/+</sup></italic> mice at E16.5, all HCs expressed POU4F3, RBM24, and HA (GFI1), although the HA (GFI1) levels again appeared heterogenous among the OHCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 2D-D’’’). By contrast, in the <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/+</sup>; Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (mosaic) mice, we detected HCs that had either lost or maintained POU4F3 expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 2E-E’’’). Notably, POU4F3+ HCs expressed HA (GFI1) and RBM24 (blue arrows in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 2E-E’’’), whereas both HA (GFI1) and RBM24 were absent in HCs that had lost POU4F3 expression (orange arrows in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 2E-E’’’). This again confirmed that HA is a reliable readout for GFI1 expression and that the expression is sensitive to the loss of POU4F3. Moreover, the results supported the view that POU4F3 regulates <italic>Rbm24</italic> in a cell-autonomous manner.</p>

<title>GFI1 is dispensable for RBM24 expression</title>
<p>Next, we produced <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants by using the same CRISPR-stop approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. One-cell-stage zygotes derived from male <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/+</sup></italic>mice were injected with base-editor components and four different sgRNAs located in distinct exons of <italic>Gfi1</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The reason for the combined use of four sgRNAs is detailed in the discussion section. With sgRNA-6, for example, Sanger sequencing of tail DNA revealed that relative to control <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/+</sup></italic>mice (black arrow in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), F0 mice showed premature emergence of the TAG stop codon, which resulted in homozygous Gfi1 inactivation (red arrow in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). All HCs expressed HA (GFI1) and RBM24 in control <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-D</xref>’’), and, notably, RBM24 expression was maintained in <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs, which showed no HA (GFI1) expression at E16.5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-E</xref>’’). This finding suggested that RBM24 expression does not depend on GFI1.</p>
<p>The advantage of this <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> model is that it allows rapid and direct confirmation of the absence of GFI1 expression in F0 mice. However, complete loss of GFI1 expression in all HCs cannot be guaranteed here at single-cell resolution through HA staining, because only one allele of <italic>Gfi1</italic> was <italic>Gfi1<sup>HA-Cre</sup></italic>. Thus, to eliminate the possibility that only the <italic>HA</italic>-tagged <italic>Gfi1</italic> allele was mutated, we generated germ-line-stable <italic>Gfi1</italic> mutants in which the majority of the <italic>Gfi1</italic> DNA fragment between sgRNA-4 and sgRNA-9 was deleted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 3A). The WT (<italic>Gfi1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>), <italic>Gfi1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>, and <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were readily identified using tail-DNA PCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 3B). In agreement with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], dual staining of RBM24 and POU4F3 revealed that relative to WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 3C-C’’), <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 3D-D’’) showed severe degeneration of HCs at P1, particularly OHCs; this validated the successful generation of the <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Notably, the surviving POU4F3+ HCs maintained the expression of RBM24 (orange arrows in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 3D-D’’). By contrast, we observed no significant difference between WT and <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice at E16.5: both WT and <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs expressed POU4F3 and RBM24, and both WT and <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> OHCs expressed BCL11B (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 3E-F’’’). This suggests that the degeneration of <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs does not begin by E16.5. The presence of POU4F3 in <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs agreed with the previously mentioned notion that <italic>Pou4f3</italic> is epistatic to <italic>Gfi1</italic>. Collectively, the results of analyses of both <italic>Gfi1</italic> mutant models support the conclusion that GFI1 is dispensable for RBM24 expression.</p>

<p>Considering that POU4F3 is upstream and a positive regulator of <italic>Rbm24</italic>, we predicted that POU4F3 expression would be unaffected in <italic>Rbm24<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs.

<p>The mosaic inactivation of RBM24 was further confirmed through triple staining of RBM24, HA, and POU4F3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-E</xref>’’’).

<title>GATA3 is downregulated and IKZF2 is upregulated in <italic>Rbm24</italic>-deficient HCs</title>
<p>We next determined whether the expression patterns of two additional genes, <italic>Gata3</italic> and <italic>Ikzf2</italic>, which are involved in OHC development and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], were altered in the absence of RBM24. For analyzing GATA3, mosaic <italic>Rbm24</italic> mutant mice were produced using the CRISPR-stop approach (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 1A). Dual immunostaining of GATA3 and RBM24 revealed that GATA3 was evenly expressed in control OHCs and IHCs at P1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 1B-B’’). By contrast, the GATA3 level in OHCs lacking RBM24 expression (white arrows in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 1C-C’’) was manifestly weaker than that in neighboring OHCs that retained RBM24 expression (yellow arrows in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 1C-C’’).

OHCs degenerate in <italic>Gata3<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], and thus the downregulation of GATA3 might contribute to the cell death of <italic>Rbm24</italic>-deficient OHCs.</p>

<title>Three <italic>Rbm24</italic> enhancers can drive specific EGFP expression in cochlear HCs</title>
<p>After showing that POU4F3, but not GFI1, is indispensable in mediating <italic>Rbm24</italic> expression, we determined the mechanism by which POU4F3 controls <italic>Rbm24</italic> expression, particularly the role of the CREs of <italic>Rbm24</italic>.

<p>Whether Eh1, Eh2, and Eh3 are bona-fide <italic>Rbm24</italic> enhancers has remained unknown. We reasoned that if Eh1, Eh2, and Eh3 were <italic>Rbm24</italic> enhancers, one of these, together with the mini-promoter of mouse heat shock protein 68 gene (<italic>Hsp68</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], would be sufficient to drive specific reporter expression in cochlear HCs, and to test this, we established three transgenic mouse strains: Eh1-EGFP+ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-C</xref>’’), Eh2-EGFP+ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-E</xref>’’), and Eh3-EGFP+ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F-G</xref>’’); in these strains, EGFP expression would be driven by the mini-promoter of <italic>Hsp68</italic> and Eh1 or Eh2 or Eh3, respectively. The mini-promoter of <italic>Hsp68</italic> alone is reported to be incapable of driving EGFP expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>], and in contrast to this, we detected strong EGFP expression through whole-mount analysis in all three transgenic lines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, D and F). Moreover, dual labeling for EGFP and MYO7A in cryosectioned cochleae showed that EGFP was specifically expressed in IHCs and OHCs in all three strains at P1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-C</xref>’’, E-E’’ and G-G’’). Collectively, our transgenic assay results suggest that Eh1, Eh2, and Eh3 are <italic>Rbm24</italic> enhancers, and further that POU4F3 regulates <italic>Rbm24</italic> expression primarily by binding to the <italic>Rbm24</italic> enhancers.</p>

<p>Our results thus far clearly showed that POU4F3 can regulate <italic>Rbm24</italic> expression, but whether ectopic RBM24 expression can alleviate the degeneration of <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs remained unknown.

<title>Molecular mechanisms underlying cochlear HC survival</title>
<p>Mammalian sound-receptor HCs are vulnerable to various genetic mutations, environmental ototoxic factors, and aging. HC degeneration is one of the primary reasons for human sensorineural hearing impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>], and several genes whose mutations lead to HC degeneration starting at different ages have been identified previously. For example, HC development is severely defective in <italic>Atoh1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], and <italic>Atoh1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cochlear sensory cells undergo apoptosis. However, whether the absence of HCs in <italic>Atoh1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice is because of HCs not being produced or dying immediately after initial emergence remains unclear, partly due to the difficulty of unambiguously defining nascent HCs by using molecular markers.</p>
<p>Unlike in <italic>Atoh1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants, in both <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>and <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], initial cochlear HC development is normal but becomes defective at perinatal ages, consistent with the notion that POU4F3 and GFI1 are dispensable for HC fate specification but necessary for subsequent differentiation and survival. Intriguingly, caspase-3 is active during HC death in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants, and the antiapoptotic factor z-VAD-fmk exerts a protective effect on <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>HCs between E14.5 and E16.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Moreover, we noted here milder overall HC degeneration in <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice than in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice at P1, because only OHC degeneration occurred in <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice but both IHCs and OHCs were degenerated in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 2 and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 3).</p>
<p><italic>Gfi1</italic> is a recognized target of POU4F3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], but whether forced GFI1 expression can alleviate the degeneration of <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>HCs is unknown. Similarly, <italic>Pou4f3</italic> is one of the target genes regulated by ATOH1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], but whether forced expression of POU4F3 or GFI1, or both, can mitigate the developmental defects of <italic>Atoh1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs remains undetermined. Future studies must address these questions to enable comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of cochlear HC survival.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Roles of RBM24 and its regulation during cochlear HC development</title>
<p>Shortly after cochlear HCs emerge, RBM24 expression begins and then is maintained permanently, as revealed by transcriptomic analyses and antibody staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. RBM24 is not necessary in the early phase of cochlear HC development, because <italic>Rbm24<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HC development is normal by P1, but RBM24 is required for OHC survival after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]; <italic>Rbm24<sup>-/-</sup></italic>OHCs, but not IHCs, are degenerated by P19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. RBM24 is also involved in mRNA stability and pre-mRNA alternative splicing of several genes, including <italic>Cdh23</italic> and <italic>Pcdh15</italic>, which are crucial for the development of HC stereocilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>. Our study also revealed that GATA3 expression is decreased and IKZF2 expression is increased in OHCs in the absence of RBM24, which could be a direct or indirect effect of RBM24 loss. Nonetheless, single-cell transcriptomic analysis has not yet been performed on <italic>Rbm24<sup>-/-</sup></italic> IHCs or OHCs, and future investigation is necessary to clarify the detailed molecular mechanism underlying <italic>Rbm24<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HC degeneration.</p>
<p>What are the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors involved in regulating <italic>Rbm24</italic> expression? First, this study has provided strong genetic evidence indicating that POU4F3 is necessary for turning on <italic>Rbm24</italic> expression; in the absence of POU4F3, <italic>Rbm24</italic> expression was not triggered. Moreover, the normal expression of POU4F3 in <italic>Rbm24<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs confirmed that <italic>Pou4f3</italic> is epistatic to <italic>Rbm24</italic> and that RBM24 is dispensable for <italic>Pou4f3</italic> expression. Besides POU4F3, ATOH1 appears to regulate <italic>Rbm24</italic> expression, as per two lines of evidence: one, RBM24 expression is lost in <italic>Atoh1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cochlear HCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]; and two, <italic>Rbm24</italic> is one of the ATOH1 binding targets revealed by the ATOH1 Cut&amp;Run assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Notably, ATOH1 binds to both the <italic>Rbm24</italic> promoter and the three <italic>Rbm24</italic> enhancers (Eh1, Eh2, and Eh3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], whereas POU4F3 only binds to the <italic>Rbm24</italic> enhancers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, POU4F3 and ATOH1 likely cooperate to regulate <italic>Rbm24</italic> expression, and either <italic>Pou4f3</italic> or <italic>Atoh1</italic> mutation leads to repression of <italic>Rbm24</italic> expression. Future conditional <italic>Pou4f3</italic> loss-of-function studies are necessary to determine whether <italic>Rbm24</italic> expression in adult HCs requires POU4F3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title><italic>Gfi1</italic> and <italic>Rbm24</italic> are expressed independently of each other</title>
<p>We initially hypothesized that POU4F3 regulates <italic>Rbm24</italic> expression through GFI1. However, this hypothesis was not supported by our observation that RBM24 expression is normal in <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 3). Moreover, in the absence of RBM24, GFI1 expression was not altered in cochlear HCs. Thus, <italic>Rbm24</italic> expression and <italic>Gfi1</italic> expression appear to be independent of each other. This might be due to the functional difference between POU4F3 and GFI1 during cochlear HC development. Although both POU4F3 and GFI1 are necessary for promoting the expression of genes involved in HC differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], GFI1, but not POU4F3, also represses the preceding expression of neural genes in nascent HCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Another observation here relevant to <italic>Gfi1</italic> isoforms is noteworthy. We showed previously that one efficient sgRNA is adequate for inducing homozygous gene inactivation by using CRISPR-stop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Here, we used four <italic>Gfi1</italic> sgRNAs distributed across distinct exons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, we successfully established one <italic>Gfi1</italic> mutant by using sgRNA-5 alone, and this, in principle, should effectively pre-stop <italic>GFI1</italic> translation in exon 1, which codes for the SNAG repressor domain; the obtained <italic>Gfi1</italic> mutant presented the HC degeneration phenotype, although HA (GFI1) remained detectable in HCs. This agrees with the notion that the <italic>Gfi1</italic> mutant lacking the SNAG domain is equivalent to the <italic>Gfi1</italic>-null model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Thus, <italic>Gfi1</italic> is likely expressed as multiple unknown isoforms, many of which might be recognized by the HA-tag antibody because HA is tagged to the last exon (exon 6). However, when we used the four <italic>Gfi1</italic> sgRNAs together, we were able to both reproduce the HC degeneration phenotype and completely block HA (GFI1) expression.</p>

<title>Why does ectopic RBM24 fail to alleviate the degeneration of <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs?</title>
<p>Upon confirming the epistatic genetic interaction between <italic>Pou4f3</italic> and <italic>Rbm24</italic>, we predicted that ectopic RBM24 expression should be able to, at least partly, alleviate the degeneration of <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs, similar to what we recently reported in our study on INSM1 and IKZF2 in cochlear OHCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. However, RBM24 failed to rescue the HC degeneration in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Two potential explanations for this finding are the following: One, although <italic>Rbm24</italic> expression is modulated by POU4F3, RBM24 is not directly involved in the pathway regulating HC survival; accordingly, cell death occurs later in <italic>Rbm24<sup>-/-</sup></italic>HCs than in <italic>Pou4f3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HCs. Two, <italic>Rbm24</italic> is a key POU4F3 downstream target, but forced expression of RBM24 alone cannot compensate for the loss of POU4F3 or other known POU4F3 targets such as orphan thyroid nuclear receptor <italic>Nr2f2</italic> and <italic>Caprin-1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]; CAPRIN-1 is recruited to stress granules in cochlear HCs exposed to ototoxic trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>].</p>

<title>Potential application of the three <italic>Rbm24</italic> enhancers in cochlear HC gene therapy</title>
<p>Gene therapy is a promising strategy for restoring hearing capacity in humans with inherited gene mutations causing hearing impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>], and a few such therapy examples have been reported to date, including <italic>Otoferlin</italic> and <italic>vGlut3</italic> gene-replacement therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>. Currently, therapeutic cDNAs are primarily delivered into HCs by using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector. Although several AAVs have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>], the vectors transfect cochlear cells non-selectively and HC-specific AAVs are not yet available. A solution to this problem is the following: instead of the CAG/CMV ubiquitous promoter widely used in current AAVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>], using any one of the three <italic>Rbm24</italic> enhancers together with the <italic>Hsp68</italic> mini-promoter (in brief <italic>Rbm24-Hsp68</italic>) should generate an AAV that would allow HC-specific transfection. Moreover, <italic>Rbm24</italic> is permanently expressed in cochlear HCs, and if <italic>Rbm24-Hsp68</italic> AAV acts as expected, it would represent a powerful tool for future HC-specific gene therapy at all postnatal ages, with potential applications in treating clinical human deafness.</p>

For obtaining cochlear cryosections, inner ears were dehydrated in 30% sucrose (V900116, Sigma) at 4℃ before embedding into optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (4583, SAKURA), and then slices were cut at 14 μm thickness.

<p>In this <bold>valuable</bold> study, the authors explore regulatory cascades governing mammalian cochlear hair cell development and survival. They confirm previous studies that the transcription factors Pou4f3 and Gfi1 are necessary for hair cell survival, and use <bold>compelling</bold> evidence to demonstrate that the RNA binding protein gene RBM24 is regulated by Pou4f3, but not Gfi1. These findings will be of interest to those working on hearing loss, and hold significance for viral gene delivery methods aiming to manipulate gene expression.</p>

<p>Wang and colleagues recently demonstrated the essential role of RBM24 (RNA-binding motif protein 24a) in the development of mouse hair cells (source: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.31003">https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.31003</ext-link>). In this study, they further expand on their findings by revealing that Rbm24 expression is absent in Pou4f3 mutant mice but not in Gfi1 mutant mice. This observation suggests that POU4F3 acts as an upstream regulator of Rbm24. The researchers effectively demonstrate that POU4F3 can bind to and regulate Rbm24 through three distant enhancers, which are located in open chromatin regions and are bound by POU4F3. Lastly, Wang and colleagues discovered that ectopic expression of Rbm24 was unable to prevent the degeneration of POU4F3 null hair cells.</p>
<p>The findings in this manuscript hold great significance as they provide additional insights into the transcriptional cascades crucial for hair cell development. The discovery of enhancers capable of driving transgene expression specifically in hair cells holds promising therapeutic implications. The figures presented in the study are of excellent quality, the employed techniques are state-of-the-art, the data are accurately represented without exaggeration, and the study demonstrates a high level of rigor.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that two hair cell transcription factors, Pou4f3 and Gfi1 are both necessary for the survival of cochlear hair cells, and that Gfi1 is regulated by Pou4f3. The authors have previously also shown that mosaic inactivation of the RNA-binding protein RBM24 leads to outer hair cell death.</p>
<p>In the present study, the authors show that hair cells dies in Pou4f3 and Gfi1 mutant mice. They show that Gfi1 is regulated by Pou4f3. Both these observations have been published before. They then show that RBM24 is absent in Pou4f3 knockouts, but not Gfi1 knockouts. They ectopically activate RMB24 in the hair cells of Poui4f3 knockouts, but this does not rescue the hair cell death. Finally the authors validate three RMB24 enhancers that are active in young hair cells and which have been previously shown to bind Pou4f3.</p>
<p>The experiments are well-executed and the data are clear. The results support the conclusions of the paper. The authors have revised the paper slightly, mostly to modify the red/green staining in the figures, and to perform additional analyses of the RBM24 and Ikzf2 mutants, now shown in Supplementary Figure 3.</p>
<p>Much of the work in the paper has been reported before. The result that hair cell transcription factors operate in a network, with some transcription factors activating only a subset of hair cell genes, is an expected result. Since RBM24 is only one of many genes regulated directly by Pou4f3, it is not surprising that it cannot rescue the Pou4f3 knockout hair cell degeneration, and indeed the rationale for attempting such a rescue experiment is not provided by the authors.</p>
<p>The identification of new hair cell enhancers may be of use to investigators wishing to express genes in hair cells.</p>
<p>In sum, this work, although carefully performed, does not shed significant new light on our understanding of hair cell development or survival.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For the Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) While not absolutely necessary - it would be nice to see at least at the in-situ level what happens to the handful of other HC-important transcription factors in the Rbm24 KO (IKZF2, Barlh1, RFX) as the authors did look at Insm1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Thanks for your suggested experiments. We agree that knowing whether the genes that are known to be involved in cell survival regulation are changed will provide insights into the mechanisms underlying cell death of Rbm24-/- HCs. Our data showed that Ikzf2 seemed to be upregulated when in the Rbm24-/- HCs, relative to Rbm24+/+ HCs at P5. We also tested Barlh1 and RFX, but we did not obtain confident data to present. Nonetheless, following the reviewer’s logic, we further tested Gata3, another gene involved in HC survival, and found that Gata3 was down-regulated in Rbm24 -/- HCs, compared to Rbm24+/+ HCs. Please refer to the text on lines 12-22 on page 12 and lines 1-10 on page 13, and Figure 3-figure supplement 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Major comments: The nomenclature for mouse gene vs. mouse protein needs to be addressed throughout the manuscript. The nomenclature when referring to a mouse gene: gene symbols are italicized, with only the first letter in upper-case (e.g. Rbm24).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The nomenclature when referring to a mouse protein: Protein symbols are not italicized, and all letters are in upper-case (e.g. RBM24).</p>
<p>Reply: Thanks for pointing it out. In the entire manuscript, we have followed the reviewer’s comments to list gene and protein.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Supplemental Figure 2D: Individual data points should be displayed on the bar graph via dots. SEM is not appropriate for this graph as SEM precision with only 3 samples is low. Furthermore, readers are more interested in knowing the variability within samples and not proximity of mean to the population mean, therefore standard deviation (SD) should be used instead.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: We have edited the Figure 1-figure supplement 2D, as suggested. The Figure 1figure supplement 2 legend was updated, too. Please refer to line 21-22 on page 32.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Red/Green should be avoided, especially when both are on the same image (merged immunofluorescence images that are found throughout the manuscript). I highly recommend changing to a color-blind friendly color scheme (such as cyan/green/magenta, cyan/magenta/yellow, etc.) for inclusivity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Thanks for pointing it out. We have changed the red to magenta in all our Figures and figure supplements.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Minor comments: As CRISPR-stop is a major method used throughout the paper, a brief explanation is needed for readers to understand what this methodology entails and why it was used. Something along the lines of,&quot; The CRISPR-stop technique allows for the introduction of early stop codons without the induction of DNA damage via Cas9 which can cause deleterious effects&quot;.</p>
