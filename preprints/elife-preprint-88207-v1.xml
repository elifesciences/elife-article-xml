<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As the main constituent of the terrestrial plant biomass, lignocellulose represents a huge reservoir of fixed carbon and a renewable resource for bioproducts and energy that is essential for human usages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Lignocellulose biomass enclosed mainly within secondary cell wall (SCW) reinforces vessels for long-distance transport and provides physical properties to fibers allowing upright growth of the plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. SCWs are composite material made of high molecular weight biopolymers, including cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, as well as cell wall proteins whose composition and structure can differ markedly between dicots and monocots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Cellulose is synthesized at the plasma membrane by the cellulose synthase complex and is composed of linear chains of β-(1–4) glucans that aggregate to form highly crystalline cellulose microfibrils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Xylans, the main hemicellulosic polysaccharides in SCW, are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus by a complex biosynthetic machinery and comprise a group of polysaccharides that share a common backbone of β-(1,4)-linked xylose (Xyl) units, but differs by the presence of side chains, whose nature is dependent on tissues and species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. In particular, glucuronoxylan, the dominant xylan in the SCW of dicots, is notably substituted at <italic>O</italic>-2 position with α-D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) or (4-O-methyl)-α-D-glucuronic acid (MeGlcA) groups, and with O-acetyl moieties at C-2 or C-3 positions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. By interacting with the cellulose and lignin, xylans contribute to the strengthening of the SCW, and are considered to be one of the main factors contributing to the biomass recalcitrance to enzymatic hydrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Finally, lignin polymers are made up of H, G, and S units which are the results of the oxidation and the polymerisation of the <italic>p</italic>-coumaryl, coniferyl and synapyl alcohols, respectively. These monomers, also called monolignols are synthesized on the ER surface/cytoplasm prior transportation to the cell wall. Lignins confer stiffness, strength and hydrophobicity to the SCW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The metabolic load imposed by the coordinated production of SCW biopolymers emphasizes the importance for plants of having a precise control over temporal and spatial expression of the corresponding SCW biosynthetic genes. Based on founding studies performed in Arabidopsis model, it is generally recognized that the SCW synthesis is primarily controlled at a transcriptional level by a multilayer and interconnected network of transcription factors/TFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Key players of this regulatory network are related NAC (NAM-ATAF1/2-CUC) and MYB-type TFs that induce, in a redundant and combinatorial manner, the expression of SCW biosynthetic genes by binding their promoter region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In addition, a family of Class III homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-ZIPIII) TFs, whose members control several aspects of Arabidopsis development, was also shown to interact with SCW regulatory network, contributing to xylem cell specification and SCW synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Although this transcriptional level of control can gain complexity in perennial plants, functional orthologs of the main regulators were identified in many different species, suggesting that SCW deposition proceeds via a conserved mechanism in all vascular plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. During the last decade, engineering the SCW regulatory network to deposit modified lignin and/or improve polysaccharide composition became a promising strategy to optimize biomass processability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. However, despite huge progresses in understanding the regulation of SCW synthesis, the engineering of SCW regulatory network to improve biomass yield and digestibility has proven difficult and often impairs plant growth because of altered vascular tissue development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Downstream of transcriptional regulations by TFs, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are essential post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression across all kingdoms of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. However, although a large cohort of RBPs exists in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, there is little information about RBPs-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of SCW biosynthetic genes. So far, only few microRNAs (miRNAs) families have been implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation of genes involved in both regulatory and enzymatic aspects of SCW biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. In particular, miR165/166 were shown to target HD-ZIPIII transcriptional regulators, having a direct impact on the transcriptional network associated with SCW biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. In the other hand, miRNA397/857/408 were shown to affect lignin content <italic>via</italic> the targeting of laccase/LAC genes, which control lignin polymerization from monolignols precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In addition, two related tandem CCCH zinc-finger proteins, which exhibit both DNA and RNA binding abilities, have been proposed to modulate SCW formation by regulating the expression of genes associated with cell wall metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Despite these mounting evidences, our current knowledge of the role of post-transcriptional regulators in SCW synthesis is still very limited.</p>
<p>In this work, we report that two RRM-domain containing RNA-binding proteins homologous to the animal translational regulator Musashi, Musashi-like2/MSIL2 and Musashi-like4/MSIL4, function redundantly to control various aspects development, including the stiffness of the inflorescence stem in Arabidopsis. We show that RRM-dependent RNA-binding activity is essential for MSIL2/4 functions <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that MSIL2/4 interactomes are similar, being enriched in proteins involved in 3’-UTR binding and translational regulation. MSIL2/4 mutations alter the formation of SCW in the interfascicular fiber cells, leading to a reduction in lignin deposition, and a change in the decoration pattern of glucuronoxylan that is associated with an increase of 4-<italic>O</italic>-methylation of GlcA substituent. In accordance, quantitative mass-spectrometry-based protein analysis reveal an overaccumulation of glucuronoxylan biosynthetic machinery, including the GlucuronoXylan Methyltransferase3/GXM3, in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant stem. We show that MSIL4 immunoprecipitates GXM3 mRNA in vivo, likely regulating its expression at a translational level. Our results demonstrate that MSILs regulate SCW synthesis in interfascicular fiber cells and point to a novel aspect of SCW regulation linking translational repression to regulation of SCW biosynthesis genes.</p>

<title>Musashi-like MSIL2/4 proteins redundantly control specific Arabidopsis development processes</title>
<p>While many studies have implicated the MSIs in the control of gene expression during cellular proliferation, cell fate determination and cancer in animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, yet little is known about the presence and activity of MSI-type proteins in plants. In this work, we describe an RNA-binding protein family in Arabidopsis, whose members hereafter named as <italic>MUSASHI- Like1</italic> to <italic>4/MSIL1-4</italic>, share both sequence, domain organization, and model-based structural similarities with animal MSIs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, b). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Arabidopsis indeed harbors a clade of seven <italic>MSIL</italic>-type genes with a prominent sub-clade harboring the <italic>MSIL1-4</italic> genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Notably, a neighboring sub-clade contains two genes, <italic>RBGD2</italic> and <italic>RGBD4</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), that encode for heat-inducible RBPs implicated in the response to heat stress in Arabidopsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. MSIL1-4 proteins share a common domain architecture consisting of two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2) that are followed by a poorly conserved, intrinsically unstructured, carboxy-terminal region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>; and Supplementary Fig. 1a). The survey of the gene expression ARAPORT11 databases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://araport.org/">https://araport.org/</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fgcz-pep2pro.uzh.ch">http://fgcz-pep2pro.uzh.ch</ext-link>) revealed that the <italic>MSIL1-4</italic> genes are widely expressed in Arabidopsis, with <italic>MSIL1</italic> showing the lowest levels of expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Database searches further indicated that <italic>MSIL</italic> orthologs are widely distributed in land plants, from bryophytes to angiosperms (Supplementary Fig. 1b). To gain a mechanistic understanding of MSIL function in Arabidopsis, we determined the subcellular localization of these proteins by performing fluorescence microscopy on GFP-tagged versions of MSIL2 and MSIL4 (MSIL2G and MSIL4G). Both proteins showed a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution in root cells of stable Arabidopsis transgenic plants that contrasts with the nucleus and cytoplasmic distributions of the free GFP protein control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>

<p>To further investigate the function of the MSILs in Arabidopsis, we raised specific antibodies against non-conserved regions of MSIL1-4 and characterized T-DNA insertion <italic>msil</italic> mutant lines that lack full-length <italic>MSIL</italic> mRNA and MSIL proteins as judged by RT-PCR and western blot experiments, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2a-c). However, none of the four characterized single <italic>msil</italic> mutants showed any obvious phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 3a and data not shown). To assess the potential functional redundancy between <italic>MSIL</italic> genes, we crossed the single <italic>msil</italic> mutants together and characterized the six possible double mutant combinations (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Only the <italic>msil2</italic>-1/<italic>msil4</italic>-1 (<italic>msil2/4</italic>) double mutant showed discernable developmental abnormal phenotypes, including enlarged and curled leaves, early leaf senescence and a pendant inflorescence stem (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, f; and Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). To assess whether MSIL1 and MSIL3 also contribute to Arabidopsis development in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> double mutant background, we generated a <italic>msil1</italic>-1/<italic>msil2</italic>-1/<italic>msil3-</italic>1/<italic>msil4</italic>-1 (<italic>msil1/2/3/4</italic>) quadruple mutant that shows no particular or aggravated developmental phenotypes with respect to the <italic>msil2/4</italic> double mutant (Supplementary Fig. 3a, c, d). To test the functional redundancy of MSIL2 and MSIL4 proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>, we transformed the <italic>msil2/4</italic> double mutant with constructs coding either for a Flag/HA-tagged version of MSIL2 (MSIL2F) or MSIL4 (MSIL4F), and selected two independent transgenic plants expressing similar and near physiological levels of the tagged protein, as evaluated by western blot using our home-made antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 3e). The ectopic expression of either MSIL2F or MSIL4F proteins was able to rescue all the phenotypes associated with the MSIL2/4 defect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, f; and Supplementary Fig. 3b). This confirms that MSIL2F and MSIL4F are functional proteins and more importantly that MSIL2 and MSIL4 redundantly control various aspects of development in Arabidopsis.</p>

<title>RRM-dependent RNA-binding activity is essential for MSIL2/4 functions <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Animal MSIs interact with target transcripts through their RRM domains and mutations in these domains have been shown to impair MSI activity <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. MSILs are very similar to metazoan MSIs over their RRM sequences (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>; and Supplementary Fig. 4a), a closeness of sequences also observed when homology models of the MSIL4 RRM motifs were generated using SWISS-MODEL server<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Homology-based structure prediction proposed that these domains adopt the characteristic RRM fold with a four-stranded β-sheet structure bearing the conserved phenylalanine residues involved in the specific recognition of RNA bases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>; and Supplementary Fig. 4a).

Given the current lack of knowledge of the role of post-transcriptional mechanisms in the control of SCW biosynthesis in plants, we henceforth focused our analysis on the pendant stem phenotype of the <italic>msil2/4</italic> double mutant. Survey of the Arabidopsis inflorescence stem tissue-specific transcriptome database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> indicated that the <italic>MSIL2/4</italic> genes are highly expressed in the SCW-forming xylary fiber (F) and xylem vessel (X) cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Toluidine blue O staining and microscopic analysis of Col-0 and <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant stem cross-sections revealed no major changes in the architecture of both the interfascicular and xylary fibers in the mutant stem. Notably, xylem cells deformation or collapse, which are a characteristic of mutants deficient in SCW synthesis, were not observed in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). However, the examination of the cell wall thickness in cross sections of stems revealed that the interfascicular fiber cells display a significantly thinner SCW in <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>).

<p>To extend this analysis, we then subjected purified Col-0 and <italic>msil2/4</italic> SCW materials to Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.

The large-scale chemotyping of CW composition in stem by FTIR spectroscopy suggested that not only lignin deposition was impaired in <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutants but also polysaccharides composition (Supplementary Fig. 7d, right panel). The lowest absorbance values in <italic>msil2/4</italic> lines were observed in the region 1800-1500cm<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, mostly associated to the absorbance of lignin related compounds.

<title>The accumulation and activity of the glucuronoxylan decoration machinery are mis-regulated in <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant</title>
<p>To elucidate the impact of the MSIL2/4 on the expression of SCW-related biosynthesis genes in the Arabidopsis inflorescence stem, we performed mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) on both wild-type and <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant backgrounds. In total, we found 234 genes to be significantly differentially regulated (DEG) in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant background (with stringent thresholds having a logarithm of fold change &gt;1.5 or &lt;-1.5 and false discovery rate (FDR ≤ 0.05), including 156 up-regulated and 78 down-regulated mRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 8a; and Supplementary Table 2). Interestingly, genes encoding regulatory or enzymatic components of the SCW biosynthesis pathway were absent from the DEG list, and their expression was not significant changed in <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Gene Ontology analysis of DEGs revealed significantly enriched signaling pathways (FDR ≤0.05) involved in plant defense or responses to biotic and abiotic stresses (Supplementary Fig. 8b), encoding products that are preferentially targeted to the extracellular region and the cell wall (Supplementary Fig. 8c).

To investigate proteome-level changes that could potentially occur upon MSIL2/4 mutations, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of Col-0 and <italic>msil2/4</italic> inflorescence stems using MS-based quantitative proteomics, and represented ≈4300 reliably identified and quantified proteins in a volcano plot according to their statistical p-value and their relative difference of abundance.

While no specific GO terms were enriched in the set of down-regulated proteins, the inspection of the up-regulated proteins revealed a strong enrichment in enzymes involved in the glucuronoxylan biosynthetic pathway (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>, b; and supplementary Table 3). Notably, the upregulated glucuronoxylan-related proteins included glycosyltransferases required for the xylan backbone synthesis (IRX9/10/14), as well as enzymes involved in its substitution (ESK1, GUX1, and GXM3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>, c). Visual inspection of the RNA-seq aligned reads of the up-regulated glucuronoxylan-related genes using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) and quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the glucuronoxylan-related decoration genes confirmed that the observed proteomic changes in msil2/4 were not associated with significant variations in mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b).</p>

We noticed that in addition to GXM3, a second member of the GXM family, GXM1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, tends also to be over-expressed in <italic>msil2/4</italic> stem although at a fold change of 1.77 slightly below the fixed significance threshold in the proteomic analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>; and Supplementary Table 3). This observations make us wonder whether the apparent decrease of GlcA branched xylooligosaccharides in <italic>msil2/4</italic> could be due to an overmethylation of the GlcA substituent. To address this question, we performed the xylanase digestion and MALDI-TOF analysis in presence of an added spike-in oligosaccharide control (Pentaacetyl- chitopentaose) for normalization of the MALDI_TOF data (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Upon normalization, the MALDI-TOF data indicated that the decrease of the peaks corresponding to the GlcA-branched xylooligosaccharides was correlated with a increase in corresponding meGlcA branched xylooligosaccharides, (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>; and Supplementary Fig. 10b; and Supplementary Table 5), suggesting that the MSIL2/4 mutations unleash the activity of the GXM1/3 in stem.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are essential components of the gene regulation machinery that govern the fate and expression of cellular RNA at post-transcriptional levels, including processing, splicing, base modification, translation and degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Sequence-based bioinformatic, reverse and forward genetic, and affinity-based proteomic analyses have converged to show that plants, like animals and fungi, harbor a large diversity of RBPs whose functions in gene regulation and plant development are ill-defined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In this study, we have identified an RRM motif-containing RBP family, hereafter named as MSIL, whose members share sequence, structural and functional similarities with the animal translational regulator Musashi/MSI. We found that two of the four MSIL members, MSIL2 and MSIL4, function redundantly to control various aspects of Arabidopsis development, including leaf senescence, morphology of rosette leaves, and the rigidity of the inflorescence stem. We provide evidence that the RRM domains of the MSIL2/4 proteins exhibit RNA-binding ability and are essential for the activity of these proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>, an observation that is corroborated by the presence of the MSIL2/4 proteins in an experimentally determined Arabidopsis mRNA-binding proteome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Further supporting a role for MSIL2/4 in mRNA-related transactions, affinity purification-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that these proteins share a common network of protein-protein interactions with well-known mRNA-binding proteins, including the PAB2/4/8, RBP45/47, and the translation factor EIF4G. Notably, the animal polyA-binding protein/PABP (homolog of the plant PABs) was previously shown to be a functional partner of MSI that is essential for it activity in translation repression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the MSIL2/4-associated proteins also include the phylogenetically related RBGD2/4 proteins, two constitutively expressed RBPs that are involved in heat resistance in Arabidopsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. The comparison of the MSIL2/4 and RBGD2/4 interactomes indicates only a partial overlap, suggesting a certain level of subfunctionalization. In accordance with this observation, the MSILs and RBGDs clearly diversify in function, since the <italic>rbgd2/4</italic> double mutant exhibits no developmental phenotypes under normal growth conditions.</p>
<p>A penetrant developmental phenotype associated with the MSIL2/4 mutations is a loss in stem rigidity that we could trace back to a defect in SCW formation, an important reservoir of fixed carbon and a renewable resource of major environmental and economic importance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Yet, with the exception of few microRNAs involved in the control of lignin polymer synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, no information about RBPs-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of SCW biosynthetic genes was previously reported. In this study, we show that MSIL2 and MSIL4, function redundantly to promote SCW formation in the interfascicular fibers and that their ability to bind RNA is essential to fulfill this function. Our conclusions are supported by independent approaches which highlight changes of SCW thickness, lignin content, and xylan decoration profile in the interfascicular fiber cells of the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant. The fiber-specific effect of the MSIL2/4 mutations on SCW formation, is further supported by our evidence showing that the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant grows normally and lacks the xylem collapses usually observed in more pleiotropic SCW deficient mutants. Previous studies have shown that specific master transcriptional regulators, such as NST1 and NST3, control cell-lineage specific formation of SCW formation in Arabidopsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Our study extend this observation by showing that RBP-mediated post-transcriptional mechanisms are also involved in cell-type specific control of SCW formation in Arabidopsis. Notably, the presumed role of MSIL2/4 in interfascicular fiber cells contrasts with the rather constitutive expression of the <italic>MSIL2/4</italic> genes, suggesting that their activity depends on cell-context. This is in accordance with the reported cell-type specific activities of ubiquitous animal MSI2 in cell renewal, cell differentiation and cancer control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Understanding how the activity of the <italic>MSIL2/4</italic> genes is controlled by the cellular context will be essential from a basic point of view, providing a unique model for studying RBP regulation in specific cell type in plants.</p>
<p>Our data indicate that the accumulation of gene transcripts of SCW biosynthesis pathway enzymes and regulators are unaffected in <italic>msil2/4</italic>, suggesting that MSIL2/4 proteins are likely to act at a translational level to regulate the SCW formation in interfascicular fiber cells, an observation that is supported by the nature of the MSIL2/4 interactome. In this regard, the stem proteomics gives us a glimpse into the changes in protein abundance that could account for the observed <italic>msil2/4</italic> SCW phenotype. Indeed, our MS data reveal that the glucuronoxylan biosynthesis machinery, including enzymes involved both in the synthesis and substitution of the xylan backbone, is specifically over-accumulated in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> double mutant. The molecular specificity of the observed glucuronoxylan phenotype with respect to the changes in glucuronoxylan enzymatic machinery content raises several interesting questions about the impact of the MSIL2/4 mutations on the SCW formation. First, we noticed that the outcome of our proteomic data contrasts with the observed normal level of glucuronoxylan deposition in the interfascicular fibers SCW, suggesting that independent regulatory mechanisms act downstream of MSIL2/4 to control final glucuronoxylan content in the SCW. One possible explanation for this observation could be that the activities of the GUX, ESK, IRXs glucuronoxylan biosynthesis enzymes, in contrast to that of GXM3, are not rate-limiting for glucuronoxylan synthesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Alternatively, and in agreement with studies that have reported that glucuronoxylan and cellulose contents are correlated <italic>in vivo</italic> in xylan-deficient mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, one could imagine that cellulose is the primary determinant of the content in glucuronoxylan in the SCW, and that the glucuronoxylan produced in excess in the golgi compartment of the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant is targeted for degradation upon secretion if unbound to cellulose. In contrast, the concomitance between the glucuronoxylan hypermethylation and the GXM3 overaccumulation phenotypes observed in <italic>msil2/4</italic> clearly support the previous assumption that the GXM-mediated methylation is a rate-limiting step in glucuronoxylan that can be overcome by GXM protein overexpression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Our data support the idea that MSIL2/4 play a specific role in the developmental control of the GXM protein accumulation/activity, actively restraining the level of glucuronoxylan methylation in the Arabidopsis interfascicular fiber cells. We currently posit that MSIL2/4 could control the level of the GXM enzymes by directly regulating the translation of the <italic>GXM</italic> mRNAs or by indirectly regulating the translation of an yet unknown translational regulator of the glucuronoxylan biosynthesis pathway (XTRe) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Future biochemical and functional studies will be necessary to precisely understand the mechanism by which MSIL2/4 proteins impact gene expression during SCW synthesis in Arabidopsis.</p>

<caption><title>Model of MSIL-dependent control of glucuronoxylan methylation in Arabidopsis and its consequence for SCW architecture.</title>
<p>In the interfascicular fiber cells of Col-0, MSIL2/4 restrain the translation of the glucuronoxylan biosynthesis machinery, including the rate-limiting GXM3 enzyme. This activity would keep the level of glucuronoxylan methylation at an intermediate level, therefore providing a biochemical environment that favors the interactions between the glucuronoxylan and lignin polymers. In the interfascicular fiber cells of <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant, the translation of the glucuronoxylan biosynthesis machinery, including GXM3, is increased, leading to the deposition of an over- methylated form of glucuronoxylan that has detrimental effects on glucuronoxylan-lignin interaction and the SCW formation. In a non exclusive manner, MSIL2/4 could also have a positive role in lignin synthesis, whose defect in <italic>msil2/4</italic> would lead to a decrease in lignin content. The model was inspired from Grantham et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p></caption>

<p>Our data indicate that, in addition to the reported change in glucuronoxylan methylation, the MSIL2/4 mutations is also associated with a specific decrease of lignin content in the SCW of the interfascicular fiber cells, whose origin remains unclear. On the basis of the previous observations, we envision two possible mechanisms by which the MSIL2/4 mutations could impact the lignin deposition in the fiber cells. In the first model, we propose that MSIL2/4 positively control the lignin synthesis pathway in the interfascicular cells by promoting the translation of lignin biosynthesis genes or that of a putative lignin translational activator (LTAc) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). In this regard, although no GO enrichment could be observed for lignin biosynthesis related genes in the proteomic analysis, two lignin biosynthetic enzymes, CAD4 and PAL2, are significantly down-accumulated in <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant (Supplementary Table 3), an observation that could account for the observed decrease in lignin content. However, previous published biochemical and genetic analyses do not support this conclusion, as the single <italic>cad4</italic> and <italic>pal2</italic> knock-out mutants display no significant alteration of lignin content due to genetic redundancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Moreover, thio-acidolysis analyses showed that the ratio or degree of polymerization of the different lignin monomers remain unchanged in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant, reinforcing the idea that the lignin biosynthesis pathway is functional in this mutant, leaving open the question of the specificity of MSIL2/4 action on the lignin pathway (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7</xref>). An alternative explanation for the decrease in lignin phenotype observed in the <italic>msil2/4</italic> mutant would be that it results from an indirect cascade effect primarily triggered by the <italic>msil2/4</italic>-dependent changes in glucuronoxylan methylation. In this regard, it has been proposed that the 4-<italic>O</italic>-methylation of GlcA substituent results in the xylan being more hydrophobic, possibly impacting its non-covalent interaction with lignin and the capacity of lignin to assemble in the SCW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, the hypermethylation of the carbon-4 hydroxyl of the GlcA side chains could affect the capacity of glucuronoxylan to form ether linkages to lignin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Indeed, a study recently reported the existence of an ether linkage between a carbon-6 hydroxyl of a mannosyl residue of a galactoglucomannan hemicellulose and lignin in pine wood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Although xylan has been proposed to bind covalently to lignin via ether bonds involving xylose or Arabinose residues, it remains unclear to date whether glucuronoxylan can form GlcA-dependent ether linkages with lignin, and the functional relevance of such linkages remains to be demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>.</p>

The MS and MS/MS data were acquired using Xcalibur 4.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>
<p>Peptides and proteins were identified by Mascot (version 2.8.0, Matrix Science) through concomitant searches against the Viridiplantae database (from Uniprot, Arabidopsis thaliana (thale-cress) taxonomy, 136447 sequences) and a homemade database containing the sequences of classical contaminant proteins found in proteomic analyses (human keratins, trypsin…, 126 sequences). Trypsin/P was chosen as the enzyme and two missed cleavages were allowed. Precursor and fragment mass error tolerances were set at respectively at 10 and 20 ppm. Peptide modifications allowed during the search were: Carbamidomethyl (C, fixed), Acetyl (Protein N-term, variable) and Oxidation (M, variable). The Proline software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> (version 2.2.0) was used for the compilation, grouping, and filtering of the results (conservation of rank 1 peptides, peptide length ≥ 6 amino acids, false discovery rate of peptide-spectrum-match identifications &lt; 1%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, and minimum of one specific peptide per identified protein group). MS data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Proline was then used to perform a MS1 label-free quantification of the identified protein groups based on razor and specific peptides.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using the ProStaR software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> based on the quantitative data obtained with the four biological replicates analyzed per condition. Proteins identified in the contaminant database, proteins identified by MS/MS in less than two replicates of one condition, and proteins quantified in less than three replicates of one condition were discarded. After log2 transformation, abundance values were normalized using the variance stabilizing normalization (vsn) method, before missing value imputation (SLSA algorithm for partially observed values in the condition and DetQuantile algorithm for totally absent values in the condition). Statistical testing was conducted with limma, whereby differentially expressed proteins were selected using a log2(Fold Change) cut-off of 1 and a p- value cut-off of 0.00513, allowing to reach a false discovery rate close to 1% according to the Benjamini-Hochberg estimator. Proteins found differentially abundant but identified by MS/MS in less than two replicates, and detected in less than three replicates, in the condition in which they were found to be more abundant were invalidated (p-value = 1).</p>

<title>MALDI-TOF MS analyses of the patterns of xylanase-released SCW oligosaccharide</title>
<p>10 mg of dried alcohol insoluble cell wall residues were incubated with 10U.ml<sup>-1</sup> of endo-1,4-D- xylanase (E-XYLNP) from MEGAZYME previously desalted with centrifulgal filters (Amicon Ultra-0.5ml) in 1 ml during 12hrs at 40°C. After boiling during 5 min to inactivate enzyme activity, samples where filtred with 50KD centrifulgal filters (Amicon Ultra-0.5ml). As positive control, 2 mg of wheat AX (MEGAZYMZE) were treated in a similar manner.

<p>Secondary cell walls support vascular plants and conduct water throughout the plant body, but are also important resources for lignocellulosic feedstocks. Secondary cell wall synthesis is under complex transcriptional control, presumably because it must only be initiated after cell growth is complete. Here, the authors found that two Musashi-type RNA-binding proteins, MSIL2 and MSIL4 are redundantly required for secondary cell wall development in Arabidopsis. The plant phenotypes could be complemented by the wild-type version of either protein, but not by a MSIL4 version that carries mutations in the conserved RNA-binding domains, and the authors localized MSIL2 &amp; 4 to stress granules, implicating the RNA-binding function of MSIL4 in the cell wall phenotype. Upon closer inspection, the secondary cell wall phenotypes included changes in vasculature morphology, and minor changes to lignin and hemicellulose (glucuronoxylan). While there were no changes to likely cell wall target genes in the transcriptome of msil2msil4 plants, proteomics experiments found glucuronoxylan biosynthesis components were upregulated in the mutants, and they detected an increase in substituted xylan via several methods. Finally, they documented MSIL4 binding to RNA encoding one of these targets, suggesting that MSIL2 and MSIL4 act to post-transcriptionally regulate glucuronoxylan modification. Altogether, this is a new mechanism by which cell wall composition could be regulated.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript is well-written, the data are generally high-quality, and the authors typically use several independent methods to support each claim. However, several important questions remain unanswered by this work in its current state and the model presented in Figure 7 is quite speculative. For example, the link between the striking plant phenotype and GXM misregulation is unclear since GXM overexpression doesn't alter plant phenotypes or lignin content (Yuan et al 2014 Plant Science), so misregulation of GXMs in msil2msil4 mutants clearly is not the whole story. It also remains to be determined why one particular secondary cell wall synthesis enzyme is regulated likely post-transcriptionally, while so much of the pathway is regulated at the transcriptional level. There are likely other targets for MSIL2- and MSIL4-mediated regulation since it seems that MSIL2 and MSIL4 are expressed in tissues that are not synthesizing secondary cell walls.</p>

<p>This work explored the biological functions of a small family of RNA-binding proteins that was previously studied in animals, but was uncharacterized in plants. Combinatorial T-DNA insertional mutants disrupting the expression of the four Mushashi-like (MSIL) genes in Arabidopsis revealed that only the msil2 msil4 double mutant visibly alters plant development. The msil2/4 plants produced stems that could not stand upright. Transgene complementation, site-directed mutagenesis of MSIL4 conserved RNA-binding motifs, and in vitro RNA binding assays support the conclusion that the loss of MSIL2 and MISL4 function is responsible for the observed morphological defects. MSIL2/4 interact with proteins associated with mRNA 3'UTR binding and translational regulation.</p>
<p>The authors present compelling biochemical evidence that Mushashi-like2 (MSIL2) and MSIL4 jointly regulate secondary cell wall biosynthesis in the Arabidopsis stem. Quantitative analyses of proteins and transcripts in msil2/4 stems uncovered upregulation of several xylan-related enzymes (despite WT-like RNA levels). Consistent with MALDI-TOF data for released xylan oligosaccharides, the authors propose a model in which MSIL2/4 negatively regulate the translation of GXM (glucuronoxylan methyltransferase), a presumed rate-limiting step. The molecular links between overmethylated xylans and the observed stem defects (which include subtle reductions in lignin and increases beta-glucan polymer distribution) warrants further investigation in future studies. Similarly, as the authors point out, it is intriguing that the loss of the broadly expressed MSIL2/4 genes only significantly affects specific cell types in the stem.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Kairouani et al. investigates the function of a small family of plant RNA binding proteins with similarity to the well-studied Musashi protein in animals, and, therefore, called MUSASHI-LIKE1-4 (MSL1-4). Studies on the biological importance of post-transcriptional control of gene expression via RNA-binding proteins in plants are not numerous, and advances in this important field are much needed. The thorough work presented in this manuscript is such an advance.</p>
<p>The central observations of the paper are:</p>
<p>- Knockout of any MSL gene alone does not produce a phenotype.</p>
<p>
It is of note that basic characterization of knockout mutations is really well done - for example, the authors have taken care to raise specific antibodies to each of the MSL proteins and use them to demonstrate that each of the T-DNA insertion mutants used actually does knock out protein production from the corresponding gene.</p>
<p>- Knockout of MSL2/4 (but no other double mutant) produces a clear leaf phenotype, and a remarkable stem phenotype in which the mutants collapse as they are unable to support upright growth</p>
<p>- The phenotypes of knockout mutants persist in point mutants defective in RNA-binding, indicating that RNA-binding is required for biological activity. Consistent with this, and associate physically with other RNA-binding proteins and translation factors.</p>
<p>- MSL proteins are cytoplasmic</p>
<p>- The msl2/4 mutants present multiple defects in secondary cell wall composition and structure, probably explaining their inability to grow upright. I did not examine the cell wall analyses in detail as I am no specialist in this field.</p>
<p>- Msl2/4 mutants show transcriptomic changes with at large two big categories of differentially expressed genes compared to wild type.</p>
<p>
(1) Genes related to cell wall metabolism</p>
<p>
(2) Genes associated with defense against herbivores and pathogens</p>
<p>- Two of the mRNAs encoding cell wall factors with significant upregulation in msl2/4 mutants compared to wild type also associate physically with MSL4 as judged by RNA-immunoprecipitation-RT-PCR assays, and this physical association is abrogated in the RNA-binding deficient MSL4 mutant.</p>
<p>Altogether, the study shows clear biological relevance of the MSL family of RNA-binding proteins, and provides good arguments that the underlying mechanism is control of mRNAs encoding enzymes involved in secondary cell wall metabolism (although concluding on translational control in the abstract is perhaps saying too much - post-transcriptional control will do given the evidence presented). One observation reported in the study makes it vulnerable to alternative interpretation, however, and I think this should be explicitly treated in the discussion:</p>
<p>The fact that immune responses are switched on in msl2/4 mutants could also mean that MSL2/4 have biological functions unrelated to cell wall metabolism in wild type plants, and that cell wall defects arise solely as an indirect effect of immune activation (that is known to involve changes in expression of many cell wall-modifying enzymes and components such as pectin methylesterases, xyloglucan endotransglycosylases, arabinogalactan proteins etc. Indeed, the literature is rich in examples of gene functions that have been misinterpreted on the basis of knockout studies because constitutive defense activation mediated by immune receptors was not taken into account (see for example Lolle et al., 2017, Cell Host &amp; Microbe 21, 518-529).</p>
<p>With the evidence presented here, I am actually close to being convinced that the primary defect of msl2/msl4 mutants is directly related to altered cell wall metabolism, and that defense responses arise as a consequence of that, not the other way round. But I do not think that the reverse scenario can be formally excluded with the evidence at hand, and a discussion listing arguments in favor of the direct effect proposed here would be appropriate. Elements that the authors could consider to include would be the isolation of a cellulose synthase mutant as a constitutive expressor of jasmonic acid responses (cev1) as a clear example that a primary defect in cell wall metabolism can produce defense activation as secondary effect. The interaction of MSL4 with GXM1/3 mRNAs is also helpful to argue for a direct effect, and it would strengthen the argument if more examples of this kind could be included.</p>
