<abstract>
<p>Fear and defense are among the most fundamental survival behaviors and are profoundly influenced by the social environment in group-living animals. While previous research has largely focused on learned fear paradigms, these approaches fail to capture the complexity of naturalistic threats. It remains poorly understood how social context—and particularly dominance hierarchy, a defining feature of many social species—modulates defensive strategies under ethologically relevant conditions. To address this question, we investigated the social modulation of innate fear in mice exposed to two ethologically relevant threats: a transient visual looming stimulus and a sustained live rat. Pair-housed mice with established dominance ranks were tested alone or with their social partner, and their behaviors were quantitatively analyzed. We found that social presence alleviates threat-induced stress and modulates defensive behaviors in a rank- and threat-specific manner: during looming exposure, it reduces immediate defensive responses and alleviates post-looming anxiety, with dominants showing greater benefit; during rat exposure, it promotes a shift from passive to active defense, again most prominently in dominants. Furthermore, threat exposure reinforces social roles and enhances group cohesion. Together, these findings demonstrate how dominance hierarchy modulates defensive responses to distinct naturalistic threats and, in turn, how threat experience shapes social behavior, providing a framework for probing the neural basis of socially modulated innate fear.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Innate fear of predation has been a powerful driver of the evolution of defensive strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cooper and Blumstein, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lima and Dill, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mobbs et al., 2024</xref>). In group-living species, these responses are further shaped by social context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Evans et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Krause and Ruxton, 2002</xref>). Collective behaviors—such as the circle defense of muskoxen against wolves, the coordinated retreat of meerkats to burrows, mobbing of raptors by smaller birds, and predator-specific alarm calls in primates—demonstrate how social context enhances survival by coordinating individual responses. In humans and other social animals, individuals adjust their fear perception and defensive behaviors based on conspecific cues through mechanisms such as social buffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kikusui et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Qi et al., 2021</xref>), emotional contagion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">de Gelder et al., 2004</xref>), social learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Olsson and Phelps, 2007</xref>), and social appraisal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mumenthaler and Sander, 2012</xref>). Disruptions in these processes increase vulnerability to fear-related disorders, leading to maladaptive fear responses and impaired social functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grammer and Zelikowsky, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ozbay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Top et al., 2016</xref>). Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying the social regulation of fear is therefore crucial for treating these neurological disorders.</p>
<p>Most studies on the social regulation of fear have focused on learned fear paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kikusui et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Morozov and Ito, 2019</xref>). In these paradigms, conspecific presence typically reduces fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Davitz and Mason, 1955</xref>), yet the effect depends on partner identity and emotional state: familiar partners provide stronger buffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kiyokawa et al., 2014</xref>), while frightened partners can diminish or even reverse this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kiyokawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Morozov and Ito, 2019</xref>). While these studies have advanced our understanding of how social cues modulate fear responses, they rely on conditioning and therefore do not capture ethologically relevant threat scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cisek and Green, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dennis et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, innate fear paradigms provide complementary insights into naturalistic defensive responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adolphs, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gross and Canteras, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rosen, 2004</xref>). Because innate fear responses are evolutionarily conserved, their underlying neural mechanisms are likely to generalize across individuals and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Peek and Card, 2016</xref>). Recent work using such paradigms has begun to uncover how social cues regulate defensive behaviors across taxa—including flies, fish, rodents, primates, and humans—with modulation depending on the properties of threats and social cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blanchard and Blanchard, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Coan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Faustino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ferreira et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gutzeit et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Testard et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Vogt et al., 1981</xref>). Despite these advances, how dominance hierarchy—a fundamental organizing principle of many animal societies—regulates defensive behavior, and whether such regulation depends on the nature of the threats, remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>To address these questions, we developed a behavioral paradigm in which pair-housed mice with established dominance hierarchies encountered two distinct naturalistic threats, a transient visual looming stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</xref>) and a sustained live rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kennedy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kunwar et al., 2015</xref>), both alone and with their partners. Social presence alleviates threat-induced stress and modulates defensive strategies in a rank- and threat-dependent manner, attenuating looming-evoked defense while promoting active coping during rat exposure, with the effects more pronounced in dominants. Furthermore, shared threat experience reinforces social roles and strengthens group cohesion. Together, these findings reveal reciprocal interactions between defensive and social behaviors across distinct threat contexts, providing a behavioral framework for future investigations into the neural mechanisms underlying social modulation of innate fear.</p>

<title>A behavioral paradigm to probe dominance-hierarchy modulation of innate defense across distinct threat contexts</title>
<p>To investigate how dominance hierarchy modulates innate defensive responses, we developed a behavioral paradigm that incorporates two ethologically relevant predatory stimuli (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Adult male sibling mice were pair-housed for two weeks to establish stable dominance hierarchies, assessed using the tube test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fan et al., 2019</xref>). Subsequently, they were divided into two cohorts: one exposed to a transient visual looming stimulus that mimics the sudden approach of an aerial predator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</xref>), and the other to a live rat that serves as a sustained threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kennedy et al., 2020</xref>). Before threat exposure, all mice were habituated to the arena. Each mouse was tested both alone and in the presence of their cage mate. Rank stability was reassessed after threat exposure; only one pair showed a rank reversal and was excluded from further analysis.</p>

<p>During habituation, mice primarily engaged in neutral solitary behaviors, with occasional spontaneous freezing (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1B</xref>). When exposed to threats alone, both looming and rat stimuli elicited robust defensive responses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Some behaviors, such as freezing and tail rattling, were common across paradigms, whereas others were threat-specific: escape occurred exclusively during looming exposure, while stretch-attend, approach, investigation, and withdrawal were unique to rat exposure. The presence of a social partner reduced defensive behaviors more than neutral ones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1C</xref>), suggesting an attenuation of fear under social conditions.</p>
<p>To probe the structure underlying these behaviors, we generated their transition maps (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref>). Three patterns emerged. First, threat-specific defensive structures were evident. During looming exposure, freezing typically followed escape, and about one-third of bouts transitioned into rearing, reflecting heightened vigilance after a transient threat. In contrast, during rat exposure, freezing occurred more frequently after withdrawal, and about one-third entered another freezing bout, consistent with sustained, elevated stress levels. Rat exposure also revealed an approach–investigation–withdrawal sequence, indicating an active threat-evaluation strategy. Second, social context modulated transition dynamics, particularly those leading to freezing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1C, S1D</xref>). During looming exposure, post-escape freezing was partially replaced by neutral behavior in paired conditions; during rat exposure, post-withdrawal freezing was partially replaced by social behaviors. These behavioral shifts are consistent with reduced fear levels. Third, the nature of the threat shaped social modulation of behavior: during transient looming threats, huddling and approaching the partner were often followed by grooming the partner, indicative of stress-buffering interactions, whereas during persistent rat exposure, huddling was more often followed by freezing, reflecting heightened and sustained fear. Such threat-specific social modulation was also evident in transitions among defensive, social, and neutral behaviors. Compared to looming exposure, social behaviors were more often followed by defensive behavior during rat exposure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Together, these findings reveal that social context modulates defensive strategies in a threat-specific manner.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Social context attenuates looming-evoked defensive behavior in a rank-dependent manner</title>
<p>Although looming stimuli trigger immediate defensive responses, their impact on behavior and emotional state can persist beyond the initial reaction. To examine how social context modulates the expression and progression of defensive responses, we analyzed behavior in two time windows: an early phase (0–5 s after looming onset) and a late phase (20–60 s after onset), each compared to the pre-looming baseline.</p>
<p>During baseline, mice showed a strong preference for the nest and stayed close to the arena walls when exploring outside, consistent with thigmotaxis in the open-field test (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A, 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2A, S2B</xref>). Looming exposure altered both spatial occupancy and locomotion speed, with distinct effects across the transient and sustained phases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A-2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2B</xref>). In the transient phase, it shifted the distribution of nest occupancy (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001, Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test) and center-zone speed (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001, KS test), reflecting a rapid behavioral change immediately after threat onset. In the sustained phase, looming exposure increased nest occupancy and reduced locomotion speed within the nest (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A-2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2B</xref>), indicative of heightened anxiety. The presence of a social partner increased the locomotion speed in the nest (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2F-G</xref>), suggesting that social interaction attenuates anxiety-related suppression of movement. Notably, nest occupancy remained unchanged (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2C-E</xref>), which may reflect opposing social influences: reduced anxiety could promote exploration outside the nest, whereas social opportunities may motivate them to remain inside (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2H</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To directly assess how social context influences defense, we quantified manually annotated behaviors. During the early phase, looming-evoked behaviors were classified into four decision types: escape (E), escape after assessment (F+E), freezing (F), and no response (N) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E-F</xref>). Social context significantly altered decision patterns in both dominant and subordinate mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), with rank-specific modulation of escape speed and freezing duration. Escape speed was reduced in both groups, with a great reduction in subordinates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), whereas freezing duration was significantly shortened only in dominants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). This reduction in freezing was unlikely due to direct social interruption, as only a small fraction of freezing episodes transitioned to or overlapped with social behaviors (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2I-K</xref>).</p>
<p>Rank-specific effects persisted into the late phase. Under social conditions, stress-induced self-grooming was alleviated only in dominants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2L</xref>). A similar rank-dependent reduction was observed for anxiety-associated rearing and up-stretch behaviors, evident both after looming exposure and during baseline (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these results demonstrate that social context shapes both early and late defensive responses to transient visual threats in a rank-dependent manner, modulating not only the occurrence but also the expression of specific defensive and anxiety-related behaviors.</p>

<title>Social context alleviates sustained predatory stress and fine-tunes defensive strategies across ranks</title>
<p>In natural environments, prey must cope not only with sudden, unpredictable predatory strikes but also with the sustained presence of predators, which imposes prolonged stress and elicits a broader repertoire of defensive behaviors. To investigate how social context modulates such defenses, we developed a rat-exposure paradigm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Following a 5-minute habituation, a live rat was placed in an adjacent perforated, transparent chamber, allowing multisensory cues to reach the mouse for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Mice allocated their time differently across near, middle, and far zones relative to the predator (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A, 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3A-C</xref>), and their locomotion speed peaked in the middle zone when moving toward the far zone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>). These patterns suggest a gradient of perceived risk: highest near the predator, moderate in the middle zone, and lowest in the far zone. Social context increased the locomotion speed in the far zone without altering time allocation (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figures S3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3E</xref>), echoing findings from the looming paradigm and indicating reduced anxiety.</p>

<p>To examine social modulation of specific behaviors, we grouped them into passive defense, active defense, social, and neutral categories (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3E-F</xref>). Social context reshaped the distribution across these categories in both ranks and amplified rank differences (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). This amplification was driven by a greater shift from passive to active defense in dominants under paired conditions(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3I</xref>). Specifically, freezing decreased in both ranks, with a more pronounced reduction in dominants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3F-H</xref>). Approach frequency increased in both ranks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>), while average investigation time—longer in dominants—remained unaffected by social context (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). Together, these results indicate that social context alleviates sustained predator-induced stress while fine-tuning defensive strategies in a rank-dependent manner, paralleling effects observed in the looming assay.</p>

<title>Threat exposure reinforces social roles and promotes cohesive behavior</title>
<p>Having established how social context shapes defensive behaviors toward distinct threats, we next asked the reciprocal effect: how does threat exposure influence social behavior? We quantified both the total time spent on social behaviors and the average duration of social bouts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A-D</xref>). Looming exposure increased both measures only in subordinates, whereas rat exposure affected both ranks, indicating a threat-specific modulation of social behaviors. In particular, during rat exposure, huddling emerged as the predominant social behavior across ranks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), likely serving to reduce individual risk and enhance collective security under sustained threat.</p>

<p>To further examine how threat exposure alters the dynamics of social interaction, we analyzed proactive and reactive behaviors across ranks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Looming exposure increased the proportion of proactive bouts in dominants but decreased it in subordinates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>), with a similar trend during rat exposure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>). Threats also lengthened proactive bouts in subordinates after looming exposure and in both ranks during rat exposure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4L</xref>). Moreover, only during rat exposure, proactive initiations by dominants elicited higher response rates from subordinates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4M</xref>), who in turn exhibited longer reactive social durations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4N</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings indicate that naturalistic threats, particularly sustained predator presence, enhance social engagement in a rank-dependent manner, potentially promoting cohesion and collective coping under threat.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study introduces a behavioral paradigm to investigate how dominance hierarchy shapes innate defensive behaviors under distinct naturalistic threats (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Using both transient looming stimulus and sustained rat exposure, we found that the presence of a social partner alleviates threat-induced stress in both dominant and subordinate mice, while fine-tuning their defensive strategies in a rank- and threat-dependent manner. Under looming threats, dominants showed stronger social modulation, with reduced freezing and faster recovery (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). During sustained rat exposure, social context promoted a shift from passive to active defense, again more prominently in dominants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Threat exposure also shaped social behaviors in a rank-dependent manner: dominants engaged more proactively, while subordinates became more responsive to dominant initiations, potentially reinforcing their social roles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings broaden our understanding of how social context regulates fear responses, which has been largely studied in learned fear paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kikusui et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Morozov and Ito, 2019</xref>). Our finding that conspecific presence reduces fear aligns with previous evidence across species, including zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Faustino et al., 2017</xref>), flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ferreira et al., 2022</xref>), rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bowen et al., 2013</xref>), monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Testard et al., 2024</xref>), and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Coan et al., 2006</xref>). However, the role of social hierarchy in modulating innate fear has remained largely unexplored. Prior work has shown that dominant and subordinate rats behave differently when exposed to a predator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blanchard and Blanchard, 1989</xref>), possibly reflecting the additional stress imposed on subordinates by their hierarchical status (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">Blanchard and Blanchard, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Blanchard et al., 1993</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that dominants investigated predators longer than subordinates when tested alone. Yet the earlier study lacked paired versus single comparisons, leaving the role of social context unresolved. Our work addresses this gap, showing that defensive responses are jointly shaped by threat type and social rank, with an emphasis on survival-critical behaviors rather than fear or stress alone.</p>
<p>This rank-specific regulation likely has adaptive value for group survival. For transient threats, stronger fear reduction in dominants may allow leaders to recover rapidly and guide group decision-making. For sustained threats, the shift of dominants toward active defense mirrors natural patterns in which leaders take on greater risk-assessment responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blanchard and Blanchard, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Davis et al., 2009</xref>). Such role differentiation could enhance group survival by distributing vigilance and risk-taking across the hierarchy. Furthermore, the increase in social interactions following threat exposure likely reflects an evolutionarily conserved coping mechanism that strengthens group cohesion and collective security—a phenomenon observed across multiple species, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Morris et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Preston et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Taylor, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">von Dawans et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>What neural circuits mediate the social modulation of innate defensive behavior? We propose that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) serves as a central hub in this process. Evidence from learned fear paradigms supports a modulatory role of the mPFC: it is densely interconnected with the amygdala and is essential for both the expression and extinction of conditioned fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sotres-Bayon and Quirk, 2010</xref>). Moreover, the mPFC is involved in social behavior and dominance hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kingsbury et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). These findings indicate that the mPFC plays a key role in the social regulation of fear. Indeed, inhibition of the mPFC abolishes social buffering of fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lungwitz et al., 2014</xref>), whereas its activation can reproduce this buffering effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gutzeit et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>By contrast, innate defensive behaviors are mediated by threat-specific subcortical circuits. Defensive responses to visual threats rely on the superior colliculus (SC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Shang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wei et al., 2015</xref>), whereas responses to predator odors or multimodal cues depend on the dorsomedial part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHdm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Silva et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, the SC and VMHdm are not isolated but interconnected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Benavidez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Oh et al., 2014</xref>): the SC projects to VMHdm via distributed relay nodes, including the anterior hypothalamic nuclei (AHN), thalamus, and periaqueductal gray, and VMHdm sends direct projections back to the SC. This bidirectional connectivity positions VMHdm as a key integrator of internal fear state triggered by naturalistic threats. Crucially, VMHdm receives top-down modulation from the mPFC, relayed by the amygdala and AHN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Canteras, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hintiryan et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Silva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Swanson, 2000</xref>). These findings raise the possibility that the mPFC regulates innate defensive behaviors by modulating neural activity in VMHdm and related subcortical circuits. Alternatively, the mPFC may function through parallel, modality-specific pathways. For instance, its direct projections to the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Benavidez et al., 2021</xref>) could selectively influence visually evoked defensive responses. Disentangling these models—convergent modulation of a unified fear state versus parallel control over distinct threat circuits—remains an important goal for future research.</p>
<p>One limitation of our study is the exclusive use of male mice, as the estrous cycles of female mice introduce additional variability that is difficult to control experimentally. Because female rodents show distinct defensive and social patterns under threat compared to males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blanchard et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pentkowski et al., 2018</xref>), extending this paradigm to female mice—with careful control for estrous cycles—will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how hierarchy and social context shape defensive strategies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings reveal that social context does not simply suppress fear but selectively tunes defensive and social behaviors according to both rank and threat type. This adaptive flexibility allows groups to manage risk while maintaining cohesion, paralleling collective coping strategies observed in humans and other animals. By providing a behavioral framework for probing the neural basis of social modulation of innate fear, our work opens new avenues for dissecting the interplay between social and defensive circuits. Given that maladaptive fear and social dysfunction often co-occur in neuropsychiatric disorders, these insights may inform mechanistic models of social-affective dysfunction and inspire new translational approaches.</p>

Paradigm-specific behaviors were also annotated. For the looming exposure paradigm, we annotated up-stretch (extending the body toward the screen with stationary hind limbs), rearing (lifting forelimbs off the ground while facing the screen), and escape (fleeing away from the looming stimulus). For the rat exposure paradigm, we annotated approach (moving toward the rat), investigation (nose contact with the rat cage or remaining within 5 cm), withdrawal (retreating from the rat), and stretch-attend (extending the body toward the rat while stationary). Additionally, in paired conditions, five social behaviors were annotated: approaching partner, sniffing partner (nose-directed investigation of the partner’s face, body, or tail), grooming partner, following partner, and huddling (remaining close to the partner without engaging in other social behaviors).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study presents an interesting behavioral paradigm and reveals interactive effects of social hierarchy and threat type on defensive behaviors. However, addressing the aforementioned points regarding methodological detail, rigor in behavioral classification, depth of result interpretation, and focus of the discussion is essential to strengthen the reliability and impact of the conclusions in a revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper is logically sound, featuring detailed classification and analysis of behaviors, with a focus on behavioral categories and transitions, thereby establishing a relatively robust research framework.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Several points require clarification or further revision.</p>
<p>(1) Methods and Terminology Regarding Social Hierarchy:</p>
<p>The study uses the tube test to determine subordinate status, but the methodological description is quite brief. Please provide a more detailed account of the experimental procedure and the criteria used for determination.</p>
<p>The dominance hierarchy is established based on pairs of mice. However, the use of terms like &quot;group cohesion&quot; - typically applied to larger groups - to describe dyadic interactions seems overstated. Please revise the terminology to more accurately reflect the pairwise experimental setup.</p>
<p>(2) Criteria and Validity of Behavioral Classification:</p>
<p>The criteria for classifying mouse behaviors (e.g., passive defense, active defense) are not sufficiently clear. Please explicitly state the operational definitions and distinguishing features for each behavioral category.</p>
<p>How was the meaningfulness and distinctness of these behavioral categories ensured to avoid overlap? For instance, based on Figure 3E, is &quot;active defense&quot; synonymous with &quot;investigative defense,&quot; involving movement to the near region followed by return to the far region? This requires clearer delineation.</p>
<p>The current analysis focuses on a few core behaviors, while other recorded behaviors appear less relevant. Please clarify the principles for selecting or categorizing all recorded behaviors.</p>
<p>(3) Interpretation of Key Findings and Mechanistic Insights:</p>
<p>Looming exposure increased the proportion of proactive bouts in the dominant zone but decreased it in the subordinate zone (Figure 4G), with a similar trend during rat exposure. Please provide a potential explanation for this consistent pattern. Does this consistency arise from shared neural mechanisms, or do different behavioral strategies converge to produce similar outputs under both threats?</p>
<p>(4) Support for Claims and Study Limitations:</p>
<p>The manuscript states that this work addresses a gap by showing defensive responses are jointly shaped by threat type and social rank, emphasizing survival-critical behaviors over fear or stress alone. However, it is possible that the behavioral differences stem from varying degrees of danger perception rather than purely strategic choices. This warrants a clear description and a deeper discussion to address this possibility.</p>
<p>The Discussion section proposes numerous brain regions potentially involved in fear and social regulation. As this is a behavioral study, the extensive speculation on specific neural circuitry involvement, without supporting neuroscience data, appears insufficiently grounded and somewhat vague. It is recommended to focus the discussion more on the implications of the behavioral findings themselves or to explicitly frame these neural hypotheses as directions for future research.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigate how dominance hierarchy shapes defensive strategies in mice under two naturalistic threats: a transient visual looming stimulus and a sustained live rat. By comparing single versus paired testing, they report that social presence attenuates fear and that dominant and subordinate mice exhibit different patterns of defensive and social behaviors depending on threat type. The work provides a rich behavioral dataset and a potentially useful framework for studying hierarchical modulation of innate fear.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study uses two ecologically meaningful threat paradigms, allowing comparison across transient and sustained threat contexts.</p>
<p>(2) Behavioral quantification is detailed, with manual annotation of multiple behavior types and transition-matrix level analysis.</p>
<p>(3) The comparison of dominant versus subordinate pairs is novel in the context of innate fear.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study examines how dominance hierarchy influences innate defensive behaviors in pair-housed male mice exposed to two types of naturalistic threats: a transient looming stimulus and a sustained live rat. The authors show that social presence reduces fear-related behaviors and promotes active defense, with dominant mice benefiting more prominently. They also demonstrate that threat exposure reinforces social roles and increases group cohesion. The work highlights the bidirectional interaction between social structure and defensive behavior.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study makes a valuable contribution to behavioral neuroscience through its well-designed examination of socially modulated fear. A key strength is the use of two ethologically relevant threat paradigms - a transient looming stimulus and a sustained live predator, enabling a nuanced comparison of defensive behaviors. The experimental design is robust, systematically comparing animals tested alone versus with their cage mate to cleanly isolate social effects. The behavioral analysis is sophisticated, employing detailed transition maps that reveal how social context reshapes behavioral sequences, going beyond simple duration measurements. The finding that social modulation is rank-dependent adds significant depth, linking social hierarchy to adaptive defense strategies. Furthermore, the demonstration that threat exposure reciprocally enhances social cohesion provides a compelling systems-level perspective. Together, these elements establish a strong behavioral framework for future investigations into the neural circuits underlying socially modulated innate fear.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study exhibits several limitations. The neural mechanism proposed is speculative, as the study provides no causal evidence.</p>

<p>Thanks for the comment. We agree that the term “group cohesion” can be misleading and will replace it with “social engagement”.</p>

<p>The criteria for classifying mouse behaviors (e.g., passive defense, active defense) are not sufficiently clear. Please explicitly state the operational definitions and distinguishing features for each behavioral category.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Passive defense was defined as an immobility-based defensive strategy characterized by suppression of locomotor activity. This category included freezing and tail rattling, which in our study involved minimal body displacement aside from rapid tail vibration. Active defense was defined as movement- or posture-dependent defensive strategy, encompassing behaviors that involved locomotor engagement or spatial repositioning relative to the threat, including approach, investigation, withdrawal, and stretch-attend. We will clarify this in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

For instance, based on Figure 3E, is &quot;active defense&quot; synonymous with &quot;investigative defense,&quot; involving movement to the near region followed by return to the far region? This requires clearer delineation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Defensive behaviors in the rat exposure paradigm were grouped into two categories: passive and active defense, each comprising distinct behaviors. All the manually annotated behaviors were mutually exclusive; that is, each video frame was assigned a single behavioral label to avoid overlap across behaviors. Active defense includes four behaviors: approach, investigation, withdrawal, and stretch-attend. We will clarify these points in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The current analysis focuses on a few core behaviors, while other recorded behaviors appear less relevant. Please clarify the principles for selecting or categorizing all recorded behaviors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. In the current study, we focused primarily on defensive and social behaviors. We also included several neutral solitary behaviors related to anxiety and defensive state, such as sniffing, grooming, and rearing, which were consistently expressed across animals and closely linked to our main findings. We will clarify this rationale in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Interpretation of Key Findings and Mechanistic Insights:</p>
<p>Looming exposure increased the proportion of proactive bouts in the dominant zone but decreased it in the subordinate zone (Figure 4G), with a similar trend during rat exposure. Please provide a potential explanation for this consistent pattern. Does this consistency arise from shared neural mechanisms, or do different behavioral strategies converge to produce similar outputs under both threats?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for bringing up this important question. The consistent increase in proactive bouts in dominant mice across both paradigms suggests a consistent rank-dependent reorganization of dyadic interaction under threats. We propose that this convergence reflects a shared neural mechanism that links defensive state with social-rank information, potentially mediated by overlapping hypothalamic and prefrontal circuits. We will expand the Discussion to incorporate this explanation.</p>

<p>(4) Support for Claims and Study Limitations:</p>
<p>The manuscript states that this work addresses a gap by showing defensive responses are jointly shaped by threat type and social rank, emphasizing survival-critical behaviors over fear or stress alone.

This warrants a clear description and a deeper discussion to address this possibility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. We agree that, in principle, behavioral differences could arise from variations in perceived danger rather than strategic choice. In humans, decisions can sometimes reflect value-based strategies that override perceived danger. In contrast, under naturalistic threat conditions, mice likely rely predominantly on danger perception to make behavioral decisions, and such responses are expected to be consistent with value-based strategies shaped by natural selection. In the revised manuscript, we will expand the Discussion to address the role of threat perception and its relationship to decision-making in our behavioral paradigms.</p>
