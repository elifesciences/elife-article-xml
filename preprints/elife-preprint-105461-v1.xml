<title>Abstract</title><p>Disordered proteins and domains often assemble into condensates with polyanionic nucleic acids, primarily via charge complementarity, regulating numerous cellular functions. However, the assembly mechanisms associated with the other abundant and ubiquitous, anionic, stress-response regulating polymer, polyphosphate (polyP), is less understood. Here, we employ the intrinsically disordered DNA binding domain (DBD) of cytidine repressor (CytR) from <italic>E.coli</italic> to study the nature of assembly processes with polyP and DNA. CytR forms metastable liquid-like condensates with polyP and DNA, while undergoing liquid-to-solid transition in the former and solubilizing in the latter. On mutationally engineering the ensemble to exhibit more or less structure and dimensions than the WT, the assembly process with polyP is directed to either condensates with partial time-dependent solubilization or spontaneous aggregation, respectively. On the other hand, the CytR variants form <italic>only</italic> liquid-like but metastable droplets with DNA which solubilize within a few hours. Polyphosphate induces large secondary-structure changes, with two of the mutants adopting polyproline II-like structures within droplets, while DNA has only minimal structural effects. Our findings reveal how polyphosphate can more efficiently discern conformational heterogeneity in the starting protein ensemble, its structure, and compactness, with broad implications in assembly mechanisms involving polyP and stress response in bacterial systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Biomolecular condensates are mesoscale membrane-less structures that facilitate various cellular processes from stress response and signal transduction to RNA processing and chromatin organization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> Physically, condensates are formed by the demixing or phase separation of bio-macromolecules (i.e. proteins, DNA, RNA) into a polymer-rich or a condensed phase and a solvent-rich phase. The phase separation can be driven by homotypic or heterotypic interactions depending on the nature of demixing species, with a host of factors including the concentration and composition of constituent species, specific ions, ionic strength, temperature, and pH governing the transition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> Both folded and disordered regions of proteins can form condensates, with a lot more propensity and prevalence noted in the latter. Biomolecular condensates are also implicated in numerous diseases, and specifically in neurodegenerative disorders, with the condensates or sometimes the dilute phase proposed to seed the formation of aggregates and amyloids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Complex coacervation, wherein oppositely charged macromolecules condense and promote phase transition, is often observed in DNA- and RNA-binding domains that harbor excess positive charges to bind the anionic counterpart.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> However, the role of inorganic polyphosphates (polyP), a series of phosphate units (Pi) linked together via phosphoanhydride bonds (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), in condensate formation and maturation has been less explored. PolyP is a ubiquitous molecule that is produced under stress conditions like oxidative stress, heat shock, nutrition limitation, etc., in all organisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> In fact, the polymer length of polyP and the concentration vary among different species ranging from few tens to thousands, reaching up to 50 mM in bacterial cells under stress conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> Apart from stress response, it has been implicated in numerous processes ranging from modulation of nucleoid structure to biofilm formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> Intriguingly, polyP is able to act both as a chaperone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and promote aggregation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> indicative of more complex underlying mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> which could be protein-specific.</p>

</fig>
<p>Based on the observations above, we pose this question: is polyphosphate more sensitive to the starting conformational ensemble than DNA leading to differential behaviors of promoting aggregation versus acting as a chaperone? If so, and given the poly-anionic nature, does it lead to aggregates or condensates or both? To answer these questions, one needs a system which is also a DBD to enable direct comparison. Second, the DBD should be mutationally tunable to populate native ensembles with different structure, compactness and helicity. Third, the charge composition and their sequence patterning should not be changed across the mutants, as this will naturally affect the binding to polyP. Here, we employ Cytidine repressor DBD (CytR DBD or CytR or CytR wildtype), an intrinsically disordered domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>) that adopts a folded conformation in the presence of DNA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> as a model system to answer these questions. Despite its disordered nature, mutations of different types and at different positions can be introduced into CytR to make it adopt a continuum of conformations, from highly disordered to globally ordered (i.e with a specific three-dimensional structure).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> Specifically, the WT populates a minor excited state which is fully folded (∼8-10%), but otherwise the native ensemble is disordered, with marginal helicity and a Stokes radius of 19.5 Å (green in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> One of the mutants we consider is the double mutant of CytR (A29V/A48M; DM) which displays the properties of a fully folded compact domain driven by the enhanced hydrophobicity of the side-chains at positions 29 and 48; these two mutations act synergistically to switch the ensemble from being disordered to fully ordered as shown earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> The DM therefore displays a higher helicity and lower Stokes radius of 17 Å, compared to the WT (blue in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). The other mutant is P33A in which the minor folded state population is eliminated because of the enhanced flexibility of alanine in the place of proline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> The P33A mutant is nearly fully disordered as evidenced by the Stokes radius of 21.5 Å, and minimum helicity (red in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, because CytR has an excess charge of +9 and a large positive electrostatic potential in its folded conformation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>), it binds non-specifically to DNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> We therefore hypothesize that CytR should bind to any negatively charged polymer driven purely by electrostatic complementarity. In this work, we employ CytR WT and two mutants of CytR that exhibit diametrically opposing conformational preferences but identical charge composition and two anionic polymers (polyP and DNA), to understand the extent to which the starting ensemble (and hence the density of charges and stability or structure) dictates the nature of macromolecular assemblies and their maturation properties (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). We find that the starting conformational ensemble is uniquely recognized by polyphosphate leading to diverse outcomes including metastable condensates, aggregates and time-dependent dissolution.</p>

<title>Time-dependent scattering (OD) and Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence measurements</title>
<p>Different concentrations of CytR WT were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized protein in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7 (43 mM ionic strength) buffer. To generate the phase diagram, the scattering intensity (optical density) was recorded at 350 nm at protein concentrations of 5, 25, 55, 90, and 120 µM, and at different polyP concentrations of 3, 6, 11, 22, 41, and 100 µM. The measurements were acquired for 24 hours at 7-minute intervals in a microplate reader (Agilent BioTek Synergy H1) at 298 K. The sample volume in each well was 200 <italic>μ</italic>l. Further studies employed 90 µM protein (WT and mutants) and 22 µM polyP, unless mentioned otherwise. For the time-dependent studies recording both scattering and fluorescence, a 5 µM ThT (Sigma-Aldrich) was also added to the protein and polyP mixture; the wells were also excited at 442 nm, and the fluorescence intensity recorded at an emission wavelength of 485 nm. Ionic strength dependent experiments were carried out at 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (43 mM effective ionic strength) with the addition of NaCl for a final ionic strength values spanning 60 - 200 mM. The OD values are reported directly from the plate reader without correction for pathlength which is 5 mm in this experiment.</p>
<p>For the scattering measurements in the presence of DNA, a range of CytR WT concentrations (2 – 100 µM) were used, and measurements were acquired with 1 µM of 45-bp dsDNA (5’ TGGTGGGTAAATTTATGCAACGCATTTGCGTCATGGTGATGAGTA 3’). Further studies with DNA were done at 25 µM protein (WT and mutants) concentration.</p>

<title>NHS-rhodamine labeling</title>
<p>NHS-rhodamine (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) was dissolved in DMSO, and protein was dissolved in conjugation buffer at pH 7.4 (as per manufacturer’s protocol). The protein solution was added to 5X – 7X molar excess of dye and incubated at 25 °C for 2 hours at mild shaking conditions in dark. The excess dye was removed by desalting using a 26/10 HiPrep desalting column (Cytiva). The labeled protein was eluted in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.</p>

<title>Flow chamber preparation for imaging experiments</title>
<p>Imaging experiments were done using 22 mm coverslips and glass slides (Blue Star, India). Coverslips and glass slides were kept in Piranha solution (3:1 v/v sulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide) for 30 minutes and then washed thoroughly with MilliQ water. The slides and coverslips were then air-dried and wiped with absolute ethanol. Clean slides and coverslips were used to prepare flow chambers to observe the condensate formation. To prepare the flow chamber, the double-stick tape was sandwiched between the glass slide and coverslip. The chamber was then sealed from three sides to avoid sample leakage.</p>

<title>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)</title>
<p>For FRAP experiments, 10% and 5% of labeled protein were used for polyP and DNA studies, respectively. Anti-fading cocktail was added to the protein sample to prevent the passive photobleaching. The samples were loaded into the flow chamber at different time points (0, 30, and 60 min), and the experiment was performed in an Olympus Fluoview FV3000 confocal microscope with a 100X/1.45 NA oil immersion objective. A 561 nm laser was used to visualize and bleach (with 100% laser power) the condensates at the center. Fluorescence intensity was acquired for five different regions of interest (ROIs) with the same diameter; ROI-1 for the actual bleaching region, ROI-2 for the neighboring condensate for passive bleaching correction and ROI-3,4 and 5 outside the condensates to record background intensity for background correction.

<title>CytR WT and DM form condensates with polyphosphate while P33A aggregates</title>
<p>Inorganic polyP<sub>45</sub>, i.e. polyphosphate with 45 Pi units and with a net-charge of -47, is employed in our studies and is referred to as polyP in the text below. We explored a range of solution conditions involving two-component mixtures of WT and polyP ([polyP] of 3 - 100 <italic>μ</italic>M and [WT] of 5 – 125 <italic>μ</italic>M at 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7 and 298 K) to map the phase diagram (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Solutions containing [WT]&gt;25 <italic>μ</italic>M and [polyP]&gt;10 <italic>μ</italic>M consistently showed higher turbidity (turbidity at 350 nm). We therefore chose [polyP] of 22 <italic>μ</italic>M for further experiments. DIC (differential interference contrast) microscopy reveals droplet-shaped condensates with a diameter of ∼1-4 microns on average (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>; also <italic>vide infra</italic>), which is also confirmed by fluorescence microscopy of NHS-rhodamine-labeled protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The number of droplets increase with increasing [WT] in the range between 25 – 90 <italic>μ</italic>M consistent with OD measurements (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). These observations establish that the WT CytR undergoes phase-separation into condensates with polyP, and that turbidity can be employed as a reasonable proxy for phase separation in this system.</p>

<p>Given that CytR carries a large excess positive charge (+9) and polyP is an anionic polymer with no structural preference (unlike DNA), the interaction and the resultant assembly process is expected to be driven by non-specific electrostatic interactions. To test this, we use a [WT]:[polyP] of 90:22 <italic>μ</italic>M and measure OD as a function of ionic strength at pH 7. The OD is observed to be independent of ionic strength till ∼80 mM following which it linearly decreases with near-zero turbidity at 200 mM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Under physiological ionic strength conditions of 150-160 mM, the OD value is still ∼0.6 and with droplets evident in fluorescence microscopy (Figure S1).</p>
<p>The double mutant (DM) which is folded and compact, also undergoes spontaneous phase separation at the same concentrations as the WT when mixed with polyP, while the P33A mutant aggregates on addition of polyP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). The fluorescence of the NHS-rhodamine-labeled WT and DM recover on photobleaching highlighting the liquid-like nature of the condensates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Specifically, the WT displays a maximal recovery of ∼92% at 90 seconds (recovery half-time, <italic>t</italic><sub>#/%</sub> = 6.0 ± 2.5 seconds), and the DM recovers to ∼87% (<italic>t</italic><sub>#/%</sub> = 5.2 ± 1.3 seconds) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). We also observe multiple coalescence and de-coalescence events in both the proteins at the earliest times (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>, Supporting Movies S1 and S2).</p>
<p>Taken together, the fully unfolded variant of CytR (P33A) forms aggregates and the variants with more ‘folded-like’ states undergo phase separation with polyP. These results indicate that charge-composition and patterning alone do not determine the phase separation tendencies in this system. They underscore the importance of the starting ensemble, and potentially the population of partially structured substates, in determining the nature of assembly process observed.</p>

<title>Maturation of polyphosphate-induced assemblies</title>
<p>We carried out time dependent studies in the presence of thioflavin T (ThT) enabling simultaneous measurement of OD and fluorescence in the same sample. The OD of WT-polyP mixtures show a strong time dependence with the OD decreasing from 1.2 to less than 0.9 in the first 10 minutes, but with little increase in ThT fluorescence (left panel in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). However, the ThT fluorescence starts to increase in a sigmoidal fashion from 20 minutes. The OD, on the other hand, drops to a value of 0.75 at ∼30 minutes following which it increases and stabilizes at a value of ∼1. The WT-polyP mixture therefore forms condensates and matures into aggregates within 3 hours which is directly observable in microscopy images (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), mirroring reports in numerous other systems that undergo droplet formation followed by a liquid-to-solid phase transition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> Control experiments with protein alone did not reveal any changes in turbidity or aggregation in the entire 24-hour duration (Figure S2), pointing to a process entirely driven by polyP-protein interactions.</p>

<p>The OD of the DM-polyP mixture exhibits a similar decrease in OD starting from a value of ∼1, but this trend extends beyond 3 hours, with the OD dropping to a value of ∼0.1 at the longest time points (middle panel in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We do observe a marginal increase in ThT fluorescence after 2 hours, but the increase is not as significant as the WT. These observations point to a scenario wherein the DM forms condensates to start with, but which slowly solubilize with time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). On the other hand, the P33A mutant forms only aggregates as evidenced by the high OD and high ThT fluorescence across all time-points in the 24-hour observation window (right panel in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, Figure S3). FRAP experiments follow the trends reported in OD-fluorescence measurements. In the WT, the recovery amplitude decreases from 0.92±0.11 at the zeroth minute to just 0.43±0.04 at 60 minutes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). The FRAP <italic>t</italic><sub>#/%</sub>, however, drops to shorter times at <italic>t</italic> = 60 minutes indicating that there is small sub-set of fast-moving molecules (i.e. a small percentage of mobile fraction) contributing to the rapid recovery (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Alternately, the DM-polyP condensates recover near fully even at the first hour, with the recovery time slowing time by a factor of 2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>).</p>
<p>We further quantified the dimensions of the droplets from the microscopy images at three different time-points: 0, 30 and 60 minutes. At <italic>t</italic> = 0 and for the WT-polyP condensates, the mean droplet dimensions are of the order of 2.7 microns, but with a heavy right tail spanning nearly 8 microns. This tail is diminished at <italic>t</italic> = 30 minutes, reducing the overall dimensions of droplets (∼2.4 microns) and their number (smaller area under the curve in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). The DM displays a behavior which is the exact opposite (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>): at <italic>t</italic> = 0 the mean dimensions of the condensates are 2.1 microns with no heavy right tail; larger droplets appear at <italic>t</italic> = 30 minutes contributing to the appearance of the heavy right tail and with the mean droplet size increasing to 3.3 microns.

<title>Structural changes within the condensates span over three hours</title>
<p>The differential behavior of the three variants raise questions on the nature of structural changes upon condensate formation and maturation. The WT CD spectrum in the dilute phase (i.e. in the absence of polyP) is characterized by minima at 202 and 222 nm with ∼17% of residual helical content (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Upon formation of condensates, the spectral shape shifts substantially to one with a minimum at 230 nm and with no spectral features at wavelength &lt;215 nm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), demonstrating that the WT adopts a non-helical and potentially an unfolded conformation in the condensed phase at initial times. The spectrum of DM is more representative of a folded protein with minima at both 208 and 222 nm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), and with the signal at 222 nm indicative of a protein with nearly 30% helical content. On mixing with polyP, the spectral shift resembles that of the WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), again signaling a structural change in the condensed phase. The P33A mutant which is more unfolded (helicity ∼10%), however, exhibits a more intense spectrum with a minimum 225 nm which is representative of <italic>β</italic>-sheet like structures (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; see below). These differences are more evident when the signal at 222 nm are plotted as a function of time: the WT and P33A mutant exhibit a trend quite different from that of the DM, with the latter acquiring structure with time despite unfolding on adding polyP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Since the spectra measured with polyP are an effective average of structural signatures from both the condensed- and dilute-phases and of different secondary-structure types, the spectral shapes cannot be directly interpreted. To extract structural signatures and the associated trends, we perform a global singular value decomposition (SVD) of the spectral time series of the three variants. The first two components contribute 92% of the overall signal change (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Of this, the first component is the spectrum of an <italic>α</italic>-helix with clear minimum at 222 nm and another at 208 nm, and accounts for 71% of the signal change. The amplitude of this component decreases with time in the WT and P33A variant, implying that helical conformations are less favored in their assemblies; this feature also signals the population of an alternate structural form which is observable in the second component (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). In the DM, the amplitude of the helical component increases with time as expected when the droplet solubilizes due to preferential transport into the dilute phase. However, the helical content recovers to just ∼15% at 4 hours (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), conceivably due to non-specific interaction with polyP resulting in partially structured states or due to a small fraction of oligomers.</p>
<p>The second component, accounting for 21% of the signal change, bears the features of polyproline II structures in unfolded conformations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> with a maximum at 231 nm and a minimum at 207 nm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). There is a marginal increase in the amplitude of this component in the WT in the first hour following which it stabilizes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). The amplitude of this component increases in the DM continuously even at 4 hours indicating a tussle between the helical and polyproline II-like structures (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Since the droplets are fully solubilized at 4 hours and by which time the ThT fluorescence starts to marginally increase, it is likely that smaller-sized aggregates (as the contribution of this component is only 20% of the overall change) coexist with folded, and partially structured helical conformations in the DM-polyP mixtures at longer times. In the P33A variant, the amplitude of second component has a negative sign and when multiplied with the second component (required for reconstructing the original spectra) points to a strong contribution from <italic>β</italic>-turn or polyproline I conformations, mixed with <italic>β</italic>-sheet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> This is further confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy on P33A wherein a strong absorbance band is evident in the wavenumbers 1610 – 1630 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which is absent in both the WT and DM at <italic>t</italic> = 0 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4J</xref>). At <italic>t</italic> = 60 minutes, the relative intensity of this band increases in the WT and P33A, while no change in spectral shape is evident for the DM.</p>
<p>In summary, we find that both the WT and the DM ‘unfold’ on forming condensates with polyP, with polyproline II-rich structures observed at longer times (∼1-2 hours) in both the mixtures. The condensates thus formed are metastable, either undergoing a liquid-to-solid transition as in the WT or partially solubilizing with time as in the DM. The starting ensemble thus determines the extent of metastability and the maturation of condensates, and not just the nature of assemblies formed.</p>

<p>The time-dependent properties of the condensates with DNA again differ from those of polyP: the condensates solubilize within 90 minutes in both the WT and DM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5I</xref>), while taking nearly 3 hours for the P33A variant (Figure S4). Numerous droplets with a mean size of 1.6 <italic>μ</italic>m form within the first few minutes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>), which coalesce to form larger droplets of size 2-3 <italic>μ</italic>M, following which they solubilize. The FRAP <italic>t</italic><sub>#/%</sub>increases by a factor of two at 60 minutes compared to the initial time point (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>), and a very slow phase is also observed at 60 minutes, indicating ∼20% immobile fraction. In fact, we interestingly find that OD is less sensitive to droplet formation with DNA, as we do observe few droplets even at 3 hours, a timepoint at which the OD is effectively zero (Figure S4). Both the DM and P33A mutants recover fully (amplitudes ∼1) and with similar half-times compared to the WT at 60 minutes (Figure S5). To rule out the possibility of concentration differences (22 µM for polyP and 1 µM for DNA) contributing to the observed diverse behavior across the two anionic polymers, we carried out a set of control experiments at 11.2 µM DNA, a concentration at which the number of negative charges are equivalent to that of 22 µM polyP. However, the trends were identical to that observed at lower DNA concentration (Figure S6), further underscoring that the differences in chemical and conformational properties of the anionic polymers contribute to the diverse assembly behaviors.</p>
<p>None of the three proteins ‘unfold’ in the DNA-driven condensates; there is a marginal reduction (i.e. the signal becomes less negative) in the far-UV CD signal at <italic>t</italic> = 0 following which it quickly recovers to reach a value near that of the CD signal in the absence of DNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5L</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5M</xref>). The absence of large structural change or ageing into an aggregate with time is also evident in FTIR spectra which do not change significantly (Figure S7). The WT, however, does display 50% less negative signal at ∼202-204 nm which shifts to longer wavelength after the first hour (blue and green spectra in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5L</xref>), indicating helical structure acquisition and mirroring earlier reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> At higher DNA concentrations as used in the current study, this structural shift appears to be offset by unfolding in other regions likely through non-specific interactions. This leads to little signal change at 222 nm – note that this shift is not observable in the two mutants – and thus requiring detailed atomic-level studies to discern the subtle structural modulations induced by DNA at longer times.</p>
<p>To further test the lack of sensitivity of DNA to the starting conformational ensemble, we carried out a similar time-dependent experiment with polyP and DNA, but with the folded DBD of FruR (fructose repressor; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) and the molten-globular variant Y19A FruR (see Supporting Information for Review). PolyP spontaneously induces aggregation in FruR, while the molten-globular variant forms condensates but only at the earliest times (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). The intensity of ThT fluorescence protein-polyP mixture increases with time indicating that polyP induces a time-dependent enhanced aggregation of FruR, while the FruR Y19A:polyP mixture undergoes a rapid liquid-to-solid transition within the first 20 minutes (Figure S8). As with the CytR WT, the change in turbidity on aggregation happens earlier than the increase in ThT fluorescence (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). DNA, however, does not discriminate between the folded and the molten-globular variant and there is no change in turbidity with time (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>), further underscoring the discriminatory power of polyP.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Phase separation of disordered CytR with the anionic polyphosphate is quite robust to solution conditions. However, when the native ensemble is perturbed via mutations to result in more order (DM) or less order (P33A) relative to the WT, polyP induces either phase separation or aggregation, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The time-dependent behavior is markedly diverse with liquid-to-solid transition, partial solubilization and enhanced aggregation in CytR, DM and P33A, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The trends are consistent across the different experimental protocols employed including turbidity-fluorescence experiments, fluorescence microscopy, far-UV CD and FTIR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). On the other hand, DNA is unable to distinguish between the different degrees of structural order in the native ensemble of CytR variants, forming only metastable condensates that solubilize with time (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). PolyP is also able to discriminate between the molten-globular variant of FruR (Y19A mutant) and the folded wild-type protein, while DNA does not (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
<p>The driving force for the different assembly processes is expected to have a strong contribution from the strength of intermolecular charge-charge interactions, the relative entropic penalty for inducing a conformational change in polyP versus that in the protein, release of counterions and restructuring of water. The balance between these different enthalpic-entropic terms results in condensates being more kinetically accessible phase but which are inherently metastable (as in the CytR WT, DM and FruR Y19A), as a strong time dependence is visibly observable even in the first few minutes. With time, they access the globally stable phase which is either the partially solubilized condensate or the more aggregated phase, conditions at which the chemical potential of the different constituent molecules equalize across the phases. Detailed molecular simulations that capture the relative experimental trends observed across the mutants are required to extract the contributions of each of the energetic and entropic terms.</p>
<p>Our observations thus establish that polyP efficiently discriminates the conformational features of proteins than DNA, contributing to the diverse outcomes. PolyP is expected to be highly flexible owing to its relatively simple chemical structure with only phosphoanhydride bonds that link adjacent units which are highly polar, while DNA has bulkier sugar and the apolar bases that limit its flexibility. It is therefore possible that polyP, owing to its flexibility, is able to wrap around the protein surface or even induce structural changes in proteins in a distinct manner depending on the nature of the starting ensemble. Strong evidence for the latter comes from our far-UV CD studies wherein we find that the helical signature of the CytR variants is fully lost on adding polyP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Our results are consistent with previous observations of structural changes and ‘unfolding’ of proteins within condensates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> We additionally show that polyproline-II-like conformations are more probable within condensates formed by the CytR WT and the DM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). One other observation that stands out is that the ThT fluorescence increases upon aggregation at a later time point than the changes in OD that happens earlier in both the CytR WT and DM. In other words, solubilization of the droplet is likely happens even in the WT until about 30 minutes (the number of larger droplets also reduce in frequency; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>) following which it aggregates.</p>
<p>The large charge density associated with polyphosphates and their natural abundance makes them prime candidates for inducing phase separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> through complex coacervation with proteins rich in basic amino acids. In fact, most DBDs which are typically associated with transcription factors are rich in basic amino acids. This opens up a fascinating possibility where polyP and DNA could compete with transcription factors or work together forming ternary condensates regulating gene expression, as shown in studies on the bacterial protein Hfq.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Taken together with our results on CytR, caution needs to be exercised in interpreting in-cell microscopy results, as it is possible that polyP is involved in condensates, especially when proteins of interest are rich in basic residues. Finally, the full length CytR plays an important role in transcription regulation of genes involved in stress response, including critical roles in nucleoside catabolism, context-dependent activation or repression, and pathogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> CytR also binds to the promotor region of the rpoH gene and represses transcription, thus regulating the expression of σ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> – an RNA polymerase subunit essential for the transcription of heat shock proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> Given the results of the current work and since polyP concentrations rise significantly in stressed cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> it is tempting to speculate that polyP interacts with CytR to form condensates and sequesters it, thus promoting σ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> transcription. Studies on CytR combining other stress response regulators, specifically with the nucleoid-associated sensory protein H-NS, with DNA and polyP could unravel hitherto unexplored mechanisms regulating the nuanced gene expression patterns in enterobacteria.</p>

<p>This manuscript offers <bold>important</bold> insights into how polyphosphate (polyP) influences protein phase separation differently from DNA. The authors present <bold>compelling</bold> evidence that polyP distinguishes between protein conformational states, leading to diverse condensate behaviors. However, differences in charge density between polyP and DNA complicate direct comparisons, and the extent to which polyP-driven phase transitions reveal initial protein states remains unclear. Addressing these concerns would strengthen the manuscript's impact for researchers interested in biomolecular condensates, protein dynamics, and stress response mechanisms.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the article titled &quot;Polyphosphate discriminates protein conformational ensembles more efficiently than DNA promoting diverse assembly and maturation behaviors,&quot; Goyal and colleagues investigate the role of negatively charged biopolymers, i.e., polyphosphate (polyP) and DNA, play in phase separation of cytidine repressor (CytR) and fructose repressor (FruR). The authors find that both negative polymers drive the formation of metastable protein/polymer condensates. However, polyP-driven condensates form more gel- or solid-like structures over time while DNA-driven condensates tend to dissipate over time. The authors link this disparate condensate behavior to polyP-induced structures within the enzymes. Specifically, they observe the formation of polyproline II-like structures within two tested enzyme variants in the presence of polyP. Together their results provide a unique insight into the physical and structural mechanism by which two unique negatively charged polymers can induce distinct phase transitions with the same protein. This study will be a welcomed addition to the condensate field and provide new molecular insights into how binding partner-induced structural changes within a given protein can affect the mesoscale behavior of condensates. The concerns outlined below are meant to strengthen the manuscript.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Throughout the article, the authors used the correct techniques to probe physical changes within proteins that can be directly linked to phase transition behaviors. Their rigorous experiments create a clear picture of what occurs at the molecular level with CytR and FruR are exposed to either DNA or polyP, which are unique, highly negatively charged biopolymers found within bacteria. This work provides a new view of mechanisms by which bacteria can regulate the cytoplasmic organization upon the induction of stress. Furthermore, this is likely applicable to mammalian and plant cells and likely to numerous proteins that undergo condensation with nucleic acids and other charged biopolymers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The biggest weakness of this study is that compares the phase behavior of enzymes driven by negatively charged polymers that have intrinsic differences in net charge and charge density. Because these properties are extremely important for controlling phase separation, any differences may result in the observed phase transitions driven by DNA and polyP. The authors should perform an additional experiment to control for these differences as best they can. The results from these experiments will provide additional insight into the importance of charge-based properties for controlling phase transitions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Goyal et al demonstrate that the assembly of proteins with polyphosphate into either condensates or aggregates can reveal information on the initial protein ensemble.

<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript offers important insights into how polyphosphate (polyP) influences protein phase separation differently from DNA. The authors present compelling evidence that polyP distinguishes between protein conformational states, leading to diverse condensate behaviors. However, differences in charge density between polyP and DNA complicate direct comparisons, and the extent to which polyP-driven phase transitions reveal initial protein states remains unclear. Addressing these concerns would strengthen the manuscript's impact for researchers interested in biomolecular condensates, protein dynamics, and stress response mechanisms.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the editorial team for the favorable assessment. We, however, contend the specific point on the difference in charge density. We have already performed experiments wherein a higher concentration of DNA is used to match the overall ‘concentration of charges’ as in the experiments with polyP (see Figure S6), and we do not identify or observe any differences in the maturation behavior with DNA, i.e. we see only dissolution at both higher and lower concentrations of DNA. Charge density (i.e. the number of charges per unit volume of the polymer), on the other hand, is an intrinsic feature of the polymer which is naturally different between DNA and polyP. In fact, the primary result of our work is our observation that polyP can discern the starting ensembles more efficiently, likely through actively engaging and interacting with the ensemble while DNA appears to be a passive player.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the article titled &quot;Polyphosphate discriminates protein conformational ensembles more efficiently than DNA promoting diverse assembly and maturation behaviors,&quot; Goyal and colleagues investigate the role of negatively charged biopolymers, i.e., polyphosphate (polyP) and DNA, play in phase separation of cytidine repressor (CytR) and fructose repressor (FruR). The authors find that both negative polymers drive the formation of metastable protein/polymer condensates. However, polyPdriven condensates form more gel- or solid-like structures over time while DNA-driven condensates tend to dissipate over time. The authors link this disparate condensate behavior to polyP-induced structures within the enzymes. Specifically, they observe the formation of polyproline II-like structures within two tested enzyme variants in the presence of polyP. Together their results provide a unique insight into the physical and structural mechanism by which two unique negatively charged polymers can induce distinct phase transitions with the same protein. This study will be a welcomed addition to the condensate field and provide new molecular insights into how binding partner-induced structural changes within a given protein can affect the mesoscale behavior of condensates. The concerns outlined below are meant to strengthen the manuscript.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Throughout the article, the authors used the correct techniques to probe physical changes within proteins that can be directly linked to phase transition behaviors. Their rigorous experiments create a clear picture of what occurs at the molecular level with CytR and FruR are exposed to either DNA or polyP, which are unique, highly negatively charged biopolymers found within bacteria. This work provides a new view of mechanisms by which bacteria can regulate the cytoplasmic organization upon the induction of stress. Furthermore, this is likely applicable to mammalian and plant cells and likely to numerous proteins that undergo condensation with nucleic acids and other charged biopolymers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The biggest weakness of this study is that compares the phase behavior of enzymes driven by negatively charged polymers that have intrinsic differences in net charge and charge density. Because these properties are extremely important for controlling phase separation, any differences may result in the observed phase transitions driven by DNA and polyP. The authors should perform an additional experiment to control for these differences as best they can. The results from these experiments will provide additional insight into the importance of charge-based properties for controlling phase transitions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for providing a positive review of our work. On the comment related to the final paragraph, we note that we have already conducted an experiment with a higher DNA concentration (11.24 µM) to explore if the concentration of charges plays any significant role. The results of this experiment are presented in Figure S6. We observe that even at a higher DNA concentration, the condensates dissolve over time. Therefore, the difference in the maturation behavior of condensates with varying initial protein ensembles is due to the nature of polyP (likely through its enhanced flexibility).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Goyal et al demonstrate that the assembly of proteins with polyphosphate into either condensates or aggregates can reveal information on the initial protein ensemble. They show that, unlike DNA, polyphosphate is able to effectively discriminate against initial protein ensembles with different conformational heterogeneity, structure, and compactness. The authors further show that the protein native ensemble is vital on whether polyphosphate induces phase separation or aggregation, whereas DNA induces a similar outcome regardless of the initial protein ensemble. This work provides a way to improve our mechanistic understanding of how conformational transitions of proteins may regulate or drive LLPS condensate and aggregate assemblies within biological systems.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a thoroughly conducted study that provides an alternative route for inducing phase separation that is more informative on the initial protein ensemble involved. This is particularly useful and a complementary means to investigate the role played by protein dynamics and plasticity in phase transitions. The authors use an appropriate set of techniques to investigate unique phase transitions within proteins induced by polyphosphates. An alternative protein system is used to corroborate their findings that the unique assemblies induced by polyphosphates when compared to DNA are not restricted to a single system.

<p>We thank the reviewer for providing constructive comments on our work. On the final paragraph: we agree that the outcome does not provide information on nature of the starting ensemble. As of now, our experimental results are primarily observations on questions related to maturation outcomes when protein ensembles of varying structure, compactness and stability interact with polyP. if there are differences in the native ensemble due to mutations (which at times cannot be revealed by ensemble probes), polyP appears to discern it more efficiently than DNA.</p>
