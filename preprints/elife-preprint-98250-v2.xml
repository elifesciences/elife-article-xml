<abstract>
<p>Specialized chemosensory signals elicit innate social behaviors in individuals of several vertebrate species, a process that is mediated via the accessory olfactory system (AOS). The AOS comprising the peripheral sensory vomeronasal organ has evolved elaborate molecular and cellular mechanisms to detect chemo signals. To gain insight into the cell types, developmental gene expression patterns and functional differences amongst neurons, we performed single cell transcriptomics of the mouse vomeronasal sensory epithelium. Our analysis reveals diverse cell types with gene expression patterns specific to each, which we made available as a searchable web resource accessed from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scvnoexplorer.com">www.scvnoexplorer.com</ext-link>. Pseudo-time developmental analysis indicates that neurons originating from common progenitors diverge in their gene expression during maturation with transient and persistent transcription factor expression at critical branch points. Comparative analysis across two of the major neuronal subtypes that express divergent GPCR families and the G-protein subunits Gnai2 or Gnao1, reveals significantly higher expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associated genes within Gnao1 neurons. In addition, differences in ER content and prevalence of cubic membrane ER ultrastructure revealed by electron microscopy, indicate fundamental differences in ER function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Vomeronasal organ (VNO), part of the vertebrate accessory olfactory system, is a major pheromone sensing organ, that is thought to be specialized to evoke innate social behaviors in mammals. The rodent VNO neuroepithelium consists of two major neuronal subtypes, that are defined primarily based on the expression of two distinct families of G- protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their associated G protein alpha subunit: vomeronasal type-I GPCRs (V1R) with G⍺i2 subunit (Gnai2) neurons or vomeronasal type-2 GPCRs (V2R) with G⍺o subunit (Gnao1) neurons. V1R and V2R expressing neurons are spatially segregated within the neuroepithelium, project to distinct locations in the accessory olfactory bulb along the anterior-posterior axis. Functional evidence suggests that V1R and V2R neurons may recognize ligands that mediate different behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chamero <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Oboti <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Trouillet <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pallé <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). However, we currently lack a comprehensive mapping of receptor-ligand interactions and how these lead to distinct behaviors. Cognate ligand binding in both Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons, is thought to signal via the phospholipase-c pathway which results in the activation of the VNO specific cation channel, Trpc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Liman, Corey and Dulac, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Stowers <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zufall, 2005</xref>)</p>
<p>In the main olfactory epithelium (MOE), neurons regenerate throughout life, continuously differentiating from a stem cell population into neurons and supporting cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fletcher <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Neuronal differentiation is also associated with the expression of a single GPCR to the exclusion of many others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hanchate <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tan, Li and Xie, 2015</xref>), leading to the hallmark feature termed as “one neuron one receptor” (ONOR) rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Malnic <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Serizawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">2003</xref>). VNO sensory neurons (VSNs) also continuously regenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barber and Raisman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wilson and Raisman, 1980</xref>) from a stem cell population, and differentiating cells take on the identity of supporting cells and mature neurons of either the Gnao1 or Gnai2 sub-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Katreddi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). While Gnai2 neurons seem to largely follow the ONOR rule in expressing one V1R gene per neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Serizawa, Miyamichi and Sakano, 2004</xref>), Gnao1 neurons seemingly deviate from this rule by co-expressing a combination of GPCRs. Thus, each Gnao1 neuron expresses a single V2R gene from the ABD family as well as a member of the C family V2R genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Martini <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Silvotti <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ishii and Mombaerts, 2011</xref>). In addition, further molecular diversification of Gnao1 neurons occurs due to combinatorial co-expression of a family of non-classical Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes, H2-M<italic>v</italic>, that are co-expressed along with V2Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ishii, Hirota and Mombaerts, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Loconto <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ishii and Mombaerts, 2008</xref>). A few combinations of V2R and H2-M<italic>v</italic> expression have been identified, indicating that these co-expression patterns are non-random and could be functionally important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Martini <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ishii, Hirota and Mombaerts, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Loconto <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Silvotti <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ishii and Mombaerts, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2011</xref>). However, identifying the precise combinatorial expressions of V2R-ABD, V2R-C and H2-M<italic>v</italic> has been elusive, partly due to the challenges in generating RNA or antibody reagents to identify closely homologous genes, combined with the challenges with multiplexing more than three targets.</p>
<p>Starting with a common progenitor population, how do cells of the VNO sensory epithelium diversify in their gene expression patterns that define the sensory neuron types? Recent studies using single cell transcriptomic analysis have implicated Notch signaling along with downstream transcription factors, Tfap2e, Bcl11b to play a role in specifying the fates of developing VSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Enomoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Katreddi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). As the progenitor cells differentiate to mature neurons, transcriptional reprogramming downstream to Notch signaling leads to distinct neuronal populations: Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons. While these studies identified transcription factors, it is not clear whether the two major differentiated VSN subtypes expressing Gnao1-V2Rs or Gnai2-V1Rs fundamentally differ in their cellular properties.</p>
<p>Here we applied a multilevel transcriptomics approach which bundles single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) validated by low-level spatial transcriptomics to characterize gene expression of the mouse VNO sensory epithelium. Our results identified genes specifically expressed in sensory, non-sensory cell types and the divergence of gene expression between Gnao1 - Gnai2 neurons at different maturation stages. Analysis of mature neurons provided a comprehensive picture of specific co-expression patterns of VR and H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes. Surprisingly, mature Gnao1 neurons revealed a significant enrichment of endoplasmic reticulum related gene transcripts and proteins, which is indicative of a fundamental divergence in cellular function between these cell types. Electron microscopy further revealed a hypertrophic ER ultrastructure consisting of gyroid cubic membrane morphology, more prevalent in Gnao1 neurons.</p>

<title>Single cell transcriptome of mouse vomeronasal neuroepithelium</title>
<p>We standardized VNO neuroepithelium dissociation to obtain a single cell suspension along with optimizing cell viability. We performed single cell droplet-based capture coupled with scRNA seq, using the 10X genomics platform on four biological replicates consisting of male and female animals. Initial quality control steps were performed (see methods) to remove cells with high or low total RNA content and red blood cell contamination, resulting in the retention of 9185 cells from all samples for further analysis. Since our comparison of gene expression obtained from male versus female mice, did not reveal appreciable differences other than known sexually dimorphic genes that include Eif2s3y, Ddx3y, Uty and Kdm5d (<xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>, supplementary table 1), we pooled cells from both sexes for further analysis.</p>
<p>To group cells based on their gene expression profiles, we performed dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering, which resulted in 18 distinct clusters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), with gene expression markers specific to each cluster (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Major markers for each cluster were identified by differential expression analysis and the cell type identity was assigned to each cluster based on known markers for each cell type. Amongst 9185 cells, we observed that 63.7 percent (5852 cells) were neuronal cell types at different developmental stages which includes progenitor cells (Cluster 5; defined by expression of Ascl1, Neurod1, Neurog1), immature neurons (Cluster12; expression of Gap43), Gnao1 neurons (Cluster 14; based on expression of Gnao1, V2Rs), and Gnai2 neurons (Cluster 7, 16; characterized by Gnai2, V1Rs expression) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The remaining 36.3 percent cells were classified to be of non-neuronal types which include sustentacular cells (Cluster 15; defined by Cyp2a5, Ppic), cells from non-sensory epithelium (Cluster 11; defined by Ly6d, Krt5), cells from glandular tissue (Cluster 13; characterized by Obp2a, Lcn3), immune cells which include macrophages (Cluster 8, 6, 10; defined by C1qa, C1qb, H2-Aa), T cells (Cluster 9; defined by Cd3d, Cd3g), neutrophils (Cluster 2; defined by s100a8, s100a9), olfactory ensheathing cells (Cluster 3; defined by Gfap, Plp1, Sox10), endothelial cells (cluster 1 and 17; defined by Gng11, Egfl7, Eng), fibroblasts (Cluster 4; defined by Igfbp4, Dcn, Lum) and solitary chemosensory cells (Cluster 18; defined by Trpm5, Gnat3). A complete list of top 20 differentially expressed genes associated with each cluster and proportion of cells are provided in supplementary table 2 and 3.</p>

<p>We performed RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (RNA-ISH) on VNO sections to confirm spatial classification of various non-sensory cell type clusters based on some of the genes identified in our study (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, we confirmed Ppic to be expressed in sustentacular cells and Ly6d in cells of non-sensory epithelium bordering the VNO lumen. Since, Cbr2 - a known marker of sustentacular cells is also expressed in non-sensory epithelium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), Ppic and Ly6d are better markers to distinguish them. Obp2a was confirmed to be expressed in cells from glandular tissue on the non-sensory side. Plp1 and Mgp, markers of olfactory ensheathing glial cells and endothelial cells/fibroblasts, respectively, were observed to be expressed in cells located at the periphery of the neuro-epithelium. Macrophage cell markers C1qb and H2-Aa were observed to be specifically expressed in scattered cells throughout the neuroepithelium, with H2-Aa co-expression also seen in sustentacular cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), confirming the presence of these cell types within the neuroepithelium.</p>

<p>Since our study identified multiple immune cell clusters, we examined these in some detail. Three clusters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, clusters 6, 8, 10 termed as Mac1, Mac2, Mac3 respectively) comprised of macrophage like cells based on expression of C1qa, C1qb, C1qc and MHC class II gene - H2-Aa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Further analysis indicates that cluster 10 (Mac3) expresses classical microglial markers such as Tmem119, Aif1 (Iba1), P2ry12, Cx3cr1, Trem2, along with chemokine genes - Ccl3, Ccl4 and Ccl7 and Interleukins – Il1a, Il1b (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating an activated macrophage subset. Cluster 8 (Mac2) is similar to Mac3 in regard to expression of classical tissue resident macrophage marker - Adgre1 (F4/80), C1qa, C1qb, C1qc but lacks expression of chemokine and interleukin genes mentioned earlier. In comparison to Mac3 and Mac2, the Mac 1 cluster is distinguished by the lack of C1qa, C1qb, Cd68, Adgre1(F4/80), microglial markers but possesses high levels of Napsa, Lsp1, H2-Aa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, Supplementary table 2, 4). In summary, the identification of discrete macrophage cell types from our data, along with experimental validation of their presence using some of the expression markers, points to the possibility of tissue resident or tissue-infiltrating macrophages within the VNO neuroepithelium. These VNO macrophage types could have functional implications towards influencing processes such as neuronal differentiation or responses to tissue repair and injury.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we did not observe evidence via RNA-ISH for T-cell markers (Cd3d, Cd3g), raising the possibility that these immune cell types may have co-purified from blood. Lastly, we were able to identify via RNA-ISH, expression of Trpm5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) and Gnat3 genes from our dataset, that mark solitary chemosensory cells expressing taste receptors and related markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ogura <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>) (Supplementary table 2), indicating that rare cell-populations were captured, and their markers identified in our study.</p>

<title>Neuronal cell types and transient gene expression in developing neurons</title>
<p>Our next step was to perform in depth analysis of vomeronasal sensory neurons. In order to obtain a better resolution on neuronal sub-types, We pooled cells from clusters representing neuronal types identified in Figure-1 (clusters 5, 7, 12, 14, 16), created a new Seurat object and performed re-clustering. This resulted in 13 clusters (labelled n1- n13), which potentially represent distinct neuronal sub-populations within the broadly defined Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons (<xref rid="figs3_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Since neurogenesis is a continuous process in VNO neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barber and Raisman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wilson and Raisman, 1980</xref>), these clusters also represent a snapshot of cells at different developmental states, identified by known markers: Globose basal cells (Cluster n5; Ascl1), progenitor cells (Cluster n5; defined by expression of Neurod1, Neurog1), immature neurons (Cluster n6, n7; defined by Gap43) expressing Gnao1 or Gnai2 (<xref rid="figs3_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Among Gap43 negative mature neurons, Gnao1 neurons are clusters n1-n4, (<xref rid="figs3_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A, B</xref>, corresponding to cluster 14 in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), where sub-cluster identity is clearly defined by their co- expression of H2-Mv and Vmn2r GPCRs (discussed in detail in the co-expression section below). In contrast, 6 clusters (n8-n13) correspond to mature Gnai2 neurons (clusters 7, 16 from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), of which n8-n11 do not have any definite gene markers and differ based on differences in the expression level of few genes (<xref rid="figs3_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1C</xref>, Supplementary table 5).

<p>Expression of cognate V1R or V2R GPCRs is one of the hallmarks of VSN differentiation. We asked the question, to what extent do VRs influence neuronal sub clustering. Exclusion of VRs from clustering parameters did not affect divergence of mature neurons into Gnai1 / Gnao1 and only selectively affected some of the subclusters (<xref rid="figs3_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2</xref>), thus indicating that neuronal subtype identity was governed by gene expression differences beyond vomeronasal GPCRs.</p>
<p>Since immature neurons separated into two clusters expressing Gnao1 or Gnai2, these imply a possible branch point in the developmental trajectory towards mature neurons. To confirm this, we performed pseudo time analysis on neurons using Slingshot, and progenitor neurons (cluster n5) as a start/anchor point. For the purpose of developmental analysis, we merged subclusters within mature Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons. The trajectory of development confirms a split of immature Gap43+ neurons into Gnao1 or Gnai2 cell clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We performed differential expression analysis between immature neurons (cluster n6: Gap43+, Gnao1+ vs cluster n7: Gap43+, Gnai2+) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, Supplementary Table 6). To identify potential transcription factors in this developmental branch point, we manually curated genes that have molecular features associated with DNA binding domains or transcription regulation based on literature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). To our surprise, we found multiple genes that are known transcription regulators but are not previously reported to be enriched in Gnao1 neurons. These include Creb5, Prrxl1, Shisa8, Lmo4 and Foxo1. Creb5, Prrxl1 are transcription factors expressed only in immature Gnao1 neurons whereas Shisa8, Lmo4 and Foxo1 expression is enriched in immature Gnao1 neurons compared to mature ones (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Prrxl1 was reported to auto-repress its expression which explains how its expression is limited to immature Gnao1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Monteiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).These data indicate that the developmental transition of VNO neurons to Gnao1 lineage may involve the transient expression of transcription factors within immature neurons after dichotomy is established.</p>

<title>Co-expression of Vomeronasal receptors</title>
<p>One of the features that differentiates vomeronasal sensory neurons from main olfactory sensory neurons is their systematic deviation from ‘one neuron one receptor rule’, especially in mature Gnao1 neurons. V2R receptors have been classified into families- A, B, D, E and a distinct family-C that is phylogenetically closer to calcium sensing receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Young and Trask, 2007</xref>). Several studies have established a broad pattern of co-expression amongst these V2R family members, such as members of family ABDE co-express with family-C GPCRs and components of family-C (Vmn2r1 -also termed - C1, Vmn2r2-Vmn2r7 -termed C2) in turn co-express with each other in specific combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Martini <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Silvotti <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes within Gnao1 neurons also exhibit non-random co-expression patterns with the V2R GPCRs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ishii, Hirota and Mombaerts, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Loconto <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Silvotti <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ishii and Mombaerts, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2011</xref>). To further investigate these co-expression patterns and subpopulations within Gnao1 neurons, we took a closer look at clusters n1-n4 comprised of mature Gnao1 neurons (<xref rid="figs3_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</xref>). These four clusters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) are found to be organized majorly based on the expression of family-C V2Rs and H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes, especially Vmn2r1 or Vmn2r2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-E</xref>). Of the 4 clusters, cluster n1 and cluster n4 express Vmn2r1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B, 4E</xref>) whereas cluster n3 neurons are distinguished by the co-expression of Vmn2r2 along with other family-C members (Vmn2r3, Vmn2r4, Vmn2r5, Vmn2r6. Vmn2r7) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, 4E</xref>). Cluster n2 is a mixture of either Vmn2r1 or Vmn2r2 expressing neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), with Vmn2r2 being similarly co-expressed along with other family-C members in those cells. We observed that among family-ABDE members, A1-A6 V2Rs are highly expressed in cluster n2, n3 which co- express Vmn2r2 whereas A8-A10, B, D, E family V2Rs are mainly expressed along with Vmn2r1 in cluster n1 neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). These observations of family biased expression of ABDE with Vmn2r1 or Vmn2r2 agrees with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Silvotti <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">2011</xref>) that have used antibody or RNA probe based approaches.</p>

</fig>
<p>Furthermore, we observed that expression of H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes (H2-M10.1, M10.2, M10.3, M10.4, M10.5, M10.6) is largely confined to clusters n2 and n3, where they are co- expressed selectively in Vmn2r2 positive neurons and mostly absent from Vmn2r1 expressing cluster n1, n2 neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, 4E</xref>, <xref rid="figs4_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 2A</xref>). These observations align with prior reports from antibody or RNA probe-based experiments, that demonstrated a sub-division amongst Gnao1 neurons based on their expression of family-C Vmn2rs and co-expression of H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes with the Vmn2r2 subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Silvotti <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We then asked whether at the single neuron level, we could identify trends in co- expression patterns between ABD-family V2Rs and H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes, or between members of ABD family themselves. We performed co-expression analysis to identify specific VR and H2-M<italic>v</italic> combinations by setting an expression threshold from normalized counts. The distribution of normalized expression for VRs and H2-M<italic>v</italic>s across cells was bimodal, with the first peak near zero and a second peak likely corresponding to true expression (<xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1D-F</xref>). We set starting of second peak as a threshold to call the expression of VRs or H2-M<italic>v</italic>s in a single cell. Thus, a VR or H2-M<italic>v</italic> was considered as co-expressed in a cell only if its normalized expression value surpasses the set threshold based on the distribution (<xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1E, 1F</xref>). The threshold was 1.25 for V2Rs (<xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1E</xref>) and H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes (<xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1F</xref>). This analysis resulted in identification of multiple co- expressing V2Rs and H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes per cell. The chance that a combinatorial pattern identified can be due to a doublet is dependent on the frequency of expression of that gene. Therefore, for abundantly expressed family C V2Rs, it is possible some combinatorial patterns may be from doublets. But in case of family ABD V2Rs, the probability of a particular combination falsely identified due to a doublet more than once is very low. Hence, we assigned a threshold for combinatorial co-expression patterns that are identified in 2 or more cells to be more reliable. These combinatorial expression patterns along with their observed frequency are listed in supplementary table 7.</p>
<p>Within the expression patterns represented by a frequency of more than two cells, we observed that family C1 V2R (Vmn2r1) is mostly expressed alone without any other family-C members (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F, 4E</xref>) as shown earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Silvotti <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Surprisingly a few cells (31 neurons out of 1025 Gnao1 neurons) were observed to co-express Vmn2r1 along with Vmn2r7 (Supplementary table 7), contrary to earlier reports that Vmn2r1 does not co-express with family-C2 receptors. Most of Gnao1 neurons with family C2 V2Rs (Vmn2r2-2r7) co-express multiple members amongst them, ranging from 2 to 6 V2Rs per cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F, 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>In case of family-ABD V2R expression, we observed that most Gnao1 neurons follow ‘one ABD-V2R, one neuron’ rule, except for few that express two ABD-V2Rs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Amongst cells that express more than two ABD-V2Rs, the combination of Vmn2r20 and Vmn2r22 stood out as the highest (44 cells), followed by Vmn2r39, Vmn2r43 and Vmn2r50 (10 cells, Supplementary table 7). It is worth noting that these ABD co- expressions in each cell are observed irrespective of whether that cell expresses famly- C1 or C2 V2R (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Among Gnao1 neurons (n1-n4), 229 cells did not express family-C V2Rs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) and 46 cells did not express ABD-V2Rs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>) as per our threshold.</p>
<p>In case of H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes, each cell expresses 1-4 members mostly with famlily-C2 V2Rs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H, 4C, 4D</xref>). Interestingly, in deviation from this, we observed a pattern whereby H2-M1, -M9 and -M11 genes that show sequence divergence from rest of the H2-M<italic>v</italic> cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ishii, Hirota and Mombaerts, 2003</xref>), are specifically expressed in cluster n4 and restricted cells amongst cluster n3, where they co-express with Vmn2r1 GPCR, rather than family-C2 V2Rs (<xref rid="figs4_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 2B, 2D</xref>). Overall, 56.9% of Gnao1 cells that express either C1-V2R or C2-V2R, did not express any H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>) as per our threshold, reinforcing earlier observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ishii and Mombaerts, 2008</xref>) that their functional role maybe restricted to a subset of V2R expressing neurons. Furthermore, these H2-M1, H2-M9 or H2-M11 expressing cells along with Vmn2r1, also co-express either Vmn2r81 or Vmn2r82 (V2rf) (<xref rid="figs4_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 2B, 2C</xref>) as identified before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ishii, Hirota and Mombaerts, 2003</xref>). Two color RNA in situ hybridization with a common probe targeting Vmn2r81 and 82 and separate probes for H2-M1, H2-M9 and H2-M11 shows that Vmn2r81/82 cells always colocalized with the selected H2-M<italic>v</italic> probes (<xref rid="figs4_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>We performed a similar co-expression analysis on scRNAseq data of p56 VNO from Hills et. al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hills <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>) and observed that the overall co-expression pattern of V2Rs and H2-Mv genes in Gnao1 neurons matches with ours (<xref rid="figs4_3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 3</xref>). This rules out the possibility of dataset specific artifacts leading to spurious co-expression patterns. Altogether, these data validate the co-expression analysis methodology and identify novel combinatorial co-expression patterns of V2Rs and H2Mv genes.</p>
<p>We next asked, whether the total GPCR or H2-M<italic>v</italic> expression level is regulated or capped in a single cell? To answer this question, we calculated the total family-C-V2R, ABD-V2R and H2-M<italic>v</italic> expression in a single cell that either express one member or multiple members of each family (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4K</xref>). The results showed that when cells express more than one V2R, total V2R expression of either family-C or family-ABD (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I, 7J</xref>) scales up proportional to total number of expressed V2Rs of that family. This is also true in the case of multiple H2-M<italic>v</italic> expression where total H2-M<italic>v</italic> expression is proportional to the number of H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes expressed in a cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>). As a control, and to eliminate the possibility of doublets, we see that the levels of Gnao1 does not change with number of V2Rs or H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes expressed in a cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4K</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, we performed a similar co-expression analysis for V1Rs with a threshold value of 2.5 (<xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1D</xref>). In similarity to the pattern observed for ABD- V2Rs, most Gnai2 neurons expressed a single V1R per cell with some cells co- expressing two V1Rs (<xref rid="figs4_4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>, Supplementary table 8). Some of these V1R combinations have been reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lee, Kume and Holy, 2019</xref>). Even in case of Gnai2 neurons, total V1R expression in the cells that co-express two receptors is higher compared to cells that express one GPCR with Gnai2 levels being same (<xref rid="figs4_4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 4C</xref>), indicating that these measurements are from singlet cells. Due to stringent expression threshold, it is possible that VRs expressed at very low level were not considered and thereby leading to neurons where zero VRs are detected (<xref rid="figs4_4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 4B</xref>). However, these neurons express other genes like neuronal marker Gnai2 at same level as other neurons (<xref rid="figs4_4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 4C</xref>) ruling out the possibility of them being debris. Collectively, these data reveal the patterns of GPCR, H2-M<italic>v</italic> co-expression in VNO neurons, which is likely to be instrumental in deciphering how these neurons respond to single or combination of stimuli, as well as the cellular mechanisms that orchestrate these expression patterns.</p>

<title>Divergent gene expression profile of mature Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons</title>
<p>Since exclusion of VR genes did not fundamentally alter the clustering and divergence into mature Gnai2 / Gnao1 neurons, we decided to investigate the gene expression differences between these neurons by performing differential gene expression analysis of mature Gnao1 (cluster 14 from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and Gnai2 neurons (cluster 7, 16 from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and identified 924 differentially expressed genes with at least log2 fold change of 1 and adjusted p-value&lt;10e-6.

Among these genes, Nrp2 and Socs2 expression is restricted to Gnai2 neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>); Tppp3 and Gm36028 expression is restricted to Gnao1 neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Some of the enriched genes such as Ckb in Gnai2 and Krt18 in Gnao1 neurons, were also observed to be expressed in sustentacular cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, 5D</xref>). Furthermore, from chromogenic RNA-ISH experiments, we observed genes such as Nsg1, Rtp1, Dner, Qpct, Pcdh7 to be either restricted to or highly expressed in Gnai2 neurons (<xref rid="figs5_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 1A</xref>) and others such as Apmap, Selenof, Hspa5, Itm2b, Agpat5 were observed to have a gradient of high to low level expression from Gnao1 to Gnai2 zones (<xref rid="figs5_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref>). Two genes: Sncg and Prph specifically expressed in scattered subsets of Gnao1 or Gnai2 neurons respectively (<xref rid="figs5_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5–figure supplement 1A, 1B</xref>) indicating selective expression in a particular neuronal subpopulation. Gene ontology terms associated with the genes validated with RNA-ISH are in Supplementary table 10.</p>
<p>These experiments validated that several of the candidate genes identified as differentially expressed from scRNA seq data, are highly specific and spatially localized to one of the neuronal sub-populations. A complete list of differentially expressed genes is in Supplementary table 9.

<title>Differential ER environment in Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons</title>
<p>Given that Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons express divergent GPCR families, we asked the question whether the differentially expressed genes indicate fundamental differences in cellular or molecular processes between these two cell types. We performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the two sets of genes. Interestingly, we observed that amongst the Gnao1 neuron genes, most of the enriched terms with p value &lt;0.05, are related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) processes, which include ‘protein folding’, ‘response to ER stress’ and ‘ERAD pathway’ (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Conversely, a gene ontology analysis of Gnai2 neuron genes did not reveal any particular enrichment of GO terms in this neuronal subset. As more than 20% of the genes associated with protein folding (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) are enriched in Gnao1 neurons, we sought to probe the spatial transcription pattern of some of the candidates. Fluorescence RNA in-situ hybridization confirmed the selective expression of ER genes such as Creld2, Dnajc3, Pdia6 and Sdf2l1 amongst Gnao1 neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>To test whether these findings extend to the protein level, we performed immuno- fluorescence microscopy of VNO sections using antibodies specific to a collection of ER proteins. We first tried an antibody against SEKDEL, a common ER retention signal, which intensely labelled Gnao1 neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). This selective labelling was confirmed by co-labelling with anti-Gnao1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B, 7D</xref>), where anti-SEKDEL ER signal is seen in Gnao1 neurons. We quantified enrichment of SEKDEL across multiple (26) VNO sections from 3 mice, labelled with anti-SEKDEL, anti-Gnao1 and anti-Omp as a control. Normalized fluorescence intensity quantified along the apical-basal axis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D, 7E</xref>), shows that SEKDEL signal intensity increases along with Gnao1. Surprisingly, several other antibodies that detect ER chaperone proteins: Hspa5 (BiP), PDI, Grp94, Calnexin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref rid="figs7_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1A</xref>); as well as antibodies against ER membrane / structural proteins: Sec61β, Atlastin1, NogoB, Climp63, Reep5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Goyal and Blackstone, 2013</xref>) show a similar enrichment in Gnao1 neurons, as seen from the immune-fluorescence images and their quantification with Gnao1 or SEKDEL antibodies (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G,H</xref>, <xref rid="figs7_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Some ER protein localizations (SEKDEL, Hspa5, PDI, Atlastin1, NogoB) were detected selectively amongst basal zone Gnao1 neurons, while others (Sec61β, Calnexin, Grp94, Reep5, Climp63) detected a pattern of Gnao1 neuron enrichment, with lower levels in Gnai2 neurons. To test whether higher levels of these ER proteins resulted from their increased transcription, we compared their RNA levels in Gnai2 / Gnao1 neurons from our scRNA dataset (<xref rid="figs7_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>). In case of Hspa5 (Bip), Hsp90b1 (Grp94), Sec61b mRNA levels are higher in Gnao1 neurons (also see Hspa5 in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, and RNA-ISH in <xref rid="figs5_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>). On the other hand, RNA level of Atlastin1, PDI were comparable (<xref rid="figs7_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that Gnao1 neuron enrichment of some ER proteins could also arise due to post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.</p>

<p>Many of the Gnao1 enriched ER genes and their protein products are chaperones, while others are ER structural proteins. The upregulation of both types of ER proteins prompted us to examine the cells by electron microscopy. Serial sections (70 nm thick) of ∼1 mm square regions of the VNO were collected on tape and were imaged by scanning electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baena <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Since the sections contained the entire VNO, we were able to distinguish Gnai2 from Gnao1 cells by their location as they are spatially segregated into apical or basal zones respectively within the neuroepithelium (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). In Gnao1 cells, more than half of the cytoplasm contained dense smooth ER with cubic membrane morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Almsherqi, Kohlwein and Deng, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Almsherqi <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), also known as organized smooth ER (OSER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Snapp <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A, 8B</xref>, <xref rid="figs8_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref>). In remainder of the cytoplasm, there were closely apposed parallel sheets of ER membrane that were contiguous with lamellar ER surrounding the nucleus (<xref rid="figs8_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref>). The apical/Gnai2 neuronal cell bodies are smaller than those of Gnao1 cell bodies. They also appeared to have cubic ER membranes, but these seemed denser and occupied a smaller fraction of cytoplasmic volume (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A, 8C</xref>).</p>

<p>Taken together, our data indicates that mature Gnao1 neurons differ substantially from Gnai2 neurons in selectively upregulating the transcription of several ER genes. Furthermore, this neuronal subset also exhibits higher levels of ER proteins, via transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, as well as a hypertrophic smooth ER that is arranged in the form of organized cubic membrane ultrastructure. Collectively, these observations indicate a specialized ER environment that could play a significant functional role in the Gnao1 subset of VNO neurons.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The vomeronasal organ has been a model of considerable interest for molecular sensory biology, to study the diversification of sensory neurons, uniquely evolved gene families and their patterns of expression, all of which are essential to understand how specific social chemo-signals elicit innate behaviors. In this study, using single cell and low-level spatial transcriptomics, we developed a comprehensive resource identifying cell types of the VNO neuroepithelium and studied the developmental and receptor co-expression patterns within sensory neurons. We organized our dataset as an interactive web portal resource, accessible from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scvnoexplorer.com">www.scvnoexplorer.com</ext-link>, where a gene can be queried for its expression pattern and levels amongst cell clusters.</p>
<p>The identification of distinct cell clusters and validation of marker expression through RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, revealed a heterogeneous cellular composition of the vomeronasal neuroepithelium. In particular, we identified specific new gene markers, such as Ppic in sustentacular cells and Ly6d in non-sensory epithelium, which would be helpful in future to genetically tag or target these cell types and to study their developmental origins. Our study also identified specific types of macrophage cells within the neuroepithelium. Given the increasing appreciation of the role of tissue resident or infiltrating macrophages in a variety of physiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nobs and Kopf, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mass <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) it is tempting to speculate that macrophages could also play an important role in VNO neuronal differentiation or the regulation of inflammatory/immune responses to external insults. Future experiments, performing targeted purification, deep sequencing, and functional manipulation of VNO macrophage types could provide deeper insights on their role in VNO function and whether they share cellular identity with MOE macrophages.</p>

<title>Development of VSNs</title>
<p>VNO sensory neurons expressing Gnao1 and Gnai2 develop continuously throughout life from a single progenitor cell population located within the VNO marginal zones and differentiate to immature and mature neurons. Recent developmental studies have demonstrated that the dichotomy is established by Notch signaling followed by transcription factor, Bcl11b expression that marks the progenitor cells to take Gnao1 fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Enomoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Katreddi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Most Importantly, a critical period of Notch signaling determines whether progenitors give rise to apical, basal or sustentacular cell types. After Gnao1/Gnai2 identity is established, transcription factor Tfap2e, continuously expressed from immature to mature Gnao1 neurons, is required to maintain the Gnao1 fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Katreddi <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Pseudo-time analysis on our data confirmed a developmental trajectory that starts with progenitor cells, leading to immature neurons that take on either Gnai2 or Gnao1 fate. From our scRNA seq data, a comparison of immature neurons revealed that apart from Tfap2e, transcription factors: Creb5, Prrxl1, Lmo4, Foxo1 also express in immature Gnao1 neurons. But unlike Tfap2e, Creb5 and Prrxl1 expression is restricted to only immature stage of Gnao1 neurons. Although, Foxo1 and Lmo4 continue to express in mature Gnao1 neurons, their RNA levels are high in immature Gnao1 neurons and reduce upon maturation. Among the transcription factors identified, Prrxl1 has been shown to involved in the development of dorsal root ganglion neurons where it has been shown to autoregulate its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Monteiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Our observations on the tight temporal regulation of these transcription factor related genes in the developmental trajectory of Gnao1 neurons indicates that additional molecular players might be important in further specification or maintenance of this neuronal lineage. Further experiments are needed to tease out the mechanism and precise choreography by which these transcription factors collectively specify and maintain the Gnao1 cell identity as well as gene expression patterns unique to these neurons.</p>

<title>Receptor co-expression in Gnao1 neurons</title>
<p>One of the key features distinguishing basal zone Gnao1 VNO neurons from apical Gnai2 or MOE neurons, is the combinatorial co-expression of two or more V2R family GPCRs along with H2-M<italic>v</italic> class-1b MHC molecules in each cell. Our analysis of receptor expression in mature VNO neurons, revealed that members of V1R and V2R-ABD gene families largely follow the one-neuron-one receptor rule, but with multiple exceptions. Some V1Rs were found to consistently co-express in Gnai2 neurons and the major combinations observed from our analysis (such as Vmn1r85/86, <xref rid="figs4_4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 4A</xref>), match those identified recently from a functional single cell study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lee, Kume and Holy, 2019</xref>), leading confidence to the methodology used in our co-expression analysis. Receptors of the ABD-V2R subfamilies are also mostly expressed at one receptor per neuron, with notable exceptions being the observed combinations of Vmn2r20/22 and Vmn2r39/43/50 being co-expressed per cell.</p>
<p>In our study, the analysis of family-C, family ABD-V2Rs and H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes expressed per cell, confirmed the earlier reported sub-division of basal/Gnao1 neurons into those that express either Vmn2r1 (family-C1) or Vmn2r2-Vmn2r7 (family-C2), resulting in a broad four-part division of mature VNO neurons: those expressing a) Gnai2/V1Rs, b) Gnao1/Vmn2r1, c) Gnao1/Vmn2r2-2r7; H2-M<italic>v</italic>+, d) Gnao1/Vmn2r2-2r7; H2-M<italic>v</italic>-. The co- expression of ABD-V2R sub-families A1-A5 and most of the H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes with Vmn2r2/family-C2 neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-E</xref>, cluster n3, n2, Supplementary table-7) as well as preferential co-expression of A6-A9, B, D, E sub-families with Vmn2r1 along with exclusion of H2M<italic>v</italic> genes from these neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), points to the overall non- random logic of V2R/H2Mv co-expression. It would be interesting to see how receptor de-orphanization and future functional experiments will map onto these elaborate co- expression patterns. At the same time there were notable deviations observed from these rules, namely the restricted and sparse expression of H2-M1/M9/M11 with Vmn2r1 neurons in cluster n4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref rid="figs4_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 2B, 2E</xref>), where the receptors Vmn2r81/82 are also expressed selectively in these neurons.</p>
<p>Of note, the combined expression of VR/H2-M<italic>v</italic> in a cell is not capped and is proportional to number of VRs and H2-Mv genes expressed in that cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4K</xref>). It would be interesting to see whether the levels of co-expressing transcripts also translate to protein levels in cells and their impact on functional interactions, if any, between co-expressed proteins.</p>

<title>ER environment in VNO neurons</title>
<p>When comparing gene expression amongst Gnai2/Gnao1 mature neurons, what stood out was the unexpected enrichment of gene ontology terms associated with ER functions within Gnao1 neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, 6E</xref>). Most of these ER-Gnao1 enriched genes from our dataset, match the ones identified from a similar comparison by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lin et al 2022</xref>, supporting our findings. We validated several of these ER genes via RNA-ISH to be exclusively expressed or enriched in Gnao1 neurons. Even more puzzling was our observation that this enrichment pattern extended at the protein level to many ER proteins probed by immune labelling (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). In some cases, both RNA and proteins were Gnao1 enriched, whereas in others, RNA levels were comparable but protein levels were biased towards Gnao1 cells. The enrichment of ER genes/proteins via transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional mechanisms presents a new feature of these cell types that could be associated with their differentiation and function. High levels of several chaperones such as Creld2, Dnajc3, Pdia6, PDI, Hspa5/Bip, Grp94, Calnexin in Gnao1 neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref rid="figs7_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1A</xref>) compared to Gnai2 neurons indicates a chaperone rich ER environment in these neurons. The chaperone Calr4 has been shown to be enriched in Gnao1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dey and Matsunami, 2011</xref>). Our observations indicate that the enrichment of chaperones is a generalized feature of Gnao1 neurons that extends to several other genes/proteins of related function and localization.</p>
<p>Since it has been proposed that the V2R family is an evolutionarily recent acquisition in rodents and marsupials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Takigami <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) and sub-family members, such as sub family-C2, A1-A6 V2Rs, as well as H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes have evolved in Muridae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Young and Trask, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Silvotti <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), it is possible that mouse Gnao1 neurons may have required to co-evolve ER protein folding mechanisms to handle multiple GPCR/H2-M<italic>v</italic> co-expression and their putative protein interactions. In addition to our observations on the generalized upregulation of ER genes in Gnao1 neurons, it may be possible that some specific ER genes are also necessary for proper folding of vomeronasal type-2 GCPRs. These data and observations assume significance given the well-recognized fact that functional reconstitution of these GPCRs and H2-M<italic>v</italic> molecules in heterologous cells remains a persistent challenge, with some success being reported using the chaperone Calr4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dey and Matsunami, 2011</xref>). On the other hand, olfactory receptors have been shown to co-opt the ER unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway via the ER proteins PERK/CHOP and transcription factor ATF5 as a mechanism for their functional expression, setting the stage for ONOR expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dalton, Lyons and Lomvardas, 2013</xref>). ATF5 is observed in the VNO, however, it is reported to be broadly expressed across Gnai2 and Gnao1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nakano <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dalton, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dalton <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>),. Further experiments are required to evaluate whether V2Rs and Gnao1 neurons adopt similar mechanisms and how the chaperone rich ER environment observed here might impact the expression, folding of GPCRs and neuronal function.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that in addition to the expression of ER chaperones in Gnao1 neurons, we also observed distinctly higher levels of ER structural and membrane proteins. Levels of membrane curvature stabilizing proteins - Reep5, NogoB/Reticulon4B, the three-way junction formation protein - Atlastin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Goyal and Blackstone, 2013</xref>), ER sheet lumen spacer protein - Climp-63/Ckap4 as well as Sec61β - a commonly used ER membrane marker were all observed to be high in Gnao1 neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G, 7H</xref>, <xref rid="figs7_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, it is possible that an added layer of complexity could involve modulation of total ER content or ER structure in Gnao1 neuronal subtypes. Our electron microcopy results (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, <xref rid="figs8_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8-figure supplement 1</xref>) revealed a strikingly higher smooth ER membrane content in Gnao1 neurons compared to Gnai2 neurons. Interestingly, this ER adopts a cubic membrane architecture, packing the Gnao1 neuron cell body with gyroid / sinusoidal membrane. Early electron microscopy studies in rodents, identified that smooth ER content is higher in VSNs than olfactory sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ciges <italic>et al</italic>., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Breipohl <italic>et al</italic>., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Taniguchi and Mochizuki, 1982</xref>), however, these studies preceded the discovery of Gnao1-Gnai2 dichotomy. To our knowledge, Breipohl and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Breipohl <italic>et al</italic>., 1981</xref>) reported the presence of smooth ER whorls in VSNs, later termed as cubic membranes. Future studies using serial section EM would be instrumental in reconstructing the 3D architecture of VSN ER.</p>
<p>Cubic membranes, representing highly curved periodic structures, have been observed in a variety of biological contexts, however their functional significance has been harder to pin down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Almsherqi, Kohlwein and Deng, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Almsherqi <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). In the context of VNO, and in particular Gnao1 neurons, we speculate that the high ER content and dense packing in the form of cubic membranes, could indicate a perpetual stress like state in these neurons, necessary to address unique folding requirements of V2R or H2- M<italic>v</italic> proteins. For instance, maturation of these proteins and their proper folding or multimerization may require a slower transit through the ER, necessitating the sinusoidal arrangement of ER membranes. Likewise, the V2R biosynthetic processes in Gnao1 neurons may require enhanced levels of ER chaperones, which could in turn induce ER membranes into a homeostatic response. Can V2Rs themselves trigger upregulation of ER chaperones and the hypertrophic ER, or are these cellular characteristics established before the onset of V2R expression? From our single cell transcriptomics data, we tried to identify at what stage ER chaperones express during the developmental trajectory of VSNs. We observed that onset of Vmn2r1 expression coincides with upregulation of ER chaperones in cluster n6 immature Gnao1 neurons (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> <bold>A, B)</bold>. However, some Gnao1 cells show upregulated ER gene expression without Vmn2r1/Vmn2r2 expression (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>), hence further experiments are needed to dissect the mechanism and precise relationship between neuronal differentiation, GPCR expression and ER chaperones as well as ER ultrastructure.</p>

<p>Overall, our data opens a new aspect to look at Gnao1 neurons, when understanding their function: a highly specialized ER environment that is divergent from Gnai2 neurons. The ER genes and their Gnao1 biased expression we identified, could be downstream targets of specific transcription factors and as a result of neuronal differentiation, while functionally these could be required for the proper folding and co-expression of V2R GPCRs. The developmental trajectory of VSNs into Gnai2/Gnao1 neurons via transcription factors and their differential ER environment is summarized as a model in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the comprehensive scRNA seq analysis presented in this study contributes valuable insights into the complexity of the vomeronasal neuroepithelium, offering a roadmap for further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying sensory perception and neural development in this specialized sensory organ. Vomeronasal neurons may also serve as model system to study specialized ER structure-function relationship and its role in maturation of GPCR expressing neurons.</p>

Neuroepithelial tissue from multiple animals was transferred to this well containing the final dissociation buffer and was cut into small pieces and the suspension was transferred to 14 mL tube and was incubated with gentle shaking at 37°C for 30 minutes on a thermomixer (Eppendorf) by passing 95% CO2, 5% O2 on top of the liquid headspace. During this incubation, the solution was triturated with fire-polished Pasteur pipette every 10 minutes and at the end the incubation. After incubation, the suspension was passed sequentially through 70µm, 35µm filters to remove tissue debris.

<title>Ambient RNA correction, quality check and filtering</title>
<p>Before downstream analysis stringent filtering was implemented to retain high quality cells. Ambient RNA contamination was removed using soupX package with default parameters in auto mode. The adjusted count matrix from soupX consisting of 10615 cells was used as an input to Seurat package using <italic>CreateSeuratObjec</italic>t function. To remove potential doublets and low gene count cells, an additional filter was applied to select cells that express 200-7000 genes resulting in dropping 683 cells.</p>

<title>Normalization, scaling, dimensionality reduction, clustering, marker identification and additional filtration</title>
<p>The data was normalized using <italic>NormalizeData</italic> function using LogNormalize method that log-transforms the expression counts after multiplying with scaling factor 10000. After normalization, top 2000 variable genes in the dataset were identified using <italic>FindVariableFeatures</italic> function using mean.function=ExpMean, dispersion.function=LogVMR, x.low.cutoff =0.0125, x.high.cutoff=3, y.cutoff=0.5 as parameters. This variable gene set was used for all downstream analysis including dimensionality reduction and clustering. All vomeronasal receptors were amongst the variable features gene set. Data was scaled and centered using <italic>ScaleData</italic> using default model by regressing out percentage of mitochondrial genes and total number of RNA molecules per cell to remove their contribution in downstream analysis. The basis of scaling for each gene is by subtracting the mean from the value and dividing the difference by standard deviation. To cluster the cells, we initially performed principal component analysis (PCA) with 50 components using <italic>RunPCA</italic>. We used elbow plot and Jack Straw plot and determined the optimum number of dimensions required for the next steps of clustering as 37. Graph based clustering was performed using Seurat’s <italic>FindNeighbours</italic> function to identify the neighboring cells that share similar expression pattern in a network constructed in PCA space with 37 dimensions. Later the clusters were identified by using <italic>FindClusters</italic> function by varying the resolution parameter from 0.2 to 0.8. The resolution parameter 0.3 was chosen, as it shows minimum overlapping markers upon plotting the heatmap of gene markers for each cluster identified by <italic>FindAllMarkers</italic> function. To clean up the dataset further, cells (408) expressing Hbb-bs gene were considered as RBC contamination and a cluster (215 cells) enriched with mitochondrial genes indicative of dying cells were removed from the data. This resulted in a total of 9180 cells.</p>

<title>Dimensionality reduction for 2D representation and cell type assignment</title>
<p>UMAP was generated using <italic>RunUMAP</italic> function. Cluster identity was assigned based on known markers of each cell type. Two clusters expressing Gnai2 as major marker were merged as they had very similar expression profile. Solitary chemosensory cells and endothelial cells were manually assigned a cluster identity based on the expression of Trpm5/Rgs21 and Aqp1/Egfl7 and by selecting the cells using the <italic>CellSelector</italic> function of Seurat.</p>

<sec id="s4d7">
<title>Comparison of male and female data</title>
<p>Based on suffix assigned to barcodes during integration of male and female samples, a metadata column was added to the Seurat object marking the sex of source tissue as male or female. Further, cells in each cluster were divided by appending the sex to the cluster identities. Differential expression analysis was performed between cells from male and female VNO for each cluster using <italic>FindMarkers</italic> function of Seurat.</p>

<sec id="s4d8">
<title>Clustering and downstream analysis of neurons</title>
<p>For neuron specific analysis, neuronal cell types representing Gnao1 neurons, Gnai2 neurons, immature neurons, and progenitor cells were separated from main seurat object using <italic>subset</italic> function to create a new ‘neurons’ object. The data is scaled again, PCA was performed, number of principal components were determined, and clustering was performed as described above with resolution=0.4 to define neuronal subtypes. To compare the results of clustering with and without VRs, a new Seurat object– ‘neurons_no_VR’ was created by removing all vomeronasal receptors from the variable gene set. Dimensionality reduction, clustering was performed again using the same method mentioned above. Seurat’s query to reference mapping module was used to project neurons_no_VR object in the same UMAP space as neurons object so that UMAPs are comparable. The anchors were identified by using <italic>FindTransferAnchors</italic> function with neurons object as reference and neurons_no_VR as query. The reference UMAP model was computed using <italic>MapQuery</italic> function using the anchors.</p>

<title>Differential gene expression of Gnao1, Gnai2 neurons</title>
<p>Differentially expressed genes between Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons (mature or immature) were identified using <italic>FindMarkers</italic> function of Seurat on ‘neurons’ object with default parameters. The results are plotted as volcano plot using EnhancedVolcano package.</p>

<title>Gene ontology (GO) analysis</title>
<p>Gene ontology analysis of Gnao1 enriched genes was done with clusterProfiler package using <italic>enricher</italic> function on mouse gene sets related to mouse biological processes (GO:BP) ontology downloaded from Mouse Molecular Signatures Database. The enrichment analysis was restricted to the differentially expressed genes with log2 fold change greater than 1.</p>

<title>Co-expression analysis</title>
<p>Non-zero expression level for a particular gene may not indicate that the VR is expressed. Therefore, we identified the cut-off for V1R, V2R and H2-M<italic>v</italic>s based on the distribution of expression level across all cells. Normalized gene expression values of V1R, V2R and H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes were extracted from each cell of Gnai2 and Gnao1 clusters and the distribution is plotted across all cells. This resulted in a Bi-modal distribution and starting of the second peak was considered as cut-off for V2R/V1R/H2- M<italic>v</italic> genes (<xref rid="figs4_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1D, 1F</xref>). The genes were considered co- expressed in a single cell if their normalized expression value is greater than the identified threshold value of 1.25 for V2R, H2-M<italic>v</italic> gene and 2.5 for V1R genes. Further, the number of cells crossing the threshold were calculated for each combination.</p>

<p>Devakinandan et al. present a revised version of their manuscript. Their scRNA-seq data is a valuable resource to the community, and they further validate their findings via in situ hybridizations and electron microscopy. Overall, they have addressed my major concerns. I only have two minor comments.</p>
<p>(1) The authors note in Figure 4I, and K that because the number of C2 V2Rs or H2-Mv receptors increased while the normalized expression of Gnao1 remained constant (and likewise for V1Rs and Gnai2 in Figure 4-S4C) that their results are unlikely to be capturing doublets. I'm not sure that this is the case. If the authors added together two V2R cells the total count of every gene might double, but the normalized expression of Gnao1 would remain the same. To address this concern, the authors should also show the raw counts for Gnao1 as well as the total number of UMIs for these cells.</p>
<p>(2) As requested, the authors have now added a colorbar to the pseudocolored images in Figures 7. However, this colorbar still doesn't have any units. Can the authors add some units, or clarify in the methods how the raw data relates to the colors (e.g. is it mapped linearly, at a logscale, with gamma or other adjustments, etc.)? Moreover, it's also unclear what the dots in the backgrounds of plots like Figure 7E mean. Are they pixels? Showing the individual lines, the average for each animal, or omitting them entirely, might make more sense.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study focuses on the vomeronasal organ, the peripheral chemosensory organ of the accessory olfactory system, by employing single-cell transcriptomics. The author analyzed the mouse vomeronasal organ, identifying diverse cell types through their unique gene expression patterns. Developmental gene expression analysis revealed that two classes of sensory neurons diverge in their maturation from common progenitors, marked by specific transient and persistent transcription factors. A comparative study between major neuronal subtypes, which differ in their G-protein sensory receptor families and G-protein subunits (Gnai2 and Gnao1, respectively), highlighted a higher expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associated genes in Gnao1 neurons. Moreover, distinct differences in ER content and ultrastructure suggest some intriguing roles of ER in Gnao1-positive vomeronasal neurons. This work is likely to provide useful data for the community and is conceptually novel with the unique role of ER in a subset of vomeronasal neurons.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Devakinandan and colleagues have undertaken a thorough characterization of the cell types of the mouse vomeronasal organ, focusing on the vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs). VSNs are known to arise from a common pool of progenitors that differentiate into two distinct populations characterized by the expression of either the G protein subunit Gnao1 or Gnai2. Using single-cell RNA sequencing followed by unsupervised clustering of the transcriptome data, the authors identified three Gnai2+ VSN subtypes and a single Gnao1+ VSN type. To study VSN developmental trajectories, Devakinandan and colleagues took advantage of the constant renewal of the neuronal VSN pool, which allowed them to harvest all maturation states. All neurons were re-clustered and a pseudotime analysis was performed. The analysis revealed the emergence of two pools of Gap43+ clusters from a common lineage, which differentiate into many subclusters of mature Gnao1+ and Gnai2+ VSNs. By comparing the transcriptomes of these two pools of immature VSNs, the authors identified a number of differentially expressed transcription factors in addition to known markers. Next, by comparing the transcriptomes of mature Gnao1+ and Gnai2+ VSNs, the authors report an enrichment of ER-related genes in Gnao1+ VSNs. Using electron microscopy, they found that this enrichment was associated with specific ER morphology in Gnao1+ neurons. Finally, the authors characterized chemosensory receptor expression and co-expression (as well as H2-Mv proteins) in mature VSNs, which recapitulated known patterns.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data presented here provide new and interesting perspectives on the distinguishing features between Gnao1+ and Gnai2+ VSNs. These features include newly identified markers, such as transcription factors, as well as an unsuspected ER-related peculiarity in Gnao1+ neurons, consisting in a hypertrophic ER and an enrichment in ER-related genes. In addition, the authors provide a comprehensive picture of specific co-expression patterns of V2R chemoreceptors and H2-Mv genes.</p>
<p>Importantly, the authors provide a browser (scVNOexplorer) for anyone to explore the data, including gene expression and co-expression, number and proportion of cells, with a variety of graphical tools (violin plots, feature plots, dot plots, ...).</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the current reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Devakinandan et al. present a revised version of their manuscript. Their scRNA-seq data is a valuable resource to the community, and they further validate their findings via in situ hybridizations and electron microscopy. Overall, they have addressed my major concerns. I only have two minor comments.</p>
<p>(1) The authors note in Figure 4I, and K that because the number of C2 V2Rs or H2-Mv receptors increased while the normalized expression of Gnao1 remained constant (and likewise for V1Rs and Gnai2 in Figure 4-S4C) that their results are unlikely to be capturing doublets. I'm not sure that this is the case. If the authors added together two V2R cells the total count of every gene might double, but the normalized expression of Gnao1 would remain the same. To address this concern, the authors should also show the raw counts for Gnao1 as well as the total number of UMIs for these cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 4I, 4K and Figure 4-Figure supplement 4C, on Y-axis, we plotted the sum of normalized counts of all V1R/V2R/H2-Mv genes expressed in each cell along with the normalized expression value of Gnao1/Gnai2. Both VR/H2-Mv and Gnao1/Gnai2 are normalized values, with normalization based on LogNormalize (mentioned in methods). We show here plots of total expression calculated from raw counts corresponding to the same Figure. Raw counts of VRs/H2-Mv, Gnao1/Gnai2 are plotted separately due to difference in scale. The overall trend matches normalized counts, with minor fluctuations in Gnao1/Gnai2.</p>

<p>As mentioned in our response to version-1 reviews and in our manuscript, doublets generally are a random combination of two cells and the probability that a combinatorial pattern is due to doublet is proportional to the abundance of cells expressing those genes. It is possible that some of the family-C V2R combinations represented by 2 cells are doublets because of their widespread expression. The frequency of combinatorial expression patterns, greater than a set threshold of 2 cells, that we observed for family ABD V2Rs or V1Rs (supplementary tables 7, 8) is an indication of co-expression and unlikely from random doublets. For instance, 134 cells express two V1Rs, of which 44 cells express Vmn1r85+Vmn1r86, 21 cells express Vmn1r184+Vmn1r185, 13 express Vmn1r56+Vmn1r57, 6 express Vmn1r168+Vmn1r177. Some of the co-expression combinations we reported were also identified and verified experimentally in Lee et al., 2019 and Hills et. al., 2024.</p>
<p>The co-expression of multiple family-C2 V2Rs (Vmn2r2-Vmn2r7) along with ABD V2Rs per cell as shown in our data, has been shown experimentally in earlier studies.</p>

<p>(2) As requested, the authors have now added a colorbar to the pseudocolored images in Figures 7. However, this colorbar still doesn't have any units. Can the authors add some units, or clarify in the methods how the raw data relates to the colors (e.g. is it mapped linearly, at a logscale, with gamma or other adjustments, etc.)? Moreover, it's also unclear what the dots in the backgrounds of plots like Figure 7E mean. Are they pixels? Showing the individual lines, the average for each animal, or omitting them entirely, might make more sense.</p>

<p>We used the Fire LUT with linear scale within Fiji / Image-J software to assign scale to the pseudo-colored images in Figure 7. We will include this description in our methods and thank the reviewer for pointing it out.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study focuses on the vomeronasal organ, the peripheral chemosensory organ of the accessory olfactory system, by employing single-cell transcriptomics. The author analyzed the mouse vomeronasal organ, identifying diverse cell types through their unique gene expression patterns. Developmental gene expression analysis revealed that two classes of sensory neurons diverge in their maturation from common progenitors, marked by specific transient and persistent transcription factors. A comparative study between major neuronal subtypes, which differ in their G-protein sensory receptor families and G-protein subunits (Gnai2 and Gnao1, respectively), highlighted a higher expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associated genes in Gnao1 neurons. Moreover, distinct differences in ER content and ultrastructure suggest some intriguing roles of ER in Gnao1-positive vomeronasal neurons. This work is likely to provide useful data for the community and is conceptually novel with the unique role of ER in a subset of vomeronasal neurons. This reviewer has some minor concerns and some suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Devakinandan and colleagues have undertaken a thorough characterization of the cell types of the mouse vomeronasal organ, focusing on the vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs). VSNs are known to arise from a common pool of progenitors that differentiate into two distinct populations characterized by the expression of either the G protein subunit Gnao1 or Gnai2. Using single-cell RNA sequencing followed by unsupervised clustering of the transcriptome data, the authors identified three Gnai2+ VSN subtypes and a single Gnao1+ VSN type. To study VSN developmental trajectories, Devakinandan and colleagues took advantage of the constant renewal of the neuronal VSN pool, which allowed them to harvest all maturation states. All neurons were re-clustered and a pseudotime analysis was performed. The analysis revealed the emergence of two pools of Gap43+ clusters from a common lineage, which differentiate into many subclusters of mature Gnao1+ and Gnai2+ VSNs. By comparing the transcriptomes of these two pools of immature VSNs, the authors identified a number of differentially expressed transcription factors in addition to known markers. Next, by comparing the transcriptomes of mature Gnao1+ and Gnai2+ VSNs, the authors report an enrichment of ER-related genes in Gnao1+ VSNs. Using electron microscopy, they found that this enrichment was associated with specific ER morphology in Gnao1+ neurons. Finally, the authors characterized chemosensory receptor expression and co-expression (as well as H2-Mv proteins) in mature VSNs, which recapitulated known patterns.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data presented here provide new and interesting perspectives on the distinguishing features between Gnao1+ and Gnai2+ VSNs. These features include newly identified markers, such as transcription factors, as well as an unsuspected ER-related peculiarity in Gnao1+ neurons, consisting in a hypertrophic ER and an enrichment in ER-related genes. In addition, the authors provide a comprehensive picture of specific co-expression patterns of V2R chemoreceptors and H2-Mv genes.</p>
<p>Importantly, the authors provide a browser (scVNOexplorer) for anyone to explore the data, including gene expression and co-expression, number and proportion of cells, with a variety of graphical tools (violin plots, feature plots, dot plots, ...).</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Devakinandan and colleagues present a manuscript analyzing single-cell RNAsequencing data from the mouse vomeronasal organ. The main advances in this manuscript are to identify and verify the differential expression of genes that distinguish apical and basal vomeronasal neurons. The authors also identify the enriched expression of ER-related genes in Gnao1 neurons, which they verify with in situ hybridizations and immunostaining, and also explore via electron microscopy. Finally, the results of this manuscript are presented in an online R shiny app. Overall, these data are a useful resource to the community. I have a few concerns about the manuscript, which I've listed below.</p>
<p>General Concerns:</p>
<p>(1) The authors mention that they were unable to identify the cells in cluster 13. This cluster looks similar to the &quot;secretory VSN&quot; subtype described in a recent preprint from C. Ron Yu's lab (10.1101/2024.02.22.581574). The authors could try comparing or integrating their data with this dataset (or that in Katreddi et al. 2022) to see if this is a common cell type across datasets (or arises from a specific type of cell doublets). In situ hybridizations for some of the marker genes for this cluster could also highlight where in the VNO these cells reside.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Cluster13 (Obp2a+) cells identified in our study have similar gene expression markers to “putative secretory” cells mentioned in Hills et al.. At the time this manuscript was available publicly, our publication was already communicated. We have now performed RNA-ISH to Obp2a, the topmost marker identified with this cluster, and found it to be expressed in cells from glandular tissue on the non-sensory side. Some of the other markers associated with this cluster such as Obp2b, Lcn3, belong to the lipocalin family of proteins. Hence in our estimate these markers collectively represent non-sensory glandular tissue. We have added Obp2a RNA-ISH to Figure 2-figure supplement-1A and results section in our revised manuscript. Cluster-13 also has cells expressing Vmn1r37, which typically is expressed in neuronal cells. However, we do not see Obp2a mRNA in the sensory epithelium. It is possible that cluster-13 comprises a heterogenous mixture of cells, some of which are clearly non-sensory cells from glandular tissue, co-clustered with other cell types as well as a  possibility that Obp2a is expressed below the detection level of our assay in neurons, which will require further experiments. We do not have any possible reason to confidently assign this cluster as a neuronal cell type, hence, we excluded it in downstream analysis of neurons.</p>
<p>We used the data from Hills et al., to compare co-expression characteristic of V2Rs, which is added as Figure 3-figure supplement 3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) I found the UMAPs for the neurons somewhat difficult to interpret. Unlike Katreddi et al. 2022 or Hills et al. 2024, it's tricky to follow the developmental trajectories of the cells in the UMAP space. Perhaps the authors could try re-embedding the data using gene sets that don't include the receptors? It would also be interesting to see if the neuron clusters still cluster by receptor-type even when the receptors are excluded from the gene sets used for clustering. Plots relating the original clusters to the neuronal clusters, or dot plots showing marker gene expression for the neuronal clusters might both be useful. For example, right now it's difficult to interpret clusters like n8-13.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>a) We have revised the UMAP in Figure 3A, and labeled mature, immature, progenitor neurons so that it is easier to follow the developmental trajectory.</p>
<p>b) In our revised text we have explicitly drawn equivalence between neuronal clusters from Figure 1 to re-clustered neurons in subsequent figures (Figure 3 and 4 in revised submission). For developmental analysis, we merged mature Gnao1, Gnai2 neuronal subclusters to two major clusters that are equivalent to original neuronal clusters in Figure 1. As UMAP is an arbitrary representation of cells, we also show expression of markers for major neuronal cell types in Figure 1C and Figure 3-figure supplement 1B, helpful in making the connection.</p>
<p>c) The purpose of re-clustering with higher resolution was to identify sub-populations within Gnao1 and Gnai1 neurons. It was useful to make sense of mature Gnao1 neurons, where family-C Vmn2r and H2-Mv expression maps onto distinct subclusters. Along with neuronal subclusters in revised Figure 3-figure supplement-1 we include a dot plot of gene expression markers.</p>
<p>d) In Figure 3-figure supplement-2, we show a comparison of neuronal clusters with and without VRs. Exclusion of VRs did not substantially alter mature neuron dichotomy into Gnao1/Gnai2. Only Gnao1 subclusters n1/n3 whose organization is dependent on family-C Vmn2r expression were affected, as well as redistribution of subcluster n8 from Gnai2 neurons. VR expression does not seem to be the primary determinant of VSN cluster identity.</p>

<p>We have extensively quantified the ER phenotype as shown in Figure 7, Figure 7-figure supplement-1 in our revised version. We would like to point out that the connection between scRNA-seq and EM was made due to our observations in the same figures, that levels of a number of ER luminal and ER membrane proteins were higher in Gnao1 compared to Gnai2 neurons. This led us to hypothesize a differential ER content or ultrastructure, which was verified by EM.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Devakinandan and colleagues have undertaken a thorough characterization of the cell types of the mouse vomeronasal organ, focusing on the vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs). VSNs are known to arise from a common pool of progenitors that differentiate into two distinct populations characterized by the expression of either the G protein subunit Gnao1 or Gnai2.

Using electron microscopy, they found that this enrichment was associated with specific ER morphology in Gnao1+ neurons. Finally, the authors characterized chemosensory receptor expression and coexpression (as well as H2-Mv proteins) in mature VSNs, which recapitulated known patterns.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data presented here provide new and interesting perspectives on the distinguishing features between Gnao1+ and Gnai2+ VSNs. These features include newly identified markers, such as transcription factors, as well as an unsuspected ER-related peculiarity in Gnao1+ neurons, consisting of a hypertrophic ER and an enrichment in ER-related genes. In addition, the authors provide a comprehensive picture of specific co-expression patterns of V2R chemoreceptors and H2-Mv genes.</p>
<p>Importantly, the authors provide a browser (scVNOexplorer) for anyone to explore the data, including gene expression and co-expression, number and proportion of cells, with a variety of graphical tools (violin plots, feature plots, dot plots, ...).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study still requires refined analyses of the data and rigorous quantification to support the main claims.</p>
<p>The method description for filtering and clustering single-cell RNA-sequencing data is incomplete. The Seurat package has many available pipelines for single-cell RNA-seq analysis, with a significant impact on the output data. How did the authors pre-process and normalize the data? Was the pipeline used with default settings? What batch correction method was applied to the data to mitigate possible sampling or technical effects? Moreover, the authors do not describe how cell and gene filtering was performed. The data in Figure 7-Supplement 3 show that one-sixth of the V1Rs do not express any chemoreceptor, while over a hundred cells express more than one chemoreceptor. Do these cells have unusually high or low numbers of genes or counts? To exclude the possibility of a technical artifact in these observations, the authors should describe how they dealt with putative doublet cells or debris. Surprisingly, some clusters are characterized by the expression of specific chemoreceptors (VRs). Have these been used for clustering? If so, clustering should be repeated after excluding these receptors.</p>
<p>The identification of the VSN types should be consistent across the different analyses and validated. The data presented in Figure 1 lists four mature VSN types, whereas the re-clustering of neurons presented in Figure 3 leads to a different subdivision. At present, it remains unclear whether these clusters reflect the biology of the system or are due to over-clustering of the data, and therefore correspond to either noise or arbitrary splitting of continua. Clusters should be merged if they do not correspond to discrete categories of cells, and correspondence should be established between the different clustering analyses. To validate the detected clusters as cell types, markers characteristic of each of these populations can be evaluated by ISH or IHC.</p>
<p>There is a lack of quantification of imaging data, which provides little support for the ERrelated main claim. Quantification of co-expression and statistics on labeling intensity or coverage would greatly strengthen the conclusions and the title of the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>a) scRNA-seq data analysis methods: Our revised submission has expanded on the methods section with details of parameters, filtering criterion and software used.</p>
<p>b) Inclusion/exclusion of VRs: Figure 3-Figure supplement-2 of our revised submission shows a comparison of neuronal sub-clusters with and without VRs. Overall sub-cluster identities were not affected by VR exclusion, except for Gnao1 sub-clusters n1/n3 -governed by family C Vmn2r1/Vmn2r2 and redistribution of Gnai2 cluster n8. The minimal effect of VRs on Gnai2 sub-clustering can also be confirmed by lack of V1R in the dot plot showing markers of neuronal clusters.</p>
<p>c) Neuronal clusters and potential over-clustering: we pooled neuronal cells from Figure-1 and re-clustered to identify sub-populations within Gnao1 and Gnai1 neurons. Several neuronal sub-clusters identified by us including progenitors, immature neurons and mature neurons are validated by previous studies with wellknown markers. Amongst the mature neurons, the biological basis of four Gnao1 neuron sub-clusters (n1-n4) is discussed in our co-expression section (Figure 4AE) and these are also validated by previous experimental studies. These Gnao1 clusters are organized according to the expression of family-C V2Rs (Vmn2r1 or Vmn2r2) as well as H2M_v_ genes. Within Gnai2 sub-clusters, n12 and n13 exclusively express markers that distinguish them from n8-n11 which we have described in our revised version. However, n8-n11 do not have definitive markers and whether these sub-clusters are part of a continuum or over-clustered, will require further extensive experiments and analysis. We prefer to show all subclusters, including Gnai2 sub-clusters, in Figure 3-Figure supplement-1, along with a dot plot of sub-cluster gene expression, so that this data is available for future experiments and analysis.  We share the concern that some Gnai2 sub-clusters may not have an obvious biological basis at this time. Hence in our revised submission, we have merged mature Gnao1 and mature Gnai2 sub-clusters for the developmental analysis shown in Figure 3A.</p>
<p>d) Quantification of the ER phenotype: In our revised submission, we provide extensive quantification of the ER phenotype in Figure 7, Figure7-figure supplement-1.</p>
<p>e) We think that the cells expressing zero as well as two V1Rs are real and cannot be attributed to debris or doublets for the following reasons:</p>
<p>i) Cells expressing no V1Rs are not necessarily debris because they express other neuronal markers at the same level as cells that express one or two V1Rs. For instance, Gnai2 expression level across cells expressing 0, 1, 2 V1Rs is the same, which we have included in Figure 4-figure supplement 4-C of our revised submission. Higher expression threshold value used in our analysis may have somewhat increased the proportion of cells with zero V1Rs. Similarly, Gnao1 levels across cells expressing multiple V2Rs and H2-M_v_ per cell stay the same, indicating that these are unlikely to be doublets (Figure 4 I-K). The frequency of each co-expression combination (Supplementary Table 7 and 8) itself is an indication of whether it is represented by a single cell or an artifact.</p>
<p>ii) Cells co-expressing V1R genes: We listed the frequency of cells co-expressing V1R gene combinations in Supplementary table - 8. Among 134 cells that express two V1Rs, 44 cells express Vmn1r85+Vmn1r86, 21 express Vmn1r184+Vmn1r185, 13 express Vmn1r56+Vmn1r57, 6 express Vmn1r168+Vmn1r177, and so on. Doublets generally are a random combination of two cells. Here, each specific co-expression combination represents multiple cells and is highly unlikely by random chance. Some of the co-expression combinations we reported were also identified and verified experimentally in Lee et al., 2019 and Hills et. al., 2024.</p>

<p>We do not seek to claim additional branch points within mature Gnao1 or Gnai2 neurons from our analysis. Whether there exist additional branch points leading to subcategories within mature neurons, requires extensive experimental investigation.

<p>Multiple ER genes were found to be enriched in Gnao1 neurons. We would not be comfortable speculating on the function of individual genes, without a proper study, which is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p>

<p>(7) For figures with pseudo-colored expressions, it would be useful to have color bars. I'm also not sure the pseudocolors are necessary; presenting the data in grayscale or a single color like green might also be sufficient.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used pseudocolor in the IHC images of ER proteins, because there is a wide variation in the fluorescence signal intensity across apical to basal axis for various proteins. In some cases, gray scale images could lead to the false impression that there is no signal in apical Gnai2 neurons, whereas pseudocolor shows low fluorescence level in these neurons.

<p>Since no single color palette can help readers with different types of colorblindness, we decided to rely on user’s operating systems that offer rendering of the images to a color palette based on their type of colorblindness.

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Upregulation of ER-related mRNAs and expanded ER lumen in Gnao1-positive neurons is interesting, but the connection between these observations is unclear. The authors can strengthen the link by adding immunohistochemistry of representative ER proteins to test if the upregulation of mRNAs related to ER results in increased levels of these proteins in the ER of these neurons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Connection between scRNA-seq and EM was made due to our observations that levels of a number of ER luminal and membrane proteins were higher in Gnao1 compared to Gnai2 neurons (Figure 7, Figure 7-figure supplement-1 in our revised submission). This led us to hypothesize a differential ER content or ultrastructure, which was verified by EM. We have also addressed the question of whether upregulation of mRNAs related to ER proteins results in their increased levels (Figure 7-figure supplement-2). In some cases, for example Hspa5 (Bip), mRNA as well as protein levels are upregulated in Gnao1 neurons (see Figure 3A volcano plot, Figure 5-figure supplement-1 RNA-ISH, Figure 7-figure supplement-1 comparison of mRNA levels, Figure 7F immunofluorescence). However, there are other genes in the same figures, for which mRNA levels are not upregulated, yet protein levels are higher in Gnao1 neurons. As mentioned in our text and discussion, upregulated mRNA levels as well as post-transcriptional mechanisms are both likely to play a role in upregulating ER protein levels in Gnao1 neurons.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 3, the authors seemed to exclude cluster 13 from Figure1 in the pseudotime analysis without justification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Cluster13 has markers such as Obp2a, Obp2b, Lcn3. We confirmed via RNA-ISH (Figure 2-figure supplement-1A in our revised submission) that Obp2a maps to cells from glandular tissue on the non-sensory side. Cluster-13 also has cells expressing Vmn1r37, which typically is expressed in neuronal cells. However, we do not see Obp2a mRNA in the sensory epithelium. It is possible that cluster-13 comprises a heterogenous mixture of cells, some of which are non-sensory glandular cells, co-clustered with other cell types as well as the possibility that Obp2a is expressed in neurons, below the detection level of our assay. Further experiments will be required to distinguish between these possibilities. We do not have any possible reason to confidently assign this cluster as a neuronal cell type, hence, it was excluded in the downstream analysis of neurons.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We did not seek to give the impression that Gnao1 cells can be progenitors of Gnai2 cells.

<p>(7) The EM shown in Figure 5 makes this work unique and intriguing. However, the lack of quantification for the ER phenotype is a concern. For example, does the ER area of a given cell correlate with the relative position of the cells along the apical-basal axis of the vomeronasal organ? What about the ER morphology in the progenitor cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We show here a quantification of the ER area from the low magnification EM image shown in Figure 8A. The ER area shows an increase going towards the basal side of the cross-section. However, this quantification is complicated by the following factors: a) Processing for EM, results in some shrinkage of the tissue, b) Gnao1 neurons follow an invaginating pattern in cross-sections. Due to these reasons, some Gnao1 neurons could come very close to, and at times lie adjacent to Gnai2 neurons in EM cross-section. Due to a lack of contrast, it is harder to identify the ER within the cell at low mag, especially in the apical zone. The plot shown here does indicate that roughly, the ER area of a cell correlates with its position along the apical-basal axis. In our revised submission, we have quantified the fluorescence intensities of various ER proteins along the apical basal axis from confocal images (Figure 7, Figure 7-figure supplement-1).</p>

<p>Establishing ER ultrastructure in progenitor or immature cells, as well as unambiguous quantification of ER area in mature neurons, requires identification of these cells in crosssections using fluorescent molecular markers, followed by performing correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM). This procedure being technically challenging is beyond the scope of our manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The main claim is about ER differences between Gnao1+ and Gnai2+ VSN. The ISH, IHC, and EM microscopy images are not quantified and, therefore, poorly support this main claim.</p>

<p>In our revised submission, we provide extensive quantification of the ER phenotype in Figure 7, Figure7-Figure supplement-1.  Quantification of ER area from EM images is challenging and described above it in our response to reviewer #2 recommendation 7.</p>

<p>(2) The annotation of VSN subclusters should be more rigorous, consistent throughout the paper (VSN clusters are inconsistent between Figure 1 and Figure 3, and the multiplication of subclusters in Figure 3 is not discussed), and verified (using ISH or IHC) that they reflect discrete, actual cell types. The authors should provide a list of differentiating marker genes for the clusters in Figure 3. At present, it remains unclear whether these clusters are the result of over-clustering of cells (and therefore represent either noise or arbitrary splits of continua) or whether they reflect the biology of the system. Subsequent characterization of these curated VSN subtypes (as done in Figure 4) would add value to the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We pooled neuronal cells from Figure-1 and re-clustered at higher resolution to identify subtypes. Several neuronal sub-clusters identified by us including progenitors, immature neurons and mature neurons are validated by previous studies with well-known markers. Amongst the mature neurons, the biological basis of four Gnao1 neuron sub-clusters (n1n4) is discussed in our analysis and these are also validated by previous experimental studies. These Gnao1 clusters are organized according to the expression of family-C V2Rs (Vmn2r1 or Vmn2r2) as well as H2Mv genes. Within Gnai2 sub-clusters, n12 and n13 exclusively express markers that distinguish them from n8-n11 which we have described in our revised version. However, Gnai2 n8-n11 do not have definitive markers and whether these sub-clusters are part of a continuum or over-clustered, will require further extensive experiments and analysis. We prefer to show all sub-clusters, including Gnai2 sub-clusters, in Figure 3-Figure supplement-1, along with a dot plot of sub-cluster gene expression, so that this data is available for future experiments and analysis. We share the concern that some Gnai2 sub-clusters may not have an obvious biological basis at this time. Hence in our revised submission, we have merged mature Gnao1 and mature Gnai2 sub-clusters for the developmental analysis shown in Figure 3A.</p>

<p>(3) Some clusters are characterized by the expression of specific chemoreceptors (VRs). Have these been used for clustering? If so, clustering should be repeated after excluding these receptors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 3-Figure supplement-2 of our revised submission shows a comparison of neuron clusters with and without VRs. We also describe in the results, specific clusters that are affected by exclusion of VRs.</p>

<p>(4) Given the title and the data, the paper should be structured around its main claim (i.e. differential ER environment between VSN types). For example, Figure 7, which deals with the characterization of receptor expression and co-expression in VSNs, is sandwiched between the validation of ER substructure (Figure 6) and the timing of coexpression of ER chaperone genes (Figure 8). The data presented in Figure 7 would fit better if used as a validation of the dataset prior to the investigation presented in the current Figure 4. In addition, we suggest that expression and co-expression diagnostics should be used to filter cells for subsequent analyses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this suggestion and have reorganized the figures in our revised version.  Our subsequent analysis showing enrichment of ER related genes at RNA, protein level covers all Gnao1 neurons and is not restricted to a specific subset. This is reflected in the ISH and IHC of ER genes.</p>

<p>(5) Figure 7-Supplement 3 suggests the presence of co-expressed V1Rs in VSNs. It is unclear from the data presented whether these co-expressing cells are artifactual cell doublets and should be removed from the analysis or whether the expression of the coexpressed receptors reflects a reality. To better address this observation, one may want to see the expression levels of the individual co-expressed V1rs in Figure 7-Supplemet 3 rather than the sum of V1r expression. I am also concerned about the unusually high frequency of &quot;empty&quot; neurons (i.e. without expressed VRs). Could these be debris?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think that the cells expressing zero as well as two V1Rs are real and cannot be attributed to debris or doublets for the following reasons:</p>
<p>i) Cells expressing no V1Rs are not necessarily debris because they express other neuronal markers at the same level as cells that express one or two V1Rs. For instance Gnai2 expression level across cells expressing 0, 1, 2 V1Rs is the same, which we have included in Figure 4-figure supplement 4-C of our revised submission. Higher expression threshold values used in our analysis may have somewhat increased the proportion of cells with zero V1Rs. Similarly, Gnao1 levels across cells expressing multiple V2Rs and H2-M_v_ per cell stay the same, indicating that these are unlikely to be doublets (Figure 4 I-K). As doublets are formed randomly, the frequency of each co-expression combination (Supplementary Table 7 and 8) itself is an indication of whether it is represented by a single cell or an artifact.</p>
<p>ii) Cells co-expressing V1R genes: All cells used for co-expression analysis were filtered via an expression threshold (Figure 4-figure supplement 1D), which eliminates cells with low counts of V1R expression. We listed the frequency of cells co-expressing V1R gene combinations in Supplementary table - 8. Among 134 cells that express two V1Rs, 44 cells express Vmn1r85+Vmn1r86, 21 express Vmn1r184+Vmn1r185, 13 express Vmn1r56+Vmn1r57, 6 express Vmn1r168+Vmn1r177, and so on. Doublets generally are a random combination of two cells. Here, each specific co-expression combination represents multiple cells and is highly unlikely by random chance.  iii) Some of the co-expression combinations we reported were identified earlier and verified experimentally in Lee et al., 2019 using FACS based single collection in 96-well plates following the cellseq-2 protocol with very low chance of doublets, and Hills et. al., 2024.</p>

<p>(6) The authors use either dot plots or scatter plots to show gene expression in cell clusters. It looks nice, but it is very difficult to deduce population levels of expression from these plots. Could we see the distribution of gene expression across clusters using more quantitative visualizations such as violin or box plots?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Dot plots are majorly used in our manuscript to show markers of cell clusters in Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3-figure supplement 1. We would like to show at least 5 gene markers for each cluster that are important to identify the cell type. Using violin plot or bar plot for this will make the panel extremely big and overwhelming, especially with 16 clusters in Figure 1 and 13 clusters in Figure 3-figure supplement 1 or make the bars/violin too small to interpret.  Hence, for the sake of simplicity, we used dot plots to give our reader a birds-eye of gene expression differences across clusters. Scatter plots were used when we want to compare the expression levels of genes between male and female samples and show the expression of two genes (VRs) simultaneously in a single cell. This cannot be achieved by Violin/box plot. However, we have made our dataset available at scvnoexplorer.com to explore the expression patterns across cell clusters with different visualization options, including violin or box plots.</p>

<p>(7) To investigate whether sex might bias clustering, the authors calculated the Pearson coefficient of gene expression between sexes for each cluster. Given the high coefficient observed across all clusters (although no threshold is used), the authors conclude that there was no bias. While the overall effect may show a strong similarity in gene expression in each cluster between the sexes, this overlooks all the genes that are significantly differentially expressed. It would be worth investigating and discussing these differences. Relatedly, what batch correction method was applied to the data (to mitigate any possible sampling or technical effect)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We chose the Pearson coefficient as a representative parameter to show that there is no bias. In addition, we have performed differential expression analysis for each cluster and the results are in supplementary table-1. Except known sexually dimorphic genes, other genes are not differentially expressed significantly with adjusted p-values greater than 0.05. This was also shown by earlier studies using bulk RNAseq (doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004593, doi.org/10.1186/s12864-017-4364-4). We used depth normalization to integrate samples and described this in the methods section of our revised version.</p>

<p>(8) We found the method description to be incomplete for the single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. The method section should include a detailed explanation of the code used by the authors to analyze the data. The Seurat package has many available pipelines for single-cell RNA-seq analysis, which have a major impact on the output data. It is therefore imperative to describe which of these pipelines were used and whether the pipeline was run with default settings.</p>
