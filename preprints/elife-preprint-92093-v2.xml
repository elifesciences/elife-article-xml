<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Interacting molecules create regulatory architectures that can persist despite turnover of molecules. Although epigenetic changes occur within the context of such architectures, there is limited understanding of how they can influence the heritability of changes. Here I develop criteria for the heritability of regulatory architectures and use quantitative simulations of interacting regulators parsed as entities, their sensors and the sensed properties to analyze how architectures influence heritable epigenetic changes. Information contained in regulatory architectures grows rapidly with the number of interacting molecules and its transmission requires positive feedback loops. While these architectures can recover after many epigenetic perturbations, some resulting changes can become permanently heritable. Such stable changes can (1) alter steady-state levels while preserving the architecture, (2) induce different architectures that persist for many generations, or (3) collapse the entire architecture. Architectures that are otherwise unstable can become heritable through periodic interactions with external regulators, which suggests that the evolution of mortal somatic lineages with cells that reproducibly interact with the immortal germ lineage could make a wider variety of regulatory architectures heritable. Differential inhibition of the positive feedback loops that transmit regulatory architectures across generations can explain the gene-specific differences in heritable RNA silencing observed in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which range from permanent silencing to recovery from silencing within a few generations and subsequent resistance to silencing. More broadly, these results provide a foundation for analyzing the inheritance of epigenetic changes within the context of the regulatory architectures implemented using diverse molecules in different living systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Patterns formed by interactions between molecules can be preserved by living systems even as the molecules change over time. For example, the localization and activity of many kinds of molecules are recreated in successive generations during comparable stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. These recurring patterns can change throughout development such that following the levels and/or localizations of each kind of molecule over time traces waveforms that return in phase with the similarity of form and function across generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. At any time, interactions that can be used to predict future arrangements of molecules define regulatory architectures that drive change or preserve homeostasis. Such architectures that arose with the origin of life have since diversified through descent with modification to form the many heritable regulatory architectures that are now transmitted across generations along with the genome.</p>
<p>Interactors that form regulatory architectures can span many scales, but descriptions at particular scales are expected to be most useful for a given experimental technique or approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. For example, molecules can interact to form a complex that both provides output to and receives input from another complex, which in turn might be regulated by an organelle. Such interactions can be described as ‘top-down’ or ‘bottom-up’ based on the sequential order in which different levels of organization such as molecules, complexes, organelles, cells, tissues etc. are considered to create an explanatory hierarchy. Considering these multi-scale interaction networks in terms of entities, their sensors, and the sensed properties provides a flexible framework for analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] that can be used to progressively refine models (Fig. S1). In these entity-sensor-property (ESP) systems, all interactors of interest can be conveniently defined as entities with some entities acting as sensors. Such sensors can cause changes (either promotion or inhibition (Fig. S2A)) in the rest of the system or the environment in response to changes in particular properties of other entities. As a result, the regulatory architectures can be in different states at different times, depending on the levels of all entities/sensors (Fig. S2B). Some interactors have compositions that change over time (e.g., biomolecular condensates with molecules in equilibrium with other dissolved molecules in the surrounding liquid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]). Such dynamic interactors can be included by considering them as entities whose integrity and properties depend on the properties of some other entities in the system and/or the environment (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] for a similar definition for degrees of individuality). Defined in this way, all ESP systems capture regulatory architectures that could persist over time even as the interacting entities and sensors change. For example, a gated ion channel acts as a sensor when it responds to an increase in the intracellular concentrations of an ion with a change in conformation, allowing the import of other ions from the extracellular environment. During development, such an ion channel could be replaced by another with similar properties, allowing the persistence of the regulatory relationships. Therefore, the analysis of ESP systems is a useful approach for examining heritable regulatory architectures to inform mechanistic studies that aim to explain phenomena using relationships between specific interactors (e.g., epigenetic inheritance using small RNA, chromatin, 3D genome organization, etc.).</p>
<p>Heritability can be considered in multiple ways. In this work, for a regulatory architecture to be heritable, all interactions between different regulators need to be preserved across generations with a non-zero level of all entities in each generation. Additional notions of heredity that are possible range from precise reproduction of the concentration and the localization of every entity to a subset of the entities being reproduced with some error while the rest keep varying from generation to generation (as illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]). Importantly, it is currently unclear which of these possibilities reflects heredity in real living systems.</p>
<p>Here I consider the transmission of information in regulatory architectures across generational boundaries to derive principles that are applicable for the analysis of heritable epigenetic changes. Only a small number of possible regulatory architectures formed by a set of interactors are heritable. Their maintenance for many generations requires positive feedback loops. Such heritable regulatory architectures carry a vast amount of information that can quickly outstrip the information that can be stored in genomes as the number of interactors increase. Quantitative simulations of perturbations from steady state suggest that these architectures can recover after many epigenetic perturbations, but some resulting changes can become heritable. Transient perturbations reveal diagnostic differences between regulatory architectures and suggest ways to generate heritable epigenetic changes for particular architectures. Unstable architectures can become heritable through periodic interactions with external sources of regulation (e.g., somatic cells for architectures within the germline), revealing a strategy for making a wider variety of regulatory architectures heritable. Transgenerational inhibition that tunes the activity of positive feedback loops in regulatory architectures can explain the gene-specific dynamics of heritable RNA silencing observed in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

<title>Information in heritable regulatory architectures grows rapidly with the number of interactors</title>
<p>As cells divide, they need to transmit all the regulatory information that maintains homeostasis. This imperative is preserved across generations through a continuum of cell divisions in all organisms as evidenced by the similarity of form and function in successive generations. Such transmission of regulatory information across generations occurs in conjunction with the sequence information transmitted by replicating the genome during each cell division. The maximal information that can be transmitted using the genome sequence is proportional to its length (log<sub>2</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].<italic>l</italic> = 2<italic>l</italic> bits for <italic>l</italic> base pairs). To determine how the maximal information transmitted by interacting molecules increases with their number (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), the regulatory architectures that can be formed by 1 to 4 entities were considered. Perpetual inheritance of such regulatory architectures requires sustained production of all the interacting molecules, i.e., every interactor must have regulatory input that <italic>promotes</italic> its production to overcome dilution at every cell division and other turnover mechanisms, if any. Indeed, this requirement was fundamental for conceiving the origin of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] and remains necessary for its persistence. Therefore, the minimal heritable regulatory architecture (HRA) is that formed by two molecules that mutually promote each other’s production (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, ‘A’), resulting in a positive feedback loop. However, not all positive feedback loops form HRAs. For example, positive feedback loops that promote the transient amplification of changes such as that formed by two molecules that mutually repress each other’s production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] are not compatible with perpetual inheritance because both molecules will be eventually lost by dilution or turnover.</p>

<p>Distinct architectures that can be formed by a set of interacting regulators can be represented as directed graphs that are non-isomorphic and weakly connected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Imposing the need for positive regulation for heritability reveals that only 7 of the 13 possible 3-node graphs formed by 3 interactors can be HRAs and only 125 of the 199 possible 4-node graphs can be HRAs (see Methods for computation). Including either positive or negative regulation for each interaction in a HRA and then selecting only architectures that include positive regulatory input for every interactor resulted in non-isomorphic weakly connected directed graphs that represent the distinct regulatory architectures that are heritable (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>): two entities form one HRA, three form 25, and four form 5604. Thus, with four interactors, the maximal information that can be transmitted using HRAs (log<sub>2</sub>[5604] ≈12.45 bits) surpasses that transmitted by a four base-pair long genome (log<sub>2</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].4 = 8 bits). The combinatorial growth in the numbers of HRAs with the number of interactors can thus provide vastly more capacity for storing information in larger HRAs compared to that afforded by the proportional growth in longer genomes.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Genetic and epigenetic perturbations can generate different heritable changes</title>
<p>To examine how each of the 26 simplest HRAs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and Fig. S3) responds to a perturbation from steady state, ordinary differential equations that describe the rates of change of each entity in each HRA were developed (see Supplementary Information) and used to simulate steady states (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and Fig. S4 to S10). For each regulatory architecture, positive and negative regulatory interactions (green arrow and magenta bar, respectively, in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) are captured as linear functions (e.g., <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub>. <italic>y</italic> − <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>xz</italic></sub>. <italic>z</italic> if <italic>x</italic> is positively regulated by <italic>y</italic> and negatively regulated by <italic>z</italic>). To ensure the concentrations of all entities remain non-negative, as expected in real living systems, the equations for the rate of change are bounded to be applicable only when the values of the changing entity is greater than zero. At steady state, the concentrations of all interactors (<italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>z</italic><sub>0</sub>) remain constant because the combination of all regulatory input, which must cumulatively promote the production of each entity (with rates <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>yz</italic></sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>zy</italic></sub>, etc), is equal to the turnover of that entity (with rates <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub>, <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub>). In principle, a genetic or non-genetic (i.e., epigenetic) perturbation could alter one or more of the following: the concentration of an entity, the strength of a regulatory link, the rate of turnover of each entity, and the polarity of an interaction. Of these, the most widely used perturbation that is easy to accomplish using current experimental techniques is reducing the concentration of an entity/sensor (e.g., using a loss-of-function mutation, knockdown of an mRNA, degradation of a protein, etc.). Indeed, the use of genome editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] for removal and RNA interference (RNAi) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] for reduction of an entity/sensor are common during the experimental analysis of living systems. Therefore, the impact of permanent or transient loss of an entity was compared.</p>

</fig>
<p>To simulate genetic change, the response after removal of each entity/sensor was examined in turn for each HRA (Table S1, left panels in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, Fig. S4 – S10). Deviations from unregulated turnover of the remaining entities (dotted lines, left panels in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, Fig. S4 – S10) reveal the residual regulation and are diagnostic of different regulatory architectures. When the removed interactor was an entity with no regulatory input into the other sensors, the remaining two sensors were unaffected (e.g., left panel, loss of <italic>z</italic> in Fig. S4B, S4D, and S4E). Residual promotion resulted in slower decay (e.g., left panels, <italic>y</italic> in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, 2E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2H</xref>) and residual inhibition resulted in more rapid decay (e.g., left panels, <italic>x</italic> in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>; <italic>y</italic> in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>, <italic>z</italic> in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, 2D, 2E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2H</xref>). In some cases, when the remaining architecture was composed of two sensors that promote each other’s production, there was continuous growth of both because their new rates of production exceed their rates of turnover (e.g., left panels, <italic>z</italic> in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, S5B, S6B, S8B, S8C, S9B-D). In other cases, the remaining architecture resulted in slower decay of both because their new rates of production were insufficient to overcome turnover (e.g., left panels, <italic>z</italic> in Fig. S5A, S6A, S7A-D, S9A). Thus, genetic change can result in unrestrained growth or eventual decay of the remaining entities depending on the residual architecture (Fig. S2C).</p>
<p>To examine scenarios where epigenetic perturbations could cause heritable changes, the threshold for observing a defect was set at 0.5x of the steady-state levels (dotted line, right panels in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, Fig. S4 – S10). RNAi can cause detectable defects that are heritable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] and the conditions that promote or inhibit heritable epigenetic change after RNAi of a gene have been proposed to depend upon the regulatory architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. To simulate RNAi of an entity/sensor, the response after a transient reduction of each entity/sensor to 2x below the threshold required for observing a defect was examined in turn for each HRA (right panels in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, Fig. S4 – S10). The responses after this transient epigenetic perturbation were different from that after genetic perturbation (compare left and right in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and Fig. S4 – S10), as expected. Many HRAs recovered the levels of all entities/sensors above the threshold required for detecting a defect (e.g., right panels in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2H</xref>). In some cases, this perturbation was sufficient to maintain the architecture but with a reduced steady-state level of all entities/sensors (e.g., reduction of <italic>x</italic> in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, right; Fig. S4B-E, right; Fig. S5B, right; Fig. S8C, right). Notably, whether recovery occurs with the steady-state levels of each entity/sensor returning above or below the threshold for observing a defect depended not only on the architecture, but also on the identity of the perturbed entity/sensor (e.g., compare reduction of <italic>x</italic> vs. <italic>y</italic> in Fig. S4A, right; <italic>x</italic> vs. <italic>y</italic> or <italic>z</italic> in Fig. S4B, right; <italic>x</italic> vs. <italic>y</italic> or <italic>z</italic> in Fig. S4C, right). Transient reduction of other entities/sensors below the threshold for observing defects was also observed in many cases (e.g., levels of <italic>z</italic> when <italic>x</italic> was perturbed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, right; of <italic>z</italic> when <italic>y</italic> was perturbed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, right; of <italic>z</italic> when <italic>x</italic> was perturbed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, right; of <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> when <italic>z</italic> was perturbed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>, right). In some cases, recovery of original architectures occurred even after complete loss of one entity/sensor (e.g., after transient loss of <italic>z</italic> in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>, right; of <italic>y</italic> in Fig. S9B, right; of <italic>y</italic> in Fig. S9D, right). Such recovery from zero can be understood as re-establishment of the regulatory architecture within the duration of simulation (100 in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, Fig. S4 – S10) and is analogous to basal activity in the absence of inducers (e.g., leaky production of LacY permease from the <italic>lac</italic> operon in the absence of lactose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], which allows the initial import of the lactose required for activating the <italic>lac</italic> operon). Alternatively, such recovery can also be understood as arising from the production of the missing entity/sensor as a byproduct when the activity of the upstream regulator increases beyond a threshold. Transient perturbations were also observed to induce different architectures that can persist for many generations (e.g., transient reduction of <italic>z</italic> resulting in loss of <italic>y</italic> and mutually promoted growth of <italic>x</italic> and <italic>z</italic> in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>, right; also see Fig. S9E and S10A). Such continuous growth after an epigenetic change provides opportunities for achieving new steady states through dilution via cell divisions during development, potentially as part of a new cell type. Finally, some transient perturbations also led to the collapse of the entire architecture (e.g., transient perturbation of <italic>y</italic> in Fig. S10A, right). Thus, epigenetic change can result in unrestrained growth, eventual decay, or recovery at a new steady state level of the remaining entities depending on the residual architecture and the nature of the perturbation (Fig. S2D).</p>
<p>In summary, genetic and epigenetic perturbations from steady state can cause a diversity of changes in HRAs that constrain the possible regulatory architectures consistent with experimental data obtained by perturbing them. HRAs that are nearly indistinguishable by genetic perturbation can be distinguished using epigenetic perturbations, underscoring the complementary nature of genetic and epigenetic perturbations.</p>

<title>Changes in HRAs caused by single mutations form a sparse matrix</title>
<p>Just as mutations in a DNA genome can persist through replication at each cell division, changes in HRAs can persist by the formation of new positive feedback loops or the liberation of previously inhibited positive feedback loops. Six types of changes in sequence can arise from the four bases in a DNA genome upon mutation (A‹–›T, A‹–›G, A‹–›C, T‹–›G, T‹–›C, G‹–›C, with density of the change matrix = 1 [6/6]). To determine the analogous types of changes in regulatory architectures, the capacity for each of the 26 simplest HRAs (A to Z in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) to change into other HRAs was considered (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Single perturbations of any interactor (entity/sensor) could result in the loss of the interactor, loss of an interaction, or a change in the polarity of an interaction (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]). These perturbations could ‘mutate’ the HRA by either collapsing the entire architecture or stably changing it into a new HRA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Only changes that do not eliminate all positive regulatory inputs to an interactor can result in the persistence of a regulatory architecture rather than the eventual loss of one or more entities. Furthermore, since at steady state all gain of an entity/sensor is balanced by loss (via dilution at every cell division and/or other turnover mechanisms), any <italic>permanent</italic> reduction in the promotion of an entity/sensor will ultimately lead to its loss. Finally, if there is promotion of one sensor in a positive feedback loop and inhibition of another sensor in the same positive feedback loop, then the net input can be positive or negative depending on the relative magnitudes of the inputs. With these considerations, enumeration of the changed HRAs that can result from a perturbation revealed that the 26 HRAs can be mutated to generate 61 different changes (24 through loss of interaction alone, 21 through change in polarity of interaction alone, and 16 through either change in regulation or though loss of an entity, with density of the change matrix ≈ 0.19 [61/325]). Thus, unlike changes in DNA sequence, not all changes are immediately accessible among HRAs (change matrix of 1 vs. 0.19, respectively). Nevertheless, the heritable information transmitted using regulatory architectures is vast because even two or three interactors can form 26 heritable architectures that are collectively capable of 61 changes through single perturbations. This capacity is an underestimate because, single mutations can also result in the gain of new interactions that combine multiple HRAs into larger regulatory architectures with more interactors.</p>

<p>The constrained transition from one HRA at steady state to the next adjacent HRA through a single change (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) could skew the frequencies of different HRAs observed in nature and restrict the mechanisms available for development and/or evolution. For example, the HRA ‘A’ is accessible from 16 other HRAs but ‘C’ and ‘T’ are each accessible only from one other HRA (‘J’ and ‘U’, respectively). Furthermore, HRAs that rely on all components for their production (‘C’, ‘F’, ‘H’, ‘K’, and ‘T’) cannot change into any other HRAs from steady state without the addition of more positive regulation because any permanent loss in regulation without compensatory changes in turnover will result in the ultimate collapse of the entire architecture. These constraints can be overcome if change can occur through regulatory architectures that are not indefinitely heritable.</p>
<p>Deducing regulatory architectures from outcomes after perturbations is complicated by multiple HRAs resulting in the same HRA when perturbed (e.g., 16 HRAs can result in ‘A’ when perturbed, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). While measurement of dynamics after perturbations of <italic>each</italic> entity/sensor in turn can distinguish between all 26 architectures, the temporal resolution required is not obvious. This difficulty in accurate inference is apparent even for the simplest of perturbation experiments when inference relies only on end-point measurements, which are the most common in experimental biology. For example, a common experimental result is the loss of one regulator (<italic>x</italic>, say) leading to an increase in another (<italic>y</italic>, say), which is frequently interpreted to mean <italic>x</italic> inhibits <italic>y</italic> (Fig. S2E). However, an alternative interpretation can be that <italic>y</italic> promotes <italic>x</italic> and itself via <italic>z</italic>, which competes with <italic>x</italic> (Fig. S2E). In this scenario, removal of <italic>x</italic> leads to relatively more promotion of <italic>z</italic>, which leads to a relative increase in <italic>y</italic>. These equivalent outcomes upon loss or reduction of an entity in different architectures highlight the difficulty of inferring the underlying regulation after perturbation of processes with feedback loops. Therefore, simulations that enable exploration of outcomes when different interactors are perturbed at different times could enhance the understanding of underlying complexity, reduce biased inference, and better guide the next experiment.</p>

<title>Simple Entity-Sensor-Property systems enable exploration of regulatory architectures</title>
<p>The most commonly considered regulatory networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] are either limited in scope and/or are not causal in nature. For example, gene regulatory networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] consider transcription factors, promoter elements, and the proteins made as the key entities. Additional specialized networks include protein-protein interaction networks (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]), genetic interaction networks (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]), and signaling networks (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]). However, regulation of any process can rely on changes in a variety of molecules within cells, ranging from small molecules such as steroid hormones to organelles such as mitochondria. Furthermore, experimental studies often seek to provide explanations of phenomena in terms of a diversity of interacting entities. A common expression for all possible regulatory networks that preserves both causation and heritability can be derived by parsing all the contents of the bottleneck stage between two generations (e.g., one-cell zygote in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>) into entities, their sensors, and the sensed properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. An additional advantage of such entity-sensor-property systems is that it is possible to consider entities that are sensed by a particular sensor even via unknown intermediate steps, allowing for simulation of regulatory networks despite incomplete knowledge of regulators.</p>
<p>For a given genome sequence, the number of distinguishable configurations of regulators represented as entities and sensors is given by the following equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="544138v3_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where, <italic>e</italic> is the measured entity (total <italic>b</italic> in the bottleneck stage between generations: <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> in system, <italic>o</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> in environment), <italic>s</italic> is the measuring sensor (total <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> for <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> entity), which is itself a configuration of entities drawn from the total <italic>N</italic> per life cycle (i.e., <italic>f(Y)</italic>, with each <italic>Y</italic> ⊆{<italic>e</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub>, <italic>e</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub>, <italic>…, e</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub>}), and <italic>p</italic> is the attainable and measurable values of the property measured by the sensor (total <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> for the <italic>j</italic><sup>th</sup> sensor of the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> entity). An entity or configuration of entities is considered a sensor only if changes in its values can change the values of other entities in the system or in the environment at some later time.</p>
<p>The complex summation Σ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> <italic>e</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> Σ<sub><italic>j</italic></sub> <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> Σ<sub><italic>k</italic></sub> <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> can be simplified into a product of measurable property values of individual entities/sensors if the possible numbers of property values of every entity/sensor combination is independent:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="544138v3_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where, <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> = |{<italic>p</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>p</italic><sub>2</sub>, … <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>}| is the number of property values as measured by the <italic>j</italic><sup>th</sup> sensor of the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> entity. However, this upper limit is never reached in any system because regulatory interactions make multiple sensors/entities covary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. As a simple example, consider two sensors that activate each other in a Boolean network with no delay: the only possible values are {0,0} when both sensors are off and {1,1} when both sensors are on, because the mutual positive regulation precludes {0,1} and {1,0}.</p>
<p>Three simplifying assumptions were made to facilitate the simulation of regulatory networks with different architectures: (1) let the number of molecules be the only property measured by all sensors, (2) let each sensor be a single kind of molecule, and (3) let all entities be within the system. In these simple Entity-Sensor-Property (ESP) systems, the number of possible configurations is given by:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="544138v3_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where, <italic>e</italic> is the measured entity (total <italic>E</italic> in the system), <italic>s</italic> is the measuring sensor (total <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> for <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> entity), <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> is the attainable and measurable numbers of the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> entity, and <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> is the attainable and measurable numbers of the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> entity as measured by the <italic>j</italic><sup>th</sup> sensor. In such simplified ESP systems, a sensor is simply an entity in the system that responds to changes in numbers of an entity by changing the numbers of that entity or another entity. Whether downstream changes occur depends on the sensitivity of the sensor and the step-size of changes in property value (i.e., number) of the downstream entity/sensor.</p>
<p>The Entities-Sensors-Property (ESP) framework is not entirely equivalent to a network, which is much less constrained. Nodes of a network can be parsed arbitrarily and the relationship between them can also be arbitrary. In contrast, entities and sensors are molecules or collections of molecules that are constrained such that the sensors respond to changes in particular properties of other entities and/or sensors. When considered as digraphs, sensors can be seen as vertices with positive indegree and outdegree. The ESP framework can be applied across any scale of organization in living systems and this specific way of parsing interactions also discretizes all changes in the values of any property of any entity (Fig. S2F). In short, ESP systems are networks, but not all networks are ESP systems. Therefore, the results of network theory that remain applicable for ESP systems need further investigation.</p>
<p>To simulate ESP systems (e.g., <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) a hybrid approach with deterministic and stochastic aspects was used (see Supplementary Information for details). Specifically, the systems represented by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">equation (3)</xref> were simulated with random values for the numbers of each entity/sensor, the sensitivity of each sensor (i.e., the change in number needed to change a downstream entity/sensor), the step-size of changes in property (i.e., numbers changed per input from a sensor), and the active fraction (i.e., proportion that are available for interactions at any time). Only an arbitrary fraction of each entity (fixed over time) was simulated as active to account for processes such as folding, localization, diffusion, etc., that can limit regulatory interactions. Simulations were begun with a total of 500 molecules. A maximal increase of 5,000 molecules was allowed per cell cycle before each cell division to account for depletion of precursors, reactants, or building blocks (which were not explicitly simulated). The simulation was ended if total number of simulated molecules increased beyond a maximal number (500,000 in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) to account for the limited capacity of a cell. Thus, with each time step, the numbers of all entities/sensors changed deterministically based upon the randomly established initial regulatory architecture with stochastic changes in the numbers of each entity arising from the random order of evaluation at each time step and the reduction by ∼1/2 at the start of each cell cycle, which simulates experimentally observed noise (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]). With these parameters, regulatory architectures were simulated and the relative concentration of each entity/sensor was plotted over time (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). These profiles represent the change in ‘phenotype’ over time and are akin to measurements of relative RNA abundance using RNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] or relative protein abundance using proteomic approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Thus, ESP systems represent networks or graphs with weighted edges (because of the different activities of different sensors needed for the transmission of each regulatory change), complex nodes (because of the multiple properties of each entity/sensor), and transmission delays (because of the variation in the duration of each regulatory interaction). Notably, the relative concentrations of an entity can change over time (e.g., ‘c’ in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) while the underlying regulatory architecture is preserved (see Fig. S11, Movie S1, section titled ‘Exploration of Simple ESP Systems’ in Supplementary Information, and run ‘ESP_systems_single_system_explorer_v1.nlogo’ in NetLogo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] for exploration).</p>

<p>(A) An ESP system illustrating the stability of a regulatory architecture despite changes in the relative numbers of the interactors (entities/sensors) over time. <italic>Left</italic>, Simulation of an ESP system showing how interacting molecules create regulatory architectures. This system consists of four entities (a, b, c, d), where ‘d’ and ‘a’ are also sensors. Each sensor (red) sends regulatory input (grey, positive or black, negative) to increase or decrease another sensor or entity (blue). Numbers of each entity (i.e., its property value) change in fixed steps per unit time. The number of sensors needed to cause one unit of change in property differs for each regulatory input (lower number = thicker line, representing lower threshold for downstream change). Each entity is depicted with property step, active fraction, and number at the start of the first generation (gen 1) and at the end of the third generation (gen 3). <italic>Right</italic>, The relative numbers of the entities, which can be together considered as ‘phenotype’, can change over time.

<title>ESP systems differ in their susceptibility to heritable epigenetic changes</title>
<p>Explorations of ESP systems revealed that some systems can be stable for a large number of cell divisions (or equivalently generations) before the level of an entity/sensor becomes zero (e.g., system-id 62795 was stable for 59,882.5 generations (Fig. S12)). This long, yet finite duration of stability highlights the difficulty in claiming any architecture is heritable forever if one of its entities/sensors has low abundance and can be lost with a small probability. Systems responded to transient perturbations that reduce the levels of a randomly chosen entity/sensor in two major ways: Type I systems recovered relative levels of entities/sensors and maintained the same regulatory architecture; Type II systems changed by losing one or more entities, resulting in new relative levels of entities/sensors, and new regulatory architectures that persisted for many subsequent generations. These two types were observed even when the numbers of some entities/sensors were changed by just 2-fold for a few generations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> versus <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>For systematic analysis, architectures that could persist for ∼50 generations without even a transient loss of any entity/sensor were considered HRAs. Each HRA was perturbed (loss-of-function or gain-of-function) after five different time intervals since the start of the simulation (i.e., phases). The response of each HRA to such perturbations were compared with that of the unperturbed HRA. For loss-of-function, the numbers of one randomly selected entity/sensor were held at half the minimal number of all entities/sensors for 2.5 generations every 50 generations. This perturbation is like the loss of transcripts through RNA interference. For gain-of-function, the numbers of one randomly selected entity/sensor were held at twice the maximal number of all entities/sensors for 2.5 generations every 50 generations. This perturbation is like overexpression of a particular mRNA or protein. Of 225,000 ESP systems thus simulated, 78,285 had heritable regulatory architectures that remained after 250 generations (system-ids and other details for exploration of individual systems are in Table S2). These persistent systems included entities/sensors with relative numbers that changed over time as well as those with nearly constant relative numbers. For each number of interactors considered (2 to 16), only a fraction of the regulatory architectures were stable, plateauing at ∼50% of simulated systems with 10 or more entities/sensors (Fig. S13, <italic>top left</italic>).</p>
<p>This plateau is likely owing to the limit set for the maximal number of molecules in the system because most systems with many positive regulatory links quickly reached this limit. Although systems began with up to 16 entities/sensors, by the end of 250 generations, there was a maximum of ∼8 entities/sensors and a median of ∼4 entities/sensors in stable systems (Fig. S13, <italic>bottom left</italic>). Furthermore, an excess of positive regulatory links was needed to sustain a system with negative regulatory links (Fig. S13, <italic>right</italic>), with the minimal system that can sustain a negative regulatory interaction requiring three sensors, as expected. This bias reflects the inability of negative regulatory interactions alone to maintain regulatory architectures over time across cell divisions (Fig. S2G).</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Periodic rescue or perturbation can expand the variety of heritable regulatory architectures</title>
<p>Since the relative abundance of each entity/sensor is expected to trace a transgenerational waveform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] and to fluctuate with each time step, the relative timing of the perturbations (i.e., their phase) can impact the persistence of particular regulatory architectures. Specifically, entities/sensors with low numbers could be rescued from reaching zero by well-timed gain-of-function perturbations and those with high numbers could be rescued from arresting the simulation by well-timed loss-of-function perturbations. Therefore, the fractions of persistent ESP systems that showed heritable epigenetic change through loss of one or more entities were examined by starting with 2 to 16 molecules for each phase and type of perturbation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). As expected, only HRAs with a minimum of 3 entities/sensors at the start of the simulation showed heritable epigenetic changes. Fractions of HRAs showing heritable epigenetic changes were comparable across all perturbations for a given number of starting entities/sensors, with more such HRAs identified with increasing numbers of starting entities/sensors (compare <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, <italic>top, middle</italic>, and <italic>bottom</italic>). The variations in the numbers identified for different phases of perturbation when starting with a particular number of entities/sensors was comparable to the variation observed in systems that were not perturbed (compare <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, <italic>top</italic> with <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, <italic>middle</italic> and <italic>bottom</italic>), suggesting that no particular phase is more effective. Although some architectures were unaffected by all perturbations, many showed an altered response based on both the nature and phase of the perturbations. Consider the behavior of the illustrative example defined by system-id 46357 that begins with 5 entities/sensors (see Movie S2 to Movie S12). The unperturbed ESP system stabilizes with an architecture of 3 entities (of the type ‘E’ in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) until ∼74 generations, when one of the entities is lost and the new architecture (of the type ‘A’ in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) remains stable until ∼286.5 generations. However, perturbations yield a variety of different stabilities depending on phase and type of perturbation. Periodic loss-of-function perturbations with phase ‘0’, ‘3’, or ‘4’ resulted in stability of all 3 entities until collapse at ∼130.5, ∼181.5, or ∼99.5 generations, respectively. But, such perturbations with phase ‘1’ resulted in an earlier change from type ‘E’ to type ‘A’ with collapse at ∼193.5 generations and with phase ‘2’ resulted in a later change from ‘E’ to ‘A’ with collapse at ∼184.5 generations. On the other hand, periodic gain-of-function perturbations with phase ‘0’, ‘1’, ‘2’, or ‘4’ prolonged the type ‘E’ architecture until ∼306, ∼253, ∼212, or ∼708 generations, respectively, after which the new type ‘A’ architecture persisted beyond 1000 generations, by when the simulation was ended. However, such perturbations with phase ‘3’ preserved the type ‘E’ architecture until collapse at ∼311.5 generations.</p>
<p>Collectively, these results reveal that the heritability of regulatory architectures that are intrinsically unstable can be enhanced through interactions that alter the regulation of one or more sensors. Such external regulators could be part of the environment (e.g., periodic interactions such as circadian signals) or other cells (e.g., periodic interactions with somatic cells for regulatory architectures transmitted along a germline).</p>

<title>Organismal development can permit HRAs that incorporate interactions with somatic cells and intergenerational delays in regulation</title>
<p>While for unicellular organisms, each cell division results in a new generation, for multicellular organisms, transmission of heritable information across generations occurs along a lineage of cells that can include many cell divisions with periods of quiescence and interactions with somatic cells. The nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a well-characterized multicellular organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] that has many features such as the early separation of the germline during development, sexual reproduction, and the generation of different somatic tissues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, <italic>top</italic>), that can be incorporated into simulations and are useful for generalization to other animals, including humans. For example, 14 cell divisions are necessary to go from the zygote of one generation to the zygote of the next (Table S3). The loading of oocytes with maternal molecules in multiple organisms makes one generation of delay in regulation (i.e., maternal regulation) common, but such ancestral effects could last longer in principle (e.g., grandparental effects are easily imagined in humans because oocytes begin developing within the female fetus of a pregnant woman). Indeed, studies on RNA silencing in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have revealed long delays in regulation within the germline. For example, parental <italic>rde-4</italic> can enable RNA silencing in adult <italic>rde-4(-)</italic> progeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, loss of <italic>meg-3/-4</italic> can result in persistent RNA silencing defects despite restoration of wild-type <italic>meg-3/-4</italic> for multiple generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. However, examining the impact of such long delays and of interactions with somatic cells (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]) is computationally expensive. Therefore, to simulate regulatory architectures that persist from one zygote to the next while satisfying some of the known constraints of <italic>C. elegans</italic> lineage and development, the ESP simulator was modified to incorporate the observed timings of cell division versus growth along the germline (Table S3, based on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]) and allow a delay of up to 2 generations for the impact of a regulatory interaction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>

(B) Key control features for simulating HRAs that incorporate organismal timing of cell divisions and temporal delays in regulation. In addition to controls used in the single system explorer (Fig. S11A), the following sliders were added: one to set the number of generations of ancestors that can contribute regulation (ancestral-effect-generations, e.g., 2 for parental effects), one to set the probability of the regulatory origin for each interaction from one of the two sensors that form the positive feedback loop required for heritability (cyc1-vs-cyc2), and one to set the probability of the gene of interest being a sensor providing regulatory input into the positive feedback loop instead of an entity (gene-is-sensor).

Different relative delays in regulation (hours on arrows, maximum of 2x generation time to allow for the widely observed parental regulation) are also depicted.

<p>Since many genes expressed in the germline can be required for fertility or viability, the analysis of how they are regulated across generations poses a challenge. Following the behavior of a reporter across generations provides a proxy that can be used to understand transgenerational regulation in a relatively wild-type background (i.e., the tracer approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]). However, regulatory interactions that rely on the gene product will not be re-created by the reporter. For example, the mRNA sequence used to produce antisense small RNA of the gene will differ from that used for the reporter.</p>
<p>To simulate the regulation of a germline gene and its reporter, a modified ESP system is required. In addition to a minimal positive feedback loop required for heritability, positive and negative regulators that depend on <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences shared by both the gene and its reporter as well as such regulators that depend on the different products (e.g., the mRNA and/or protein of gene versus reporter) need to be simulated. Of the 10,000 such ESP systems simulated, 11 maintained all entities/sensors for 10 generations (Table S4). A representative such system (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>) forms a HRA that incorporates regulatory delays ranging from 0 to 171 hours and can persist for hundreds of generations. Examining the levels of all entities/sensors over the first 10 generations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>) reveals that despite starting at random values the HRA settles with a reproducible pattern during each generation (gen 2 onwards in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). The transgenerational waveforms traced by the relative numbers of all entities/sensors reveal periods of increased expression/activity for some entities/sensors during development (red asterisks in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), as observed for many genes expressed in the germline. Future studies that obtain data on key regulators with spatial and temporal resolution can be used to discriminate between different HRAs that drive the expression of different genes of interest.</p>

<title>Tuning of positive feedback loops acting across generations can explain the dynamics of heritable RNA silencing in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title>
<p>The simple fact that organisms resemble their parents in most respects provides evidence for the homeostatic preservation of form and function across generations. Yet, this ‘transgenerational homeostasis’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] is overcome in some cases such that epigenetic changes persist for many generations (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]). Indeed, DNA methylation patterns of unknown origin are thought to have persisted for millions of years in the fungus <italic>C. neoformans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Studies on RNA silencing in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]) provide strong evidence for heritable epigenetic changes in the expression of particular genes, facilitating analysis. When a gene expressed in the germline is silenced using double-stranded RNA of matching sequence and/or germline small RNAs called piRNAs, the silencing can last from one or two generations to hundreds of generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. The maintenance of RNA silencing across generations is thought to require a positive feedback loop formed by antisense small RNAs called 22G RNAs that are bound to the Argonaute HRDE-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>] and sense mRNA fragments processed into poly-UG RNAs (pUG RNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] that can act as templates for RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that synthesize the 22G RNAs. However, this mechanism does not explain the variety of effects that can arise when such genes with long-term silencing are exposed to other genes of matching sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. For example, when a gene silenced by disrupting RNA regulation within the germline (<italic>iT</italic>, a transgene with silenced <italic>mCherry</italic> sequences) is exposed to genes with matching sequences (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]), different outcomes are possible. After initial silencing <italic>in trans</italic>, the newly exposed genes can recover from silencing (<italic>mCherry</italic> and <italic>mCherry</italic>Δ<italic>pi</italic> in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) when separated from the source of silencing signals, but can be either continually silenced (<italic>mCherry/iT</italic> in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) or become resistant to silencing (<italic>mCherry</italic>Δ<italic>pi/iT</italic> in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) depending on the presence of intact piRNA-binding sequences despite the continued presence of the source. While this observation suggests that recognition of the target mRNA by piRNAs prolongs RNA silencing, loss of the Argonaute PRG-1 that binds piRNAs and regulates more than 3000 genes in the germline (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]) also prolongs the duration of heritable RNA silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Although the release of shared regulators upon loss of piRNA-mediated regulation in animals lacking PRG-1 could be adequate to explain enhanced HRDE-1-dependent transgenerational silencing initiated by dsRNA in <italic>prg-1(-)</italic> animals, such a competition model alone cannot explain the observed alternatives of susceptibility, recovery and resistance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Recent considerations of such competition for regulatory resources in populations of genes that are being silenced suggest explanations for some observations on RNA silencing in <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Specifically, based on Little’s law of queueing, with a pool of M genes silenced for an average duration of T, new silenced genes arise at a rate λ that is given by M = λT. However, this theory cannot predict which gene is silenced at any given time, why some genes are initially susceptible to silencing but subsequently become resistant (e.g., <italic>mCherry</italic>Δ<italic>pi</italic> in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>), and why the silencing of some genes can last for hundreds of generations. Thus, there is a need for understanding the origins of gene-specific differences in the dynamics of heritable epigenetic changes.</p>

<p>22G RNAs and pUG RNAs are experimentally measurable molecular markers whose levels are thought to be proportional to the extent of gene silencing (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]), although formally gene-specific regulatory features could influence this proportionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. To understand how the activity of the underlying positive feedback loop that maintains the levels of these RNAs could relate to the extent of observed silencing, the HRDE-1-dependent loop was abstracted into a minimal positive feedback loop with 22G RNAs and pUG RNAs promoting each other’s production (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). Ordinary differential equations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>) were developed for interdependent change in both RNAs by considering their rates of promotion (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub> for 22G and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>yx</italic></sub> for pUG) and turnover (<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> for 22G and <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub> for pUG). All molecules and chemical modifications that are necessary to maintain a positive feedback loop are sensors because they need to transmit the change from an ‘upstream’ regulator to a ‘downstream’ regulator. This 22G-pUG positive feedback loop thus represents mutual promotion by two sensors (i.e., the HRA ‘A’ in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). When any changed molecule or chemical modification is thus viewed as one component of a heritable regulatory architecture driven by a positive feedback loop, two criteria that impact the duration of epigenetic changes through the reduction of particular sensors are immediately suggested: (1) for every permanent change that is observed, all sensors that participate in the regulatory loop must be reduced to a level below that required for observing the change; and (2) for eventual recovery from a change, at least one sensor should be above the threshold required to drive the increase of all other sensors above their respective levels for observing the change. Consistently, a weak and brief reduction of 22G RNAs from steady state levels results in the eventual recovery of both 22G RNA and pUG RNA levels above the threshold required for them to be effective for silencing (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). Stronger (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, <italic>middle</italic>) or longer (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, <italic>right</italic>) reductions can result in new steady-state levels for both RNAs that are below the threshold required for silencing.</p>
<p>To obtain an analytic expression for how long heritable RNA silencing needs to be inhibited for eventual recovery, the impact of transient reduction in the activity of the 22<italic>G</italic>-<italic>pUG</italic> positive feedback loop from steady state ([22<italic>G</italic>]<sub>0</sub> and [<italic>pUG</italic>]<sub>0</sub>) was considered. Let <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. [22<italic>G</italic>]<sub>0</sub> or lower be insufficient for silencing and let 22G RNAs be transiently perturbed to <italic>p. d</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. [22<italic>G</italic>]<sub>0</sub> ≠ 0, where <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> &lt; 1 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1. The critical duration (<italic>t</italic><sub>22<italic>G</italic></sub>) of such a perturbation for permanent reduction of 22G RNA below the level required for silencing is given by
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="544138v3_eqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub> are the rates of turnover for 22G RNAs and pUG RNAs, respectively. Analogously, the critical duration (<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>pUG</italic></sub>) of such a perturbation for permanent reduction of pUG RNA below the level required for silencing is given by
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="544138v3_eqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub>. [<italic>pUG</italic>]<sub>0</sub> or lower is insufficient for silencing. Derivation of the general case for these equations (HRA ‘A’) is presented in supplementary information. These equations suggest that depending on the parameters of the architecture, different sensors may be more easily perturbed to cause heritable epigenetic changes. For example, for the same critical threshold below steady state (<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> = <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub> = 0.5) and the same extent of perturbation (<italic>p</italic> = 0.8), an architecture with [22<italic>G</italic>]<sub>0</sub> = 10, [<italic>pUG</italic>]<sub>0</sub> = 7.14, <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> = 0.05, <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub> = 0.1, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub> = 0.07, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>yx</italic></sub> = 0.0714, is more quickly inhibited by reducing 22G RNAs than by reducing pUG RNAs (6.93 vs. 27.72 units of time).</p>
<p>Combining these considerations with the observations that both piRNA binding to target mRNAs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) and loss of the piRNA-binding Argonaute PRG-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] prolong the duration of heritable RNA silencing suggests a unified mechanism that sets gene-specific durations of heritable RNA silencing. Specifically, the dynamics of recovery from silencing depends on the strength of an inhibitory feedback that can act across generations to reduce the HRDE-1-dependent positive feedback loop. This transgenerational inhibition relies on sensor(s) that are regulated by PRG-1 and is opposed by piRNA binding to the silenced mRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>This proposed mechanism implies the existence of sensor(s) that respond to the activity of the HRDE-1-dependent positive feedback loop by recognizing one or more of the molecules and/or chemical modifications generated. Consistently, a chromodomain protein HERI-1 has been reported to be recruited to genes undergoing heritable RNA silencing and is required to limit the duration of the silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Additional sensors are likely among the &gt;3000 genes mis-regulated in animals lacking PRG-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. The levels or activities of these sensor(s) could either increase or decrease in response to the activity of the HRDE-1-dependent loop depending on which of the multiple equivalent configurations of the negative feedback are present at different genes (expected to decrease in Fig. S14, <italic>left</italic> and <italic>right</italic>, but increase in Fig. S14, <italic>middle</italic>). However, in every case, the net result is a reduction in the activity of the HRDE-1-dependent loop (Fig. S12). Therefore, genes encoding such sensors could be among those that show increased mRNA levels (e.g., 2517 genes in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]) and/or that show decreased mRNA levels (e.g., 968 genes in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]) upon loss of PRG-1. Another set of genes that could encode similar sensors are those identified using repeated RNAi as modifiers of transgenerational epigenetic kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. Regardless of the identities of such sensors, differences in the transgenerational feedback that reduces some component(s) of the 22G-pUG positive feedback loop can explain the persistence of, recovery from, and resistance to heritable RNA silencing when different genes are targeted for silencing.</p>
<p>In summary, experimental evidence and theoretical considerations suggest that the HRDE-1-dependent positive feedback loop that generates 22G RNAs and pUG RNAs is tuned by negative feedback that acts across generations to cause different durations of heritable RNA silencing. Such tuning can explain silencing for a few generations followed by recovery from silencing as well as resistance to silencing. Future studies are required for testing the quantitative predictions on the impact of reducing 22G RNA or pUG RNA levels (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq. (4)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">(5)</xref>) and for identifying the PRG-1-dependent genes that could have roles in the transgenerational inhibition of heritable RNA silencing (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>).</p>

<title>ESP systems can be used to analyze many types of regulatory interactions</title>
<p>The simple ESP systems simulated here (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) can be extended to include a wide variety of properties to explore heritable epigenetic changes that can occur in cell/organelle geometry, phase separation, protein folding, etc. In general, each kind of molecule or entity can have multiple properties that are sensed by different sensors. For example, concentration, folded structure, primary sequence, and subcellular localization of a protein could each be measured by different sensors that respond by causing different downstream effects. If a protein (<italic>x</italic>) is regulated by three different regulators that each change its concentration (<italic>C</italic>), subcellular localization (<italic>L</italic>), or folded structure (<italic>F</italic>), then the protein <italic>x</italic> could be considered as having <italic>C, L</italic>, and <italic>F</italic> as values for its regulated properties. If the protein <italic>x</italic> in turn acts as a regulator that changes another entity <italic>y</italic>, then the activity of <italic>x</italic> regulating <italic>y</italic> could be simulated as a combined function of its concentration, localization and folded structure (i.e., activity of <italic>x</italic> = <italic>f</italic>(<italic>C, L, F</italic>)). Such simulations preserve both the independent regulation of different properties of a protein along with the potential equivalence in the activity of a higher concentration of partially folded proteins and a lower concentration of well-folded proteins. Thus, appropriate mapping onto an ESP system would enable the explanation of many phenomena in terms of regulatory architectures formed by any set of interactors while rigorously considering heritability.</p>

<title>A positive feedback loop can only support the inheritance of one property of an entity</title>
<p>While no entity can promote changes in all its properties by itself, some entities can promote changes in one of their properties through self-regulatory interactions under some conditions. For example, prions can act as replicating stores of information that template changes in the conformation of other proteins with the same sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>], although other properties of prions such as their concentration, subcellular localization, rate of turnover, etc. are determined through interactions with other entities/sensors. Such self-regulatory interactions for the control of some properties can be considered by allowing self-referential loops. Specifically, if the protein <italic>x</italic> above were a prion, then its properties will include <italic>C, L</italic>, and <italic>F</italic> as above, with the value of <italic>F</italic> changing with time as a function of both concentration and prior proportion folded (i.e., <italic>F(t+1) = g</italic>(<italic>C, F(t)</italic>)). Similar considerations underscore that any one positive feedback loop can promote only one property of an entity and not all of its properties. For example, consider small RNAs that are associated with gene silencing in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The targeting of a gene by small RNAs could be preserved in every generation through a regulatory loop whereby recognition of mRNA by antisense small RNAs results in the production of additional small RNAs by RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases. However, the mere existence of this feedback loop cannot explain the different concentrations of small RNAs targeting different genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>] or the different durations of persistent small RNA production when initiated experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Similar considerations apply for chromatin modifications, DNA modifications, RNA modifications, and all other ‘epigenetic marks’.</p>

<title>Mutability of epigenetic information changes non-monotonically with complexity</title>
<p>Inducing heritable changes in epigenetic information is more challenging than inducing similar changes in genetic information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Chemically altering a single molecule (typically DNA) is sufficient for inducing a genetic change, however, similarly altering one entity of a regulatory architecture (say, a protein) to induce an epigenetic change requires simultaneously altering the many copies of that entity without altering DNA sequence. All DNA bases with induced chemical changes are deleted or converted into one of the other bases by the replication and repair pathways. Consequently, only 6 different base exchanges are possible in DNA sequence through a single mutation, but even when only up to three interactors are considered, 61 different HRA changes are possible through a single mutation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Importantly, after a heritable change, the DNA sequence remains similarly mutable, but the impact of a change (genetic or epigenetic) on subsequent mutability of a regulatory architecture could increase or decrease. Consider a change that incorporates a new transcription factor into a regulatory architecture. If it is an activator, it could promote the expression of many genes leading to the incorporation of more RNAs and proteins into the regulatory architecture. Conversely, if it is a repressor, it could repress the expression of many genes leading to the removal of RNAs and proteins from the regulatory architecture. Either of these consequences could make the entire architecture more robust such that drastic perturbation is needed to cause observable change. When such robust architectures occur during development, the identity of a cell could become relatively fixed and heritable through cell divisions and yet remain compatible with specific natural [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>] and/or induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] cell fate transformations. Thus, such cell fate determination reflects the acquisition of different robust states, providing the appearance of a cell ‘rolling down an epigenetic landscape’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>].</p>

<title>Complexity of heritable regulatory architectures</title>
<p>Despite imposing heritability, regulated non-isomorphic directed graphs soon become much more numerous than unregulated non-isomorphic directed graphs as the number of interactors increase (125 vs. 5604 for 4 interactors, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). With just 10 interactors, there are &gt;3x10<sup>20</sup> unregulated non-isomorphic directed graphs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] and HRAs are expected to be more numerous. This tremendous variety highlights the vast amount of information that a complex regulatory architecture <italic>can</italic> represent and the large number of changes that are possible despite sparsity of the change matrix (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This number is potentially a measure of epigenetic evolvability – the ability to adapt and survive through regulatory change without genetic mutations. However, architectures made up of numerous interactors that are all necessary for the positive feedback loop(s) required for transmitting information across generations are more vulnerable to collapse (e.g., ‘C’ and ‘T’ in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Furthermore, spatial constraints of the bottleneck stage (one cell in most cases) present a challenge for the robust transmission of regulatory information. A speculative possibility is that complex architectures are compressed into multiple smaller positive feedback loops for transmission between generations with the larger HRAs being re-established through interactions between the positive feedback loops in every generation. Examples of such numerous but small positive feedback loops include small RNA-mediated, chromatin-mediated, and prion-mediated loops that specify the identity of genes for particular forms of regulation in the next generation. However, determining how the rest of the regulatory information is transmitted in each case and whether such compression with redundancy is a general principle of heredity require further study.</p>

<title>Information Density in Living Systems</title>
<p>Individual entities transmitted across generations can be considered as carrying part of the heritable information if such information is always seen in the context of the sensors that interact with the entity. While the maximal information that can be carried by DNA sequence is a product of its length (<italic>l</italic>) and the number of bits contributed by each base (2<italic>l</italic> = log<sub>2</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].<italic>l</italic>), the maximal number of relevant bits contributed by any entity - including the genome - depends on the number of states sensed by all interacting sensors (for <italic>I</italic> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="544138v3_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">equation (1)</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. The genome likely interacts with the largest number of sensors per molecule, making it the entity with the most information density. When a gene sequence is transcribed and translated, sequence information is transmitted from one molecule (DNA) to many (RNA(s) and/or protein(s)), thereby reducing the density of sequence information per entity (e.g., RNA or protein of a particular sequence). However, information is also added to these entities through the process of RNA folding and protein folding, which depend on interactions with the surrounding chemical and physical context (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]). The resultant structural (and potentially catalytic) specialization of RNAs and proteins provides them with additional properties that are relevant for other sensors, thereby increasing their information content beyond that in the corresponding genome sequence. Importantly, these proteins and RNAs can interact to create molecular complexes and organelles that again concentrate information in higher-order entities present as fewer copies within cells (e.g., centrosomes). Such complexes and organelles therefore are entities with high information density. In this view, the information density throughout a bottleneck stage connecting two generations (e.g., the single-cell zygote) is non-uniform and ranges from entities with very high density (e.g., the genome) to those with very low density (e.g., water). Beginning with the simplest of regulatory architectures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), progressive acquisition of entities and their interacting sensors would lead to the incorporation of regulators with increasing information density. An entity that is connected to numerous sensors that each respond to changes in a fraction of its properties can appear to be the chief ‘information carrier’ of the living system (e.g., DNA in cells with a genome). Thus, as heritable regulatory architectures evolve and become more complex, entities with a large number of sensed properties can appear central or controlling (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>] for similar ideas). This pathway for increasing complexity through interactions since before the origin of life suggests that when making synthetic life, any form of high-density information storage that interacts with heritable regulatory architectures can act as the ‘genome’ analogous to DNA.</p>

Systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) were used to describe the rate of change for each interacting entity (<italic>x, y, z</italic>) in each of the 26 heritable regulatory architectures (A to Z) with the relative amounts of all entities at any time defined as the ‘phenotype’ at that time. Each regulatory architecture is characterized by a maximum of 9 parameters in addition to the relative amounts of each entity: a rate of turnover for each entity (3 total; <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub>, <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub>) and rates for each regulatory interaction between entities (6 total; e.g., <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub> is the regulatory input to <italic>x</italic> from <italic>y, k</italic><sub><italic>yz</italic></sub> is the regulatory input to <italic>y</italic> from <italic>z</italic>, etc.). Relative amounts of each interacting entity for each architecture at steady state (<italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>z</italic><sub>0</sub>) were determined by setting all rate equations to zero, which results in constraints on the variables for each architecture (e.g., for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="544138v3_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="544138v3_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> etc.). These constraints were used to obtain a total of 128,015 parameter sets (<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub>, <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>yz</italic></sub>, etc.) that are compatible with steady state for each architecture (Table S1). Particular parameter sets were then used to illustrate the consequences of genetic and epigenetic changes in all architectures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and Figs. S4 – S10). The simpler expressions for steady-state levels for all regulatory architectures when there are no turnover mechanisms for any entities and the only ‘turnover’ occurs by dilution upon cell division (<italic>T</italic> = <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> = <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub> = <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub>) were derived (see supplementary information). Expressions for steady state values when all entities are lost at a constant rate to complex formation (γ) and for changes upon complete loss of an entity were also derived (see supplementary information).</p>
<p>The impacts of transient perturbations from steady state were examined for each architecture to identify conditions for heritable epigenetic change by defining thresholds (<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub>, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub>) for observing a defect for each entity (e.g., for the function of <italic>x, d</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> is not sufficient, when <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> &lt; 1, or <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> is in excess, when</p>
<p><italic>d</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> &gt; 1). Responses after perturbations are illustrated for all architectures (Figs. S4 to S10) and cases where genetic and epigenetic perturbations result in distinct responses are highlighted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The duration and extent of perturbation needed for heritable epigenetic changes were explored using numerical solutions of the equations describing the dynamics of each regulatory architecture. Explorations of 22G-pUG positive feedback loop were similarly performed by simulating a type ‘A’ HRA using ODEs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Analytical expressions for conditions that enable heritable epigenetic change were derived for the simplest heritable regulatory architecture where two entities (<italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic>) mutually promote each other’s production. Transitions between HRAs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) were worked out manually by considering the consequence of each change from steady state for each HRA.</p>

<title>Analysis of entity-sensor-property systems</title>
<p>Simple ESP systems were simulated using custom programs in NetLogo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>](details are available within the ‘code’ and ‘info’ tabs of each program). Results from systematic explorations obtained by running NetLogo programs from the command line (i.e., ‘headless’) were analyzed using R (e.g., <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, Fig. S13). The developmental timing of cell division is <italic>C. elegans</italic> were curated manually from the literature (Table S3) and used to simulate ESP systems that incorporate this developmental timing and temporal delays in regulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Supplementary movies (Movie S1 – S13) were made by recording screen captures of NetLogo runs using QuickTime Player.</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> manuscript explores conditions for epigenetic inheritance by studying the stability of simple network models to permanent and transient perturbations. A novel aspect of the study is that it unifies non-genetic inheritance phenomena across cell divisions of unicellular organisms and in the germline of multicellular organisms. However, the models studied are more a collection of vignettes of numerical studies than a systematic study, therefore the evidence presented remains <bold>incomplete</bold>. As a first step towards building a more systematic theoretical framework, this work will be of interest to colleagues in the field of epigenetic inheritance.</p>

<p>The author studies a family of models for heritable epigenetic information, with a focus on enumerating and classifying different possible architectures. The key aspects of the paper are:</p>
<p>- Enumerate all 'heritable' architectures for up-to 4 constituents.</p>
<p>
- A study of whether permanent (&quot;genetic&quot;) or transient (&quot;epigenetic&quot;) perturbations lead to heritable changes</p>
<p>
- Enumerated the connectivity of the &quot;sequence space&quot; formed by these heritable architectures</p>
<p>
- Incorporating stochasticity, the authors explore stability to noise (transient perturbations)</p>
<p>
- A connection is made with experimental results on C elegans.</p>
<p>The study is timely, as there is a renewed interest in the last decade in non-genetic, heritable heterogeneity (e.g., from single-cell transcriptomics). Consequently, there is a need for a theoretical understanding of the constraints on such systems. There are some excellent aspects of this study: for instance, the attention paid to how one architecture &quot;mutates&quot; into another. Unfortunately, the manuscript as a whole does not succeed in formalising nor addressing any particular open questions in the field. Aside from issues in presentation and modelling choices (detailed below), it would benefit greatly from a more systematic approach rather than the vignettes presented.</p>
<p>## Terminology</p>
<p>The author introduces a terminology for networks of interacting species in terms of &quot;entities&quot; and &quot;sensors&quot; -- the former being nodes of a graph, and the latter being those nodes that receive inputs from other nodes. In the language of directed graphs, &quot;entities&quot; would seem to correspond to vertices, and &quot;sensors&quot; those vertices with positive indegree and outdegree. Unfortunately, the added benefit of redefining accepted terminology from the study of graphs and networks is not clear.</p>
<p>## Model</p>
<p>The model seems to suddenly change from Figure 4 onwards. While the results presented here have at least some attempt at classification or statistical rigour (i.e. Fig 4 D), there are suddenly three values associated with each entity (&quot;property step, active fraction, and number&quot;). Furthermore, the system suddenly appears to be stochastic. The reader is left unsure what has happened, especially after having made the effort to deduce the model as it was in Figs 1 through 3. No respite is to be found in the SI, either, where this new stochastic model should have been described in sufficient detail to allow one to reproduce the simulation.</p>
<p>## Perturbations</p>
<p>Inspired especially by experimental manipulations such as RNAi or mutagenesis, the author studies whether such perturbations can lead to a heritable change in network output. While this is naturally the case for permanent changes (such as mutagenesis), the author gives convincing examples of cases in which transient perturbations lead to heritable changes. Presumably, this is due the the underlying multistability of many networks, in which a perturbation can pop the system from one attractor to another.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there appears to be no attempt at a systematic study of outcomes, nor a classification of when a particular behaviour is to be expected. Instead, there is a long and difficult-to-read description of numerical results that appear to have been sampled at random (in terms of both the architecture and parameter regime chosen). The main result here appears to be that &quot;genetic&quot; (permanent) and &quot;epigenetic&quot; (transient) perturbations can differ from each other -- and that architectures that share a response to genetic perturbation need not behave the same under an epigenetic one. This is neither surprising (in which case even illustrative evidence would have sufficed) nor is it explored with statistical or combinatorial rigour (e.g. how easy is it to mistake one architecture for another? What fraction share a response to a particular perturbation?)</p>
<p>As an additional comment, many of the results here are presented as depending on the topology of the network. However, each network is specified by many kinetic constants, and there is no attempt to consider the robustness of results to changes in parameters.</p>
<p>## DNA analogy</p>
<p>At two points, the author makes a comparison between genetic information (i.e. DNA) and epigenetic information as determined by these heritable regulatory architectures. The two claims the author makes are that (i) heritable architectures are capable of transmitting &quot;more heritable information&quot; than genetic sequences, and (ii) that, unlike DNA, the connectivity (in the sense of mutations) between heritable architectures is sparse and uneven (i.e. some architectures are better connected than others).</p>
<p>In both cases, the claim is somewhat tenuous -- in essence, it seems an unfair comparison to consider the basic epigenetic unit to be an &quot;entity&quot; (e.g., an entire transcription factor gene product, or an organelle), while the basic genetic unit is taken to be a single base-pair. The situation is somewhat different if the relevant comparison was the typical size of a gene (e.g., 1 kb).</p>

Aside from issues in presentation and modelling choices (detailed below), it would benefit greatly from a more systematic approach rather than the vignettes presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Despite being foundational, this work was systematic in that (1) for the simple architectures modeled using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with continuity assumptions, parameters that support steady states were systematically determined for each architecture and then every architecture was explored using genetic changes exhaustively, although epigenetic perturbations were not examined exhaustively because of their innumerable variety; and (2) for the more realistic modeling of architectures as Entity-Sensor-Property systems, the behavior of systems with respect to architecture as well as parameter space that lead to particular behaviors (persistence, heritable epigenetic change, etc.) was systematically explored. A more extensive exploration of parameter space that also includes the many ways that the interaction between any two entities/nodes could be specified using an equation is a potentially ever-expanding challenge that is beyond the scope of any single paper.</p>
<p>Specific aspects that remain to be addressed include the application of multiple notions of heritability to real networks of arbitrary size, considering different types of equations for change of each entity/node, and classifying different behavioral regimes for different sets of parameters.</p>
<p>The key contribution of the paper is an articulation of the crucial questions to ask of any regulatory architecture in living systems rather than the addressing of any question that a field has recognized as ‘open’. Specifically, through the exhaustive listing of small regulatory architectures that can be heritable and the systematic analysis of arbitrary Entity-Sensor-Property systems that more realistically capture regulatory architectures in living systems, this work points the way to constrain inferences after experiments on real living systems. Currently, most experimental biologists engaged in reductionist approaches and some systems biologists examining the function or prevalence of network motifs do not explicitly constrain their models for heritability or persistence. It is hoped that this paper will raise awareness in both communities and lead to more constrained models that minimize biases introduced by incomplete knowledge of the network, which is always the case when analyzing living systems.</p>

<p>Terminology</p>
<p>The author introduces a terminology for networks of interacting species in terms of &quot;entities&quot; and &quot;sensors&quot; -- the former being nodes of a graph, and the latter being those nodes that receive inputs from other nodes. In the language of directed graphs, &quot;entities&quot; would seem to correspond to vertices, and &quot;sensors&quot; those vertices with positive indegree and outdegree. Unfortunately, the added benefit of redefining accepted terminology from the study of graphs and networks is not clear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Entities-Sensors-Property (ESP) framework is based on underlying biology and not graph theory, making an ESP system not entirely equivalent to a network or graph, which is much less constrained. The terms ‘entity’, ‘sensor’, and ‘property’ were defined and justified in a previous paper (Jose, J R. Soc. Interface, 2020). While nodes of a network can be parsed arbitrarily and the relationship between them can also be arbitrary, entities and sensors are molecules or collections of molecules that are constrained such that the sensors respond to changes in particular properties of other entities and/or sensors. When considered as digraphs, sensors can be seen as vertices with positive indegree and outdegree. The ESP framework can be applied across any scale of organization in living systems and this specific way of parsing interactions also discretizes all changes in the values of any property of any entity. In short, ESP systems are networks, but not all networks are ESP systems. Therefore, the results of network theory that remain applicable for ESP systems need further investigation.</p>
<p>The key utility of the ESP framework is that it is aligned with the development of mechanistic models for the functions of living systems while being consistent with heredity. In contrast, widely analyzed networks like protein-interaction networks, signaling networks, gene regulatory networks, etc., are not always constrained using these principles.</p>

<p>Model</p>
<p>The model seems to suddenly change from Figure 4 onwards. While the results presented here have at least some attempt at classification or statistical rigour (i.e. Fig 4 D), there are suddenly three values associated with each entity (&quot;property step, active fraction, and number&quot;). Furthermore, the system suddenly appears to be stochastic. The reader is left unsure what has happened, especially after having made the effort to deduce the model as it was in Figs 1 through 3. No respite is to be found in the SI, either, where this new stochastic model should have been described in sufficient detail to allow one to reproduce the simulation.</p>

<p>The Supplementary Information section titled ‘Simulation of simple ESP systems’ provides the requested detailed information and revisions to the writing provide the biologically grounded justification for parsing interacting regulators as ESP systems.</p>

<p>Perturbations</p>
<p>Inspired especially by experimental manipulations such as RNAi or mutagenesis, the author studies whether such perturbations can lead to a heritable change in network output. While this is naturally the case for permanent changes (such as mutagenesis), the author gives convincing examples of cases in which transient perturbations lead to heritable changes. Presumably, this is due the the underlying multistability of many networks, in which a perturbation can pop the system from one attractor to another.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there appears to be no attempt at a systematic study of outcomes, nor a classification of when a particular behaviour is to be expected. Instead, there is a long and difficult-to-read description of numerical results that appear to have been sampled at random (in terms of both the architecture and parameter regime chosen). The main result here appears to be that &quot;genetic&quot; (permanent) and &quot;epigenetic&quot; (transient) perturbations can differ from each other -- and that architectures that share a response to genetic perturbation need not behave the same under an epigenetic one. This is neither surprising (in which case even illustrative evidence would have sufficed) nor is it explored with statistical or combinatorial rigour (e.g. how easy is it to mistake one architecture for another? What fraction share a response to a particular perturbation?)</p>
<p>As an additional comment, many of the results here are presented as depending on the topology of the network. However, each network is specified by many kinetic constants, and there is no attempt to consider the robustness of results to changes in parameters.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The systematic study of all arbitrary regulatory architectures is beyond the scope of this paper and, indeed, beyond the scope of any one paper. Nevertheless 225,000 arbitrary Entity-Sensor-Property systems were systematically explored and collections of parameters that lead to different behaviors provided (e.g., 78,285 are heritable). These ESP systems more closely mimic regulation in living systems than the coupled ODE-based specification of change in a regulatory architecture.</p>
<p>The example questions raised here are not only difficult to answer, but subjective and present a moving target for future studies. One, ‘how easy is it to mistake one architecture for another?’. Mistaking one architecture for another clearly depends on the number of different types of experiments one can perform on an architecture and the resolution with which changes in entities can be measured to find distinguishing features. Two, ‘What fraction share a response to a particular perturbation?’. ‘Sharing a response’ also depends on the resolution of the measurement after perturbation.</p>

<p>DNA analogy</p>
<p>At two points, the author makes a comparison between genetic information (i.e. DNA) and epigenetic information as determined by these heritable regulatory architectures. The two claims the author makes are that (i) heritable architectures are capable of transmitting &quot;more heritable information&quot; than genetic sequences, and (ii) that, unlike DNA, the connectivity (in the sense of mutations) between heritable architectures is sparse and uneven (i.e. some architectures are better connected than others).</p>
<p>In both cases, the claim is somewhat tenuous -- in essence, it seems an unfair comparison to consider the basic epigenetic unit to be an &quot;entity&quot; (e.g., an entire transcription factor gene product, or an organelle), while the basic genetic unit is taken to be a single base-pair. The situation is somewhat different if the relevant comparison was the typical size of a gene (e.g., 1 kb).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Considering every base being the unit of stored information in the DNA sequence results in the maximal possible storage capacity of a genome of given length. Any other equivalence between entity and units within the genome (e.g., 1 kb gene) will only reduce the information stored in the genome.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the claim was modified to say that the information content of an ESP system can [italics added] be more extensive than the information content of the genome. This accounts for the possibility of an organism that has an inordinately large genome such that maximal information that can be stored in a particular genome sequence exceeds that stored in a particular configuration of all the contents in a cell.</p>
<p>I thank the reviewer for providing further explanation of this misunderstanding in the second round of review, which helps draw future readers to the sections in the paper that discusses this important point (also see response to Recommendations for the authors).</p>

<p>I thank the author for their efforts in replying to the comments. I have updated my review accordingly; in particular, I have:</p>

<p>(2) Removed issues with the presentation of the ODE model in the supplementary information.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I thank the reviewer for raising these issues and acknowledging the improvements made.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>However, given that the manuscript is broadly unchanged from the initial one, many of my prior comments remain justified. Some key points:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript continues to be difficult to read, for the same reasons as I mentioned when reviewing the paper previously.</p>
<p>(2) The utility of the &quot;ESP&quot; formalism is still unclear.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">

<list-item><p>This seems little reason to reject ODEs and implement a poorly defined formalism/simulation scheme.</p>

<p>(3) The author claims that many questions raised are &quot;beyond the scope of this study&quot;. Indeed, answering all of these questions are beyond the scope of any one study. However, as I initially wrote, the paper would be much stronger if it focused on a particular problem rather than the many vignettes depicted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The broad scope of this foundational paper necessitates addressing many issues, which may make it a difficult read for some readers. I hope that future work where each paper focuses on one of the aspects raised here will enable the extensive treatment of limited scope as suggested by the reviewer.</p>
<p>The utility of ODEs is much appreciated and was indeed a computationally efficient way of exploring the vast space of regulatory architectures. As stated in the response to the public reviews, the Entity-Sensors-Property framework provides a biologically grounded way of parsing interacting regulators. This approach is aligned with the development of mechanistic models for the functions of living systems while being consistent with heredity. In contrast, widely analyzed networks like protein-interaction networks, signaling networks, gene regulatory networks, etc., are not always constrained using these principles.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>On a final note, on the subject of the comparison with DNA:</p>
<p>Perhaps I have misunderstood something. I simply meant that comparing the &quot;maximal information&quot; with 4 HRAs (12.45 bits) is certainly more than the &quot;maximal information&quot; with 4 basepairs (8 bits), but definitely less than the &quot;maximal information&quot; for four 1-kb genes (4^(4000) combinations, so 8000 bits...)</p>
<p>Perhaps the author means that the growth in information of HRAs is faster than exponential. If so, that should be shown and then remarked on.</p>
<p>For this reason, I maintain my comment that the comparison is tenuous.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This issue was addressed once in the results section and again in the discussion section.</p>
<p>The results section states that “The combinatorial growth in the numbers of HRAs with the number of interactors can thus provide vastly more capacity for storing information in larger HRAs compared to that afforded by the proportional growth in longer genomes.”</p>
<p>The discussion section states that “Despite imposing heritability, regulated non-isomorphic directed graphs soon become much more numerous than unregulated non-isomorphic directed graphs as the number of interactors increase (125 vs. 5604 for 4 interactors, Table 1). With just 10 interactors, there are &gt;3x1020 unregulated non-isomorphic directed graphs [60] and HRAs are expected to be more numerous. This tremendous variety highlights the vast amount of information that a complex regulatory architecture can represent and the large number of changes that are possible despite sparsity of the change matrix (Fig. 3).”</p>
<p>Thus, indeed as the reviewer surmises, the combinatorial explosion in information of HRAs with increases in interacting entities is faster than the proportional growth in information of genome sequence with increases in length.</p>

<p>Heritability</p>
<p>The primary goal of the paper is to analyse the properties of those networks that constitute &quot;heritable regulatory architectures&quot;. The definition of heritability is not clearly stated anywhere in the paper, but it appears to be that the steady-state of the network must have a non-zero expression of every entity. As this is the heart of the paper, it would be good to have the definition of heritable laid out clearly in either the main text or the SI.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I have now defined the term as used in this paper early, which is indeed as surmised by the reviewer simply the preservation of the architecture and non-zero levels of all entities. I have also highlighted additional notions of heredity that are possible, which will be the focus of future work. These can range from precise reproduction of the concentration and the localization of every entity to a subset of the entities being reproduced with some error while the rest keep varying from generation to generation (as illustrated in Fig. 2 of Jose, BioEssays, 2018). Importantly, it is currently unclear which of these possibilities reflects heredity in real living systems.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Model</p>
<p>As described in the supplementary, but not in the main text, the author first chooses to endow these networks with simple linear dynamics; something like $\partial_t \vec{x} = A x - T x$, where the vector $x$ is the expression level of each entity, $A$ has the structure of the adjacency matrix of the directed graph, and $T$ is a diagonal matrix with positive entries that determines the degradation or dilution rate of each entity. From a readability standpoint, it would greatly aid the reader if the long list of equations in the SI were replaced with the simple rule that takes one from a network diagram to a set of ODEs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I have abridged the description by eliminating the steady state expression for every HRA as suggested and simply pointed to the earlier version of the paper for those readers who might prefer the explicit derivations of these simple expressions. An overview is now provided for going from any network diagram to a set of ODEs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The implementation of negative regulation is manifestly unphysical if the &quot;entities&quot; represent the expression level of, say, gene products. For instance, in regulatory network E, the value of the variable z can go negative (for instance, if the system starts with z= and y=0, and x &gt; 0).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Negative values for any entity were avoided in simulations by explicitly setting all such values to zero. This constraint has been added as a note in the section describing the equations for the change of each node/entity in each regulatory network. Specifically, the levels of each entity/sensor was set to zero during any time step when the computed value for that entity/sensor was less than zero. This bounding of the function allows for any approach to zero while avoiding negative values. I apologize for the omission of this constraint from the supplemental material in the last submission. This constraint was used in all the simulations and therefore this change does not affect any of the results presented. In this way, it is ensured that the presence of negative regulation does not lead to negative values.</p>
<p>Formally, the promotion or inhibition of an entity or sensor can be modeled using any function that is either increasing (for promotion) or decreasing (for inhibition). This diversity of possibilities is one of the challenges that prevents exhaustive exploration of all functions. In fact, the use of ODEs after assuming a continuous function is an idealization that facilitates understanding of general principles but is not in keeping with the discreteness of entities or step changes in their values (amount, localization, etc.) observed in living systems. Other commonly used continuous functions include Hill functions for the rate of production of y given as xn/(k + xn) for x activating y, which increases to ~1 as x increases, or given as k/(k + xn) for x inhibiting y, which decreases to ~0 as x increases. Increasing values of ‘n’ result in steeper sigmoidal curves. In reality, levels of all entities/sensors are expected to be discretized by measurement in living systems and the form of the function for any regulation needs empirical measurement in vivo (see response to comment below).</p>

<p>The model seems to suddenly change from Figure 4 onwards. While the results presented here have at least some attempt at classification or statistical rigour (i.e. Fig 4 D), there are suddenly three values associated with each entity (&quot;property step, active fraction, and number&quot;). Furthermore, the system suddenly appears to be stochastic. The reader is left unsure of what has happened, especially after having made the effort to deduce the model as it was in Figs 1 through 3. No respite is to be found in the SI, either, where this new stochastic model should have been described in sufficient detail to allow one to reproduce the simulation.</p>

<p>While ODEs are easier to simulate and understand, they are less realistic as explained above.

In other words, architectures that can be heritable for some set of parameters. Of course, parameter sets can be found that make any regulatory architecture not heritable.

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript uses an interesting abstraction of epigenetic inheritance systems as partially stable states in biological networks. This follows on previous review/commentary articles by the author. Most of the molecular epigenetic inheritance literature in multicellular organisms implies some kind of templating or copying mechanisms (DNA or histone methylation, small RNA amplification) and does not focus on stability from a systems biology perspective. By contrast, theoretical and experimental work on the stability of biological networks has focused on unicellular systems (bacteria), and neglects development. The larger part of the present manuscript (Figures 1-4) deals with such networks that could exist in bacteria. The author classifies and simulates networks of interacting entities, and (unsurprisingly) concludes that positive feedback is important for stability. This part is an interesting exercise but would need to be assessed by another reviewer for comprehensiveness and for originality in the systems biology literature. There is much literature on &quot;epigenetic&quot; memory in networks, with several stable states and I do not see here anything strikingly new.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The key utility of the initial part of the paper is the exhaustive enumeration of all small heritable regulatory architectures. The implications for the abundance of ‘network motifs’ and more generally any part of a network proposed to perform a particular function is that all such parts need to be compatible with heredity. This principle is generally not followed in the literature, resulting in incomplete networks being interpreted as having motifs or modules with autonomous function. Therefore, while the need for positive feedback for stability is indeed obvious, it is not consistently applied by all. For example, the famous synthetic circuit ‘the repressilator’ (Elowitz and Leibler, “A synthetic oscillatory network of transcriptional regulators”, Nature, 2000), which is presented as an example of ‘rational network design’, has three transcription factors that all sequentially inhibit the production of another transcription factor in turn forming a feedback loop of inhibitory interactions. Therefore, the contributions of the factors that promote the expression of each entity is unknown and yet essential for heritability. The comprehensive listing of the heritable regulatory architectures that are simple provide the basis for true synthetic biology where the contributing factors for observed behavior of the network are explicitly considered only after constraining for heredity. Using this principle, the minimal autonomous architecture that can implement the repressilator is the HRA ‘Z’ (Fig. 1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>An interesting part is then to discuss such networks in the framework of a multicellular organism rather than dividing unicellular organisms, and Figure 5 includes development in the picture. Finally, Figure 6 makes a model of the feedback loops in small RNA inheritance in C. elegans to explain differences in the length of inheritance of silencing in different contexts and for different genes and their sensitivity to perturbations. The proposed model for the memory length is distinct from a previously published model by Karin et al. (ref 49).</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>I found confusing the distinction between the architecture of the network and the state in which it is. Many network components (proteins and RNAs) are coded in the genome, so a node may not disappear forever.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>I have added language to clarify the many states of a network versus its architecture (also illustrated in Fig. 4 for ESP systems). Even loss of expression below a threshold can lead to permanent loss if there is not sufficient noise to induce re-expression. For example, consider the simple case of a transcription factor that binds to its own promoter, requiring 10 molecules for the activation of the promoter and thus production of more of the same transcription factor. If an epigenetic change (e.g., RNA interference) reduces the levels to fewer than 10 molecules and if the noise in the system never results in the numbers of the transcription factor increasing beyond 10, the transcription factor has been effectively lost permanently. In this way, reduction of a regulator can lead to permanent change despite the presence of the DNA. Many papers in the field of RNA silencing in C. elegans have provided strong experimental evidence to support this assertion.</p>

<list-item><p>From the Supplementary methods, the relationship between two nodes seems to be all in the form of dx/dt = Kxy . Y, which is just one way to model biological reactions. The generality of the results on network architectures that are heritable and robust/sensitive to change is unclear. Other interactions can have sigmoidal effects, for example. Is there no systems biology study that has addressed (meta)stability of networks before in a more general manner?</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, the relationship between any two entities can in principle be modeled using any function. Extensive exploration of the behavior of any regulatory architecture – even the simplest ones – require simplifications. For example, early work by Stuart Kauffman explored Boolean networks (see ref. 10 in the paper for history and extensive explanations). However, allowing all possible ways of specifying the interactions between components of a network makes analysis both a computational and conceptual challenge.</p>

<list-item><p>Why is auto-regulation neglected? As this is a clear cause of metastable states that can be inherited, I was surprised not to find this among the networks.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Auto-regulation in the sense of some molecule/entity ultimately leading to the production of more of itself is present in every heritable regulatory architecture. Specifically, all auto-regulatory loops rely on a sequence of interactions between two or more kinds of molecules. For example, a transcription factor (TF) binding to the promoter of its own gene sequence, resulting in the production of more TF protein is a positive feedback loop that relies on many interacting factors (transcription, translation, nuclear import, etc.) and can be considered as ‘auto-regulation’ as it is sometimes referred to in the literature. In this sense, every HRA (A through Z) includes ‘auto-regulation’ or more appropriately positive feedback loops. For example, in the HRA ‘A’, x ‘auto-regulates’ itself via y.</p>

<list-item><p>I did not understand the point of using the term &quot;entity-sensor-property&quot;. Are they the same networks as above, now simulated in a computer environment step by step (thus allowing delays)?</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see response to the other reviewer regarding the need for the Entity-SensorProperty framework and how it is distinct from generic networks. Briefly, the ODE-based simple networks, while easy to analyze, are not realistic because of the assumptions of continuity. In contrast ESP systems are more realistic with measurement discretizing changes in property values as is expected in real living systems.</p>

<list-item><p>The final part applies the network modeling framework from above to small RNA inheritance in C. elegans. Given the positive feedback, what requires explanation is how fast the system STOPs small RNA inheritance. A previous model (Karin et al., ref. 49) builds on the fact that factors involved in inheritance are in finite quantity hence the different small RNAs &quot;compete&quot; for amplification and those targeting a given gene may eventually become extinct.</p>
</list-item></list>
<p>The present model relies on a simple positive feedback that in principle can be modulated, and this modulation remains outside the model. A possibility is to add negative regulation by factors such as HERI-1, that are known to limit the duration of the silencing.</p>
<p>The duration of silencing differs between genes. To explain this, the author introduces again outside the model the possibility of piRNAs acting on the mRNA, which may provide a difference in the stability of the system for different transcripts. At the end, I do not understand the point of modeling the positive feedback.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The previous model (Karin et al., Cell Systems, 2023) can describe populations of genes that are undergoing RNA silencing but cannot explain the dynamics of silencing particular genes. Furthermore, this model also cannot explain cases of effectively permanent silencing of genes that have been reported (e.g., Devanapally et al., Nature Communications, 2021 and Shukla et al., Current Biology, 2021). Finally, the observations of susceptibility to, recovery from, and even resistance to trans silencing (e.g., Fig. 5a in Devanapally et al., Nature Communications, 2021) require an explanation that includes modulation of the HRDE-1-dependent positive feedback loop that maintains silencing across generations.</p>
<p>The specific qualitative predictions regarding the relationship between piRNA-mediated regulation genome-wide and HRDE-1-dependent silencing of a particular gene across generations could guide the discovery of potential regulators of heritable RNA silencing. The equations (4) and (5) in the paper for the extent of modulation needed for heritable epigenetic change provide specific quantitative predictions that can be tested experimentally in the future. I have also revised the title of the section to read ‘Tuning of positive feedback loops acting across generations can explain the dynamics of heritable RNA silencing in C. elegans’ to emphasize the above points.</p>

<list-item><p>From the initial analysis of abstract networks that do not rely on templating, I expected a discussion of possible examples from non-templated systems and was a little surprised by the end of the manuscript on small RNAs.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>The heritability of any entity relies on regulatory interactions regardless of whether a templated mechanism is also used or not. For example, DNA replication relies on the interactions between numerous regulators, with only the sequence being determined by the template DNA. The field of small RNA-mediated silencing facilitates analysis of epigenetic changes at single-gene resolution (Chey and Jose, Trends in Genetics, 2022). It is therefore likely to continue to provide insights into heritable epigenetic changes and how they can be modulated. Unfortunately, there are currently no known cases of epigenetic inheritance where the role of any templated mechanism has been conclusively excluded. Future research will improve our understanding of epigenetic states and their modulation in terms of changes in positive feedback loops as proposed in this study and potentially lead to the discovery of such mechanisms that act entirely independent of any template-dependent entity.</p>

<p>I thank the reviewers for their specific suggestions to improve the paper.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The paper has many long paragraphs that attempt to explain results, make illustrations, and give intuition. Unfortunately, these are difficult to read. It would aid the reader greatly if these were, say, converted into cartoons (even if only in the SI), or made more accessible in some other way.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I agree with the importance of making the material accessible to readers in multiple ways. I have now added a figure with schematics in the SI titled ‘Illustrations of key concepts’ (new Fig. S2), which collects concepts that are relevant throughout the paper and might aid some readers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The bulk of the supplementary is currently a collection of elementary mathematics results: to whit, pages 26 to 33 of the combined manuscript carry no more information than a quick description of the general model and the diagrams in Fig 1. Similarly, pages 34 to 39 (non-zero dilution rate), and pages 39 through 58 (response to permanent changes) each express a trivial mathematical point that is more than sufficiently made with one illustrative example.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I agree with the reviewer and have condensed these pages as suggested. I have added a pointer to the earlier version as containing further details for the readers who might prefer the explicit listing of these equations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overall, the paper appears to be a collection of numerical results obtained from different models, united by uncertain terminology that is not fully defined in this paper. The most promising aspects of the paper lie either in (a) combinatorially complete enumeration of all regulatory architectures, or (b) relating experimental manipulations in C. elegans to possible underlying regulatory architectures. Focusing on one or the other might improve the readability of the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The two sections of the paper are complementary and when presented together help with the integration of concepts rather than the siloed pursuit of theory versus experimental analysis. When this work was presented at meetings before submission, it was clear that different researchers appreciated different aspects. This divergence is also apparent in the two reviews, with each reviewer appreciating different aspects. I have repeated the definitions and justifications from the earlier paper (Jose, J R Soc Interface, 2020) to provide a more fluid transition between the two complementary sections of the paper. Knowing both sides could aid in the development of models that are not only consistent with measurable quantities (e.g., anything that can be considered an entity) but are also logically constrained (e.g., entities matched with sensors while avoiding any entities that do not have a source of production – i.e., avoiding nodes with indegree = 0).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>However, having said that many results of these types are well-known in models of regulatory networks, and it is unclear what precisely warrants the new framework that the author is proposing. Indeed, it would be good to understand in what way the framework here is novel, and how it is distinguished from prior studies of regulatory networks.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The key novelty of the work is the consideration of heritability for any regulation. With the explicit definition of the heritability for a regulatory architecture and the acknowledgement that there can be more than one notion of heredity, this paper now sets the foundation for examining many real networks in this light. I hope that the added justifications for the current framework in the revised paper strengthen these arguments. Future literature reviews on networks in general and how they address heritability or persistence will better define the prevalence of these considerations. Currently, most experimental biologists engaged in reductionist approaches and some systems biologists examining the function or prevalence of network motifs do not explicitly constrain their models for heritability or persistence. It is hoped that this work will raise awareness in both communities and lead to more constrained models that acknowledge incomplete knowledge of the network, which is always the case when analyzing living systems.</p>

</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>This phrase was expanded upon in a previous paper (Jose, BioEssays, 2020). I have now added more explanation in this paper for completeness. The section now reads ‘For example, the localization and activity of many kinds of molecules are recreated in successive generations during comparable stages [1-3]. These recurring patterns can change throughout development such that following the levels and/or localizations of each kind of molecule over time traces waveforms that return in phase with the similarity of form and function across generations [2].’</p>

<p>I have now edited this long sentence to read as follows: ‘For systematic analysis, architectures that could persist for ~50 generations without even a transient loss of any entity/sensor were considered HRAs. Each HRA was perturbed (loss-of-function or gain-of-function) after five different time intervals since the start of the simulation (i.e., phases). The response of each HRA to such perturbations were compared with that of the unperturbed HRA.’</p>

<p>I have simplified this sentence describing prior work by others (Karin et al., Cell Systems, 2023) and moved a clause to the subsequent sentence. This section now reads: ‘Recent considerations of competition for regulatory resources in populations of genes that are being silenced suggest explanations for some observations on RNA silencing in C. elegans [49]. Specifically, based on Little’s law of queueing, with a pool of M genes silenced for an average duration of T, new silenced genes arise at a rate  that is given by M = T’. I have also provided more context by preceding this section with: ‘Although the release of shared regulators upon loss of piRNA-mediated regulation in animals lacking PRG-1 could be adequate to explain enhanced HRDE-1-dependent transgenerational silencing initiated by dsRNA in prg-1(-) animals, such a competition model alone cannot explain the observed alternatives of susceptibility, recovery and resistance (Fig. 6A).’</p>
