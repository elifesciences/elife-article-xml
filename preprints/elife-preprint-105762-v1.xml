<title>Abstract</title><p>Noncoding transcribable inverted repeat sequences are vital in genome stability, regulation of transposable elements, mutations, and diseases in eukaryotes. In vascular plants, dsRNA Binding Proteins (dsRBPs), DRB7.2 and DRB4, inhibit Dicer-like-protein 3 (DCL3) to stall endogenous inverted-repeat dsRNA (endo-IR dsRNA) mediated gene silencing. As dsRBPs generally assist Dicers, the inhibition of DCL3 by a dsRBP complex is quite enigmatic. Here, we explore how the DRB7.2:DRB4 complex sequesters substrate dsRNA of DCL3 using a structure-based mechanistic approach. Intriguingly, the crucial step of endo-IR dsRNA precursor sequestration is the high affinity complex formation of interacting domains of DRB7.2 (DRB7.2M) and DRB4 (DRB4D3). Next, we establish that DRB7.2 simultaneously interacts with DRB4 and endo-IR dsRNA precursors, where DRB4 contributes towards enhancement in the affinity of the complex with dsRNA, thereby impairing DCL3 mediated cleavage of endo-IR dsRNA precursors. The uniqueness of the DRB4D3 structure implies that the trans-acting (tasi)/siRNA initiation complex formed by DCL4:DRB4 in plants is diverse from its non-plant higher eukaryotes. Overall, we present considerable insights into endo-IR dsRNA precursors regulation in plants and indicate a differential evolution of RNAi initiation complexes between plants and other higher eukaryotes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Organisms ranging from microsporidian parasites to humans and plants invoke elaborate gene regulation mechanisms mediated by small non-coding RNA during development as well as to combat infection and stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">González Plaza, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sunkar &amp; Zhu, 2004</xref>). In general, Dicer depends on dsRNA Binding Proteins (dsRBPs), containing strictly two or more dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD), as the non-catalytic factors for enhancing the dsRNA cleavage activity. A few structurally and functionally well-characterized dsRBDs that exclusively interact with dsRNA and regulate the RNAi pathway include <italic>Hs</italic>TRBP dsRBD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Masliah <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), <italic>Hs</italic>TRBP dsRBD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Masliah <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), <italic>Dm</italic>R2D2 dsRBD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yamaguchi <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>), <italic>Ce</italic>RDE-4 dsRBD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chiliveri &amp; Deshmukh, 2014</xref>), <italic>At</italic>DRB1 dsRBD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yang <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>), and <italic>At</italic>DRB4 dsRBD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chiliveri <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>Hs</italic>TRBP dsRBD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wilson <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>), <italic>Dm</italic>R2D2 dsRBD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yamaguchi <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>), and <italic>Dm</italic>LoqsPB dsRBD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Jouravleva <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>) form a very stable complex with the corresponding Dicer. Nonetheless, dsRBDs that simultaneously interact with dsRNA and mediate protein-protein interaction are yet to be identified, except for R2D2 dsRBD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yamaguchi <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>) and DGCR8 dsRBDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Partin <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>), and hold potential for the unexplored functions of dsRBDs in biological processes.</p>
<p>Depending on the nature and the origin of the trigger dsRNA, plants recruit a specific subset of Dicer and corresponding dsRBPs to effect the gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wilson &amp; Doudna, 2013</xref>). For example, when presented with long <italic>trans</italic>-acting or viral dsRNA, DCL4 associates with DRB4 to produce a 21 nt siRNA duplex that further leads to AGO1/AGO7 mediated cleavage of the cognate transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fukudome <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adenot <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). While the structure and functional mechanism of DCL4 is still unknown, DRB4 has two N-terminal dsRBDs with canonical α-β-β-β-α fold and an extended unstructured region followed by a small folded domain in the C-terminus with no known sequence or structural homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chiliveri <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). In addition, at various stages of viral infections and developmental stages in plants, DRB4 independently interacts with Hypersensitive Response to Turnip crinkle-virus (HRT), virus coat protein (vCP), DRB7.1, and DRB7.2 to perform a diverse set of functions in versatile gene regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tschopp <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Montavon <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, additional studies are needed to decipher how DRB4 compartmentalizes the task of association with several partners.</p>
<p>Primary sequence searches across the plant genome indicate that DRB4 is conserved in all plants, whereas DRB7.1 and DRB7.2 are specific to vascular plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Clavel <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis suggests that DRB7.1 and DRB7.2 belong to a new clade of the dsRBD family (Type III) possessing the closest sequence homology with DCL4 dsRBD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Clavel <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). It was also proposed that the dsRBD of DRB7.1 and DRB7.2 may interact with both dsRNA and partner protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Clavel <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Earlier, Wuest <italic>et al</italic>. showed a relatively higher gene expression profile of DRB7.2 in egg cells, suggesting an essential role in the development of the female gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wuest <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Amongst multiple partners, DRB4 interacts independently with DRB7.1 and DRB7.2 to sequester endogenous precursor dsRNA and prevent DCL3 from producing epigenetically activated siRNAs (easi-RNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tschopp <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>) and endogenous inverted repeat siRNAs (endo-IR siRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Montavon <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>), respectively. Additionally, Montavon <italic>et. al</italic>., showed that both single and double mutants of <italic>drb7.2</italic> and <italic>drb4</italic> accumulate a similar level of endo-IR siRNAs originating from the transcripts of locus IR71 and IR2039, signifying that the association of DRB7.2:DRB4 safeguards precursors of endo-IR siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Montavon <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, when the DRB7.2:DRB4 complex is dissociated, DCL3 generates 24 nt near-perfect self-complementarity products from these transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lu <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kasschau <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, DCL3 produced 24 nt dsRNA initiates RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) that leads to <italic>de novo</italic> methylation across the centromeric and repetitive sequences in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Erdmann &amp; Picard, 2020</xref>). RdDM plays a crucial role in the stress response as well as development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Huettel <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) and is implicated in modulating various epigenetic processes, such as transgene silencing, transposon suppression, gene imprinting, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Erdmann &amp; Picard, 2020</xref>). Thus, the epigenetic modifications in the inverted repeat sequences are regulated through a delicate balance between the DRB7.2:DRB4 complex versus DCL3.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, DRB7.2:DRB4 is a first-of-its-kind complex that inhibits Dicer from processing the trigger dsRNA instead of assisting it in the process. The antagonistic activity of DRB7.2:DRB4 on DCL3 poses a fundamental structural and mechanistic question in the RNAi pathway.</p>
<p>Using an integrated approach involving NMR and X-ray crystallography, here, we present the structure of the complex formed by the interaction domains of DRB7.2 and DRB4 (i.e., DRB7.2M and DRB4D3). Furthermore, we show that the complex interacts with the dsRNA using the exclusive free RNA binding site present on DRB7.2M and the two N-terminal dsRBDs of DRB4 to enhance the affinity of the DRB7.2:DRB4 for the substrate dsRNA binding. Our study provides the mechanism of the ternary complex formation and proposes a mechanism for the inhibition of DCL3 activity by DRB7.2:DRB4.</p>

<title>Domain architecture and interaction of DRB7.2 with DRB4</title>
<p>At the outset, using primary sequence analysis, we identified and defined domain boundaries in DRB7.2 and DRB4.</p>
<p>For DRB7.2, the program cNLS Mapper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kosugi <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>) predicted that residues Q20-L37 form a strong bipartite Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). As DRB7.2 exclusively localizes and functions in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Montavon <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>), having a strong N-terminal NLS affirms that DRB7.2 does not need additional co-factors for its localization. The disorder prediction analysis using PONDR for DRB7.2 yields two disordered regions (M1-S83 and Y163-V190) flanking a dsRBD domain (S84-G162) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). As the N- and C-terminal disordered regions in DRB7.2 may interfere with the structural studies of the full-length protein, we additionally cloned the dsRBD region as T71-G162, marked as DRB7.2M (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The N-terminal flanking residues T71-S83 provided stability to the dsRBD domain as constructs devoid of it were not stable. Additionally, we have cloned and expressed only the N-terminal region of DRB7.2 (DRB7.2N, i.e., M1-Q81) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Similarly, based on our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chiliveri <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>), we have prepared four clones of DRB4, namely, DRB4, DRB4D1D2, DRB4C, and DRB4D3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). DRB4D1D2 consists of both dsRBD domains, whereas the DRB4C is primarily disordered with a small structured domain located at the end of the C-terminal region, namely DRB4D3.</p>
<p>To establish the interaction between DRB7.2 and DRB4, we monitored the changes in the <sup>1</sup>H– <sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectrum of DRB7.2 in the presence of the saturating concentrations of unlabeled DRB4. DRB7.2 shows many well-dispersed broad resonances, probably due to the underlying exchange processes of partially folded states or a heterogeneous ensemble of interconverting oligomeric states (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Similarly, narrow dispersion in the proton dimension seen for many resonances is probably emanating from long disordered regions in DRB7.2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Interestingly, upon addition of the molar equivalence of unlabeled DRB4 to DRB7.2, we observed significant line narrowing and the appearance of new resonances, albeit with the unchanged central region in the spectrum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Subsequent ITC studies yield an exothermic and enthalpically driven binding yielding a dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of 3.1 nM for the interaction between DRB7.2 and DRB4 suggesting that these proteins form a high-affinity complex by associating at an equimolar ratio as N is ∼ 0.8 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>The nature of dsRBD region of DRB7.2</title>
<p>To identify the interaction domains between DRB7.2 and DRB4, we performed ITC titrations of DRB7.2 with DRB4D1D2, DRB4C, and DRB4D3. While DRB4D1D2 does not bind with DRB7.2, the isotherm of DRB7.2:DRB4C yields a K<sub>d</sub> ∼ 2.8 nM, and DRB7.2:DRB4D3 interactions with a K<sub>d</sub> ∼ 2.2 nM (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A-S1C</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). As the thermodynamic parameters for the titrations of DRB7.2:DRB4 and DRB7.2:DRB4C are highly similar to DRB7.2:DRB4D3, we reason that DRB4D3 is solely responsible for mediating the interaction between DRB7.2 and DRB4.</p>
<p>Similarly, we proceeded to identify if DRB7.2 possesses a specific region that drives its interaction with DRB4. Hence, we individually titrated the unlabeled DRB4C to <sup>15</sup>N-DRB7.2N and <sup>15</sup>N-DRB7.2M and monitored the changes in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC. For DRB7.2N:DRB4C titration, we did not observe any changes in the spectral pattern of amide resonances, suggesting that the DRB4C does not bind to DRB7.2N (data not shown). At the same time, the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC of DRB7.2M, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, displays hallmark features observed for DRB7.2, such as significantly broadened resonances probably arising from conformational heterogeneity or due to the presence of higher order oligomers of alone DRB7.2M. The <sup>15</sup>N backbone relaxation studies on DRB7.2M also indicate a <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> ∼ 11.89 ns based on the R<sub>2</sub>*R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub>/R<sub>1,</sub> which is much higher than a theoretical <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> ∼ 5-6 ns for a globular protein of this size (Fig S2). These data further imply that DRB7.2M is probably experiencing slow to intermediate exchange processes induced by monomer:dimer and interconverting higher-order oligomeric states in equilibrium.</p>

</fig>
<p>Furthermore, the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectra of DRB7.2M showed similar line narrowing upon titration of unlabeled DRB4D3, identical to those observed for DRB7.2, indicating that the DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 attain a well-defined complex structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). These data suggest that DRB7.2M is probably necessary and sufficient to achieve the specific interaction with DRB4.</p>
<p>The broad resonances in the DRB7.2M triggered us to perform size exclusion chromatography followed by MALDI-TOF measurements (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A-S3B</xref>) to understand the nature of conformational heterogeneity in DRB7.2M. We observe that DRB7.2M (M<sub>t</sub> = 10670 Da) elutes at an MW 10440 Da (SEC) and gives a major MALDI peak corresponding to the monomeric mass at 12009 Da (∼ 85%) and a small dimeric population at 24184 Da (∼ 15%).</p>
<p>Previously, using phylogenetic analysis, Clavel <italic>et al</italic>., showed that DRB7.2 dsRBD belongs to a type III class of the dsRBD family and harbors a close relationship with <italic>At</italic>DCL4 dsRBD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Clavel <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Our primary sequence analysis of DRB7.2M with dsRBDs of <italic>Hs</italic>TRBP, <italic>Dm</italic>R2D2, and <italic>Ce</italic>RDE-4 suggests that the dsRBD fold is well conserved in DRB7.2M (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>).</p>

<title>DRB7.2M and DRB4D3 constitute interaction regions in DRB7.2:DRB4 complex</title>
<p>Our earlier studies showed that DRB4C is comprised of two dominant regions consisting of a highly flexible segment composed of N154-S293 and a domain encompassing E294-P355 (DRB4D3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chiliveri <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). As seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC of DRB4D3 shows fewer than expected peaks that have a significantly narrow dispersion and larger line widths. Moreover, DRB4D3 (M<sub>t</sub> = 7810 Da) elutes at a higher MW of 13319 Da on SEC (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D</xref>) but shows a monomeric population at 8128 Da (∼ 85%), a dimer at 16400 Da (∼ 11%), a trimer at 24686 Da (∼ 3%), and a tetramer at 32955 Da (∼ 1%) on MALDI (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3E</xref>). These observations imply that DRB4D3 experiences a high hydrodynamic radius arising from the formation of higher-order oligomers coupled with various conformational exchange processes.</p>
<p>Despite extensive bioinformatics searches, DRB4D3 did not show sequence homology with any protein or domain in the UniProt database. As the homolog of DRB4 in <italic>H. sapiens</italic> (TRBP) and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (R2D2, Loqs-PB) also contain a C-terminal third domain tailored for an association with Dicer, we carried out the alignment of DRB4D3 with the TRBPD3, R2D2D3, and LoqsD3 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3F</xref>). However, DRB4D3 bears only 6.4% identity and 11.9% similarity with <italic>Hs</italic>TRBPD3, indicating that DRB4D3 does not have any evolutionary relationship with domains that are known to interact with respective Dicers.</p>
<p>To know if DRB7.2M and DRB4D3 drive the specific interaction necessary to form the DRB7.2:DRB4 complex, we titrated DRB7.2M with DRB4D3 and <italic>vice versa</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). The <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectrum of both domains in complex form yields a highly dispersed spectrum as well as a narrow line width for most resonances. The significant changes in spectral pattern in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref> imply that DRB7.2M and DRB4D3 attain a stable conformation as a complex. The changes seen in these spectra also corroborate with the spectrum of the DRB7.2:DRB4 complex (<italic>vide supra</italic>). Furthermore, the ITC studies on DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 follow an identical binding pattern as for DRB7.2:DRB4 titration, which most likely arises from the folding into a stable monomeric conformation of DRB7.2M and DRB4D3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). The single-site binding isotherm results in a K<sub>d</sub> ∼ 2.84 nM with approximately 1:1 stoichiometry. We also found that the DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 complex (M<sub>t</sub> = 18480 Da) shows MW of 27658 Da on SEC and a corresponding equimolar complex peak at 20290 Da on MALDI (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3G-S3H</xref>). The additional peaks seen in this MALDI correspond to the fragments seen in the individual MALDI profiles of DRB7.2M and DRB4D3.</p>
<p>Collectively, DRB7.2M and DRB4D3 are necessary and sufficient to facilitate the binding between DRB7.2:DRB4 as they are the interaction domains. Previously, it was observed that the dsRBPs in humans and flies (e.g., TRBP, R2D2, Loqs-PB) interact with corresponding Dicers through a C-terminal domain, termed as D3, attain a dsRBD fold. If DRB4D3 possesses a putative role in DCL4 recognition, similar to TRBPD3, R2D2D3, and Loqs-PBD3, it remains enigmatic at this stage. Therefore, the evolution in plants to select DRB4D3 for an association with DRB7.2 poses an interesting conundrum to the hypothesis of DCL4:DRB4 association in the tasi/siRNA pathway.</p>

<title>Solution structure of DRB7.2M in complex with unlabeled DRB4D3</title>
<p>To understand the molecular basis of the DRB7.2:DRB4 complex formation, we have performed structural and biochemical characterization on the DRB7.2M and DRB4D3.</p>
<p>As the standalone DRB7.2M and DRB4D3 are not amenable for structural studies due to significant spectral broadening (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>), we have isotopically enriched one component of the complex while keeping the other perdeuterated to obtain better signal-to-noise ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gardner &amp; Kay, 1998</xref>). For the solution structure determination of DRB7.2M, we have used a complex formed by <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>13</sup>C, perdeuterated DRB7.2M with perdeuterated DRB4D3, whereas for the structure determination of DRB4D3, a complex formed by <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>13</sup>C, perdeuterated DRB4D3 with perdeuterated DRB7.2M is used.</p>
<p>The solution structure of DRB7.2M suggests that the dsRBD region (A85-V161) adopts a canonical α1-β1-β2-β3-α2 fold, in which two α helices are packed against a three-stranded anti-parallel β sheet (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).

While most of the dsRBD region of DRB7.2 aligns well with the TRBP dsRBD1, the orientation of the β1-β2 loop is different, and DRB7.2M has a longer β2-β3 loop.

<p>In the majority of dsRBDs, the β2-β3 turn is composed of ∼ 5 amino acids; however, in DRB7.2 dsRBD, it appears as a long loop involving nine amino acids. Moreover, the stretch formed by T71-S84 harbors a short α−helix, α0, encompassing E78-S83. We could not identify any specific contacts between α0 and the rest of the dsRBD fold, probably due to the lack of long-range NOEs attributed to the flexible nature of the stretch. At the same time, transient interactions between the stretch and the dsRBD cannot be ruled out as the stretch is essential in stabilizing the dsRBD. Previously, extensions that impart stability to dsRBD have been identified in other dsRBPs, such as RDE-4 and TRBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chiliveri &amp; Deshmukh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Masliah <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). The presence of a longer β2-β3 sheet and the loop connecting both strands appears to be specific to DRB7.2 dsRBD, and such a modification has not yet been identified in any other dsRBD.</p>
<p>The superposition of the DRB7.2 dsRBD with its human homolog TRBP dsRBD1 (TRBPD1) shows a highly similar arrangement of the secondary structural elements with a backbone RMSD of 1.16 Å (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Furthermore, the comparison of DRB7.2M with dsRBD2 of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> DCL1 (PDB ID: 2LRS) and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> DCL3 (PDB ID: 7VG2), which possess a relatively longer β2-β3 loop compared to the canonical dsRBDs but still shorter than DRB7.2M, showed near identical β2-β3 loop orientation and a backbone RMSD 1.17 Å and 1.69 Å, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Similarly, the overlay of DRB7.2 dsRBD with DRB1 and DRB4 dsRBDs, which are structurally well-studied dsRBPs in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, reveals that DRB7.2 dsRBD is well conserved. For these, the backbone of DRB7.2 dsRBD aligns with DRB1 dsRBD1 (DRB1D1) and DRB1 dsRBD2 (DRB1D2) with an RMSD of 1.0 Å and 1.7 Å, respectively; and DRB4 dsRBD1 (DRB4D1) and DRB4 dsRBD2 (DRB4D2) with an RMSD of 0.9 Å and 1.9 Å, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, the DRB7.2 dsRBD appears to be highly conserved in features that contribute to the dsRNA recognition, except for the DRB7.2M specific β2-β3 region, which assumes an extended and stable structure.</p>

<title>Solution structure of DRB4D3 in complex with unlabeled DRB7.2M</title>
<p>Using a similar strategy of isotope labeling and NMR methods, we have determined the solution structure of DRB4D3 with chemical shift information and sparse NOE restraints using Rosetta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Raman <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>). The chemical shift deviation from the random coil value for the backbone residues predicts that the region comprising E294-S316 is flexible, hence, it was eliminated from the structure calculation. The ten lowest energy ensemble structures of DRB4D3 show a backbone RMSD of 0.25 Å (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). In addition, we observe three cross peaks at lower <sup>15</sup>N frequencies corresponding to 84 ppm, 84.4 ppm and 85 ppm in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum of DRB4D3 suggesting the formation of the salt-bridge within DRB4D3 and between DRB4D3 and DRB7.2M (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>
<p>The structure reveals a novel arrangement of three anti-parallel β-strands as β1-β3-β2 in the three-dimensional space (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>). Besides, the DRB4D3 assumes a stable conformational state only upon binding with the partner; therefore, the absence of such a fold in the structural database is not surprising. In the RNAi pathway, generally, the C-terminal region of most dsRBPs often has a third dsRBD, which is essential to make contact with the respective Dicer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Jouravleva <italic>et al</italic> 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Liu <italic>et al</italic> 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang <italic>et al</italic> 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wilson <italic>et al</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yamaguchi <italic>et al</italic> 2022</xref>).

<p>The cell content analysis showed the presence of two protomers, a heterodimer of the DRB7.2M:DRB4D3, in the asymmetric unit. The complex is primarily stabilized by the β3 of DRB7.2M and β1 of DRB4D3 by burying ∼ 20% (1750 Å<sup>2</sup>) of the total accessible surface area (8500 Å<sup>2</sup>) of DRB4D3, signifying strong interaction between DRB7.2M and DRB4D3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Besides, we find an additional interaction between the β1 strand of the two molecules of DRB7.2M in the asymmetric unit formed by burying ∼ 10% of the total surface area. However, the formation of a dimer of the heterodimeric complex appears to have been formed due to crystal packing effects.

<title>The interaction interface between DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 complex</title>
<p>The structure of the complex indicates that the DRB7.2 dsRBD primarily utilizes the β-sheet region to form an interaction interface with DRB4D3 in which the y-shaped α-helical face is completely excluded. Besides, the putative dsRNA recognition residues forming the tripartite contact, such as K86, L89, and N91 in α1 helix, the tandem K143, K144 at the N-terminal α2 helix, and the invariant H112 in the β1-β2 loop appear on the surface. Moreover, the longer β3 strand in DRB7.2 dsRBD observed in the solution and crystal structure is involved in stabilizing the interaction interface of the complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The crystal structure of DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 reveals that V132, E134, and, F136 of the β3 strands of DRB7.2M, and V323 and C325 of the β1 strand of DRB4D3 stabilize the dimerization interface through hydrogen bonding as well as polar contact formed by T131 (DRB7.2M) with G320 (DRB4D3) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Moreover, the crystal and solution structures of individual DRB7.2M and DRB4D3 are in good agreement as we observe the backbone RMSD 0.87 Å and 0.59 Å, respectively (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8A-S8B</xref>).</p>
<p>Further analysis reveals that the complex is stabilized by an intermolecular salt bridge formed between H322 (DRB4D3) and E134 (DRB7.2M) and a cation-<italic>π</italic> interaction by R326 (DRB4D3) and F136 (DRB7.2M) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).

<title>dsRNA binding studies of the DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 complex</title>

<p>In our experience, the NMR study of longer dsRNA (such as 20 bp, 40 bp or longer) with dsRBD results in the resonance broadening resulting from multiple simultaneous events, i.e., binding of multiple dsRBDs (about two to four) with a single dsRNA molecule, the intermediate scale binding affinity (such as μM affinity), the sliding of dsRBD (diffusion) over the length of dsRNA. Therefore, we titrated the DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 complex with the increasing concentration of 13 bp dsRNA, which is necessary and sufficient to interact with just one dsRBD at a time and does not lead to any deleterious effect on the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>, and S9A).

The location of the dsRNA binding site lies on the opposite side of the DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 interface thus giving accessibility of dsRNA to DRB7.2M independent of DRB7.2M’s interaction with DRB4D3.</p>
<p>Collectively, DRB7.2M appears to engage two distinct substrates, DRB4D3 and dsRNA, with two exclusive surfaces.</p>

<title>DCL3 substrate recognition by DRB7.2, DRB4, and DRB7.2:DRB4 complex</title>
<p>Recent cryo-EM structure of DCL3:pre-siRNA complex in an active dicing-competent state reveals that a 40 bp RNA with 5’P guide and 1 nt 3’ overhang containing complementary strand (pre-siRNA or 40 bp RNA) are recognized by PAZ:platform and connector region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Therefore, to know whether DRB7.2:DRB4 binds to the DCL3 substrate, we characterized interactions of DRB7.2, DRB4, and DRB7.2:DRB4 complex with the pre-siRNA using gel mobility shift assay.</p>
<p>We found that the construct bearing DRB7.2 dsRBD region binds to the 40 bp RNA (i.e., DRB7.2 and DRB7.2M), confirming that the dsRBD region in DRB7.2 is the sole dsRNA recognizer. As expected, DRB7.2N and DRB4D3 did not show any binding to the 40 bp RNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). We also found that DRB4D3 is devoid of dsRNA binding activity even at higher concentrations irrespective of the length of the dsRNA (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10A-B</xref>), which supports the earlier observation of its lack of structural features and unavailability of necessary electrostatic surface needed for dsRNA binding.</p>

<p>The concentration dependent gel mobility shift assay of DRB7.2 with 40 bp RNA shows a complete saturation at 20 μM protein concentration, where distinct mobility shift intermediates are seen at protein concentrations ranging from 1 μM to 10 μM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Similarly, the concentration dependent gel mobility shift assay of DRB4 with 40 bp RNA show that DRB4 saturates around 20 μM protein concentration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). In this case, we do not observe distinct mobility shift intermediates most likely due to dsRNA interaction driven by “all or none” binding possibly occurring due to the presence of two dsRBDs in DRB4. The saturation of DRB7.2:DRB4 complex with 40 bp RNA occurs by 3-4 μM protein concentration, indicating that the complex may have a relatively higher affinity of the dsRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Additional gel mobility shift assay studies with DRB7.2, DRB7.2M and DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 complex together with a longer 80 bp dsRNA corroborates with the above observations (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Fig S11A-S11C</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on titration of proteins with 40 bp RNA, we find that the apparent K<sub>d</sub> of the interaction of DRB7.2, DRB4, and DRB7.2:DRB4 complex with 40 bp RNA is ∼ 2.2 μM, 3.6 μM, and 1.0 μM, respectively (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The higher apparent affinity of DRB7.2:DRB4 with pre-siRNA is probably due to the presence of multiple dsRBDs in the complex. Interestingly, 40 bp RNA interacts with both DRB7.2 and DRB4, and their complex with the Hill coefficient is more than 2 in all cases (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref> and <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The Hill coefficient larger than 1 is often attributed to the intrinsic cooperativity of binding interaction; however, in our case, it implies that DRB4, DRB7.2, and their complex are probably interacting with the multiple consecutive minor-major-minor groove structure present on a 40 bp RNA.</p>

<p>Our data demonstrate that DRB7.2 dsRBD is capable of interacting with dsRNA of a varied length as well as with DRB4D3, through a distinct interaction interface. To validate if DRB4D3 and dsRNA occupy separate binding sites on DRB7.2 and do not interfere with individual recognition, we titrated the pre-formed complex of DRB7.2M:40 bp RNA with the increasing concentration of DRB4D3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). We observe that the preformed complex of DRB7.2M:40 bp RNA is not disrupted by DRB4D3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>, similarly for 80 bp dsRNA (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11D</xref>)).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the oligomeric nature of DRB7.2M induces the formation of a mixture of the high order oligomeric complex of DRB7.2M even in the presence of dsRNA, which lags its migration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). Whereas, at the equimolar and above equimolar concentrations of the DRB7.2M and DRB4D3, the monomeric nature of the heterodimer bound to the 40 bp RNA is compact in size, allowing it to migrate relatively faster (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>).</p>
<p>The ITC titration of DRB4D3 with the preformed complex of DRB7.2M:80 bp RNA yielded a K<sub>d</sub> ∼ 9.5 nM (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Fig.S11E</xref>), comparable to the affinity measured for DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 in the absence of dsRNA. Overall, these results suggest that DRB7.2 can independently assemble heteromeric complex with DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 and DRB7.2M:dsRNA, and acts as a molecular interface for the formation of the ternary complex of dsRNA:DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 by sandwiching between dsRNA and DRB4.</p>
<p>Structural and biochemical studies presented reveal that DRB7.2 harbors two independent surfaces for simultaneous association with DRB4 and dsRNA. Besides, the ability of DRB7.2 to recognize dsRNA and that DRB4 dsRBDs bind to dsRNA ultimately leads to sequestering pre-siRNA by DRB7.2:DRB4 to stall the subsequent endonuclease-driven cleavage mediated by DCL3.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The mechanism responsible for the competition to capture endoIR-precursor dsRNA by DCL3 versus DRB7.2:DRB4 complex remains elusive. As known from previous studies, many dsRBPs assist the corresponding Dicers to initiate and execute the RNAi pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Jouravleva <italic>et al</italic> 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Liu <italic>et al</italic> 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang <italic>et al</italic> 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wilson <italic>et al</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yamaguchi <italic>et al</italic> 2022</xref>), and therefore, the formation of the DRB7.2:DRB4 assembly to stall Dicer entry on the precursor dsRNA is quite contrasting.</p>
<p>Another important observation during the study was the conformational heterogeneity due to loosely coupled oligomeric states of the interaction domains of DRB7.2 and DRB4 in their solo form. The remarkable improvement in the NMR spectrum of the complex and the very high affinity of association affirm that the interaction domains attain a favorable heterodimeric state as a complex. Moreover, the evolution of DRB7.2 specific β2-β3 loop and the longer β3 remains a crucial step in the formation of the high affinity DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 complex as the key interactions for the complex formation are mediated by residues belonging to the extended β3 strands in DRB7.2M and the β1 strand of DRB4D3. Undoubtedly, it marks the first step in sequestering the endo-IR precursor RNA, as proposed in the model (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Proposed model for the dsRNA sequestration mechanism by DRB7.2 and DRB4 complex.</title>
<p>The functional domains, DRB7.2M and DRB4D3 of DRB7.2 and DRB4, respectively, assemble a stable and very high-affinity heterodimeric complex such that DRB7.2M is accessible to the substrate RNA without steric hindrance. The ternary complex composed of DRB7.2, DRB4, and endo-IR precursor RNA is formed by the interaction of N-terminal dsRBDs of DRB4 and the sole dsRBD of DRB7.2 that can recognize the dsRNA fold. The formation of the DRB7.2:DRB4 complex increases the availability of the dsRBD pool that is necessary to prevent the access of DCL3 to the endo-IR precursor RNA, which leads to stalling of the production of 24/22 bp siRNA duplexes. The formation of the DRB4:DRB7.2 complex is a critical step in regulating the endo-IR precursor RNA processing. The structural divergence in DRB4D3 from its homologs in humans and flies (TRBPD3/R2D2D3) is a key event that allows plants to tailor the components of the RNAi machinery for diverse gene regulatory pathways.</p></caption>

<p>The ability of DRB7.2 to simultaneously interact with substrate dsRNA and DRB4 using two independent binding sites is unprecedented. Unlike ribosomes, Dicers, and Argonautes, which typically recognize RNA and protein substrates through multiple domains, DRB7.2 achieves this dual recognition using two opposing surfaces within its dsRBD. This distinctive capability of the DRB7.2 dsRBD to concurrently recognize dsRNA and the DRB4D3 domain represents a significant and novel discovery highlighted in our study.</p>
<p>Earlier we have shown that the N-terminal DRB4 dsRBD1 is tailored to recognize the dsRNA and DRB4 dsRBD2 has ephemeral dsRNA binding activity in the presence of DRB4 dsRBD1 (Chiliveri <italic>et a</italic>l 2017). The binding study with 40 bp pre-siRNA presented here suggests that DRB4 dsRBDs and DRB7.2 dsRBD remain successful in populating multiple dsRBDs to sequester the pre-siRNA, thus potentially restricting access of pre-siRNA to DCL3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>).</p>
<p>As evident from the transcript levels annotated at the bioanalytical resource for the plant biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Toufighi K <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), DRB4 transcripts are twice more abundant than DRB7.2, which ensures that abundant DRB4 is ubiquitously available in the cytoplasm for binding with a diverse set of partners such as DCL4 and DRB7.2. As two independent processes involving DRB4, viz., the processing of the <italic>trans</italic>-acting siRNA by DCL4:DRB4 and sequestering endo-IR precursors by DRB7.2:DRB4 occur in the nucleus, plants have to devise an impeccable mechanism for DRB4 to choose between these two partners for efficient utility. We hypothesize that DRB4 interacts with either DRB7.2 or DCL4 post-translationally and the NLS on DRB7.2 and on nuclear localizing isoforms of DCL4 ensures DRB4’s journey to the nucleus. Therefore, by virtue of strong affinity, DRB4 gets tugged in the nucleus with its respective partners, DRB7.2 and DCL4. While the interaction interface of DCL4:DRB4 is not yet understood, the uniquely structured DRB4D3 primarily drives DRB7.2:DRB4 complex formation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our results deliberate on the formation of DCL4:DRB4 mediated RNAi initiation complex formation in plants. In humans and flies, the RNAi initiation complex formation requires interaction of the C-terminal dsRBD or unstructured C-terminal region of dsRBP with the inter-helicase domain of corresponding Dicers. However, the DRB4D3 fold, despite being located at the C-terminus of DRB4, exhibits a very different structure from the canonical C-terminal α-β-β-β-α dsRBD of TRBP (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>) and R2D2 (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>). Remarkably, DRB4D3 adopts a newly identified structural fold composed of three anti-parallel β strands arranged as β1-β3-β2. Despite extensive sequence and structural motif searches, no domain with such an abutted β strand arrangement has been identified during the course of this study. Moreover, following the formation of the DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 complex, DRB4D3 is left with only a little free surface for any additional interaction owing to its relatively small size compared to TRBPD3/R2D2D3. Therefore, DRB4 probably utilizes the remaining unstructured PxxP motif-rich C-terminus or the N-terminal dsRBDs to mediate the DCL4:DRB4 association. Alternatively, the fold attained by DRB4D3 upon binding with DRB7.2M may be an evolved feature enabling interactions with multiple partners, potentially adopting different conformations depending on the binding context.</p>
<p>Hence, our work implies that the organization of the plant RNAi initiation complex is distinct from its non-plant higher eukaryotes, as DRB4D3 is most likely impaired in directly associating with DCL4. Finally, we propose that the Dicer:dsRBP organization for dsRNA processing has evolved differently between plants and animals. Consequently, our results provide a foundation for future studies to unravel the precise organization of Dicer:dsRBP complexes across organisms possessing RNAi pathways and open up newer avenues for understanding the evolutionary diversification of RNA silencing mechanisms.</p>

Additionally, we estimated the K<sub>d</sub> of DRB7.2, DRB4, and DRB7.2:DRB4 complex with commercially synthesized 40 bp RNA, i.e., pre-siRNA with 1 nt 3’ overhang, which is a known DCL3 substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>), (guide: 5’ P-AACAAGCGAAUGAGUCAUUCAUCCUAAGUCUGCAUAAAGU 3’, complementary: 5’ ACUUUAUGCAGACUUAGGAUGAAUGACUCAUUCGCUUGUUC 3’), using gel mobility shift assays.</p>
<p>For each assay, 20 μL reaction containing 750 nM dsRNA and varying protein concentrations were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in buffer containing 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and 2 mM DTT.</p>
<p>The protein:RNA complex was separated on a 7% native PAGE, and the electrophoresis was performed at a constant 80 V for 2 h, RT. The gels were visualized using SYBR Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain, the bound and unbound RNA intensities were calculated from the gels using ImageJ software, and the triplicate data (fraction bound vs protein concentration) was plotted to calculate the apparent K<sub>d</sub> and Hill coefficient using non-linear regression curve fit analysis (Growth/Sigmoidal using Hill equation) using OriginPro 8.0.</p>

<title>15N NMR backbone relaxation and model-free analysis</title>
<p>R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2,</sub> and <sup>15</sup>N-{<sup>1</sup>H} heteronuclear NOE experiments were performed on equimolar complexes of [U-<sup>15</sup>N] DRB7.2M:perdeuterated DRB4D3 and [U-<sup>15</sup>N] DRB4D3:perdeuterated DRB7.2M, where the concentration of each construct was 200 μM. Relaxation rates were estimated by fitting the peak intensities as a function of relaxation delay to a single exponential function and errors in the relaxation rates were calculated by running 500 Monte Carlo simulations using Relax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Bieri et al, 2011</xref>). The ratio of peak intensities with and without proton pre-saturation was used to estimate steady-state NOE, and the standard deviation in the NOE values was calculated from the RMS value of the background noise. R2R1_TM, Quadric diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lee et al., 1997</xref>), and the heterodimeric complex crystal structure were used to make an initial guess of the molecular rotational diffusion tensor from the R<sub>2</sub>/R<sub>1</sub> ratios derived from the individual residues. Model-free analysis was performed with Model-free 4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mandel et al., 1995</xref>) interfaced with FAST-Modelfree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Cole et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, we have extensively used tools hosted by NMRbox for the relaxation data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Maciejewski et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The <sup>15</sup>N backbone relaxation rates (R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub>), the R<sub>2</sub>/R<sub>1</sub> ratio, and the <sup>15</sup>N-{<sup>1</sup>H}-heteronuclear NOE (hetNOE) as a function of residues is represented in <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref> for DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 complex. We have excluded residues T71, T72, E73, D127, S128, K144, and A146 of DRB7.2M and residues E294-C298, K306, K307, and Q321 of DRB4D3 from the analysis due to exchange broadening as manifested by the poor exponential decay fits during data analysis. Residues M124 and K143 of DRB7.2M were excluded due to a lack of backbone chemical shift assignments. The average R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, and hetNOE values obtained for the structured region of DRB7.2M are 0.8 s<sup>-1</sup>, 20 s<sup>-1,</sup> and 0.8, respectively, whereas, the DRB4D3 correspondingly yielded R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, and hetNOE values of 0.8 s<sup>-1</sup>, 22 s<sup>-1</sup>, and 0.7, respectively. While the residues T75-S84, C111, H112, K125, and T131 in DRB7.2M display flexibility as they assume a hetNOE value of 0.3 or lower, the β2-β3 region appears to be rigid. Similarly, in DRB4D3, the N-terminal region comprising V299-I309 is also flexible, as seen from the average hetNOE values of 0.3 or lower.</p>
<p>We obtained an initial estimation of the molecular rotational diffusion tensor using the R<sub>2</sub>/R<sub>1</sub> ratio for residues that are not affected by fast ps-ns timescale internal dynamics or by slow μs-ms timescale dynamics. Using this analysis, we find that the average <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> of the complex is 15.27±0.65 ns, considering only the mean R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). Additionally, using the quadric diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lee et al., 1997</xref>), we have estimated the initial values of the principal components, the parallel (D<sub>ǁ</sub> = D<sub>ZZ</sub>) and perpendicular (D<sub>⊥</sub> = 0.5 (D<sub>XX</sub>+D<sub>YY</sub>)), of the diffusion tensor. The F-test value analysis suggested that the rotational diffusion of the complex is best described by an axially symmetric diffusion tensor over a fully anisotropic tensor. However, the estimated rotational correlation time and the diffusion anisotropy (D<sub>ratio</sub> = D<sub>ǁ</sub>/D<sub>⊥</sub>) are highly identical for both models. Considering an axially symmetric tensor, we obtained an average <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> = 14.43±0.34 ns with D<sub>ratio</sub> = 1.25±0.23 for the complex (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). Simultaneously, we obtained a <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> value of 14.09 ns using the Hydrodynamic radius approach embedded in the program HYDRONMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Torre et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, we have optimized the diffusion tensor using the <sup>15</sup>N backbone relaxation data through extended model-free formalism (using the crystal structure of the complex as the input structure) to derive residue-specific amplitude and fast timescale motions (ps-ns). Iterative model-free fitting was set up with the estimates derived from the above approaches, where the diffusion tensor along with the parameters for internal motions S<sup>2</sup> and <italic>τ</italic><sub>e</sub> is optimized to fit the R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, and NOE data according to the model selection procedure described by Mandel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mandel et al., 1995</xref>). After convergence, we obtained optimized values for <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> = 15.79±0.05 ns and diffusion anisotropy as D<sub>ratio</sub> = 1.13±0.05. NMR relaxation analysis resulted in the rotational correlation time (<italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub>) of 15.8 ns, which corresponds to a molecular weight of ∼ 25 kDa of 1 unit of DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 complex.</p>
<p>The other features derived from the model-free analysis, such as the square of the order parameter (S<sup>2</sup>), model selection, fast-timescale internal motion (<italic>τ</italic><sub>e</sub>), and the conformational exchange rate (R<sub>ex</sub>) as well as the atomic displacement parameter (B-factor) derived from the crystal structure are as shown in <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>. During the final selection of the dynamical model for the individual residues, we observed that the majority of the DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 complex residues assume an average value of 0.85 for the S<sup>2</sup> indicating that the majority of the complex behaves as a rigid entity with no significant dynamics. Nonetheless, the residues C111, H112, and T131 of DRB7.2M and residues L308, I309, and W328 of DRB4D3 show a drop in S<sup>2</sup> below a value of 0.5 suggesting that these regions might possess local flexibility. Unsurprisingly, the decrease in the S<sup>2</sup> values corroborates with an increase in the crystallographic B-factor, as shown in <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>.</p>
<p>As expected, the majority of the residues within the secondary structural elements of the complex assume Model1, where motions on a slow time scale are negligible, and the generalized order parameter is represented by the fast timescale motions only.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Paturi et.al. presents a detailed structural and mechanistic study of the DRB7.2:DRB4 complex in plants, focusing on its role in sequestering endogenous inverted-repeat dsRNA precursors and inhibiting Dicer-like protein 3 (DCL3) activity. By truncating the two proteins, they systematically identify the domains involved in direct interaction between DRB7.2 and DRB4 and study the interactions between the two using biophysical techniques (ITC and NMR). They show using NMR that the interacting domains between the two proteins are likely partially unfolded or aggregated in the absence of the binding partner and determining the NMR structure of the individual interacting domains in the presence of the isotopically unlabelled partner using sparse restrain data combined with Rosetta. They also determine the complex structure of the interacting DRB7.2 dsRBD domain and the DRB4 D3 domain using X-ray crystallography.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript is well written, provides molecular details at high resolution between the interaction of DRB7.2 and DRB4 and the data in the manuscript strongly supports the proposed model where DRB7.2:DRB4 complex sequesters the DCL3 substrates inhibiting its function of producing epigenetically activated siRNAs.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript unfortunately completely lacks functional validation of the determined DRB7.2:DRB4 complex structure which is required for the rigorous validation of the proposed model. For functional validation of the determined structures, the author should at least present the mutational analysis (impact on complex formation, RNA affinity) of the point mutants derived from the structure of the DRB7.2:DRB4 complex.</p>
<p>(2) The proposed model shows the DRB7.2M and DRB4D3 as partially folded/aggregated proteins in the absence of the complex, understandably from the presented NMR data of the individual domains. However, in the cellular context, when the RNAs are present, especially DRB7.2M might be properly folded/not aggregated. Could the authors support or negate this by showing the 15N HSQC spectrum of DRB7.2M in complex with the 13 bp dsRNA?</p>
<p>(3) It remains unclear from the manuscript if DRB7.1 will have a similar or different mechanism of interaction with DRB4. Based on the sequence comparisons of the two proteins, the authors should comment on this in the discussion section.</p>
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>(1) There are no errors for the N, dH and dS values of the ITC measurements in Table 1. Also, it seems that the measurements are done only once. Values derived from at least triplicates should be presented. This would be helpful to increase confidence in the values derived from ITC especially for the titration between DRB7.2, DRB4C, and DRB4D3 as the N value there is substantially lower than 1 which does not agree with the other data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Paturi and colleagues uses an approach that combines structural biology and biochemistry to probe protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions for two protein factors related to the dsRNA pathway in plants.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A key finding in the research is the direct demonstration of the ability of the single dsRBD (double-strand RNA binding domain) of DRB7.2 to interact simultaneously with dsRNA as well as the C-terminal domain of DRB4. The heterodimerization of DRB7.2 and DRB4 is demonstrated to make a high-affinity complex with dsRNA and it is proposed that this atypical use of the dsRBD domain to bridge the protein and RNA may contribute to the ability to prevent cleavage that would otherwise occur for dsRNA. The primary results for the interactions are generally well-supported by the data, and the conclusions are taken from the available results without excessive speculation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There is a need for some statistical repeats, as well as a suggested movement of many protein characterization findings in the solution state to support data or to better indicate how these properties could play a role in the final proposed mechanism. There is also the need for certain measurement replicates, such as for the ITC data which are derived from single measurements and lack sufficient estimates of error.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Paturi et.al. presents a detailed structural and mechanistic study of the DRB7.2:DRB4 complex in plants, focusing on its role in sequestering endogenous inverted-repeat dsRNA precursors and inhibiting Dicer-like protein 3 (DCL3) activity. By truncating the two proteins, they systematically identify the domains involved in direct interaction between DRB7.2 and DRB4 and study the interactions between the two using biophysical techniques (ITC and NMR). They show using NMR that the interacting domains between the two proteins are likely partially unfolded or aggregated in the absence of the binding partner and determining the NMR structure of the individual interacting domains in the presence of the isotopically unlabelled partner using sparse restrain data combined with Rosetta. They also determine the complex structure of the interacting DRB7.2 dsRBD domain and the DRB4 D3 domain using X-ray crystallography.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript is well written, provides molecular details at high resolution between the interaction of DRB7.2 and DRB4, and the data in the manuscript strongly supports the proposed model where DRB7.2:DRB4 complex sequesters the DCL3 substrates inhibiting its function of producing epigenetically activated siRNAs.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript, unfortunately, completely lacks functional validation of the determined DRB7.2:DRB4 complex structure, which is required for the rigorous validation of the proposed model. For functional validation of the determined structures, the author should at least present the mutational analysis (impact on complex formation, RNA affinity) of the point mutants derived from the structure of the DRB7.2:DRB4 complex.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out a crucial aspect that is missed out in our manuscript. With the inputs and experiments proposed above, we would certainly like to perform additional mutational analysis to determine the impact on the heterodimeric complex formation and identify the key essential residues involved in the RNA binding.</p>
<p>We expect that we can accomplish this study in the next ~ 4-6 months as we may have to create a combination of mutations for residues involved in the dimerization interface, namely, T131, V132, E134, F136, W156, and V161 on DRB7.2M. Having said that, the disruption of the heterodimer interface would probably lead to DRB7.2M and DRB4D3 returning to their fast-intermediate timescale exchanging native homo-oligomeric state/partially folded state.</p>
<p>For dsRNA binding, six residues (i.e., A85 and K86 (a1), H112 and K114 (b1-b2 loop), and K142 and K144 (a2)) involved in the RNA binding interface and a few other residues based on the mutational data will be considered.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The proposed model shows the DRB7.2M and DRB4D3 as partially folded/aggregated proteins in the absence of the complex, understandably from the presented NMR data of the individual domains. However, in the cellular context, when the RNAs are present, especially DRB7.2M might be properly folded/not aggregated. Could the authors support or negate this by showing the <sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum of DRB7.2M in complex with the 13 bp dsRNA?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we have no direct proof that the DRB7.2M might be folded/not aggregated in the presence of RNAs in the cellular context, the <italic>in vitro</italic> NMR-based titration studies of alone DRB7.2 (Author response image 1A) with two molar equivalence of 13 bp dsRNA (Author response image 1B and R1C) indicate that there is no change in overall spectral pattern (except for the apparent chemical shift perturbations as expected from fast-intermediate exchange timescale binding of DRB7.2M with 13 bp dsRNA), implying that the dsRNA alone is neither necessary nor sufficient to disrupt the native fast exchange oligomeric states sampled by individual DRB7.2 and DRB7.2M.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the line-width analysis, shown in Author response image 1D, implies that the ~R<sub>2</sub> rates are roughly identical in the presence of dsRNA, indicating that the native oligomeric state of DRB7.2M remains unperturbed by the presence of dsRNA. Our observation also corroborates with the crystal structure presented in the manuscript, where we have observed that the hetero-dimeric interface lies on the opposite side of the dsRNA binding interface of the DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 complex.</p>
<p>Therefore, the dsRNA substrate does not have any role in the native partially folded/oligomeric state of DRB7.2M.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It remains unclear from the manuscript if DRB7.1 will have a similar or different mechanism of interaction with DRB4. Based on the sequence comparisons of the two proteins, the authors should comment on this in the discussion section.</p>

<p>Moreover, the residues involved in the heterodimerization interface in DRB7.2M are identical to those in DRB7.1. As a matter of fact, the residues involved in the dimerization interface, namely, T131, V132, E134, F136, W156, and V161 in DRB7.2M are unchanged in DRB7.1, suggesting that DRB7.1M may interact with DRB4D3 using a similar manner as illustrated for DRB7.2M:DRB4D3 in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Future studies will shed more light on the binding preference of DRB4D3 with DRB7.1 versus DRB7.2. One interesting thing to note is that DRB7.2 is exclusively present in the nucleus, whereas DRB7.1 is observed to localize in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm. Therefore, spatial restriction may be one of the mechanisms that bring exclusivity to the interaction partner despite having a conserved interaction interface.</p>

<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>(1) There are no errors for the N, dH, and dS values of the ITC measurements in Table 1. Also, it seems that the measurements are done only once. Values derived from at least triplicates should be presented. This would be helpful to increase confidence in the values derived from ITC, especially for the titration between DRB7.2, DRB4C, and DRB4D3, as the N value there is substantially lower than 1, which does not agree with the other data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We plan to estimate the errors as proposed by the reviewer in the revised manuscript to ensure that the presented data is of high confidence.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Paturi and colleagues uses an approach that combines structural biology and biochemistry to probe protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions for two protein factors related to the dsRNA pathway in plants.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A key finding in the research is the direct demonstration of the ability of the single dsRBD (double-strand RNA binding domain) of DRB7.2 to interact simultaneously with dsRNA as well as the C-terminal domain of DRB4. The heterodimerization of DRB7.2 and DRB4 is demonstrated to make a high-affinity complex with dsRNA, and it is proposed that this atypical use of the dsRBD domain to bridge the protein and RNA may contribute to the ability to prevent cleavage that would otherwise occur for dsRNA. The primary results for the interactions are generally well-supported by the data, and the conclusions are taken from the available results without excessive speculation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There is a need for some statistical repeats, as well as a suggested movement of many protein characterization findings in the solution state to support data or to better indicate how these properties could play a role in the final proposed mechanism. There is also the need for certain measurement replicates, such as for the ITC data, which are derived from single measurements and lack sufficient estimates of error.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We plan to restructure the manuscript on the lines proposed by the reviewer in the revised version. Moreover, as mentioned in the response to the comments of Reviewer 1, we suggest estimating the errors to ensure that the presented data is of high confidence in the revised version.</p>
