<abstract>
<p>Emotions, defined as transient states preparing organisms for adaptive responses, are thought to be based on evolutionarily conserved building blocks (“emotion primitives”) that are present across mammalian and other vertebrate species. Whether and to which extent these building blocks are found in insects is largely undefined. In this study, we employ the open field test in fruit flies and focus on wall-following and total walking activity as behavioural indicators of emotion-like states.</p><p>Wildtype and transgenic flies were subjected to various conditions, including social isolation, starvation, and exposure to anxiolytic substances prior to behavioural testing in the open field test. The results indicate that wall-following and total walking activity are modulated by these conditions, with generally increased wall-following observed under aversive stimuli and decreased values under positive conditions. Notably, the behaviour was consistent across different times of the day and independent of circadian rhythms. Genetic manipulation of neuromodulatory systems, such as serotonin, dopamine, and neuropeptide F, supports the role of these pathways in modulating emotion-like states in the fruit fly. Activation of reward-related neurons decreased wall-following, while inhibition increased it, aligning with known effects in mammalian models. Additionally, pharmacological treatments with ethanol and diazepam produced predictable changes in wall-following and total walking activity, reinforcing the validity of the open field test as a measure of emotion-like states in the fly.</p><p>The findings suggest that <italic>Drosophila</italic> exhibits core emotion-like states, with wall-following and total walking activity serving as reliable indicators of emotional valence and arousal. Our results promote the use of <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a powerful genetic model to dissect the neuronal and neurochemical substrates of emotion primitives, shedding light on the evolution of basic emotional processing mechanisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Emotions can be defined as transient states that, upon specific events or stimuli, prepare the human organism for adaptive behavioural and physiological responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anderson and Adolphs 2014</xref>). These states generally involve some form of subjective experience (“feelings”) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">James 1884</xref>). One example is fear, which triggers specific neuronal and autonomic responses that prime the organism for a range of defensive behaviours, such as freezing and fight or flight, depending on the intensity of the threat stimulus and the likelihood of harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Roelofs 2017</xref>). Threat situations and coupled stimulus-dependent defensive behaviour are encountered by all animals, including humans. It is therefore plausible to assume that basal neuronal circuits and neurochemical brain states underlying fear and other basic emotions in humans are evolutionarily conserved in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">LeDoux 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anderson and Adolphs 2014</xref>), even though it is questionable and difficult to test whether non-human animals experience emotions and hence conscious feelings. Thus, contemporary concepts of emotions and increasing evidence suggest that basal building blocks in form of neuronal and bodily states underlying emotions in humans (“emotional processing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">LeDoux 2012</xref>), “emotion primitives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anderson and Adolphs 2014</xref>)) can also be found in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Damasio 1999</xref>; de Waal 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">LeDoux 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anderson and Adolphs 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zych and Gogolla 2021</xref>). These concepts allow the use of animal models, including genetic model organisms such as the mouse, to dissect the neuronal underpinnings of these basal circuits and brain-body states, which are still poorly defined.</p>
<p>Potentially, <italic>Drosophila</italic> may serve as a valuable model for investigating the neuronal and physiological mechanisms of “emotion primitives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anderson and Adolphs 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Perry and Baciadonna 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gu et al. 2019</xref>) due to its sophisticated genetic tools and available whole-brain connectomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Scheffer et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Schlegel et al. 2023</xref>). In fact, a range of fly studies have already been conducted to elucidate neuronal mechanisms and neuromodulators underlying specific emotion-related behaviours like aggression (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoyer et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zhou et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Williams et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Asahina et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jung et al. 2020</xref>), or fear-like defensive behaviour (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gibson et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mohammad et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zacarias et al. 2018</xref>)). Moreover, evidence of negative cognitive bias, a characteristic of specific affective states, has been reported for another insect, the honey bee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bateson et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A widely used test for negative (defensive) emotion-like states in rodents is the open field test (OFT). Typically, animals are placed inside an open arena, and the ratio of the time spent in the central vs. peripheral zone is measured and used to assess fear-like behaviour. Increased aversion of the center – commonly referred to as thigmotaxis-is usually interpreted as a sign of an increased anxiety/fear-like defensive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Walsh and Cummins 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Simon et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Belzung and Griebel 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Crusio 2001</xref>). Similarly, humans with elevated anxiety sensitivity or patients with anxiety disorders show increased time spent along the green wall of a natural open field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Walz et al. 2016</xref>). Outside of a fear-related context, the OFT is used to study exploratory behaviour (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Easton et al. 2003</xref>)) and pain-related thigmotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zhang et al. 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to rodents, fruit flies show increased center avoidance and wall-following (WAFO) in larger open field arenas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Götz and Biesinger 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Besson and Martin 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Liu et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Valente et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Soibam et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mohammad et al. 2016</xref>), which at least in part represents exploration of the boundary rather than thigmotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Soibam et al. 2012</xref>). A pioneering study from the Claridge-Chang laboratory employed a small open field arena to provide evidence for ancient fear-related pathways that are conserved between mice and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mohammad et al. 2016</xref>). Specifically, they found that manipulation of serotonin signaling, anxiolytic treatment with diazepam as well as stress produced remarkably similar effects in the OFT as in mice. Thus, <italic>Drosophila</italic> wall following resembled the characteristics of anxiety-related behaviour in rodents. These results suggest that OFT behaviour can be used as a behavioural proxy of a fear-like state in flies.</p>
<p>These findings made us wonder whether WAFO and locomotor activity in the OFT can be used as more general behavioural proxies for emotion-like states beyond fear in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. To investigate this, we subjected different wildtype and transgenic flies to a number of different negative and positive conditions and treatments prior to automated behavioural tracking in the OFT. Then, we quantified total locomotor activity and wall-following behaviour. Our results show that the OFT response of <italic>Drosophila</italic> is remarkably similar to different forms of aversive stimuli and can be reversed by restoration of non-aversive conditions, or positively influenced by thermogenetic activation of appetitive modulatory neurons. We further show that the behaviour in the open field is independent of the time of the day and circadian locomotor activity but differs between flies under laboratory versus natural selection. Collectively, our results suggest that the behaviour in a small open field arena can be used to behaviourally assess core emotion-like states of flies. This opens the possibility to use the OFT as an easy and automatable behavioural readout in conjunction with the sophisticated genetic toolbox and the connectome knowledge of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to study the neuronal and neurochemical substrates of “emotion primitives”.</p>

<title>WAFO and TOWA reversibly correlate with aversive signals in Drosophila</title>
<p>When flies are placed into a larger open field arena, they show a high initial locomotor activity which is strongly dependent on the diameter of the arena and declines quickly over the first minutes to reach a steady activity level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Connolly 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Liu et al. 2007</xref>). Importantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Liu et al. (2007)</xref> found that this initial activity is completely lost in a circular arena of 6.6 cm diameter, while it was measurable over 3 minutes in larger arenas of 17.6 and 28.5 cm diameter. To reduce the complexity of the open field behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Martin 2003</xref>), we therefore used an array of circular arenas with a small diameter (1cm), which we expected to minimise the initial exploratory activity component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Meehan and Wilson 1987</xref>) and hence emphasizes a measurement of stimulated activity. Importantly, a 1cm square arena had successfully been used before to study “fear-like” defensive behaviour in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mohammad et al. 2016</xref>). For the current experiments, we put a single male fly into each arena and automatically tracked the behaviour for 10 min, as initial experiments based on 1h recordings revealed that the average activity within this time period is stable and is not significantly different from the following 10 min periods. We then calculated the distance to the center as a measure for WAFO, and the total walking distance (TOWA) as a measure for locomotor activity.</p>
<p>In a first set of experiments, we tested 7d old unmanipulated and unconditioned male flies in the arena, which walked close to the wall, but also crossed the center (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We then removed the flies from the arena and kept them socially isolated under starvation on pure agarose on a vibrating shaker (420 rpm) for one day. Afterwards, we observed a significantly increased WAFO and TOWA when retested in the OFT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A-A’</xref>). The males were then placed together as a group in a fresh vial on standard full medium without vibration, and 20 virgin females were added. After one day of restoration, the male flies were retested in the OFT and showed restored pre-stress WAFO and TOWA values (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1 A-A’</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>When plotted in a two-dimensional coordinate system, the multiple stress experience shifted the data points (X=WAFO, Y=TOWA) for the individual flies towards significantly higher values (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A’</xref>). These data points shifted back towards the pre-stress values after the flies were restored from stress (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A’</xref>). To better visualise the behavioural changes, we normalised the individual values for WAFO and TOWA to the median pre-stress values. We then plotted the resulting relative median values for the whole group, with the X-Y axis representing the respective fold change of WAFO/TOWA compared to the pre-stressed condition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A’’</xref>). We further reversed the sign of the fold change of WAFO to better reflect that center preference decreases with increasing strength of aversive signals. Due to the normalisation, the median pre-stress value now centers at the axis origin, and the fold-change of -WAFO and TOWA can obtain a positive or a negative value (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A’’</xref>). After experiencing stress, the values moved in the direction of an increased WAFO and increased TOWA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A’’</xref>).</p>
<p>To evaluate the effect of single stressors, seven days old male unconditioned flies were tested pre-treatment on day 1, and then either kept i) isolated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-A’</xref>), ii) starved (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-B’</xref>), iii) sleep-deprived (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-C’</xref>), iv) sex-deprived as virgins by female rejection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-D’</xref>), or v) sex-deprived after mating in a group without females (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-E’</xref>) over two to three days (day 2-4) and re-tested for their behaviour in the OFT. At the end, flies were allowed to restore from stress by allowing social contact, feeding, mating and sleep according to the previously exerted stress for one day (day 4 or 5) and then tested again in the OFT. As before, the unconditioned pre-stressed flies defined the baseline value to normalise the results. After social isolation for one and two days (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-A’</xref>), and two days of starvation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-B’</xref>), flies showed a significantly increased TOWA. WAFO increased as well after two days of social isolation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-A’</xref>), and after one and two days of starvation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-B’</xref>). These changes in behaviour further increased with four days of social isolation, or two days of starvation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B’</xref>). The strong increase in TOWA from day 1 to day 2 under starvation can at least partially be explained by increased AKH/octopamine-dependent starvation-induced hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lee and Park 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Isabel et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Yang et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Yu et al. 2016</xref>). Upon restoring social contact and providing food, TOWA and WAFO shifted back towards the pre-stress levels which were, however, not fully reached at least for WAFO (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B’</xref>). Similarly, when either sleep-deprived during the day including siesta time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-C’</xref>), or sex-deprived as virgins due to being rejected by mated females for one day (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-D’</xref>), flies increased both TOWA and WAFO. These changes became again more pronounced over time with continued sex deprivation like the changes seen after social isolation and starvation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-D’</xref>). In line, extending sleep deprivation into the night resulted in an increase of WAFO, while TOWA decreased possibly due to exhaustion from night sleep deprivation. After restoration, WAFO for both sleep- and sex-deprived flies shifted towards pre-stress levels, while TOWA remained significantly higher compared to the pre-treatment level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-D’</xref>). When mated adult flies were sex-deprived by keeping them in male-only groups, TOWA and WAFO levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-E’</xref>) changed qualitatively like what was observed for sex-deprived virgin males that were rejected by mated females (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-D’</xref>). Notably, restoration by mating with a virgin female decreased both WAFO and TOWA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-E’</xref>). One explanation for the difference in TOWA levels between the restored sex-deprived males is that the mating-rejected virgin males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-D’</xref>) were sexually naive, while the mated males kept separated from females (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-E’</xref>) already had the opportunity to mate prior to the test. The increased TOWA levels of the virgin males after first mating during restoration may thus indicate an increased motivation to look for new mating partners due to a novel activation of a neuronal reward circuit compared to mating-experienced males. A previous study in a larger circular arena had not found differences in WAFO between virgin and mated flies in both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bath et al. 2020</xref>), suggesting that the mating status per se has no significant effect on the open field behaviour. Combined, the results for the different single stressors show that stress in general leads to increased TOWA and WAFO levels, while restoration from stress in general reverts both values towards pre-stress levels.</p>

<p>To test for the effect of age, we analysed the open field behaviour of unconditioned young flies 2-3 days, 5-6 days, and 10-11 days after eclosion (under our conditions, flies typically reach an age of 50+ days). We found no effect in TOWA between these age groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F-F’</xref>), indicating that the flies are physiologically of a similar (young) age. In contrast, we observed a significant increase of WAFO in the older groups compared to 2-3 days-old flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F-F’</xref>), which suggests that older flies are more defensive than young flies. Significant differences in WAFO between 5-6- and 10-11 days-old flies were not observed, which validates our standard use of 5-11 days-old flies for the OFT. These age-related changes in WAFO suggest that either age-dependent experience or (brain) maturation during early life alters open field behaviour</p>

<title>Aversive stimuli and anxiolytic substances influence the open field behaviour of flies similar to mice</title>
<p>We next ask whether aversive stimuli connected to pain in rodents lead to similar behavioural changes in flies. For that, we applied i) a mild mechanical shock (5x tapping) to induce a startle response, ii) a heat pulse of 37°C during the OFT, and iii) 10 brief consecutive electric foot shocks. Flies were tested for their open field behaviour before and during or after the treatment. A mild mechanical shock significantly increased WAFO compared to pre-stimulus conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-A’</xref>). This effect was intensified after the mechanical shock was repeated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-A’</xref>), along with a significant increase in TOWA. Similarly, a 37°C heat shock during the OFT increased both WAFO and TOWA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-B’</xref>). Moreover, an aversive electric foot shock (EFS) resulted in increased WAFO and TOWA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-C’</xref>). We next repeated the experiment with EFS with a new set of flies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-D’</xref>). As before, TOWA was increased, while WAFO reached from medium to elevated levels after EFS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-D’</xref>). The day after, we first retested the flies which showed that WAFO and TOWA were fully restored to pre-shock conditions. Afterwards, we applied 1.2 second EFS. As expected, this resulted in increased WAFO value similar to the EFS on day 1. Strikingly, however, the increase in TOWA was lost after the second EFS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-D’</xref>), reminiscent of the learned “helplessness” state of flies after EFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Batsching et al. 2016</xref>).</p>

<p>The OFT is often used to screen for effects of drugs, including ethanol and diazepam, on pain-induced avoidance and fear-like behaviour in rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Prut and Belzung 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Knight et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zhang et al. 2023</xref>). To assess whether flies react similarly, we tested the effect of ethanol (which has different dose-dependent effects on locomotor activity in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Singh and Heberlein 2000</xref>)) and diazepam (a benzodiazepine and prototype anxiolytic drug). Using a capillary feeder (CAFE) assay that allows to quantify food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ja et al. 2007</xref>), we first supplied flies for 24h with 10% ethanol mixed with sucrose and then tested flies that had consumed at least 1μl in the OFT. After ethanol consumption, flies showed weakly increased WAFO, and a weakly decreased TOWA compared to controls that consumed sucrose only (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E-E’</xref>). Thus, feeding on 10% ethanol had a weak sedative but no “anxiolytic” effect on flies under our conditions. Next, we kept flies in vials on 2% coloured agarose mixed with either 4% sucrose (control) or 4% sucrose plus 5 mM diazepam. Food consumption was checked by the appearance of colour in the gut of the flies. Flies that had consumed sucrose plus diazepam-containing food showed a significantly decreased WAFO while TOWA was unaffected compared to controls that had consumed only sucrose (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-F’</xref>). This indicates that, unlike 10% ethanol, diazepam has an “anxiolytic-like” effect and confirms that the “anxiolytic” effect of a diazepam-ethanol solution described in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mohammad et al. 2016</xref>) was indeed due to the benzodiazepine.</p>

<title>Genetic manipulation of neuromodulator signalling affects WAFO rather than TOWA</title>
<p>The results above show that stress and aversive signals trigger a similar open field behaviour in flies as reported for rodents. In mammals including humans, mood, anxiety and fear are under neuromodulatory control by biogenic amines and neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rana et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Pourhamzeh et al. 2022</xref>). In particular, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), dopamine as well as neuropeptide Y (NPY) signalling are known to strongly affect the open field behaviour of rodents ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Simon et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Broderick and Phelix 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Prut and Belzung 2003</xref>). We therefore asked whether manipulating homolog neurochemical systems in the fly brain also yield similar effects in the open field behaviour as found in mice. First, we revisited the role of serotonin signalling by repeating previous experiments by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mohammad and colleagues (2016)</xref>. We conditionally down-regulated (by RNA interference) or overexpressed the <italic>Drosophila</italic> serotonin transporter (dSerT) using a temperature-inducible (29°C) pan-neuronal <italic>nSyb tubGal80ts</italic> Gal4 driver line based on the TARGET system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">McGuire et al. 2003</xref>). Control and experimental flies were pre-incubated at either 18°C or 29°C prior to the OFT assays conducted at 20°C. The pre-incubation temperature itself had no effect on the respective GAL4 driver and UAS responder controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-D</xref>). Overexpression of dSerT at 29°C significantly reduced WAFO (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) in line with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mohammad et al. (2016)</xref>. RNAi-mediated down-regulation of <italic>SerT</italic> at 29°C, however, also resulted in reduced WAFO (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), contrary to what was expected and found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mohammad et al. (2016)</xref>. TOWA was not significantly affected by either downregulation or overexpression of <italic>SerT</italic> (Suppl. Fig. 1). Directly after the OFT, the flies received an electrical foot shock (EFS) in the arena, and then were tested a second time. This treatment significantly increased both WAFO and TOWA in controls and flies with down-regulated <italic>SerT</italic> expression (Suppl. Fig. 2). Yet, flies with <italic>SerT</italic> overexpression showed a significant increase only for TOWA (Suppl. Fig. 2). Moreover, decreased or increased <italic>SerT</italic> expression at the permissive temperature led to a significantly reduced post-EFS increase in WAFO compared to the non-permissive temperature (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Next, we used the <italic>GMR58E02-Gal4</italic> line and expressed a temperature-sensitive form of dynamin encoded by <italic>shibire</italic> (Shits) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kitamoto 2001</xref>) to specifically and conditionally suppress neuronal transmission of the dopaminergic protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) neurons that project prominently to the medial lobe of the mushroom body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liu et al. 2012</xref>). While the PAM neurons are an inhomogeneous group of neurons in adult flies, their <italic>en masse</italic> activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liu et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Burke et al. 2012</xref>) or disinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Yamagata et al. 2021</xref>) signals reward, and their thermogenetic or optogenetic activation induces valence-driven behaviour such as attraction or aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aso et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mohammad et al. 2024</xref>) . Specific silencing of neuronal transmission at 29°C in PAM neurons significantly increased WAFO compared to the same genotype tested at 18°C (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), while temperature itself had no effect in controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). As in the dSerT experiment, we found no change in TOWA after suppression of dopaminergic PAM neuron signalling (Suppl Fig. 3). Next, we activated the PAM neurons thermogenetically at 29°C via the temperature-sensitive channel TRPA1 prior to the OFT. This resulted in a significant decrease of WAFO (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) compared to temperature controls.

<title>In the OFT, wild-caught Drosophila melanogaster strains are more defensive and aroused than laboratory wildtype strains</title>
<p>The results above show that fruit flies in the OFT react similarly to stressors and impaired neuromodulatory signalling as rodents for which the open field behaviour can be linked to fear-like states. Like other emotions, fear and anxiety are products of evolution, thought to promote the adaptation of behavioural and physiological responses to the environmental condition, e.g., the presence of a predator or other dangerous situations. However, all experiments so far were conducted with fly strains that for many generations are kept in the laboratory without predators, with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food, and with extremely limited possibility to spatially escape from aggressors. We therefore wondered to which degree the observed OFT responses are representing naturally selected responses, and compared the unconditioned open field behaviour among three laboratory wild type strains (OregonR (OrR), CantonS strain (CS), and CantonS flies that were outcrossed against a <italic>period01</italic> strain for 110 generations (CS110) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Horn et al. 2019</xref>)), as well as three wild-caught strains of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (originating from Hubland-Würzburg/Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Deppisch et al. 2022</xref>), as well as from Munich/Germany and Akaa/Finland (coll: John Parsch and Maaria Kankare within the DrosEU consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kapun et al. 2020</xref>)). To cover the natural variation within the wild-caught strains, all experiments were conducted with the F1 outcross of isofemale lines from the respective population. To account and test for possible time-dependent effects, an OFT was performed every six hours during a day in a light-dark cycle of 12:12. Daily rhythmicity or significant day-dependent changes in WAFO were not observed in the tested strains (ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-B</xref>) except for the CS110 strain (ANOVA, p&lt;0.01). We infer from this that the naïve WAFO behaviour in the OFT is independent of the time-of-day and the circadian clock. For TOWA, only the Finnish (ANOVA, p&lt;0.0001) and the CS110 strain (ANOVA, p&lt;0.05), but not the other strains showed significant day-dependent differences in TOWA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A-B</xref>, Suppl.

These differences, however, did not correlate with the typical morning (around Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0) and evening peak (around ZT12) in spontaneous locomotor activity in the DAM assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>) which is under circadian control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Schlichting and Helfrich-Förster 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main aim of this study was to evaluate whether wall-following (WAFO) and total walking activity (TOWA) in the OFT can be used to behaviourally assess core dimensions of emotion-like states in fruit flies. Our results show that conditions and treatments associated with negative valence in humans or other mammals (including social isolation, starvation, sex or sleep deprivation, heat, mechanical disturbance, and electric foot shocks) generally increased WAFO. On the contrary, conditions and treatments associated with positive valence in mammals (including social company, feeding, and relief from stress) generally decreased WAFO. This raises the question whether WAFO can be interpreted as indicating emotional valence in the fly.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>WAFO as an indicator of emotional valence in the fly?</title>
<p>In humans, valence can be defined as an indicator whether something is good or bad/pleasant or unpleasant/helpful or harmful. As such, valence is one key dimension of emotional states, reflecting the organism’s capacity for evaluating stimuli or situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barrett 2006</xref>). In behavioural terms, positive valence leads to approach behaviour (positive taxis), while negative valence results in withdrawal (negative taxis). In T-maze experiments with <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tully and Quinn 1985</xref>), for example, approach or avoidance of an odour learned to be associated with either reward or punishment is extensively used to dissect the neuronal mechanisms underlying appetitive and aversive memory and valence assignment (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Keene 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Perisse et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aso et al. 2014</xref>). One outcome of these and similar studies is that distinct subsets of dopaminergic neurons in the fly brain assign and innately encode positive or negative valence of odors or tastes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Owald and Waddell 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Siju et al. 2020</xref>). Strikingly, optogenetic activation of a large subset of dopaminergic neurons in the paired-anterior-medial (PAM) cluster (targeted by R58E02-Gal 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liu et al. 2012</xref>)) that drives appetitive memory to odors was alone sufficient to elicit attraction in a light-dark optogenetic assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mohammad et al. 2024</xref>). In the OFT, we found that aversion of the center/approaching the wall was caused by stimuli that would have a negative valence in humans, while stimuli that would have a positive valence in humans elicited an opposite response. Moreover, thermogenetic activation of the R58E02 PAM neuron subcluster that drove attraction in a light-dark optogenetic assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mohammad et al. 2024</xref>) also increased attraction to the center in the OFT, while conditional block of their activity increased WAFO. Thus, WAFO/center preference appears to be a suitable behavioural indicator of emotional valence in the fly.</p>
<p>In the study of human emotions, dimensional theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Russell 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Watson et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Posner et al. 2005</xref>) have gained considerable influence and provide a conceptual framework that is extendable to the study of animals as they rely on few empirically measurable dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mendl et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anderson and Adolphs 2014</xref>). One of the most widely used dimensional theories is the circumplex model that is based on two bipolar dimensions thought to represent two independent neurophysiological systems: arousal (active/ activated-inactive/ inactivated) and valence (positive/ pleasure-negative/displeasure) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Russell 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Posner et al. 2005</xref>). Subjective experiences that can be classified by these dimensions are referred to as “core affect”, regarded to be a most basic component underlying emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Russell 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">2003</xref>). Core affect represents the “constant stream of transient alterations in an organism’s neurophysiological state that represents its immediate relationship to the flow of changing events” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barrett 2006</xref>), i.e. changes in reaction to internal and external stimuli. A great advantage of the circumplex model is that the degree of arousal and valence cannot only be obtained by oral report but also by objective physiological and behavioural measurements. This allows to extend the circumplex model to non-human animals where subjective report is absent but behaviour and physiology can still be measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mendl et al. 2010</xref>). Based on the conclusion that WAFO can be used as a proxy for valence, we asked whether TOWA can be used as a proxy for arousal, and hence whether the observed OFT behaviour in the fly can be plotted in a circumplex-like manner.</p>

<title>TOWA as a proxy for exogenously induced arousal in the fly?</title>
<p>Altered locomotor activity is part of an operational definition of arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pfaff and Banavar 2007</xref>) and is thought to be a hallmark of emotion states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zych and Gogolla 2021</xref>). In the fly, like in other animals, endogenous processes such as sleep drive, the satiety state, the emotional state or the circadian clock modulate arousal and locomotor activity in similar directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">van Swinderen and Andretic 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Van Swinderen and Andretic 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionaly, external factors such as a new environment can trigger increased sensory and behavioural responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">van Swinderen and Andretic 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Van Swinderen and Andretic 2011</xref>), for example in the form of increased locomotor activity during exploratory behaviour. We here chose a small and empty OFT arena for our behavioural assay which allowed us to minimise externally-triggered exploratory behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Liu et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Soibam et al. 2012</xref>). Our results show that TOWA in our OFT setup is not regulated in a circadian or diel manner in various laboratory and nature-derived strains, nor was TOWA significantly correlated with the spontaneous activity level measured in <italic>Drosophila</italic> activity monitors, which is strongly modulated by the circadian clock. In line with an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mohammad et al. 2016</xref>), we therefore conclude for our OFT setup that TOWA is distinct from spontaneous and clock-regulated locomotor activity. Rather, the observed walking activity appears to primarily represent a startle-like stimulated activity (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Meehan and Wilson 1987</xref>) that is induced by the stimulus of the new environment after the fly is put into the arena (with possible exception of the starvation treatment which is known to induce locomotor hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lee and Park 2004</xref>)). Our results show that the magnitude of this stimulated activity depends on the treatment of the fly prior to the new stimulus of the arena, which is in line with the idea of basic emotion-like states in the fly. We assume that this stimulated activity may comprise elements of escape behaviour (one form of defensive behaviour). Interestingly, nature-derived strains showed higher TOWA than the highly inbred lab strains OrR and CS. This may not be surprising as OrR and CS flies have been selected over hundreds of generations for a sedentary lifestyle in fly bottles. In addition, compared to lab strains, nature-derived strains likely possess a higher sensory acuity and may show a higher responsiveness to external stimuli and hence higher arousability. Collectively, our data suggest that TOWA in the OFT can be interpreted as a behavioural proxy for exogenously induced arousal. Moreover, our results showed that WAFO and TOWA are largely independent variables, which corresponds to the orthogonal conceptualisation of valence and arousal in dimensional theories of human emotions</p>
<p>When we next plotted WAFO as an indicator of relative valence (i.e. fold change of - WAFO with respect to the pre-stimulus condition), and TOWA as a proxy of relative arousal (i.e. fold change of TOWA with respect to the pre-stimulus condition) in analogy to the circumplex model (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), most conditions and treatments lead to a location in the upper left Q4 quadrant that in humans is associated with conditions like “fearful”, “stressed” or “nervous”, or the lower right Q2 quadrant that in humans is typically associated with states like “relaxed”, “calm” or “contented” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Russell 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Posner et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mendl et al. 2010</xref>). Few conditions and treatments led to a location in the Q1-Q3 axis. Consecutive foot shocks as well as consumption of 10% ethanol led to a location in Q3 that in humans is associated with conditions like “depressed”, “bored” or “sad”. In comparison to a single electric foot shock that increased WAFO and TOWA, continued foot shock increased WAFO but slightly decreased TOWA. This phenotype is reminiscent of a depressive state in mammals, and resembles the learned helplessness behaviour of flies in the electric shock box in which uncontrollable electric shocks have a longer-lasting negative effect on locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Batsching et al. 2016</xref>). Mating after rejection and sleep recovery showed the strongest decrease in WAFO with weakly increased TOWA, and hence co-locate with a state that is labeled as “joy” in humans (Q1). We can currently only speculate why most conditions and treatments lead to a location along the Q2-Q4 axis, while only a few lead to a location in the Q1-Q3 with a relatively small difference in TOWA compared to controls. However, we note that, in humans, the negative/inactive quadrant is also frequently underrepresented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lang et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bradley and Lang 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bradley et al. 2001</xref>), possibly because negative emotional states always induce some degree of arousal. Alternatively, the observed distribution may be caused by the nature of the OFT which is typically conceptualised as a behavioural assay for anxiety-like behaviour and thus promotes conditions along the Q2-Q4 axis which have been related to the avoidance of fitness-threatening punishers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mendl et al. 2010</xref>). Moreover, the normalisation against control flies that have their major requirements satisfied (i.e., <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food, mating and social partners present, optimal temperature and light regime) might negatively bias against emotional states along the Q1 (upper right) and Q3 (lower left) axis which have been related to acquiring fitness-enhancing rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mendl et al. 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>The median values from all treatments were normalized to the median control value: for post-stress, the pre-stress median served as the control, and for post-restoration, the post-stress median served as the control. These normalized values were then plotted as fold changes relative to the control state, with the fold change in -WAFO represented on the X-axis and the fold change in TOWA represented on the Y-axis.

<p>Taken together, plotting our WAFO-TOWA data in a circumplex-like system in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> produced a distribution that is very similar to the distribution of emotional states in humans in the bipolar valence-arousal circumplex. In addition, the opposite effects of negative and positive stimuli on WAFO are compatible with the “principle of antithesis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Darwin 1872</xref>) that states that opposite emotional states are bound to opposite behavioural expressions. Anderson and Adolph (2014) functionally defined four features common to different emotions across animals that serve as “building blocks” or “emotion primitives”: valence, scalability (intensity), persistence and generalisation. Above, we already argued that WAFO can serve as a proxy for valence. This is supported by a study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> which showed that chronic winning or losing in repetitive aggressive encounters induces internal states that are associated with opposite valence and that affect other, non-aggression related behaviours such as gap-crossing or object exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kim et al. 2018</xref>). The increasing changes in TOWA and WAFO upon extended duration of social isolation, sexual deprivation, or mechanical shock suggest that the OFT behaviour is scalable with increasing stimulus strength. Further, the treatments (except for heat) were given prior to the OFT. Thus, the observed behavioural effects in the OFT are in line with the assumption of a short-term persistent emotional-like state in the flies. In addition, different treatments led to a similar behavioural reaction. While this may in part be caused by the nature of the OFT setup, it at least does not speak against the presence of a generalised response. Taken together, these findings lend behavioural support to the presence of basic emotion-like states in the fruit fly.</p>
<p>In mammals including humans, arousal is defined by autonomic nervous system activation with physiological consequences, e.g., sweating, changes in heartbeat, or pupil diameters that ideally are measured along with the behaviour. For example, in mice, measurement of thermal responses allowed to correlate physiological arousal with anxiety-related behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lecorps et al. 2016</xref>), and the co-measurement of behaviour and heart rate dynamics allowed to refine and strengthen defensive states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Signoret-Genest et al. 2023</xref>). Importantly, changes in heart rate were also found to accompany defense behaviour in tethered <italic>Drosophila</italic> that were presented with a looming threat stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barrios et al. 2021</xref>). Heart rate decelerated during freezing, and accelerated during escape runs and a startle response upon looming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barrios et al. 2021</xref>). A caveat of our study is, that we do not provide physiological evidence for an aroused state since methods to measure heart rate in freely behaving flies are not available yet and were not developed in this study. To increase the validity of our conclusions, further studies are required that measure behaviour in combination with heart rate or other physiological parameters like metabolic rate or tracheal opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lehmann 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Manipulation of neurochemical signalling support the pres-ence of emotion primitives in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title>
<p>The results obtained by genetic manipulation of neuromodulatory signalling pathways linked to human emotions provide further support for the presence of emotion primitives in the fly. Serotonin signalling has already been shown to influence WAFO in flies and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Prut and Belzung 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mohammad et al. 2016</xref>) and presents an ancient fear-related pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mohammad et al. 2016</xref>). In both flies and mammals, dopamine and NPY/NPF signalling are associated with the reward system and hence positive valence (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dvořáček and Kodrík 2021</xref>)). Thermogenetic activation of these neuromodulator systems in the fly decreased WAFO, while inhibition of dopamine signalling increased WAFO.</p>
<p>Confirming a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mohammad et al. 2016</xref>), the anxiolytic GABAA receptor blocker diazepam decreased WAFO, as expected from the anxiolytic effect of diazepam in humans and in agreement with similar experiments in mice (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Prut and Belzung 2003</xref>)).</p>
<p>Interestingly, inhibition of dopamine signalling, activation of NPF signalling and diazepam only affected WAFO, but not TOWA. This suggests the existence of at least partially distinct neuronal substrates for arousal and valence in the fruit fly, in line with the assumption that the two bipolar dimensions arousal and valence in the circumplex represent two independent neurophysiological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Russell 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Posner et al. 2005</xref>)</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Taken together, our results provide behavioural and neurochemical support to the idea that insects such as the fruit fly share stereotypical behavioural phenotypes and evolutionarily conserved and genetically hardwired neuronal circuits (“emotion primitives”) that underly basic emotions in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gu et al. 2019</xref>). Moreover, the results provide additional support for the use of <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a genetically tractable model to study the neuronal substrate of “emotion primitives”, and propose the OFT in a small arena as an easy and automatable behavioural readout. Our study did not attempt to test whether flies have emotions or affective states linked to conscious feelings, nor are the results informative in this respect.</p>

<title>Open field test (OFT)</title>
<p>Unless stated otherwise, 5-11 days old male CS flies were sedated on ice, then male flies were picked and individually placed into circular arenas with a diameter of 1 cm arranged in a 4×6 matrix drilled in a 2 mm thick dark-gray plastic plate. The arena plate was sandwiched between two glass plates to prevent flies from escaping, and placed on a white light plate (LED-Panel LP100-NW-Mw (Pollin)) with a light intensity of 270 lm within a climate chamber set to 20°C except for the experiments with <italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> flies which were conducted at 29°C. Before starting the recording system (sCMOS USB 3.0 Monochrome DMK 33UX287 camera, ImagingSource, Bre-men, Germany), the arena plate was gently shaken to wake up the flies. Fly behaviour was recorded for 10 minutes at 5 frames per second (FPS). The trajectories of moving flies were automatically tracked using Ctrax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Branson et al. 2009</xref>). Dead or immobile flies were excluded from the analysis. The XY coordinates from Ctrax were then further analysed using a custommade Matlab script (developed by YLW and Stefanie Pütz) for total-walking distance (TOWA). Wall-following behaviour (WAFO) was calculated as the distance to the center of the arena as calculated from the XY coordinates.</p>

<title>Pharmaceutical treatments Ethanol</title>
<p>For assessing the effects of ethanol, a Capillary Feeder (CAFE) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ja et al. 2007</xref>) with 5 μl capillaries was used to provide liquid food containing 10% ethanol, or 5.4% sucrose in water as control. The system consisted of a plate with 24 wells tiled with moist filter paper and closed by a lid was used to house flies individually. Capillaries were inserted into the well through small holes drilled into the lid and an underlying layer of rubber. Test capillaries in wells without flies served to correct for evaporation. On the first training day, the experimental and the control group were fed with freshly prepared food made of 5.4% sucrose in water. The well plate was placed in an incubator at 25 °C and 60 % humidity in a 12 h light/ 12 h dark cycle for approximately 24 hours. On the second day, flies were maintained in the wells, but food-containing capillaries were swapped against water-only filled capillaries for approximately 24 hours to promote hunger. On the third day, the control group was given the same freshly prepared 5 μl 5.4% sucrose water solution as on the training day in the CAFE system. The experimental group received 5 μl 10% ethanol in 5.4% sucrose water solution. Both groups were placed in the incubator for the next 24 hours under the same conditions as above.

<p>From this, the median was calculated across all frames.</p>
<p>With the instantaneous coordinates of the fly (X<sub>i</sub>, Y<sub>i</sub>) and the coordinates on the next frame (instant location i+1), total walking activity (TOWA) of the fly during the 10min recording was calculated in pixels by applying the summation:

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Animal behavior is continuously influenced by the internal state moment-by-moment, including emotion primitives, as the authors pointed out. Although emotion is a more human-related state, evolutionary conservation is undeniable, which can be inferred by the behavioral manifestation. To further elaborate on the neuronal mechanisms of emotion primitives, the simplest behavioral parameter related to emotional primitives should be well-characterized. In this study, the authors described in detail wall-following behavior (WAFO) and the total walking distance (TOWA) using flies after subjecting them to various conditions or flies being genetically manipulated according to the previous reports that could affect emotion primitives. Overall, the study is well designed and structured. In addition, the discussion on emotion primitives will be of value to the field.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this study is its use of a simple behavioral parameter, TOWA, and also a simple design of behavior, WAFO. The importance of the behavioral assay is reproducibility and comparability. In fact, the author demonstrated a summary of comparisons where different treatments result in scalable behavioral changes in WAFO and TOWA.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The weakness of the study is the lack of further experiments to support their assumption related to TOWA.</p>
<p>The authors suggested that TOWA can be interpreted as a behavioral proxy for exogenously induced arousal. However, it could be interpreted as higher activity, although the authors argued that the circadian clock increasing locomotor activity around ZT0 and ZT12 does not affect TOWA, and therefore TOWA is not related to the locomotor activity per se. As the author cited, flies lose locomotor activity in the circular arena of 6.6 cm in diameter, whereas they continuously move during a 1-h recording in the authors' arena of 1 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>I would agree that the arena of 1 cm in diameter, but not 6.6 cm in diameter, serves as an exogenous stimulus inducing arousal, and TOWA is manifested by arousal. However, TOWA would also be affected by other behavioral parameters, including the activity, motivation for exploration, or perception of the space. Therefore, it could be reasonable to re-examine some of the flies tested in this study in the circular arena of 6.6 cm in diameter. If arousal is biased by the components presented in Figure 6 and TOWA can assess mainly exogenously induced arousal, the treatment altering TOWA in the arena of 1 cm in diameter would not affect their behavior in the arena of 6.6 cm in diameter. My concern is that Figure 6 may demonstrate too simplistic a diagram to interpret the results. I would suggest adding the experiments using the arena of 6.6 cm diameter or softening the argument.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work seeks to establish the Open Field Test (OFT) as a paradigm to measure emotion-like states in the fruit fly Drosophila. To do this, the authors first applied various stressors and aversive stimuli to wild-type flies and tracked their locomotion. By measuring wall-following (WAFO) and total walking (TOWA), they showed that these behaviors are generally increased by stressors, but return to baseline levels after their removal. Then, they used the same approach to analyze the effects of pharmacological, genetic, and neuronal activity manipulations, showing that diazepam, serotonin, dopamine, and neuropeptide F affect locomotion in the OFT in largely expected ways that are consistent with their functions in rodents. Finally, the authors demonstrate that wild-type fly strains from the laboratory or caught in the wild differ significantly in their OFT behavior, with wild-caught flies generally behaving as if more 'stressed'. Given the numerous advantages of Drosophila, this study can form the foundation for using the OFT in conjunction with this animal model to elucidate the molecular and neuronal mechanisms that underlie emotion primitives.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strength of the paper is the rigorous use of several stressful or aversive treatments and their subsequent removal to show that WAFO is a robust proxy for stress-like emotional primitives across multiple stimuli. The pharmacological, molecular, and neuronal activity manipulations, although more limited in scope, lend further credence to the authors' central claim.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conceptual advance of this research is unclear, as previous work (Mohammad et al., 2016, Curr Biol.) carried out similar treatments and manipulations and reached largely similar conclusions. Moreover, while WAFO is a good proxy for 'stress', I am not convinced that TOWA necessarily represents an emotional state in all cases. Indeed, as the authors themselves acknowledge, changes in total walking may be associated with other factors, such as starvation-induced hyperactivity, physical exhaustion after sleep deprivation, increased sex drive after mating, alcohol sedation, etc. Another unclear point is the interpretation of some unexpected results, such as the finding that both serotonin transporter overexpression and its knockdown give the same phenotype. Finally, there are some issues with the use of the OFT in rodent research (e.g., inconsistent effects of anxiolytic drugs; see Rosso et al., 2022, Neurosci Biobehav Rev., for a meta-analysis). These should be explained to place the Drosophila findings in their appropriate context.</p>
