<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Two evolutionary highly conserved functions of dopamine are to carry “teaching” signals during associative learning and to control movement. In mammals and humans these functions are generally thought to be produced by different populations of neurons. Here, we investigated in the larva of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> whether both these functions can be induced by the same individual dopaminergic neurons in the central brain. Focusing on the dopaminergic neurons of the DL1-cluster, we asked whether the optogenetic activation of individual neurons established associative punishment and/or safety memories, controlled the retrieval of the established memories, and acutely modulated locomotion. We found that each neuron had a unique, yet overlapping set of behavioural effects. Several individual neurons both established a memory and modulated acute locomotion by increasing the animals’ bending and decreasing its velocity. Our results demonstrate that individual dopaminergic neurons can fulfil a surprisingly broad range of functions in different behavioural contexts. Given the highly conserved roles of the dopaminergic system across the animal kingdom, this study raises the question whether a similarly diverse functionality can be found also in other animals, including humans.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dopamine has many functions in the brain. Among them, two turned out to be highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom: to carry “teaching” signals during associative learning and to initiate and control movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In mammals and humans, it is widely accepted that these two functions are brought about by different populations of dopaminergic neurons (DANs): effects regarding learning are thought to be elicited by the mesolimbic pathway, effects regarding movement by the nigrostratiatal pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Here, we study in the larva of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> whether in contrast the same individual central brain-DANs can induce both functions regarding memory and movement.</p>
<p>The fruit fly larva is an established model organism to study the neuronal and genetic mechanisms underlying associative learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Due to the numerical simplicity of its brain and the available toolbox for transgene expression, the larva allows investigating these mechanisms at tractable levels of complexity. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> distinct sets of DANs convey appetitive and aversive unconditioned stimuli (US), respectively (larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>; adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>) (a similar scenario may be emerging in vertebrates, too<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>). Each of the DANs synapses onto a different compartment of the parallel fibres of Kenyon cells (KCs) that form a higher-order brain structure called mushroom body (larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>; adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>). Odours are combinatorically coded across the array of these KCs which in turn give output to mushroom body output neurons (MBONs). The MBONs collect information across the KCs and send it towards efferent circuitry, promoting either approach or avoidance (larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>; adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>). Within the KCs the coincidence of odour presentation and activity in DANs is detected and enables a memory trace to be formed. The respective memory engram is thought to come by synaptic depression between the KCs and the MBONs of the same mushroom body compartment, such that the net effect of the activity across the MBONs is tilted towards approach or avoidance, respectively (larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>; adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>). Electron microscope reconstructions further revealed a direct within-compartment connection from the DANs onto the MBONs (larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>; adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>). Thus, each DAN has two main targets: the KCs and the MBONs of its own compartment. The general organization of this DAN-KC-MBON matrix is likely shared with other insects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Three pairs of identified DANs of the dorso-lateral cluster 1 (DL1) have been shown to support aversive learning upon optogenetic activation during Pavlovian conditioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In this study, we ask whether those same DANs have additional functions. Specifically, we ask for their role for safety learning – that is, learning that a cue predicts the absence of a threat; memory retrieval – that is, whether a memory will be retrieved and affect behaviour; and modulations of acute, innate locomotion. Little is known about how the dopaminergic system controls any of these functions – if at all. Given the highly conserved functionality of the dopaminergic system across the animal kingdom, this study will reveal more about how the manifold functions of the dopaminergic system are organized – in any brain.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We focus our study on the DANs that support aversive learning when optogenetically activated, called DAN-d1, DAN-f1 and DAN-g1. We investigated the transgenic expression pattern of the driver strains covering each DAN, and the effects of activating each DAN on learning, memory retrieval and locomotion.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>The used driver strains drive transgene expression in identified DANs</title>
<p>Previous studies had described the expression patterns of the used split-driver strains in the central nervous system in detail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Here, we extended the view on the expression within the whole body. Towards this end, we applied a recent protocol for whole-body visualizations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. We confirmed the highly specific transgene expression in the brain of the four split-Gal4 driver strains without any detectable expression in the rest of the body (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-D</xref>, Supplementary material S1). <italic>TH-Gal4</italic> is known to cover almost all DANs in the brain, with the notable exception of the neurons of the primary protocerebral anterior medial (pPAM) cluster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We confirm this pattern of transgene expression and in addition found strong expression outside of the brain, in particular in the proventriculus and in hypodermal melanin-producing cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, Supplementary Movie 1). This pattern fits to the reported function of dopamine in the hardening and darkening of the insect cuticle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and a recent report of <italic>TH-Gal4</italic> expression in the adult proventriculus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. This result means that any genetic manipulation using <italic>TH-Gal4</italic> may affect cells outside of the central nervous system. Finally, we confirm that <italic>R58E02-Gal4</italic> covers three of the four pPAM DANs that are missing in the <italic>TH-Gal4</italic> expression pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, with no expression outside of the central nervous system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>Some individual DANs establish and retrieve associative memories</title>
<p>In larvae, for many kinds of aversive US learned behaviour is only observed if the US is present at the moment of memory retrieval<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. For example, we trained groups of larvae with an odour as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and quinine as US and observed an aversive associative memory when we tested the animals in presence of quinine, but not in its absence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Learned aversive behaviour therefore can be viewed as an escape from the US, guided by the respective memory – an escape that is pointless in absence of anything to escape from<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>We then asked for the roles of the DL1-DANs for both establishing and retrieving associative memories by employing the same learning experiment, but instead of quinine we used optogenetic DAN activation by blue light as a virtual US. We also tested the innate odour preference of all genotypes, both in darkness and in blue light (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 – Figure supplement 1</xref>) and observed no evidence that the innate odour preference was modified by activating the respective DANs.</p>
<p>After training with DAN-d1 as virtual US, zero memory scores were observed when the animals were tested in darkness. When tested in blue light, however, the animals of the experimental genotype, but not the controls, showed aversive associative memory (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 – Figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study using a much stronger light intensity during training observed no significant memory with DAN-d1 as virtual US<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. We therefore repeated the experiment with two different light intensities and observed an aversive memory only when using the low intensity that we use throughout the study, but not with a 10-fold higher intensity (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 – Figure supplement 2C</xref>). Moreover, when raising the larvae in food supplemented with all-trans-retinal which had been shown to increase the effectiveness of our effector ChR2-XXL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, no aversive memory could be detected (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 – Figure supplement 2D</xref>). Thus, it seems that a too strong activation of DAN-d1 prevents the establishment and/or retrieval of an aversive memory.</p>
<p>For DAN-f1, we likewise found an aversive memory that was retrieved only when DAN-f1 was activated also during the test (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 – Figure supplement 2E</xref>). Our results indicate that both DAN-d1 and DAN-f1 are sufficient to establish an aversive memory which requires the respective DAN to be activated for retrieval.</p>
<p>A previous study used the same driver strains crossed to <italic>UAS-CsChrimson</italic> as the optogenetic effector in a similar learning experiment. Critically, learned behaviour was observed also in darkness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Using the same effector and the same intensity of red-light stimulation we were able to replicate these results (<xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 – Figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, the memories induced by either effector differed in the conditions of how they could be retrieved. These results call for caution against using different optogenetic effectors interchangeably.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Some DANs establish memories but do not control retrieval</title>
<p>Activation of DAN-g1, too, established an aversive memory (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). However, in contrast to DAN-d1 and DAN-f1, we found aversive associative memory scores in the experimental genotype independent of the testing condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we employed two driver strains that each covers a combination of the DANs, and activated them using ChR2-XXL. One of them covers DAN-f1 and DAN-g1, the other one, <italic>TH-Gal4</italic>, covers all three of them, plus many additional cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). In both cases, we observed associative memories in the experimental genotype both in absence and in presence of the US (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-F</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 – Figure supplement 2F-G</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, in the experiments with these driver strains, we also observed significantly aversive memory scores in the genetic controls when tested in light (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-F</xref>). Given that this result was found both in driver and effector controls, it was most likely caused by the light itself. Light is known as an aversive US in larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and has been seen to affect the results of optogenetic experiments before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Why this aversive effect of the light remained a non-significant trend in the previous experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>) is not known.</p>
<p>Taken together, activating DAN-g1, or driver strains that include DAN-g1, established aversive memories that were retrieved independent of whether the respective DANs were activated during the test.</p>

<title>Individual DANs are sufficient for establishing safety, but not punishment memories</title>
<p>Animals can associate stimuli not only with the presence of a threat, but also with its absence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Such safety memory has been found in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, but received little attention by the community until recently (larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>; adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>). That means a US, such as bitter taste, can establish two different memories: punishment memory after paired training and safety memory after unpaired training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Critically, our results so far demonstrate that each of the individual DANs was sufficient to establish an associative memory – but not, whether this was a punishment memory, a safety memory, or both. Therefore, we next focussed on the animals’ odour preference after paired and unpaired training, respectively, compared to the odour preference of the pooled genetic controls as a baseline. A punishment memory would reveal itself by decreased odour preferences after paired training, a safety memory by increased preferences after unpaired training, compared to the baseline. To further bolster this analysis, we included the data of all independent replications of the experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> including Figure supplements 2 and 3).</p>

<p>For the case of DAN-d1, after paired training there was no difference in odour preference between the genetic controls and the experimental genotype, nor between the two testing conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, left). After unpaired training, in contrast, the larvae of the experimental genotype exerted increased odour preferences when tested under blue light compared to all other groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, right). This suggests that the activation of DAN-d1 established no punishment memory, but a safety memory. For DAN-f1, we found analogous results (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). In the case of DAN-g1, after paired training we found more negative odour preferences when tested in presence than in absence of light, but no difference between the controls and the experimental genotype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, left). This suggests a potential punishment memory by the light, but not by the activation of DAN-g1. After unpaired training, the animals of the experimental genotype showed higher odour preferences than the controls, both in darkness and light (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, right).</p>
<p>Taken together, we found that all three DANs induced only a safety memory after unpaired training, but no punishment memory after paired training (confirming similar results using CsChrimson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>). The safety memory established by DAN-d1 and DAN-f1 were retrieved only if the respective neuron was activated during the test, whereas the safety memory established by DAN-g1 was, at least partially, also retrieved without neuronal activation.</p>

<title>Combinations of DANs are sufficient for establishing both safety and punishment memories</title>
<p>We next wondered whether the activation of a combination of DANs would be sufficient to induce a punishment memory. For the combination of DAN-f1 and DAN-g1, after paired training, we indeed found more negative odour preferences in the experimental group than in the genetic controls, irrespective of the testing condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, left). After unpaired training, we found higher odour preferences in the experimental genotype than in the genetic controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, right).

<p>Taken together, activating both DAN-f1 and DAN-g1, or activating most DANs in the brain, did establish both a punishment and a safety memory. Both kinds of memory were retrieved irrespective of whether the DANs were activated in the test or not.</p>

<title>Activating the DANs covered by TH-Gal4 modulates the animals’ bending and velocity</title>
<p>Next, we investigated which effect activating the DL1-DANs would have on locomotion.</p>
<p>Using the novel IMBA (Individual Maggot Behaviour Analysis) software for behavioural analyses, we recently had found strong locomotor effects upon optogenetic activation of the DANs covered by <italic>TH-Gal4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Within the current study, we repeated this experiment in total five times, in two different laboratories and with different parameters (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 – Figure supplement 1A</xref>). This gave us the opportunity to probe the behavioural effects upon DAN activation for their robustness across experimental repetitions. Groups of around 8 experimentally naïve larvae of either the experimental genotype or the driver or effector controls were allowed to crawl freely on an agar-filled Petri dish in darkness. After 30 s, blue light was activated for 30 s, followed by darkness. We video-recorded the animals’ behaviour and analysed it afterwards with the IMBA software (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>The IMBA software provides a rich variety of behavioural attributes for individual animals. We selected 17 attributes (for a list and descriptions, see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) and first asked how these attributes relate to each other. Towards this end, we performed a Spearman correlation analysis of all 17 attributes based on the animals’ baseline behaviour in darkness. We found three clusters of inter-correlated attributes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Cluster 1 consists of attributes measuring different aspects of directional changes, e.g. the animals’ bending, or the rate of lateral head movements, the so-called head casts (HC). All attributes of cluster 2 relate to the speed of the larvae’s peristaltic movement. Finally, cluster 3 consists of attributes dealing with the directional bias of the animals’ behaviour. For example, the bending bias measures to which extent an animal was bent more towards one side than another.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Then, we wondered how much each attribute would change upon light stimulation. Towards this end, we calculated a Δ-value of each attribute as an individual’s behaviour during the second half of the light stimulation minus its baseline behaviour during darkness (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). We used only the second half of the stimulation to exclude any potential startle-like response to the sudden light. Then, we used a random forest classification algorithm to classify individual larvae between the genotypes based on the 17 Δ-attributes. Crucially, the random forest provides the relative importance of each attribute for the classification. In other words, it can be used to obtain an unbiased measure of how relevant each attribute is for discriminating the behaviour of different genotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. We found consistently the attributes of cluster 1 and 2 to be much more important than those of cluster 3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Within each cluster, most attributes were on average similarly important, with strong variability both within and across data sets (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 – Figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>We concluded that the main behavioural differences between the experimental genotype and the genetic controls were the amount of bending and directional changes (cluster 1) as well as peristaltic speed (cluster 2). Given the correlations of individual attributes within each cluster (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) as well as their variable importance (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 – Figure supplement 1</xref>), for all following analyses we decided to focus on one representative attribute of each cluster 1 (bending) and cluster 2 (tail velocity) that we have used already in a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. In addition, we will present the relative importance of each attribute cluster along with each experiment.</p>

<title>Activating different subsets of DANs modulates locomotion in opposite directions</title>
<p>In accordance with our previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, we found that the control genotypes increased their bending and decreased their tail velocity upon light stimulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, Supplementary Movie 2). Such responses to blue light have been reported before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> and were consistently seen throughout this study (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 – Figure supplement 2</xref>). Both types of behavioural change were significantly enhanced in the experimental genotype in which the <italic>TH-Gal4</italic>-DANs were activated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-F</xref>). More specifically, when the DANs were activated, the larvae kept high bending and low velocity throughout the 30 seconds of light stimulation whereas the controls gradually reverted towards their normal behaviour (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). These results were confirmed by a repetition of the experiment using larger Petri dishes and multiple light stimulations (<xref rid="fig4s3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 – Figure supplement 3</xref>). For the random forest, the attributes from cluster 1 and 2 were equally important (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 – Figure supplement 3</xref>).</p>
<p>As <italic>TH-Gal4</italic> covers all DANs except those of the pPAM cluster, we next asked whether activation of the pPAM DANs would have a similar effect on locomotion. Towards this end, we used <italic>R58E02-Gal4</italic> which covers 3 out of 4 pPAM DANs (DAN-h1, DAN-i1 and DAN-j1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. To our surprise, activation of these DANs decreased bending and increased tail velocity compared to the controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H-K</xref>, Supplementary Movie 3). More precisely, after an initial reaction to switching on the light, when the pPAM DANs were activated the larvae reverted to their normal behaviour much quicker than the controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). Again, the attributes of cluster 1 and 2 were similarly important for the random forest classification (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the activation of two non-overlapping sets of DANs had opposite effects on behaviour: activating the <italic>TH-Gal4</italic>-DANs (including the aversive US-signalling DANs) increased bending and decreased velocity, whereas activating the <italic>R58E02-Gal4</italic>-DANs (which were shown to signal appetitive US)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> decreased bending and increased velocity.</p>

<title>DANs modulate locomotion independent from the light responses</title>

<p>We compared the animals’ behavioural changes in three sets of experiments, activating the DANs with strong blue light, weak blue light, or red light, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).

A possible reason for the differently strong light response may be the different handling of the animals: in the learning and preference experiments, the Petri dish was loaded with the larvae in dimmed room light and placed in the experimental setup, followed by an immediate start of the light stimulation and video recording. In the locomotion experiments, the larvae were kept in darkness for at least 40 s before the light stimulation started. The sudden light stimulus after a period of darkness may trigger stronger light responses. * and ns above brackets indicate pairwise significance or non-significance, respectively (MW).

<p>Red light reportedly triggers only very mild light responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. We therefore next used the red-shifted effector CsChrimson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, and raised larvae either with or without all-trans-retinal which is necessary for the Chrimson channels to function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5s3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 – Figure supplement 3</xref>). When the larvae were raised with retinal, we observed similar effects as when using ChR2-XXL (<xref rid="fig5s3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 – Figure supplement 3</xref>). The control without retinal, in contrast, displayed only very weak responses to the red light (<xref rid="fig5s4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 – Figure supplement 4</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to compare the effects of DAN activation between the three experiments, we defined the behaviour of the pooled controls in each experiment as zero, and displayed the difference of each experimental group from their respective controls. The behavioural effects of the DAN activations were strikingly similar in the three conditions, both in magnitude and time course (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-B</xref>). The only obvious difference was an extended reduction of the tail velocity beyond the activation of the <italic>TH-Gal4</italic>-DANs that could be seen only when using ChR2-XXL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). This “after-effect” may be due to the reportedly slow closing times of the ChR2-XXL channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We wanted to further quantify the relation between the light responses elicited in each experiment and the behavioural effects of the DAN activation. Therefore, we used the mean behavioural changes upon light stimulation of the pooled controls of each experiment as an indicator for the effect size of the light response, and the difference in behavioural changes between the experimental groups and the respective controls as an indicator for the effect size of the DAN activation. We found that the effect sizes of the DAN activation were all relatively similar and completely unrelated to the effect sizes of the light responses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, we concluded that the observed modulations of bending and tail velocity upon DAN activation occurred independent of the animals’ responses to the light stimulation itself.</p>

<title>Different subsets of DANs convey opposite acute valence when activated</title>
<p>Next, we asked how to interpret the behavioural effects of activating DANs. Stopping and turning around upon a sudden activation of <italic>TH-Gal4</italic>-DANs can be interpreted as a reaction to an aversive signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> – on the other hand, slowing down and turning on the spot could also be a behavioural strategy to stay in a pleasant situation. Likewise, going straight and speeding up upon <italic>R58E02-Gal4</italic>-DAN activation can be interpreted as a “go on”-reaction to an appetitive signal or a strategy to escape. To test for the valence of activation of either set of DANs we performed choice experiments between a dark and an illuminated half of a Petri dish (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Larvae of all genotypes avoided the illuminated half as expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Relative to the genetic controls, larvae with <italic>TH-Gal4-</italic>DANs activated showed more avoidance, and larvae with <italic>R58E02-Gal4-</italic>DANs showed more approach (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-C</xref>, Supplementary Movies 4-5). We next analysed the animals’ behaviour near the dark-light-border. When activating <italic>TH-Gal4</italic>-DANs, the animals’ bending was increased and their velocity decreased on the illuminated half compared to the controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D-F</xref>), similar to our previous experiments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). When activating <italic>R58E02-Gal4</italic>-DANs, the animals’ bending was decreased and their velocity increased compared to the controls everywhere on the dish (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G-I</xref>). Taken together, we concluded that activating <italic>TH-Gal4</italic>-DANs conveys an acute aversive signal and <italic>R58E02-Gal4</italic>-DANs conveys an acute appetitive signal. The animals’ reaction to the sudden activation of these DANs therefore should be interpreted as aversive and appetitive behaviour, respectively.</p>

<title>The modulations of bending and velocity are dopamine-dependent</title>
<p>Several DANs have been found to have additional neurotransmitters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Therefore, we wondered whether the observed effects on locomotion were indeed dependent on dopamine signalling. Towards this end, we combined optogenetic activation by ChR2-XXL with TH-RNAi which knocks down the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate limiting enzyme of dopamine synthesis. Thus, when both effectors are expressed in a set of DANs, these DANs can get activated by light but have a reduced dopamine synthesis. When expressing both effectors in the <italic>TH-Gal4-</italic>DANs, we found that the change in bending upon DAN activation was slightly decreased compared to animals without the TH-RNAi, but still higher than in the genetic controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-B</xref>, <xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 – Figure supplement 1A-F</xref>). Furthermore, in animals with TH-RNAi the tail velocity was generally increased, but the change in tail velocity upon DAN activation was unaffected (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A,C</xref>, <xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 – Figure supplement 1A-F</xref>). There are several possible reasons for this lack of effects, including a too weak knock-down of tyrosine hydroxylase or a developmental adaptation to the reduced dopamine levels. Therefore, we next sought to inhibit tyrosine hydroxylase by an independent and acute technique.</p>

This means inhibiting the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase acutely or during the whole development had opposite effects on the baseline tail velocity. Upon DAN activation, 3IY-fed animals reduced their tail velocity less than animals without 3IY, and to a level comparable to the genetic controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E,G</xref>, <xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 – Figure supplement 1G-M</xref>).

<p>For DAN-d1, we found that the experimental genotype displayed an increased bending and decreased tail velocity compared to the controls that remained trends for the first stimulation (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 – Figure supplement 1A-C</xref>) and were statistically significant for the second stimulation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A-D</xref>). The effect on bending seemed to be somewhat weaker than for <italic>TH-Gal4</italic> and expressed itself in a delayed peak rather than a general increase. The tail velocity, in contrast, was reduced to zero in both cases (compare <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-G</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8A-D</xref>). However, using weaker light did not result in any significant differences between the experimental genotype and the control, in contrast to the case of <italic>TH-Gal4</italic> (<xref rid="fig8s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 – Figure supplement 2A-C</xref>). Thus, activating DAN-d1 individually has similar effects as activating all neurons covered by <italic>TH-Gal4</italic>, but two stimulations of strong light were required to fully induce these effects.</p>
<p>Next, we repeated the same experiments for DAN-f1 and DAN-g1. We found no effects on locomotion upon activating DAN-f1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E-G</xref>, <xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 – Figure supplement 1D-F</xref>, <xref rid="fig8s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 – Figure supplement 2D-F</xref>). For DAN-g1, we found both significantly increased bending and decreased velocity very similar to DAN-d1, again only for strong light and clearer during the second activation, just like for DAN-d1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8H-L</xref>, <xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 – Figure supplement 1G-I</xref>, <xref rid="fig8s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 – Figure supplement 2G-I</xref>).

(B) Aversive and appetitive memories are established via synapses between aversive US-signalling DANs (DAN-AV) and appetitive US-signalling DANs (DAN-AP) with KCs. Memories are stored in the synapses between the KCs and the respective MBONs, and memory retrieval is thought to be controlled via the DAN→MBON synapses. The balance of the MBON signals determines the resulting behaviour (appetitive or aversive). (C) The synapses on the DAN are organized in clusters with DAN→KC and DAN→MBON in the centre, surrounded by KC→DAN synapses. One sample cluster is schematically displayed. For more details, see Figure supplement 1. (D-G) For clarity, only DAN-AV is shown. Thickness of arrows indicate relative strength of synapses and MBON activity, respectively. (D) Paired training with DAN-AV activation depresses the KC→MBON-AP synapses, shifting the balance towards aversion. (E) Unpaired training, in turn, potentiates the KC→MBON-AP synapses, shifting the balance towards approach. (F) DAN-AV activation may directly inhibit the MBON-AP, inducing acute aversive locomotor changes.

Rather, DAN→KC, DAN→MBON and KC→DAN synapses form several dense clusters on the DAN, with the DAN→KC and DAN→MBON synapses more to the centre, and the KC→DAN synapses more on the outside of each cluster (<xref rid="fig9s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 – Figure supplement 1D-E</xref>). In many cases, one cluster contains synapses with several different MBONs, and several clusters contain synapses with the same MBON (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>). We had demonstrated the same clustered pattern already for DAN-i1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. The potential function of this arrangement remains speculative, but it may indicate that these clusters form functional units, each of them with all necessary synaptic connections for both memory formation and memory retrieval.</p>
<p>In the following, we use the d-compartment (lateral appendix) of the mushroom body as example. During training, the presence of an aversive US is signalled by DAN-d1 towards the mushroom body. The coincidence of dopaminergic input and activation of the KC by an odour during paired training is detected by the type I adenylate cyclase and results in presynaptic depression of the KC→MBON synapses (larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>; adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>). This leads to less drive towards approach-promoting MBONs and hence to odour avoidance (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>) (larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>; adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>). For the case of the larval d-compartment, MBON-d1 was shown to be indeed approach-promoting, MBON-d2 and d3 did not show any behavioural effect, and MBON-p1 has not been tested so far<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Thus, the KC→MBON-d1 synapses are the best candidates for harbouring a memory established by DAN-d1.</p>
<p>Presenting an odour unpaired from DAN activation can lead to potentiation of the KC→MBON synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and thus to odour approach (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9E</xref>). The details of this process are not well understood. We assume that during training signals from the DAN can have opposite effects on the KC→MBON synapse, depending on the activity state of the KC: if the DAN signal coincides with KC activation by an odour, the KC→MBON synapse is depressed (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>), otherwise it is potentiated (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9E</xref>). This drives avoidance or approach towards the odour, respectively. In the case of DAN-d1, only the odour approach after unpaired training, indicating safety learning, was statistically significant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>During the test, the presence of the US is signalled by DAN-d1 and provides a gating signal. This signal is most likely received by the MBONs which are known to be necessary for the expression of learned behaviour (larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>; adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>). Such a gating signal in the simplest case could be a logical ‘AND’ gate: for learned behaviour to occur, both the changed drive from the KC onto the MBON and the DAN gating signal to the MBON are required. The consequence is that any associative memory established by the modified KC→MBON-d1 synapses can only take effect behaviourally if DAN-d1 is activated also during the test, just as we observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>How the mushroom body circuit can account for the modulations of acute locomotion</title>
<p>So far, very little is known about how the mushroom body-innervating DANs could modulate innate locomotion. We consider two simple scenarios to explain our observations, a reduced velocity and increased bending upon activation of DAN-d1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A-D</xref>): (1) the DAN-d1→MBON-d1 synapse acts inhibitory such that an activation of DAN-d1 silences the approach-promoting MBON-d1 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9F</xref>); (2) the signal from the DAN-d1→KC synapse reduces the drive from the KCs onto the MBON-d1 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9G</xref>). In both cases, the net output of the mushroom body would be tilted towards aversion.</p>
<p>Scenario 1 seems straight-forward, but two studies in adults caution against such a simple model: First, it was found that activating a DAN while pharmacological blocking output from the KCs activated the MBON of the respective compartment rather than inhibiting it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. So, we would need to assume that the “sign” of the DAN→MBON synapses differs either between developmental stages, or between different mushroom body compartments, or even changes in certain conditions. Different dopamine receptors can either excite or inhibit a neuron<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, and many DANs likely release additional neurotransmitters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Thus, it remains possible that activation of a DAN causes either activation or inhibition of the downstream MBON dependent on the exact composition of receptors.</p>
<p>Second, a recent study compared the innate valence induced by optogenetically activating DANs (of the PAM cluster) and MBONs, and found that in the case of DANs valence was brought about largely by differences in speed in darkness or light, but in the case of MBONs by modulations of turns at the dark-light border<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. This discrepancy makes a simple, direct inhibition unlikely.</p>
<p>Scenario 2 resembles the effects of the DAN signal in paired learning (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D,G</xref>). However, the observed modulations of locomotion occurred within a few seconds and therefore much faster than in our learning experiments. In addition, some activation of the KCs and therefore some drive of the MBONs would be required, otherwise an acute down-regulation of the KC→MBON synapse would be without any effect. To which extent the KCs were active during our experiments is no known.</p>
<p>Previous studies provide conflicting evidence for the involvement of the KCs: on the one hand, a recent study in adults found that KC activity was dispensable for the innate attraction to PAM-DANs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the same study found that knocking down the Dop2R receptor in the KCs reduced the innate attraction to PAM-DANs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. In addition, a study in larvae found an increased locomotion when the Dop1R1 receptor was knocked-down in the KCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Considering these discrepancies, it is very likely that both scenarios are too simplistic, by ignoring for example asymmetric body-side effects of DAN and/or MBON activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, or cross-compartmental connections between DANs and MBONs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. It can also not be excluded that DANs exert their acute locomotion effects independent of the MBONs. Future research has to disentangle the neuronal mechanisms of how DAN activity modulates innate locomotion and valence.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Each DAN induces a different combination of effects</title>
<p>Strikingly, each DAN in this study (as well as in a previous study regarding the appetitive domain) induced a different set of behavioural effects (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>).</p>
<p>The optogenetic activation of DAN-d1 and DAN-f1 can have two effects with respect to memories: during training, the virtual US signal they confer can induce a safety memory. During testing, this memory is only retrieved when the same DAN is activated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>). This mimics many natural US such as tastants or mild mechanical disturbance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, or formic acid in adult flies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. We propose that this mechanism serves to ensure that memories only influence behaviour when it is adaptive to do so. In contrast, the activation of DAN-g1, as well as of two different combinations of DANs (which both happen to include DAN-g1), establish memories that can be retrieved also without the respective DANs being activated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-F</xref>). This mimics US like electrical shocks that induce memories that are retrieved in absence of the US<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. It has been shown that memories in larvae can be specific for the kind of US and are retrieved independently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. It is conceivable that memories regarding relatively harmless types of US, like a bad taste, require the US to be present in order to be retrieved and guide behaviour. Memories regarding more severe US which threaten the body integrity of the animal, such as electrical shocks, are retrieved without the actual US being present. The activation of DAN-d1 or DAN-f1 on the one hand, and DAN-g1 on the other hand, may correspond to such harmless and dangerous US, respectively.</p>
<p>In a previous study we found that the appetitive US-signalling DAN-i1 can establish memories of opposite valence when it was activated paired or unpaired with an odour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. This suggested that both kinds of memory rely on the activity of the same DANs. In the aversive domain, DAN-d1, DAN-f1 and DAN-g1 each establish only safety memory but not punishment memory, whereas activating combinations of DANs did establish both kinds of memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The reason for these discrepancies is not known yet.</p>
<p>Most strikingly, DAN-d1 and DAN-g1 (but not DAN-f1) also modulate innate locomotion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>,<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Interestingly, recent studies in mammals suggested that the nigro-stratiatal ‘movement’ pathway also plays a role for carrying reward signals, in addition to the traditional mesolimbic ‘reward’ pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Together, these results point towards a neuronal organization in which the same dopaminergic neurons can have multiple functions that are as diverse as instructing learning processes and modulating movements.</p>
<p>Our results suggest a combinatorial-like neuronal organization with each neuron having a unique, yet overlapping set of functions. This raises a question: given that all mushroom body compartments share the same basic circuitry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>), how can such functional differences be explained? It is conceivable that they depend on the specific properties of the involved MBONs or its synapses with the KCs and the respective DANs. For example, if the synapses between the KCs and a given MBON are weak to begin with (for example the MBONs of the d- and f-compartment), they can be easily potentiated by unpaired training, but any depression by paired training will be minute. Such weak depression may need to happen in several compartments before it becomes behaviourally measurable.</p>
<p>Moreover, the impact of the gating signal by the DAN to the MBON may vary dependent on the circumstances: the memories established by DAN-d1 or DAN-f1 bypassed the retrieval control by the DANs if those memories were established with CsChrimson, but not with ChR2-XXL (<xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 – Figure supplement 3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The memory stablished by DAN-g1 bypassed this control even when using ChR2-XXL (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of memory retrieval in MBONs, and future research has to uncover which factors may determine its dependence on dopamine signals.</p>
<p>Our study revealed that individual DANs can induce surprisingly diverse effects, from establishing and retrieving memories to modulating innate locomotion. The mushroom body circuit – that is shared with adult flies and other insects – provides an excellent study case to advance our understanding of the complex functions of the dopaminergic system. Given the highly conserved roles of DANs in mediating “teaching” signals and modulating movement across the animal kingdom including vertebrates and humans, a deeper understanding of this circuit and its functions should provide new insights about the principles of DAN function in general.</p>

<p>Third-instar feeding-stage larvae (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>), aged 4-5 days after egg laying, were used throughout. Flies were maintained in mass culture at 25 °C, 60-70 % relative humidity and a 12/12 hour light/dark cycle. Two kinds of food medium were used:</p>
<p>Food medium #1 was used for all learning and olfactory experiments as well as for some of the locomotion experiments. Per 1 l water, 45 ml sugar beet molasses, 45 ml malt, 147.5 g cornmeal, 10 g soy flour, 18.75 g dry yeast, 6.25 g agar and 2.5 g methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were added as described in detail previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Food medium #2 was used for most of the locomotion experiments as well as the olfactory stimulation preference experiments. Per 1 l water, 100g glucose, 50 g cornmeal, 31.65 g wheat germ, 40 g dry yeast, 8 g agar, 2 ml propionic acid (Kanto-kagaku, Tokyo, Japan) and 5 ml 10% butyl p-hydroxybenzoate (Wako, Osaka, Japan) in ethanol were added as described in detail previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>For learning and preference experiments, larvae were trained and tested in Petri dishes of 9 cm inner diameter (order #82.1472, Sarstedt) filled with 1 % agarose (electrophoresis grade; CAS: 9012-36-6). For the experiments displayed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, 5 mM quinine (purity: 92%, CAS: 6119-70-6, Sigma-Aldrich) was added into the agarose. As odour, we used <italic>n</italic>-amyl acetate diluted 1:20 in paraffin oil (AM; CAS: 628-63-7, Merck). For locomotion experiments, either Petri dishes of 15 cm inner diameter (order #82.1184.500, Sarstedt) filled with 1 % agarose were used, or dishes of 9 cm inner diameter (order #3-1491-01, AS ONE) filled with 2 % agar (CAS: 9002-18-0, Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Industries).</p>
<p>Experiments were performed inside a 43 x 43 x 73 cm surrounding box equipped with a custom-made light table featuring a 24 x 12 LED array (Solarox) and a 6 mm thick diffusion plate of frosted plexiglass on top to ensure uniform blue light for ChR2-XXL activation (470 nm; 120 µW/cm²; for <xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 – Figure supplement 3C</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> incl.

<title>Associative learning</title>
<p>Learning experiments followed established protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. Odour containers were prepared by adding 10 µl of odour substance into custom-made Teflon containers (5 mm inner diameter with a lid perforated with 7 holes of 0.5-mm diameter each). Petri dishes were covered with modified lids perforated in the centre by 15 holes of 1 mm diameter each to improve aeration.</p>
<p>For paired training with quinine as US, about 20 larvae were placed on a quinine-filled Petri dish equipped with two AM-filled odour containers. After 2.5 min, the animals were transferred to a dish with plain agarose and empty odour containers (EM) on which they spent another 2.5 min. This cycle (AM-/EM) was repeated two more times before the animals were transferred to a test Petri dish with AM on one and EM on the other side. This dish was either a plain agarose dish, or one with quinine added, as mentioned in the results section. After three minutes, the number of animals on either side as well as on a 1 cm-wide middle stripe were counted and the odour preference was calculated as:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="634646v1_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Thus, preference values are constrained between 1 and −1 with positive values indicating a preference for and negative values indicating avoidance of AM. Note that the training sequence in every other repetition of the experiment was reversed (EM/AM-)</p>
<p>For unpaired training, AM was presented on plain agarose Petri dishes and EM was present on quinine Petri dishes, such that the CS and US were experienced explicitly separated from each other (AM/EM-or EM-/AM). Otherwise, the training was performed analogously, and the final test was performed as described.</p>
<p>From each one paired and one unpaired trained cohort of animals we calculated an associative Memory score as:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="634646v1_eqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Thus, the values can range from 1 and −1 with negative values indicating that the larvae preferred the odour less after paired than unpaired training. Thus, negative scores indicate an aversive associative memory. Positive values, in turn, would indicate appetitive associative memory.</p>
<p>Learning experiments with ChR2-XXL or CsChrimson as effectors were performed analogously. However, all Petri dishes were filled with plain agarose, i.e. no tastants were added. Rather, for paired training, AM was paired with continuous blue (ChR2-XXL) or red light stimulation (CsChrimson) for 2.5 min, followed by 2.5 min of darkness without an odour. For unpaired training, animals received odour presentation and light stimulation separately from each other.

<title>Video analysis</title>
<p>Video analysis used the IMBA (Individual Maggot Behaviour Analyser) software and followed previous procedures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. In brief, the positions of head, tail, as well as several spine and contour points of each larva were tracked over the course of the experiment. A combination of computational modelling and statistical approaches allowed keeping the identities of larvae across collisions and thus the analysis of individual animals tested in cohorts. Then, we discarded all tracks that were shorter than half of the time window used for the analysis. This prevented multiple tracks from the same individual animal from entering the analysis.</p>
<p>Larval behaviour was separated into head-casting (HC) phases and run phases. Lateral HCs are a very prominent feature during larval chemotaxis. We quantified these head movements based on the angular speed of the head vector through the front third of the animal. HCs were detected when the angular speed exceeded ± 35°/s. Runs were determined as periods in which the animals were not performing HCs, omitting 2 s before and after each HC event to prevent behavioural effects of the HC. We noticed that the rhythmic velocity changes of the tail point provided a reliable indicator for the occurrence of one peristaltic forward movement. We therefore defined each local maximum in the tail forward velocity as one step, and the period between two maxima, i.e. one complete peristaltic cycle, as an inter-step (IS) period. Since the local-maxima detection algorithm we employed also produced false maxima during intervals of little or no forward motion, we discarded maxima whenever the tail velocity in forward direction was less than 0.6 mm/s.</p>
<p>After the detection of runs, steps and head casts, we calculated a number of behavioural attributes. We summarize all attributes in this study in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. Whenever the average behaviour of a group of larvae is displayed over time, the mean and the 95 % confidence intervals of the respective attribute are calculated per 1 s time bin with a 5 s convolution filter. Whenever data are displayed in box plots to compare across experimental conditions, the mean of each attribute is calculated for each individual larva across the indicated time period. As we were interested in the difference in a given attribute X before and during light stimulation, we calculated Δ-values as the difference in X during the last 15 s of light stimulation minus X during the 15 s just before light stimulation (called baseline in the main text).</p>
<p>We used random forest models which are based on classification and regression trees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. The random forest algorithm works by building N number of decision trees and then predicting the class label of an instance using a majority voting. Each tree is trained on a random subspace of the data, only using a sample of the instances. To evaluate the random forest classification, we used five-fold cross validation, which was repeated three times. Five-fold cross validation means that the test set for the model is taken from five different, disjunct sets of the data set. The data set is then shuffled and the procedure is repeated three times. Cross validation is used to make sure that the model is not based merely on the selected data, but can explain the full data set.</p>
<p>For the applications of the random forest in this study, we pre-selected 17 behavioural attributes to be included (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The pre-selection was based on our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> and was warranted to avoid using largely redundant attributes and to exclude non-behavioural attributes such as the size of the larvae. The random forest was always applied to pairwise compare two experimental conditions, typically the experimental groups with one of the genetic controls. In order to provide a good estimate of the importance of each attribute, the complete random forest model (including the cross validation) was performed 10 times for any given comparison. In the typical case, this means 10 repetitions of the comparison between the experimental genotype with the driver control and 10 repetitions of the comparison with the effector control. In each case, the relative importance rank of each attribute was noted.</p>

After washing (3 × 5 min in distilled water), they were fixed in 4% PFA in 0.1 mol/L PB at pH 9, with gentle shaking overnight at 4°C. Fixed samples were briefly rinsed 3 × with 0.1 mol/L PB containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBT), then washed 2 × 60 min and left overnight at 4°C in PBT. Dehydration the following day used a graded ethanol (EtOH) series (60 min in 10% and 25% EtOH, followed by 30 min in 50%, 60%, 80%, and 2 × 100% EtOH). Samples were then cleared by replacing EtOH with ethyl cinnamate (ECi; ethyl 3-phenyl-2-propenoate; order #112372-100G, Sigma-Aldrich). After 30-60 min, the ECi was refreshed once, and the samples stored at room temperature in black boxes in a desiccator.</p>
<p>The samples were placed in ECi-cleared phytagel blocks (1 × 1 × 1 cm, P8169, Sigma-Aldrich) before imaging on an Ultra-Blaze microscope (Miltenyi Biotec). The microscope was equipped with an FIU-15 white light laser (NKT Photonics) for excitation through triple-sheet optics to illuminate samples from one side. The following excitation and emission filters were used: autofluorescence: exc. 480/20, em. 515/30, mcherry: exc. 590/20, em. 625/30, mIFP: exc. 680/20, em. 720/30.</p>
<p>Tiled image stacks were acquired with either a 12× objective with zoom set to 1 or 4x objective with zoom set to 1.66 (both Miltenyi Biotec) with a format of 2048 × 2048. Using ImSpector software (version 7.3.6, Miltenyi Biotec), a 10% overlap of tiles was set for stitching.</p>
<p>Image files were processed with Imaris software (version 10.1, Bitplane), including file conversion, stitching, further processing, and rendering. Either the ortho slicer, oblique slicer or clipping plane tool was used to restrict volumes in the z direction to improve the representation of structures that were otherwise covered in the context of the whole body. All inserts were generated using the snapshot function in Imaris. Whole-body 2D maximum-intensity projections were generated in Fiji<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. Supplementary Movie 1 was produced in Imaris with the key frame animation tool; Adobe Premiere Pro 2020 (version 14.9.0, Adobe) was used for cutting and labelling.</p>

<title>Dendrogram analysis</title>
<p>To visualize neuron morphology and synapse locations, we employed neuron dendrograms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> that are linearized, topologically correct 2D representations of 3D neuron reconstructions with synapse annotations (based on <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>). Synapse locations and the distances between them are approximately correct, with slight adjustments to avoid overlap and cluttering of the synapse symbols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We formally analyzed the spatial organization of synapses based on geodesic distances along the neuron’s branches (“cable length distances”). The geodesic distance between two synapses was determined by finding the shortest path between them on the neuron, and then computing the cumulated Euclidean distance, in the 3D coordinate space of the neuron, between points along that path.</p>
<p>In particular, we analyzed spatially local clusters of synapses and the distances to the centroid of the cluster. To this end, we clustered the synapses on each neuron based on geodesic distances and using hierarchical clustering with Ward’s criterion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup> (implemented in the base R package “stats”). The maximum number of clusters per neuron was set to k=10. For analysis, we kept only clusters with at least 5 presynaptic and 5 postsynaptic KC connections.</p>
<p>The centroid of a cluster was defined to be the most central synapse, computed by partitioning around medoids clustering (PAM with k = 1 cluster)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup> based on geodesic distances.</p>

<sec id="s4j">
<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>Two-tailed non-parametric tests were used. Values were compared across multiple groups with Kruskal-Wallis tests (KW). In case of significance, subsequent pair-wise comparisons used Mann-Whitney U-tests (MW). To test whether values of a given group differ from zero, we used Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests (WSR). When multiple comparisons were performed within one analysis, a Bonferroni-Holm correction was applied to keep the experiment-wide error rate below 5 %<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. The detailed results of all statistical tests are reported in the Supplementary Data S1 along with the source data. We present our data as box plots which represent the median as the middle line and 25 %/75 % and 10 %/90 % as box boundaries and whiskers, respectively. Outliers are not displayed. Experimenters were blind to genotype. Sample sizes (biological replications) were chosen based on previous studies revealing moderate to mild effect sizes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> and are displayed in the figures.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigate the role of different specific dopaminergic neurons in the mushroom body of Drosophila larvae for learning and innate behavior. All the tested neurons are thought to be involved in punishment learning. The authors discover that artificial activation of single DANs in training leads to safety learning, but not punishment learning. Furthermore, activation of single DANs can lead to changes in locomotion behavior, which can affect light preference. The authors provide a deeper understanding of the functional diversity of single dopamine neurons; however, it is unclear how translatable these findings are to learning experiments with real punishment stimuli.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors attempt to disentangle what kind of memories are formed with the activation of different dopamine neurons - safety learning, and punishment learning, will the US be required to test for recall or not? They do indeed find differences and the results will be of interest to the learning and memory community.</p>
<p>Interestingly, optogenetic activation of a single DAN during training leads to safety memory, but not punishment memory. Furthermore, DAN activation also affects innate locomotion, and the authors can show that optogenetic activation of different DANs affects locomotion differently.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
All experiments in the manuscript use optogenetic activation of DANs, thus it is not clear what kind of memories are formed. Several stimuli can be used as punishment, such as electric shock, salt, bitter, and light - it is not clear what kind of memory the authors investigate here. The findings could be discussed in the context of what DANs respond to. Furthermore, studies in adults and larvae showed that most DANs can code for both valences - etc., aversive DANs can be activated by punishment, and inhibited by reward. Thus, safety learning might be a result of a decrease in activity in DANs during odor presentation. The authors also do not discuss possible feedback loops from MBONs to DANs across compartments. Could such connections allow for safety learning in larvae?</p>
<p>The authors show that artificial activation with different light intensities can form different memories and that increasing the light intensity sometimes leads to no memories. Also, using different optogenetic tools reveals different results. This again raises the question of how applicable the results will be for learning with real stimuli. Is there a natural stimulus that only induces safety learning, but no punishment learning?</p>
<p>
The authors provide a detailed behavioral analysis of locomotion behavior; however, the detailed analysis seems unnecessary for that dataset. Modulation of speed and bending rate has been described before with simpler methods (specifically for MBONs). The revealed locomotion phenotypes probably affect larval locomotion during memory recall with light activation, thus the authors should show that larvae are potentially able to move during light-on memory tests.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study provides valuable context for ongoing research on the role of dopamine in memory and locomotion. DANs have been a fascinating area of study due to their complexity, and this work dissects specific DANs, exploring their roles in different memory-related behaviors while offering some explanations. The discussions provided by the authors effectively situates the study in the broader field of learning, memory, DAN circuitry and behavioral computation in insect brains. The study achieves what it sets out to and it does so unequivocally. The experiments were elegantly designed, leaving little room for doubt in the study's claims. However, the study lacks context regarding the molecular pathways underlying these results. While it strengthens current knowledge by providing robust evidence, it does little to explore the molecular mechanisms behind these effects.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Experiment design is one of the strengths of this study. The experiments are thorough and cover the length and breadth of the core findings of the study. Although a lot of work has already been done in studying the role of dopamine in memory and locomotion, the dissection of the functions of distinct DANs in larvae has been done meticulously with well-structured experiments.</p>
<p>
(2) This study fits quite nicely into the puzzle of memory, especially in the context of Dopamine. Previous studies in *Drosophila* adults have shown the opposing roles of DANs in locomotion depending on the context of DAN activation. This study drives that point home for larvae, providing conclusive evidence in that regard.</p>
<p>
(3) The use of clear figures and simple language is one of the strengths of this paper. The figures are comprehensive, complete and manage to narrate the story by themselves. The flow of information is smooth. The simple and effective language used maintains scientific rigor while remaining accessible to those new to the field. A pleasant read.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
(1) The authors have done a great job at structuring the figures. But some main figures would benefit from including the controls instead of placing them in supplementary.</p>
<p>
(2) The paper would benefit from a deeper discussion regarding molecular mechanisms underlying their results. It would be interesting to see what the authors think about different Dopamine receptors and how they relate to the findings of this paper.</p>
<p>
(3) Throughout the paper, the authors have been clear and comprehensive, but in some cases, further explanation of their choices were missing. For example, the choice to compare bending and tail velocity over other parameters within the same clusters is unclear.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Across species, dopamine release carries out seemingly diverse functions, like reinforcing memories and regulating locomotion and flight. However, whether distinct dopaminergic neurons (DANs) are allocated for each function is not clear. In this study, Toshima et al. have used the numerically simple organization of the Drosophila larval brain to answer this question. They use optogenetic activation to systematically stimulate a small set of DANs, individually and collectively, and study the effect on diverse functions such as memory formation, retrieval, and locomotion. They find that singly or collectively, DL1 DANs can induce punishment and/or safety memory formation and retrieval. DANs can even gate the expression of memory. Finally, the same DANs also modulate locomotion in the larvae. The authors speculate that dopaminergic neurons in other species may also share such overlapping functions. Their findings are nicely summarised in Figure 9.</p>

<p>The study comprehensively activates the neurons in the DL1 cluster in a systematic manner. Individual and collective stimulation of the Dl1 DANs has been conducted to assess the induction and gating of aversive punishment memory, safety memory, and acute locomotion.</p>
<p>Specific adult Drosophila DANs are known to induce dual behaviors and functions. The same MP1/y1pedc DANs are recognized for gating appetitive memory expression and representing aversive teaching signals downstream of sensory stimuli such as electric shocks, bitter tastes, and heat. Neurons in the PPL1 cluster regulate adult flight and food-seeking behavior. The authors deserve credit for conducting an organized examination of dopaminergic neuron functions in larvae, which makes their findings more comparable and facilitates the proposal of a holistic model.</p>
<p>They have provided substantial evidence for their findings and frequently presented replicated behavioral data sets. They have been transparent about results that were difficult to explain. Additionally, they have provided an impressive body of supporting data to strengthen their main findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>The larvae exhibit directed locomotory action to express punishment or safety memory. If the larvae did not move, we would not be able to assess memory function. Hence, functional activation of DANs could result in one action, which seems like two different functions of memory expression and locomotion. It can also be argued that activation of DANs represents a teaching signal to the KCs, and then eventually, downstream of the MBONs, it results in locomotion modulation. Hence, the seeming functional diversity could be a function of different downstream neuronal pathways and not molecular context-dependent diversity inside dopaminergic neurons. The authors should address this possibility or point out the fallacy in the above argument.</p>
<p>The finding that activation of TH-GAL4 conveys aversive valence and R58E02-GAL4 conveys appetitive valence seems redundant (Figure 6). I understand they say this in the context of locomotion. However, they may not have mentioned similar findings in adults. In adults, artificial activation of DANs covered by the same GAL4 lines acts as aversive and appetitive teaching signals for memory formation. These references should be cited appropriately in the results and discussion if not currently included.</p>
<p>The evidence for the role of dopamine (Figure 7) can be bolstered by using other available RNAi lines against TH. A valium20 vector-based shRNA line is recommended. The current evidence is based mainly on non-specific pharmacological intervention with 3IY.</p>
