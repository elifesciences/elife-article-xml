<title>Abstract</title>
<p>We present evidence implicating the BAF (BRG1/BRM Associated Factor) chromatin remodeler in meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). By immunofluorescence (IF), the putative BAF DNA binding subunit, ARID1A (AT-rich Interaction Domain 1a), appeared enriched on the male sex chromosomes during diplonema of meiosis I. The germ cell-specific depletion of ARID1A resulted in a pachynema arrest and failure to repress sex-linked genes indicating a defective MSCI. Consistent with this defect, mutant sex chromosomes displayed an abnormal presence of elongating RNA polymerase II coupled with an overall increase in chromatin accessibility detectable by ATAC-seq. By investigating potential mechanisms underlying these anomalies, we identified a role for ARID1A in promoting the preferential enrichment of the histone variant, H3.3, on the sex chromosomes, a known hallmark of MSCI. Without ARID1A, the sex chromosomes appeared depleted of H3.3 at levels resembling autosomes. Higher resolution analyses by CUT&amp;RUN revealed dramatic shifts in sex-linked H3.3 associations from discrete intergenic sites and broader gene-body domains to promoters in response to the loss of ARID1A. Several sex-linked sites displayed ectopic H3.3 occupancy that does not co-localize with DMC1 (DNA Meiotic Recombinase 1). This observation suggests a requirement for ARID1A in DMC1 localization to the asynapsed sex chromatids. We conclude that ARID1A-directed H3.3 localization influences sex chromosome gene regulation and DNA repair during meiosis I.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Meiosis is central to the formation of haploid gametes from diploid pluripotent progenitors. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair, exchange genetic material, align at the metaphase plate and then segregate during the first meiotic cell division. Unlike autosomal homologues, the X and Y chromosomes share limited homology. Unique mechanisms have evolved to ensure these chromosomes are identified, sequestered, and processed in a parallel but distinct process from autosomes.</p>
<p>XY chromosomes pair along the pseudo-autosomal region (PAR), leaving extensive regions of the X and Y unpaired. These regions become enriched for DNA damage response (DDR) factors, including ATR (Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3 related), TOPBP1 (DNA topoisomerase II-binding protein 1), and MDC1 (Mediator of DNA Damage Checkpoint 1), which amplifies γ H2A.X across XY chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alavattam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">ElInati et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fernandez-Capetillo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ichijima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Royo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Turner et al., 2004</xref>). XY chromatin acquires further distinguishing features when canonical histones H3.1/3.2 are exchanged for variant H3.3 in that H3K9me3 (Histone lysine9 trimethylation) becomes elevated on XY chromatin relative to autosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hirota et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">van der Heijden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yuen et al., 2014</xref>). As the XY chromosomes become epigenetically distinct from autosomes, they also become physically separated into a unique nuclear sub-compartment known as the XY body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Handel, 2004</xref>). Transcriptional silencing of unpaired chromatin occurs during this phase of meiosis I, known as meiotic silencing of unpaired chromatin, MSUC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Turner, 2007</xref>). MSUC of autosomal chromatin, such as in response to an abnormal karyotype, causes pachynema arrest and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baarends et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Schimenti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Turner et al., 2005</xref>). However, silencing unpaired XY chromatin results in a different outcome known as meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alavattam et al., 2021</xref>). Sex chromosomes are required to undergo MSCI and become transcriptionally inactivated. Failure to achieve MSCI triggers arrest and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ichijima et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Chromatin factors that influence MSCI include the H3K9 methyltransferase, SETDB1 (SET domain, bifurcated 1), PRC1 associated SCML2 (Sex comb on midleg-like protein 2), and testis-specific reader of histone acetylation, BRDT (Bromodomain testis-specific protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hasegawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hirota et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Manterola et al., 2018</xref>). Although our previous studies demonstrated a critical requirement for SWI/SNF-directed transcriptional regulation during meiosis, evidence for its involvement in MSCI is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Menon et al., 2019</xref>). This lack of evidence is also true for the PBAF (POLYBROMO1-BRG1/BRM Associated Factor) remodeler within the SWI/SNF family, which we have shown is required for meiotic cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Menon et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, the germ cell-specific depletion of the SWI/SNF catalytic subunit, BRG1 (Brahma-related gene-1), was shown to result in an early pachytene arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Whether this suggests a role in MSCI remains an open question given that BRG1 associates with both SWI/SNF remodelers, PBAF and BAF.</p>
<p>Here, we find that ARID1A (AT-rich Interaction Domain 1a), a BAF-specific putative DNA binding subunit, is required for the transcriptional silencing of the sex chromosomes during pachynema, thereby ensuring meiotic progression through prophase-I. Mechanistically, ARID1A is necessary to establish MSCI hallmarks, such as the eviction of elongating RNA polymerase-II (phosphorylated on Serine2 of carboxy-terminal domain; pSer2-RNAPII), limited sex-linked chromatin accessibility, and hyper-accumulation of histone H3.3 on the sex body. Additionally, ARID1A is required for the targeted localization of DMC1 to the unpaired sex chromatids, implicating BAF-A-governed sex-linked chromatin dynamics in DNA repair.</p>

<title>ARID1A regulates the transcriptional silencing of the sex chromosomes at pachynema</title>
<p>The meiotic requirement of ARID1A and, more importantly, its association with the sex chromosomes at diplonema prompted us to examine its role in MSCI. We hypothesized that ARID1A might play a role in the transcriptional silencing of the sex-linked genes during meiosis. To address this question, we performed RNA-seq on Sta-Put purified populations of pachytene spermatocytes to profile changes in transcript abundance upon ARID1A deficiency. Differential analysis of gene expression using DeSeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Love et al., 2014</xref>) revealed an equal proportion of significantly (FDR &lt; 0.05) misexpressed genes displaying either elevated (up-regulated, n= 5824) or reduced (down-regulated, n=5821) transcript abundance in <italic>Arid1a<sup>cKO</sup></italic> relative to <italic>Arid1a<sup>WT</sup></italic> pachytene spermatocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Notably, we detected significant misexpression of 53 % of all the sex-linked coding genes (593/1105) in response to an ARID1A deficiency. Amongst these, 86.4% displayed elevated expression (n=512), whereas only 13.6% displayed reduced (n=81) transcript abundance. This skew was even starker when only considering sex-linked genes misexpressed by a magnitude of 2 LOG-fold or higher. Here, 97% (297/306) of the misexpressed sex-linked genes displayed increased transcript abundance in response to an ARID1A deficiency. Therefore, ARID1A predominantly affects the repression of sex-linked genes during pachynema.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="542290v1_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>An examination of changes in the average transcript abundance on a chromosome-wide basis showed that expression from the sex chromosomes was significantly higher than that from autosomes in response to the loss of ARID1A at pachynema (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Therefore, ARID1A regulates the transcriptional repression of the sex chromosomes, implicating it in MSCI. Its predominant influence on sex-linked gene regulation may result from a preferential association of ARID1A with the sex chromosomes during meiosis. This association is undoubtedly the case late in diplonema. However, earlier in pachynema, when MSCI initiates, no sex chromosome-specific pattern of ARID1A enrichment was discernible, at least by IF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

This result is consistent with the genome-wide distribution of ARID1A observed in pachytene spermatocyte spreads by IF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Unnoticeable to IF, pachytene spermatocytes displayed a preferential association of ARID1A with promoters of normally repressed sex-linked genes, when detected by CUT&amp;RUN (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>), emphasizing its role in MSCI.</p>

<title>ARID1A does not influence DNA damage response signaling on the sex body</title>
<p>Unlike autosomal homologs that complete pairing during pachynema, the non-homologous regions of the sex chromosomes feature unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). These DNA DSBs recruit γH2Ax, a product of DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathways essential for establishing and maintaining MSCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Turner, 2007</xref>). Therefore, to determine whether ARID1A regulated MSCI by influencing DDR signaling, we first monitored the association of γH2Ax with the sex chromosomes in response to the loss of ARID1A. By IF, γH2Ax accumulation on the sex body appeared unperturbed in the mutant (ARID1A<sup>-</sup>) relative to internal controls (ARID1A<sup>+</sup>) and <italic>Arid1a<sup>WT</sup></italic> pachytene spermatocytes (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>). Consistent with this, the recruitment of ATR (Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3 related), a kinase known to phosphorylate γH2Ax and initiate MSCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Turner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Royo et al., 2013</xref>), appeared normal in the absence of ARID1A. These data indicate that sex-linked DDR signaling occurred independently of ARID1A (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>). Furthermore, MDC1 (Mediator of DNA damage Checkpoint 1), a known γH2Ax reader that is essential for sex body formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ichijima et al., 2011</xref>), remains robustly associated with the asynapsed sex chromosomes in the absence of ARID1A during pachynema (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C</xref>). These data show that the mechanisms underlying ARID1A-mediated repression of the sex-linked transcription are mutually exclusive to DDR pathways regulating sex body formation.</p>

<title>ARID1A limits RNAPII localization to the sex chromosomes during pachynema</title>
<p>Apart from γH2Ax, the association of the sex chromosomes with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) distinguishes the sex body from the autosomes during pachynema. Normally, pachytene spermatocytes display reduced levels of RNAPII on the sex body relative to autosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Khalil et al., 2004</xref>). This sub-nuclear localization of RNAPII coincides with increased transcriptional output, which peaks at diplonema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ernst et al., 2019</xref>), underscoring the importance of targeted mechanisms regulating sex chromosome repression. Therefore, we were curious to test whether ARID1A influenced the nuclear localization of RNAPII during pachynema. We performed IF to monitor the localization of the actively transcribing (elongating) form of RNAPII marked by Serine2 phosphorylation (pSer2) on its carboxy-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Noe Gonzalez et al., 2021</xref>). We monitored elongating RNAPII (pSer2) because its pausing regulates meiotic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alexander et al., 2022</xref>). By co-staining for RNAPII (pSer2) and SYCP3, we could stage pachynema and identify the sex chromosomes. While RNAPII (pSer2) localization to the autosomes appeared similar, we noticed increased levels of RNAPII (pSer2) association with the sex chromosomes in <italic>Arid1a<sup>cKO</sup></italic> relative to <italic>Arid1a<sup>WT</sup></italic> mid and late pachytene spermatocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). By quantifying the RNAPII (pSer2) signal generated by IF, we detected a 1.5-fold increase (p=0.0003) in the average RNAPII (pSer2) fluorescence associated with the sex chromosomes in <italic>Arid1a<sup>cKO</sup></italic>relative to <italic>Arid1a<sup>WT</sup></italic> pachytene spermatocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Due to technical difficulties, we could not simultaneously stain for ARID1A alongside SYCP3 and RNAPII (pSer2), making it impossible to distinguish internal controls from mutants in the <italic>Arid1a<sup>cKO</sup></italic> meiotic spreads. This result suggests that the 1.5-fold increase in RNAPII association with the sex body in <italic>Arid1a<sup>cKO</sup></italic>relative to <italic>Arid1a<sup>WT</sup></italic> pachytene spermatocytes is likely underestimated. Therefore, our results indicate that ARID1A facilitates sex-linked gene repression by limiting the association of elongating RNAPII with the sex chromosomes during pachynema.</p>

<title>ARID1A regulates promoter accessibility during pachynema</title>
<p>Next, we hypothesized that ARID1A-governed chromatin remodeling might underlie its role in limiting RNAPII accessibility on pachytene sex chromosomes. Therefore, we profiled changes in chromatin accessibility in response to the loss of ARID1A using ATAC-seq. Normally, ATAC-seq peaks (accessible chromatin) are mapped comparably across promoters (34%), intergenic (22.8%), and intronic (21.5%) regions. In contrast, the loss of ARID1A resulted in a dramatic shift towards predominantly promoter-associated ATAC-seq peaks with only a minority mapping to intergenic and intronic regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with an increase in the proportion of promoter-associated peaks, we detected an increase in accessibility across transcription start sites (TSS) associated with both autosomal and sex-linked DEG’s in <italic>Arid1a<sup>cKO</sup></italic> relative to <italic>Arid1a<sup>WT</sup></italic> pachytene spermatocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B,C</xref>). Furthermore, in the case of autosomal targets, chromatin accessibility at their TSSs was enhanced irrespective of their transcriptional status, appearing indistinguishable between down-regulated and up-regulated genes upon the loss of ARID1A (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In contrast, on the sex chromosomes, the loss of ARID1A seemed to have a prominent effect on TSS’s associated with up-regulated genes, which displayed greater chromatin accessibility relative to their down-regulated counterparts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Therefore, the increased promoter accessibility of normally repressed sex-linked genes may underlie their persistent transcription by RNAPII upon the loss of ARID1A. Overall, these data highlight a role for BAF complexes in limiting promoter accessibility, especially on the sex chromosomes during pachynema.</p>

<title>ARID1A regulates the chromatin composition of the sex body</title>
<p>Chromatin remodelers regulate DNA accessibility by altering nucleosome positioning or composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Clapier et al., 2017</xref>). The latter outcome is interesting in the context of MSCI, given that the sex body typically displays a striking enrichment of the variant histone H3.3 while concomitantly appearing depleted of the canonical histones H3.1/3.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">van der Heijden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yuen et al., 2014</xref>). Given that human ARID1A is known to regulate H3.3 genomic associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Reske et al., 2022</xref>), we tested whether a similar mechanism governed H3.3 localization to the sex chromosomes. To address this, we monitored H3.3 localization in pachytene spermatocytes by IF, simultaneously staining for ARID1A and HORMAD1. The former aided in mutant identification, while the latter labeled the pachytene sex chromosomes. Consistent with previous reports, H3.3 can be seen preferentially coating the sex chromosomes distinguishing it from autosomal chromatin during normal pachynema (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Interestingly, this sex body association of H3.3 was detected less frequently early in pachynema (17%), becoming more pervasive during the mid (70 %) and late (95%) stages of pachynema. In contrast, in the absence of ARID1A, H3.3 staining on the sex chromosomes was indistinguishable from their autosomal counterparts throughout pachynema (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Notably, the majority of mutant mid (89%) and late (77%) pachytene spermatocytes lacked the typical sex body enrichment of H3.3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), indicating that ARID1A dictates the preferential accumulation of H3.3 on the sex body.</p>

<p>Next, we were curious to know the consequence of reduced H3.3 association on H3.1/3.2 occupancy on the sex body in response to the loss of ARID1A. We performed IF to monitor the association of H3.1/3.2 with the sex chromosomes marked by HORMAD1 in response to the loss of ARID1A. Like H3.3, canonical H3.1/3.2 appeared uniformly distributed genome-wide in most early pachytene spermatocytes (92%). At the onset of pachynema, sex chromosomes mostly displayed comparable H3.3 and H3.1/3.2 levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, B). However, this balance changed during the subsequent sub-stages of pachynema. Although robust H3.3 levels remained, H3.1/3.2 appeared excluded from the sex chromosomes in most mid (56%) and all late pachytene spermatocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, B). In contrast, the loss of ARID1A increased the proportion of mid (66%) and late (40%) pachytene spermatocytes retaining H3.1/3.2 on sex-linked chromatin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). The abnormal retention of canonical H3.1/3.2 coincides with a lack of H3.3 enrichment on sex-linked chromatin in response to the loss of ARID1A.</p>
<p>To determine whether these abnormal kinetics result from a genome-wide deficiency in H3.3, we compared its levels by western blotting to find no difference in H3.3 abundance in <italic>Arid1a<sup>cKO</sup></italic> relative to <italic>Arid1a<sup>WT</sup></italic> spermatocyte enriched populations (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>). We also considered an alternative possibility that ARID1A might promote the sex-linked enrichment of H3.3 by influencing the expression of cognate chaperones like DAXX and HIRA during murine pachynema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">van der Heijden et al., 2007</xref>). We addressed this by monitoring DAXX and HIRA levels in response to the loss of ARID1A using IF. In the case of DAXX, we examined meiotic spreads to find no changes in either the overall levels or sex chromosome localization of DAXX in response to the loss of ARID1A (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6B</xref>). The same was also true of HIRA, whose levels and nuclear localization in mutants appeared comparable to that seen in internal (from <italic>Arid1a<sup>cKO</sup></italic>) and normal (<italic>Arid1a<sup>WT</sup></italic>) spermatocytes (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6C</xref>). Therefore, ARID1A impacts H3.3 accumulation on the sex chromosomes without affecting its expression or incorporation during pachynema. Overall, our data suggest that ARID1A influences MSCI by regulating the composition of sex-linked chromatin.</p>

<p>Due to the increased representation of promoter-associated peaks in response to the loss of ARID1A, we monitored H3.3 association with TSSs of genes differentially regulated by ARID1A. Consistent with the genomic annotation of H3.3 peaks, we could not detect H3.3 enrichment at TSSs associated with ARID1A-regulated sex-linked genes relative to IgG control. H3.3 signal spread gene-wide in <italic>Arid1a<sup>WT</sup></italic> pachytene spermatocytes (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7B</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8A</xref>-top panel).

There is a transition from the gene-wide spreading of H3.3 to promoter-proximal enrichment in response to the loss of ARID1A. Concomitantly, X and Y-linked intergenic regions undergo a significant decrease in H3.3 occupancy upon ARID1A loss (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8A</xref>). A similar loss of H3.3 occupancy was also observed at a handful of autosomal intergenic peaks (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8B</xref> – top).</p>

<title>ARID1A restricts H3.3 occupancy to intergenic regions on the sex chromosomes</title>
<p>Our analysis of the genome-wide localization of H3.3 in response to the loss of ARID1A would argue that the abnormal increase in promoter-associated H3.3 results from its redistribution from high-affinity sites (peaks) that are predominantly sex-linked and intergenic during normal pachynema (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>). We focused our attention on these H3.3-occupied intergenic sex-linked sites.

The clusters associated with common ATAC-seq peaks displayed contrasting changes in H3.3 occupancy in response to the loss of ARID1A. C1 and C2 represented regions deficient for H3.3, while C3 and C4 represent regions that gained H3.3 binding in <italic>Arid1a<sup>cKO</sup></italic> relative to <italic>Arid1a<sup>WT</sup></italic> pachytene spermatocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, left panel). Similarly, clusters associated with gained ATAC-seq peaks, namely, G1 and G3, represented sites that gained H3.3 occupancy, while G2 identified sites that lost H3.3 occupancy. We also noticed a gain in H3.3 binding at regions associated with G4 in response to the loss of ARID1A, albeit at significantly reduced coverage relative to G1 and G2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, right panel). Genomic annotations of common and gained k-means clusters revealed that the sites that displayed a loss of H3.3 binding (represented by C1 + C2, G2) in response to the loss of ARID1A were intergenic (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9A</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, those that gained H3.3 localization (represented by C3, C4, G1+G3, and G4) distributed differentially between intergenic and genic regions (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9A</xref>). Therefore, these data support our idea that ARID1A restricts H3.3 occupancy primarily to intergenic sites on the sex chromosomes. Furthermore, the loss of ARID1A triggers an abnormal redistribution of H3.3 to genic regions. Therefore, the increased promoter occupancy of H3.3 is an indirect consequence of ARID1A loss.</p>

<p>Interestingly, regions associated with G1 and G3 usually are devoid of H3.3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>), implying a potential antagonism between H3.3 occupancy and the occurrence of meiotic DNA DSBs.

<p>Since the PRDM9 motifs identified from SSDS (Single-Stranded DNA Seq) data were generated to map the genomic associations of DNA repair factor DMC1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brick et al., 2012</xref>), we monitored its enrichment at the various k-means clusters. We also monitored the association of markers of meiotic DNA DSBs, such as the PRDM9 catalyzed H3K4me3 at common and gained k-means clusters using published ChIP-seq data from pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Maezawa et al., 2018a</xref>). Consistent with the motif analyses, DMC1 occupancy and H3K4me3 enrichment occurred at gained and common ATAC-seq peaks associated with k-means clusters, normally devoid of H3.3, namely, G1, G3, G4, C3, and C4 (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9C, D</xref>).</p>
<p>These data suggest that ARID1A might indirectly influence DNA DSB repair on the sex chromosomes by regulating the localization of H3.3. To test this conclusion, we monitored the association of DMC1 on the sex chromosomes, in response to the loss of ARID1A, by IF. Normally, DMC1 foci appear distributed along the non-homologous arms of the X and Y chromosomes from early to mid-pachynema, only disappearing by late pachynema (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, left, panel insets) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Moens et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, in the absence of ARID1A, we observed a marked reduction in the number of DMC1 foci (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, right, panel insets). Quantification of DMC1 foci in Arid1a<sup>cKO</sup> relative to Arid1a<sup>WT</sup> pachytene spermatocytes revealed a significant decrease in the sex-linked association of DMC1 in the absence of ARID1A (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Along with DMC1, the mitotic DNA recombinase, RAD51, is also known to localize to the non-homologous arms of the sex chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Moens et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Moens et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, we determined whether ARID1A also influenced the sex-linked association of RAD51. First, we analyzed previously generated RAD51-SSDS data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hinch et al., 2020</xref>) to monitor its enrichment across the various k-means clusters associated with common and gained ATAC-seq peaks. Unlike DMC1, we found no detectable levels of RAD51 at any k-means clusters (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10A</xref>). Furthermore, the formation of RAD51 foci along the asynapsed axes of the sex chromosomes appeared unchanged in <italic>Arid1a<sup>cKO</sup></italic> relative to <italic>Arid1a<sup>WT</sup></italic>pachytene spermatocytes (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10B</xref>). Therefore, ARID1A is necessary for the normal sex-linked association of DMC1 but not RAD51. More importantly, our data highlight a dual role for ARID1A in regulating sex chromosome repression and DNA repair (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>A model describing the role of ARID1A sex-linked chromatin regulation.</title>
<p>During meiosis, the sex chromosomes undergo transcriptional repression at the onset of pachynema. A dramatic change in the composition of sex-linked chromatin accompanies this chromosome-wide repression. From mid to late pachynema, spermatocytes display a hyper-accumulation of the variant histone H3.3 (Ochre shading and gradient) on the sex chromosomes (magenta) relative to autosomes (green). Concomitantly, the levels of the canonical histones H3.1/3.2 and elongating pSer2-RNAPII complex (grey gradients) appear depleted from the sex body by late pachynema. The loss of ARID1A dramatically alters the chromatin composition of the sex body, which features low H3.3 (yellow bar) association at levels indistinguishable from autosomes throughout pachynema. Concomitantly, canonical H3.1/3.2 and pSer2-RNAPII levels (grey bar) on the sex body remain abnormally stable throughout pachynema. These sex-linked chromatin aberrations, along with persistent transcription owing to the association of pSer2-RNAPII with mutant sex body, fail meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) and, consequently, pachytene arrest. This defect also coincides with an abnormal loss of DMC1 (blue foci) localization to the unpaired sex chromatids in response to the loss of ARID1A. Therefore, along with transcriptional repression, ARID1A-governed chromatin dynamics appear to influence DNA repair on the sex chromosomes.</p></caption>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We previously demonstrated a spermatogenic requirement for the mammalian SWI/SNF complex based on its role in coordinating germline transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Menon et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, we showed that the SWI/SNF PBAF subcomplex activates genes essential for reductional meiosis and gamete formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Menon et al., 2021</xref>). These data highlight that distinct SWI/SNF subcomplexes govern specific meiotic transitions.</p>
<p>Our current study demonstrates a requirement for the ARID1A-associated BAF (BAF-A) subcomplex for meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). It does so by promoting the accumulation of the variant histone H3.3 on the sex chromosomes at the onset of mid-pachynema, coinciding with the eviction of canonical histones H3.1/3.2 and RNA polymerase II from the sex body (Model, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). In contrast, when depleted of ARID1A, chromatin accessibility increased along with a deficiency of H3.3 and the continued presence of H3.1/3.2 and pSer2-RNAPII (an elongating form of RNA polymerase II) in the sex body. These data indicate that BAF-A helps define features distinguishing sex chromosomes from autosomes and that the absence of the BAF-A subcomplex during meiosis I results in the failure of MSCI during pachynema.</p>
<p>Although previous work described the association of H3.3 with the sex body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">van der Heijden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yuen et al., 2014</xref>) and its requirement for meiotic repression of sex-linked genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fontaine et al., 2022</xref>), our study revealed the need for BAF-A in the preferential localization of H3.3 to the sex body relative to autosomes. Interestingly, a similar role for BAF-A in promoting H3.3 incorporation occurs in human endometriotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Reske et al., 2022</xref>). In this case, the genomic localization of H3.3 to super-enhancers required ARID1A. Our study describes the ARID1A-dependent localization of H3.3 at a chromosome-wide scale comprised of (i) local enrichment at intergenic loci and (ii) larger domains that resembled spreading much like that of <italic>Xist</italic> during female X chromosome inactivation (XCI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chaumeil et al., 2006</xref>). X chromosome inactivation (XCI) requires SWI/SNF subunits SMARCA4 and SMARCC1 in female mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Keniry et al., 2022</xref>). SMARCC1 promotes XCI by increasing promoter accessibility of the inactive X chromosome (Xi). Interestingly, during MSCI, sex-linked chromatin displays enhanced accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Maezawa et al., 2018b</xref>). In contrast, our studies showed that BAF-A limits rather than enhances sex-linked chromatin accessibility. These data highlight a mechanism that checks chromosome-wide relaxation during MSCI. The divergent outcomes of SWI/SNF-governed sex-linked chromatin accessibility during XCI and MSCI probably reflect noticeable sex-specific differences or arise from potentially perturbing distinct SWI/SNF subcomplexes.</p>
<p>Along with altered chromatin composition and structure, pachytene spermatocytes lacking ARID1A also displayed an abnormal association of pSer2-RNAPII (elongating form) with the sex body. Normally, total transcriptional output peaks towards the end of meiotic prophase-I, even with MSCI coinciding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alexander et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ernst et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">MONESI, 1964</xref>). The dynamic switching from the paused (pSer5-RNAPII) to the elongating (pSer2-RNAPII) state of RNAPII drives this burst of transcription on autosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alexander et al., 2022</xref>). The association of pSer2-RNAPII with the sex chromosomes without ARID1A renders them more autosome-like, underlying the defect in sex-linked gene repression. The BAF-A-governed H3.3 dynamics on the sex chromosomes may limit the switch from the paused to the elongating state of RNAPII. In a human cell culture model, ZMYND11, a known tumor suppressor and reader of Lysine 36 trimethylation on H3.3 (H3.3K36me3), suppresses RNAPII elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wen et al., 2014</xref>). Whether similar H3.3 readers affect RNAPII pausing during meiosis in mice remains unknown.</p>
<p>The initiation and maintenance of MSCI are known to be regulated by DNA damage response (DDR) factors, ATR, and MDC1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ichijima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Royo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Turner et al., 2004</xref>). However, ARID1A deficient pachytene spermatocytes appeared proficient in sex-linked DDR signaling, evidenced by the normal enrichment of ATR, γH2Ax, and MDC1 on the sex body. Therefore, BAF-A-mediated transcriptional repression of the sex chromosomes occurs independently of DDR signaling. Given that the accumulation of ATR and MDC1 on the sex body precedes that of ARID1A, which only manifests late in diplonema, it is reasonable to hypothesize that DDR signaling might recruit BAF-A to the sex chromosomes.</p>
<p>ARID1A did not appear necessary for sex-linked DNA DSB formation. In contrast, the expected association of DMC1, the meiosis-specific DNA recombinase, with the asynapsed axes of the sex chromosomes do require ARID1A. Interestingly, sex-linked intergenic sites displaying an ARID1A-dependent enrichment of H3.3 appeared depleted for DMC1. Consistent with this antagonism, the loss of ARID1A resulted in the re-distribution of H3.3 to regions normally associated with DMC1. Although only correlative, these data suggest that regions displaying a localized enrichment of H3.3 might be unfavorable for DNA repair. Determining the extent to which a deficiency in BAF-A activity might impede sex-linked DNA repair is challenging. RAD51 binding to the sex chromosomes remained stable without ARID1A, suggesting that some sex-linked DNA repair remains. Our studies highlight a model in which BAF-A promotes meiotic progression by facilitating MSCI and DNA repair on the sex chromosomes.</p>

Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL hypotonic lysis buffer (10mM Tris-Cl pH8.0, 1mM KCl, 1.5mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1mM DTT) and incubated on a rotator at 4° C for 30 minutes. Nuclei were pelleted at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4° C. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 400 µL 0.2N HCl and incubated for 1 hr at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 10 minutes at 4° C to isolate supernatants containing histones that were precipitated with Trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and then added to the nuclear suspension at a final concentration of 33% and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. Precipitated histones were pelleted at 14,000g for 10 minutes at 4° C and washed two times in 1 mL ice-cold acetone. Finally, washed histones were air-dried at RT for 20 minutes and resuspended in 100 µL ddH<sub>2</sub>O. For western blots, histones were separated on a 15 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF (Polyvinylidene Difluoride) membrane using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). Sample loading was assessed by REVERT<sup>TM</sup> total protein stain (LI-COR, 926-11010). Blots were scanned on a LI-COR Odyssey CLx imager and viewed using Image Studio Version 5.2.5. Antibodies and their corresponding dilutions are listed (Supplementary table 2).</p>

<title>Isolation of Pachytene Spermatocytes by the Sta-Put method of Unit Gravity</title>
<p>Pachytene spermatocytes were purified from <italic>Arid1a<sup>WT</sup></italic>and <italic>Arid1a<sup>cKO</sup></italic> adult testis by the unit gravity sedimentation procedure using a Sta-Put apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bellvé, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">O’Brien, 1993</xref>). Testis from at least 12 adult males (&gt;P60) were dissected into EKRB, decapsulated, and digested in 0.5mg/ml collagenase for 15 min at 32° C. The resulting tubules were gently washed with EKRB and digested with 0.25mg/ml trypsin supplemented with 4µg/ml DNase for 15 min at 32° C. Following trypsin incubation, additional DNase (4µg/mL) was added to reduce viscosity further. Samples were triturated for 3 minutes with a plastic transfer pipet to fragment flagella, break intercellular bridges between germ cells and further disperse cells into suspension. Trypsin digestion was stopped by adding 0.25mg/mL trypsin inhibitor (Sigma/EPRO, T9003), and cell aggregates were removed by filtration using 40 µm cell strainers. Cells from the flow-through were pelleted at 500g for 5 min at 4° C, resuspended in EKRB + 0.5% BSA, and adjusted to a 3.33x10<sup>8</sup> cells/mL density. 10<sup>9</sup> cells from this single-cell suspension were loaded onto a 2-4% linear BSA gradient and allowed to sediment in the Sta-Put apparatus at 4° C. After 2hr and 40min of undisturbed sedimentation, 10ml fractions were collected at 45 sec per tube. Fractions were pelleted at 500g for 5 min at 4°C and resuspended in 1ml EKRB + 0.5%BSA. Fractions containing &gt;80% pachytene spermatocytes were identified by light microscopy, pooled, and stored in cryoprotective media (DMEM supplemented with 10%FBS and 20%DMSO) at -80° C pending further analysis.</p>

For ARID1A, CUT&amp;RUN was performed in triplicates per genotype with two different antibodies. H3.3 CUT&amp;RUN was performed in duplicates on <italic>Arid1a<sup>WT</sup></italic> and triplicates on <italic>Arid1a<sup>cKO</sup></italic> samples. Aliquots of cryopreserved <italic>Arid1a<sup>WT</sup></italic> and <italic>Arid1a<sup>cKO</sup></italic> pachytene spermatocytes were quickly thawed in a water bath at room temperature (RT), pelleted at 600g for 5 minutes, and washed [wash buffer: 20mM HEPES(Na) pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, EDTA-free protease inhibitor] three times. Cells were gently resuspended in wash buffer and bound to Concanavalin-A coated magnetic beads (20 µL beads/500,000 cells) by mixing on a rotator for 15 minutes. The bead slurry was separated using a magnet followed by permeabilization in 50 µL antibody buffer (wash buffer + 0.05% Digitonin + 2mM EDTA) per sample in 0.2 mL 8-strip PCR tubes. Primary antibody was added to the samples and incubated on a nutator at 4° C overnight. Cells were then separated using a magnet, washed two times in 200 µL Dig-wash buffer (wash buffer + 0.05% Digitonin), and incubated with a secondary antibody prepared in 50 µL of Dig-wash buffer/sample for 30 minutes on a nutator at 4° C. After antibody incubations, samples were washed twice in 200 µL Dig-wash buffer and then incubated on a nutator at 4° C with 50 µL Dig-wash buffer containing 1000ng/mL Protein A/G Micrococcal Nuclease (pA/G-MNase) for 1 hr. Following this, samples were washed twice in 200 µL Dig-wash buffer, resuspended in 50 µL Dig-wash buffer, cooled down to 0° C, and supplemented with CaCl<sub>2</sub> at a final concentration of 2 mM to activate MNase. Samples were digested at 0 °C for 40 minutes. The resulting chromatin fragments were extracted from the bead slurry by incubating in 2X STOP buffer (340 mM NaCl, 20mM EDTA, 4mM EGTA, 0.05% Digitonin, 100 µg/mL RNase A) at 37° C for 30 minutes. DNA was purified using ChIP DNA clean and concentrator kit (Zymo, D5205). Libraries were prepared using the Kapa Hyperprep kit (Roche, KK8504), examined for size, and quantified on an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer using the high-sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent, 5067-4626). The libraries were pooled in equimolar amounts and sequenced on a single lane of the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S Prime flow cell (50 bp reads, paired-end).

<p>The work by Debashish U. Menon, Noel Murcia, and Terry Magnuson brings important knowledge about histone H3.3 dynamics involved in meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). MSCI is unique to gametes and failure during this process can lead to infertility. Classically, MSCI has been studied in the context of DNA Damage repair pathways and little is known about the epigenetic mechanisms behind maintenance of the sex body as a silencing platform during meiosis. One of the major strengths of this work is the evidence provided on the role of ARID1A, a BAF subunit, in MSCI through the regulation of H3.3 occupancy in specific genic regions. This is well supported by a combination of immunofluorescence, RNA seq, CUT&amp;RUN and ATAC-seq.</p>
<p>
The mouse model in this study is a conditional Stra8 Cre mouse. Loss of ARID1A in this mouse, caused up regulation of XY linked genes in prophase I spermatocytes and ingression of RNA pol II to the sex body, indicating a role for this chromatin remodeller in MSCI. Using RNA seq and CUT&amp;RUN and ATAC-seq, the authors show that ARID1A regulates chromatin accessibility of the sex chromosomes. ARID1A interacts with gene transcription start sites of sex-linked genes, and loss of ARID1A increased promoter accessibility of XY linked genes with concomitant gene up regulation.</p>
<p>This work suggests that ARID1A regulates chromatin composition of the sex body relative to the autosomes. In the absence of ARID1A, spermatocytes show less enrichment of H3.3 in the sex chromosomes and stable levels of the canonical histones H3.1/3.2. By overlapping CUT&amp;RUN and ATAC-seq data, authors show that changes in chromatin accessibility in the absence of ARID1A are given by redistribution of occupancy of H3.3. Gained open chromatin in mutants corresponds to up regulation of H3.3 occupancy at transcription start sites of genes regulated by ARID1A.</p>
<p>Interestingly, ARID1A loss caused increased promoter occupancy by H3.3 in regions usually occupied by PRDM9. PRDM9 is a protein with histone methyltransferase activity that catalyzes histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation during meiotic prophase I, and positions double strand break (DSB) hotspots. Lack of ARID1A causes reduction in occupancy of DMC1, a recombinase involved in DSB repair, in non-homologous sex regions. These data suggest that ARID1A might indirectly influence DNA DSB repair on the sex chromosomes by regulating the localization of H3.3. This is very interesting given the suggested role for ARID1A in genome instability in cancer cells (Nacarelli et al 2020: 10.1080/23723556.2019.1690923, Zhang et al. 2023: 10.1093/carcin/bgad011 and others). It raises the question of whether this role is also involved in meiotic DSB repair in autosomes and/or how this mechanism differs in sex chromosomes compared to autosomes.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that authors show that there are Arid1a transcripts that escape the Cre system. This might mask the phenotype of the Arid1a knockout, given that many of the sequencing techniques used here are done on a heterogeneous population of knockout and wild type spermatocytes. In relation to this, I think that the use of the term &quot;pachytene arrest&quot; might be overstated, since this is not the phenotype truly observed (these mice produce sperm). ARID1A is present throughout prophase I and it might have pre-MSCI roles that impact earlier stages of Meiosis I and cell death might be happening in these earlier stages too.</p>
<p>Overall the research presented here is solid, adds new knowledge on how the sex chromatin is silenced during meiosis and has generated relevant databases for the field.</p>

<p>The authors tried to characterize the function of the SWI/SNF remodeler family, BAF, in spermatogenesis. The authors focused on ARID1A, a BAF-specific putative DNA binding subunit, based on gene expression profiles. The study has several serious issues with the data and interpretation. The conditional deletion mouse model of ARIDA using Stra8-cre showed inefficient deletion; spermatogenesis did not appear to be severely compromised in the mutants. Using this data, the authors claimed that meiotic arrest occurs in the mutants. This is obviously a misinterpretation. In the later parts, the authors performed next-gen analyses, including ATAC-seq and H3.3 CUT&amp;RUN, using the isolated cells from the mutant mice. However, with this inefficient deletion, most cells isolated from the mutant mice appeared not to undergo Cre-mediated recombination. Therefore, these experiments do not tell any conclusion pertinent to the Arid1a mutation. Furthermore, many of the later parts of this study focus on the analysis of H3.3 CUT&amp;RUN. However, Fig. S7 clearly suggests that the H3.3 CUT&amp;RUN experiment in the wild-type simply failed. Thus, none of the analyses using the H3.3 CUT&amp;RUN data can be interpreted. Overall, I found that the study does not have rigorous data, and the study is not interpretable. If the author wishes to study the function of ARID2 in spermatogenesis, they may need to try other cre-lines to have more robust phenotypes, and all analyses must be redone using a mouse model with efficient deletion of ARID2.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Magnuson and colleagues investigate the meiotic functions of ARID1A, a putative DNA binding subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler BAF. The authors develop a germ cell specific knockout mouse model using Stra8-cre and observe that ARID1A-deficient cells undergo pachytene arrest, although due to inefficiency of the Stra8-cre system the mice retain ARID1A-expressing cells that yield sperm and allow fertility. Because ARID1A was found to accumulate at the XY body late in Prophase I, the authors suspected a potential role in meiotic silencing and by RNAseq observe significant misexpression of sex-linked genes that typically are silenced at pachytene. They go on to show that ARID1A is required for exclusion of RNA PolII from the sex body, consistent with a meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) defect. The authors proceed to investigate the impacts of ARID1A on chromatin accessibility and H3.3 deposition genome-wide. H3.3 is known be regulated by ARID1A and is linked to silencing, and here the authors find that upon loss of ARID1A, overall H3.3 enrichment at the sex body as measured by IF failed to occur, but H3.3 was enriched specifically at transcriptional start sites of sex-linked genes that are normally regulated by ARID1A. The results suggest that ARID1A normally prevents H3.3 accumulation at target promoters on sex chromosomes and based on additional data, restricts H3.3 to intergenic sites. Finally, the authors present data implicating ARID1A and H3.3 occupancy in DSB repair, finding that ARID1A KO leads to a reduction in focus formation by DMC1, a key repair protein. Overall the paper covers a lot of ground, provides important new insights into the process of MSCI from the perspective of chromatin composition and structure, and raises many interesting questions. In general the paper is well written and the data are clear. Specific points to address are as follows:</p>
<p>1. A challenge with the author's CKO model is the incomplete efficiency of ARID1A loss, due to incomplete CRE-mediated deletion. The authors effectively work around this issue, but they don't state specifically what percentage of CKO cells lack ARID1A staining. This information should be added. They refer to cells that retain ARID1A staining in CKO testes as 'internal controls' but this reviewer finds that label inappropriate. Although some cells that retain ARID1A won't have undergone CRE-mediated excision, others may have excised but possibly have delayed kinetics of deletion or ARID1A RNA/protein turnover and loss. Such cells likely have partial ARID1A depletion to different extents and therefore in some cases are no longer wild-type. In subsequent figures in which co-staining for ARID1A is done, it would be appropriate for the authors to specify if they are quantifying all cells from CKO testes, or only those that lack ARID1A staining.</p>
<p>2. The authors don't see defects in a few DDR markers in ARID1A CKO cells and conclude that the role of ARID1A in silencing is 'mutually exclusive to DDR pathways' (p 12) and 'occurs independently of DDR signaling' (p30). The data suggest that ARID1A may not be required for DDR signaling, but do not rule out the possibility that ARID1A is downstream of DDR signaling (and the authors even hypothesize this on p30). The data provided do not justify the conclusion that ARID1A acts independently of DDR signaling.</p>
<p>3. After observing no changes in levels or localization of H3.3 chaperones, the authors conclude that 'ARID1A impacts H3.3 accumulation on the sex chromosomes without affecting its expression or incorporation during pachynema.' It's not clear to this reviewer what the authors mean by this. Aside from the issue of not having tested DAXX or HIRA activity, are they suggesting that some other process besides altered incorporation leads to H3.3 accumulation and if so what process would that be?</p>
<p>4. The authors find an interesting connection between certain regions that gained chromatin accessibility after ARID1A loss (clusters G1 and G3) and presence of the PRDM9 sequence motif. The G1 and G3 clusters also show DMC1 occupancy and H3K4me3 enrichment. However, an additional cluster with gained accessibility (G4) also shows DMC1 occupancy and H3K4me3 enrichment but unlike clusters G1 and G3 has modest H3.3 accumulation. The paper would benefit for additional discussion about the G4 cluster (which encompasses 960 peak calls). Is there any enrichment of PRDM9 sites in G4? If H3.3 exclusion governs meiotic DSBs, how does cluster G4 fit into the model?</p>
<p>5. The impacts of ARID1A loss on DMC1 focus formation (reduced sex chromosome association) are very interesting and also raise additional questions. Are DMC1 foci on autosomes also affected during pachynema? The corresponding lack of apparent effect on RAD51 implies that breaks are still made and resected, enabling RAD51 filament formation. A more thorough quantitative assessment of RAD51 focus formation will be interesting in the long run, enabling determination of the number of break sites and the kinetics of repair, which the authors suggest is perturbed by ARID1A loss but don't directly test. It isn't clear how a nucleosomal factor (H3.3) would influence loading of recombinases onto ssDNA, especially if the alteration is not at the level of resection and ssDNA formation. Additional discussion of this point is warranted. Lastly, there currently are various notions for the interplay between RAD51 and DMC1 in filament formation and break repair, and brief discussion of this area and the implications of the new findings from the ARID1A CKO would strengthen the paper further.</p>
