<abstract>
<p>Animals routinely need to make decisions about what to eat and when. These decisions are influenced not only by the availability and quality of food but also by the internal state of the animal, which needs to compute and give weights to these different variables before making a choice. Feeding preferences of female mosquitoes exemplify this behavioural plasticity. Both male and female mosquitoes usually feed on carbohydrate-rich sources of nectar or sap, but the female also feeds on blood, which is essential for egg development. This blood-appetite is modulated across the female’s reproductive cycle, yet little is known about the factors that bring it about. We show that mated, but not virgin <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> females, a major vector of urban malaria in the Indian sub-continent and West-Africa, suppress blood-feeding between a blood-meal and oviposition. We identify several candidate genes through transcriptomics of blood-deprived and -sated <italic>An. stephensi</italic> central brains that could modulate this behaviour. We show that <italic>short Neuropeptide-F (sNPF)</italic> and <italic>RYamide (RYa)</italic> act together to promote blood-feeding and identify a cluster of cells in the subesophageal zone that expresses <italic>sNPF</italic> transcripts only in the blood-hungry state. Such females also have more <italic>sNPF</italic> transcripts in their midguts. Based on these data, we propose a model where increased <italic>sNPF</italic> levels in the brain and gut promotes a state of blood-hunger, which drives feeding behaviour either by <italic>sNPF’s</italic> action in the two tissues independently or via a communication between them.</p>

<title>Introduction and Results</title>
<p>An animal’s dietary choice is an outcome of its internal physiological state and external stimuli. Its changing nutritional demands, reproductive state, and developmental history are integrated with external cues before a food-choice is made. For example, when deprived of a particular nutrient, like proteins, animals show a specific increase in protein-appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Mating influences food choices of female flies by increasing their preference for proteins, sugars, and salt for egg development and oviposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>Changes in both sensory perception and central brain circuits have been shown to underlie such behavioural changes. For example, sensory neurons of starved animals become more sensitive to attractive cues and less sensitive to aversive ones, both in vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). These changes are often brought about by neuromodulators and neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). In the central brain, internal nutrient or hormone sensors can monitor the animal’s nutritional state.</p>
<p>In mice, neurons in the hypothalamus express receptors for hunger and satiety signals like ghrelin and leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). In insects, several neurons in the mushroom body, central complex, and subesophageal zone (SEZ) have been shown to integrate hunger and satiety signals to regulate feeding on sugars or proteins, choose between exploration or exploitation of food sources, or initiate or terminate feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>
<p>Female mosquitoes offer a striking model for dissecting how internal state and external cues shape dietary choices. Many female mosquitoes have a dual appetite for carbohydrate-rich nectar or sap – to meet energetic requirements – and protein-rich blood – for egg development. Which meal a female chooses to take is influenced by nutritional demands, reproductive state, and developmental history. For example, mosquitoes with low teneral reserves will take multiple blood meals for egg development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Nutritional state also influences other internal state outputs on blood-feeding. For example, whether virgin females take blood-meals or not is dependent on prior sugar-feeding in most <italic>Aedes</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) (and references within). However, mating is dispensable in Anophelines even under conditions of nutritional satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these species-and context-dependent variations, a consistent finding is that female mosquitoes oscillate between states of heightened and suppressed host-seeking across successive reproductive cycles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A</xref>). For example, in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, newly emerged mosquitoes display no or low interest in the host, which increases as they age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) and once fed to repletion, host attraction is suppressed. The strength and timing of this suppression varies between species — being robust and well-characterised in mated <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), and more flexible in Anophelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Sugar-feeding is not modulated in this way, in some cases it is preferred soon after emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>).</p>

<p>A. Reproductive cycle of <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. Upon emergence [1, D0-D5] females have a dual appetite for protein-rich blood and carbohydrate-rich sources of sugar [2,3]. After a blood-meal [3,4,5, D1<sup>B</sup>-D4<sup>B</sup>], the eggs mature and are laid in water [6]. The next reproductive cycle can now begin. B. Blood-feeding assay. 0-7h old mosquitoes were collected in cups and aged appropriately on sugar. Prior to the test, mosquitoes were ‘activated’ for 5 minutes by presenting a human hand, followed by 3 exhalations. Blood-meals were presented through a Hemotek perfumed with human skin odours. Number of blood-fed mosquitoes were visually scored, irrespective of the quantity fed. C. Blood-feeding behaviour of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. 8-days old virgin and mated females were assessed for their first blood-meal. Fully fed mated females were assessed for second blood-meal (D1<sup>B</sup>-D4<sup>B</sup>). Each dot represents a single trial with 18-21 females, n=10-12trials/group. Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test, p&lt;0.05. Data labelled with different letters are significantly different. D. Blood-feeding behaviour of <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. Co-housed and virgin females were tested on the day of emergence (D0) and each day for the next 5 days (D1-D5). D1<sup>B</sup>-D4<sup>B</sup> represents their blood-feeding 1-4 days after their first blood-meal and D1<sup>○</sup>-D2<sup>○</sup> represents their blood-feeding 1-2 days after oviposition (see methods for assay details). 18-21 females/trial, n=9-20trials/group. Generalized Linear Mixed Model with post-hoc pairwise comparisons using estimated marginal means and Bonferroni-corrected p-values; *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ****p&lt;0.0001. E. Sugar-feeding behaviour of <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. Females of similar conditions as in (D) were tested for sugar-feeding. 18-21females/trial, n=9-20trials/group. Generalized Linear Mixed Model with posthoc pairwise comparisons using estimated marginal means and Bonferroni-corrected p-values; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.001; ****p&lt;0.0001. F. Choice assay for blood and sugar. Sugar-sated females or sugar-starved females, co-housed with males (indicated by the dashed abdomens) were given a choice between blood and sugar and assessed for their choice of food (bottom): blood and sugar; blood only; sugar only; none. While most sugar-sated females took blood (left of dashed line), most sugar-starved females fed on both (right of dashed line). As an internal control, co-housed males were accessed for sugar-feeding only and most were found to be fed in both conditions. 17-24 mosquitoes/trial; n=11-12 trials/condition. One-way ANOVA with Holm-Šídák multiple comparisons test, p&lt;0.05. Data labelled with different letters are significantly different. G. Mating and blood-feeding. The mating status of D0-D5 co-housed females assayed in (D) were determined post-hoc by dissecting their spermathecae. n=232-239 females were analysed for each day. Many blood-fed females were unmated. H. Mating after blood-feeding. Blood-fed virgins were allowed to mate and then offered a second blood-meal. A suppression in blood-appetite was observed. 15-20females/trial, n=10 trials. Unpaired t-test; ****p&lt;0.0001.</p></caption>

<p>The modulation of blood-feeding provides a useful frame-work for understanding how internal and external cues shape meal-choice. What underlying molecular cues represent internal physiological states to influence dietary choice is of interest not only because of its importance in public health, but also because such understanding has implications for other organisms. In <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> anticipatory expression of the yolk protein precursor gene <italic>vitellogenin 2</italic> in the fat body promotes host-seeking behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). In <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, neuropeptide-Y receptor (NPYLR7), and more recently, short Neuropeptide F (sNPF) and neuropeptide RYamide (RYa) have been shown to suppresses hostattraction, while Neuropeptide F (NPF) promotes it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>– <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Factors from the host can also both promote (ATP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>) and terminate feeding (Fibrinopeptide A)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we describe the blood- and sugar-feeding patterns of <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic>, which is endemic to the Indian sub-continent but has expanded its range into West Africa, putting millions more people at risk of malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Neurotranscriptomics across the different conditions of blood-deprivation and -satiety allowed us to shortlist several candidate molecules that might promote blood-feeding behaviour. Through dsRNA mediated knockdown of nine of them, we identified two neuropeptide genes – <italic>sNPF</italic> and <italic>RYa</italic> - tht together promote blood-feeding through its action in the brain and possibly the abdomen. We find that <italic>sNPF</italic> expression pattern reflects this requirement: a cluster of cells in the SEZ expresses the <italic>sNPF</italic> transcripts only in blood-hungry females and such females also have more <italic>sNPF</italic> transcripts in their midguts. <italic>RYa</italic> is not modulated similarly. Both their receptors are expressed in the brain and the <italic>sNPF receptor</italic> is also expressed in the midgut. Together, these data are consistent with a model where increase in levels of <italic>sNPF</italic> in the brain and the midgut promotes a state of blood-hunger in <italic>An. stephensi</italic>.</p>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>Blood-, but not sugar-feeding, is modulated across the reproductive cycle</title>
<p>To assess the female <italic>An. stephensi</italic> appetite for blood through the reproductive cycle we designed a behavioural assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1A</xref>; see methods for details), and tested it on <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, a well-studied model. We were able to reproduce the previously reported results that mating enhances blood-feeding in <italic>Aedes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>) and that once fed to repletion, females actively suppress blood-feeding until oviposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>We used this assay on <italic>An. stephensi</italic>, and employed Generalised Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to compare appetites across conditions (see supplementary sheet1). We found that these females were uninterested in blood when they emerge but that their appetite increased with age (magenta, D0-D5 in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1D</xref>, supplementary sheet1: model 1). Once fed to repletion, like <italic>Ae. aegypti, An. stephensi</italic> also suppress blood-feeding for at least four days after a blood-meal (magenta, D1<sup>B</sup>-D4<sup>B</sup> in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1D</xref>) and until oviposition, after which, the suppression was lifted to pre-blood-meal levels (magenta, D1<sup>○</sup>-D2<sup>○</sup> in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1D</xref>). Unlike blood-feeding, sugar-feeding was not modulated similarly barring a brief suppression post-blood-meal, which was not dependent on oviposition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1E</xref>; methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1G</xref> for details, supplementary sheet1: model 4, 5, 6).</p>
<p>To ascertain whether sugar and blood represent parallel appetites independent of each other, we presented sugar-sated co-housed females a choice between the two. Under these conditions, 70% of the females chose to feed on blood alone and only 21% took both meals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1F</xref>). When co-housed females were deprived of sugars for a day prior to testing, the pattern revered: 68% of the females now took both sugar and blood meals and only 24% fed on blood alone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1F</xref>). As expected, males fed robustly on sugar in both conditions (grey, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>Since females took blood-meals regardless of their prior sugar-feeding status and only sugar-feeding was selectively suppressed by prior sugar access, we infer that these two represent parallel appetites regulated independently. The fact that most females in the starved group took both sugar- and blood-meals, while most females in the sated condition ignored sugar, supports this interpretation. An alternate interpretation of these data are that two represent hierarchical appetites: that some sugar feeding is necessary to stimulate blood-feeding. Determining the order of feeding events in the choice assay would be necessary to comment on this. However, prior reports that females can survive on blood-meals alone (with no access to plant sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>)) argue against this model. Together, these data suggest that in newly-emerged females, blood and sugar represent parallel appetites. We note that their interdependence may emerge later in the reproductive cycle (D1<sup>B</sup>-D2<sup>B</sup> in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>As mating promotes the first blood-meal in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, we tested if this was true for <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. A post-hoc dissection of each female’s spermatheca (where sperm is stored after mating) revealed that many of the blood-fed females in the above assay were unmated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1G</xref>). To confirm this, we assayed blood-feeding behaviour in virgin females and found that virgin <italic>An. stephensi</italic>, unlike <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, have a robust appetite for blood and that mating enhances it only marginally (cyan, D0-D5, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1D</xref>, supplementary sheet1: model 1, 2). Interestingly, however, these virgins, unlike mated <italic>An. stephensi</italic> (or <italic>Ae. aegypti)</italic> females, failed to suppress their blood-appetite, even after engorging on blood. Instead, they continued to blood-feed for up to four days after their first blood-meal (cyan, D1<sup>B</sup> - D4<sup>B</sup> in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1D</xref>, supplementary sheet1: model 3). A flipped order of the two behaviours - virgins were first given a blood-meal then allowed to mate – also resulted in suppression of the appetite (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1H</xref>). This suggests that the post-blood-meal suppression of blood-appetite in <italic>An. stephensi</italic>, is dependent upon mating status.</p>
<p>Together, these data describe female <italic>An. stephensi’s</italic> feeding behaviours: 1) in newlyemerged females blood and sugar represent parallel appetites, 2) blood-, but not sugar-appetite (barring a brief effect), is suppressed between a blood-meal and oviposition, and 3) mating is not necessary for blood-feeding in newly-emerged females, but it is necessary for its suppression between a blood-meal and oviposition.</p>

<title>Host-seeking is modulated across the reproductive cycle</title>
<p>The modulation of blood-feeding through the reproductive cycle could be due to 1) modulation in peripheral sensitivity to host kairomones, 2) modulation by central brain circuits, or 3) modulation in both peripheral and central circuit elements. Extensive data in other mosquito species suggest that sensitivity to host kairomones change as females age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>) and following a blood-meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). We tested this in <italic>An. stephensi</italic>.</p>
<p>Because of the multi-sensory nature of host-seeking, we used a two-choice behavioural assay where multiple hostcues were provided in one arm while the other had none. Mosquitoes had to make a choice between the two arms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>). When no host-cues are provided in either (blank) even blood-hungry females distribute equally between the two arms demonstrating the assay has no bias (black, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref>). Using this assay, we found that newly emerged females showed no preference for either the control or the host arm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref>). Five days later, they were strongly attracted to the host-cues and this attraction was suppressed after their blood-meal and until oviposition (magenta, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref>). This general trend in attraction to host-cues tracks the trend in blood-feeding. Interestingly, the response of virgin females to host-cues in the Y-maze was highly variable under all conditions tested (cyan, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref>). Yet, like in the blood-feeding assay, blood-fed virgins were comparatively more attracted to human host-cues than were the mated blood-fed females (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref>).</p>

Females were allowed to acclimatise in the chamber for 5 minutes while being exposed to host kairomones that were presented in a test arm. A fan sucked the air from both host and control arms at 0.3-0.6m/s. Mosquitoes were released after acclimatisation and allowed to choose between the two arms. B. Percent females attracted to either host-cues or control arm at the indicated time points in the Y-maze. 17-21 females/trial, n=10 trials/group. Unpaired t-test; n.s.: not significant, p&gt;0.05.; * p&lt;0.05; ****p&lt;0.0001.

<p>These data suggest that, like blood-feeding, host-seeking is also modulated through the female’s reproductive cycle, and mating influences this modulation by enhancing it initially and suppressing it post-blood-meal. The variability in response of virgin females suggests that mating enhances the female’s initial attraction to a host.</p>

<title>Neurotranscriptomics reveals several candidate genes that promote blood-feeding</title>
<p>While sensitivity to host kairomones may modulate blood-feeding, it is also possible that central brain circuitry contributes to it. We reasoned that cues from mating, or signals from other tissues such as midgut could act on brain circuitry to modulate blood-feeding. To determine the molecular underpinnings of this behavioural modulation, we performed RNA sequencing from the central brains of mosquitoes at different stages of their reproductive cycle (consequently different states of blood-deprivation or -satiety). This included females at emergence (D0), 5-days after emergence (D5; sugar-fed, blood-deprived), virgins and mated females one day after a blood-meal (D1<sup>B</sup>, D1<sup>B</sup>M), and females one day after oviposition (D1<sup>○</sup>). Age-matched males were included for the earliest two time points (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3A</xref>).</p>

Blood-hungry: D5, sugar-fed virgin females, D1<sup>B</sup> virgin females, and D1<sup>○</sup> females. Blood-sated: D1<sup>B</sup> mated females. n=100 central brains per replicate; 3 biological replicates per sample, 7 samples. B. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the normalised counts-per-million from different brain RNA-seq samples. Replicates cluster closely, and age and sex contribute most to the differences between the samples. C. Genes (listed on the right) with known expression patterns plotted across different samples. These known expression patterns are reproduced in our data. Average of the triplicate data are represented as z-score normalised log10 (TPM+1) values. Grey cells represent no data. D. Identification of candidates potentially involved in promoting blood-feeding behaviour. Two types of comparisons were made: (left) genes commonly up-regulated in the three blood-hungry conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">figure 3A</xref>) when compared against D0 females and excluded in males, and (right) genes up-regulated in D5 sugar-fed virgin females when compared against D1<sup>B</sup> mated females (blood-sated), and excluded in males. Number of candidate genes identified from two different sets of analyses are boxed in red. E. Nine candidate genes (listed on the right), shortlisted for further validation.

<p>For each of our samples, 81-87% of about 20-30million reads aligned to the <italic>An. stephensi</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). The variance between our replicates was low as represented in the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3B</xref>). In PCA, older female brains, regardless of mating-, blood-feeding-, or oviposition-status clustered together while the youngest female and male brains stood apart on PC1 and PC2 suggesting that age and sex contribute most significantly to the variance in our data (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3B</xref>). The expression pattern of some hallmark genes showed the expected trends. Genes involved in eclosion behaviours – <italic>eclosion hormone</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>) and <italic>partner of bursicon</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>) – showed the highest expression in the D0 samples and were not expressed later. Male-specific genes, <italic>HMG-B-13-like</italic>, were expressed only in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>), and genes involved in vitellogenic stages of egg-development – <italic>vitellogenins, Ecdysone receptor</italic>, and <italic>E-20-monooxygenase</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>)– were expressed only in post-blood-meal samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>We next explored this data for insights into the molecular underpinnings of blood-feeding modulation. Reports suggest that anticipatory metabolic changes in female germline cells and a ‘vittelogenin wave’ in fat bodies can drive specific appetite in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>) and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>) respectively. However, we did not find any evidence in the neurotranscriptomes for a similar anticipatory metabolic change that might drive blood-feeding in the mosquito brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">figure S2B</xref>). Interestingly, we found that after a blood-meal, glucose is neither spent nor stored, and that the female brain goes into a state of metabolic ‘sugar rest’, while actively processing proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">figure S2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3</xref>). We similarly plotted genes involved in lipid metabolism, neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and their receptors and found no significant patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">figure S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">S6</xref>). In summary, contrary to our expectations, we saw no evidence in the neurotranscriptomes for anticipatory metabolic changes in the brain that might in turn drive blood-feeding behaviour. It is possible, however, that other forms of regulation that do not involve transcriptional changes could still influence metabolism.</p>
<p>In an alternate approach to identifying genes that might modulate blood-feeding, we took the intersection of genes that were enriched in the three blood-hungry conditions (and absent in males). These comparisons were made against the two conditions that were not motivated to blood-feed: females at emergence and mated-blood-fed females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">figure3D</xref>). These shortlisted 38 and 34 genes respectively, gave us 68 unique candidates (excluding common genes and isoforms) that might promote blood-feeding in <italic>An. stephensi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">figure S7</xref>). Notably, we did not find any genes to be differentially expressed between the two blood-fed conditions (virgins and mated), despite their contrasting behaviours (figure S2A). The strongest signatures we observed in these females were those related to metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">figure S2B</xref>). It is possible that the differences lie in small populations of cells, which get obscured in the averaged transcriptomes of the entire brain.</p>

<title>Neuropeptides <italic>sNPF</italic> and RYamide promote blood-feeding in <italic>An. stephensi</italic></title>
<p>We employed multiple, independent criteria while further short-listing candidates from the above analysis: 1) genes that showed the expected expression pattern: low in newly-emerged males and females; high in blood-hungry females; low in blood-sated females, 2) all neuropeptides, since these are known to regulate feeding behaviours, and 3) all genes related to juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) signalling pathway, since they regulate development and reproduction in mosquitoes. This gave us 9 candidates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3E</xref>): Two sodium-dependent amino acid transporters <italic>118504075 and 118504077</italic>.

Using dsRNA, we knocked each of these genes down and tested their blood-feeding behaviour. In each case, we ensured efficiency of gene knockdown post-hoc (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4A</xref>). We first confirmed that the injection itself did not cause any behavioural changes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4B</xref>) and in all following experiments either <italic>dsGFP</italic>-injected or uninjected females were included as controls.</p>

<p>We saw no change in behaviour upon loss of <italic>Eiger, JHEH</italic>, and <italic>Ork</italic> function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">figure S8A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">S8A’-C’</xref>). We were able to downregulate <italic>Hairy</italic> and <italic>Prp</italic> transcript levels by only 3035%, hence cannot comment on their role in modulating blood-feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">figure S8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">S8E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">S8D’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">S8E’</xref>). Downregulation of the two transporters was efficient and resulted in a marginal reduction in blood-feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">figure S8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">S8G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">S8F’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">S8G’</xref>). However, their combined knockdowns, though effective, did not show any significant change in behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">figure S8H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">S8H’</xref>).</p>
<p>Two neuropeptides - <italic>sNPF</italic> and <italic>RYa</italic> - showed about 25% and 40% reduced mRNA levels in the heads and these animals showed no change in blood-feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">figure S9B, S9C, S9E, S9F</xref>). We noticed, however, that many of these animals did not engorge and instead took smaller blood-meals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">figure S9D, S9G</xref>). Given this, and since neuropeptides are known to act in concert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>), we tested the possibility that <italic>sNPF</italic> and <italic>RYa</italic> might act together to regulate blood-feeding behaviour. Indeed, their simultaneous dsRNA injections resulted in about 40% of the animals not taking blood-meals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4C</xref>). Since RNA interference (RNAi) can be variable, and each female is an independent experiment, we pooled the females that took blood-meals and those that didn’t separately before quantifying mRNA from them. We noted that knockdown efficiency was higher in the heads of females that did not take blood-meals suggesting that downregulating these genes caused the suppression of blood-feeding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4D</xref>). Importantly, since these females were offered both blood and sugar, we noted that their sugar-feeding was unaffected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Since RNAi results in systemic knockdowns and neuropep-tides are known to influence behaviour from their action in non-neuronal tissues such as the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>), we modified our dsRNA injection protocol to knock <italic>sNPF</italic> and <italic>RYa</italic> down in the abdomen while leaving their levels in the head unaltered (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4F</xref>, 4G, S9J, S9L) (see methods for details). Abdomen-specific knockdown had no effect on blood-feeding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4E</xref>, S9I, S9K), indicating that abdominal <italic>sNPF</italic> and <italic>RYa</italic> alone cannot influence blood-feeding and their action in the brain is necessary. In contrast, since every head knockdown of these neuropeptides also abolished their abdominal expression (figure S9C, S9F), we cannot rule out the possibility that both brain-and gutderived neuropeptides modulate blood-feeding. Indeed, since such neuropeptide mediated gut-brain control of feeding is commonly seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>), we propose a model, consistent with our data, where brain-derived <italic>sNPF/RYamide</italic> is essential to trigger blood-feeding, while gut-derived peptide acts as a modulatory feedback signal. This remains to be tested with cell-specific tools that are currently not available for this species.</p>
<p>To determine in which cells <italic>sNPF</italic> and <italic>RYa</italic> act, we used hybridisation chain reaction (HCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>) <italic>in situ</italic>. We found that their transcripts are expressed in several non-overlapping neuronal clusters distributed across many regions in the brain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS10">S10A</xref>) and only in the Kenyon cells of the mushroom body were they co-expressed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS10">S10B</xref>). This is reminiscent of their expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Bombyx</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>). Importantly, we found a cluster of cells in the SEZ that expresses the <italic>sNPF</italic> transcript only in the blood hungry-state (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4J</xref>, supplementary movie). Its transcripts were either absent or diminished from this cluster in newly-emerged or sated females. Since the RNAi experiments suggested the abdominal involvement of these neuropeptides, we also looked for their expression in the midgut where we could detect only <italic>sNPF’s</italic> transcripts, not <italic>RYa’s</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4K,K</xref>’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS11">S11A, S11B, S11E</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>sNPF’s</italic> transcript expression was also modulated in the midgut enteroendocrine cells (EECs) - hormone-producing cells of the gut. In these cells, <italic>sNPF</italic> transcripts were specifically increased in blood-hungry females when compared to newly-emerged or sated females (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4L,M</xref>).</p>
<p>Neuropeptides work by acting on their receptors to trigger downstream signalling cascades in the cells that express the receptors. We identified putative receptors for <italic>sNPF</italic> and <italic>RYa</italic> (see methods) and found that both were expressed in several overlapping cell-clusters in the brain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS10">S10C, S10D</xref>). In the midgut, however, we could only detect <italic>sNPFR</italic> and not <italic>RYaR</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS11">S11C, S11D, S11F</xref>). Since these receptors were identified based on homology, their functional validation will be necessary to implicate them in blood-feeding behaviour. However, neuropeptide receptors are often ligand-promiscuous and confirming their specificity would require pharmacological characterisation beyond the scope of this study.</p>
<p>Together, these data are consistent with a model where increased <italic>sNPF</italic> expression in both the brain and midgut might drive the blood-feeding behaviour, but that this occurs in the context of <italic>RYa’s</italic> action in the brain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4O</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Here, we report the blood- and sugar-feeding behaviours of <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. While sharing key features with other mosquito species, <italic>An. stephensi</italic> exhibits distinct regulatory patterns. Unlike <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, it does not require mating to initiate blood-feeding, though the presence of males is necessary to sustain the enhanced state. In both species, blood-feeding is suppressed after a blood-meal and until oviposition, but this suppression is mating-dependent in <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. Since unmated <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females did not blood-feed in our assays, we cannot comment on whether this suppression also requires mating.</p>
<p>Mosquito feeding behaviour is highly context-dependent, shaped by physiological state, environment, and experimental design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Our comparisons between <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>An. stephensi</italic> were conducted under standardised conditions. While direct comparisons across studies must be made cautiously, patterns observed under particular conditions can offer meaningful insights. For example, virgins of other <italic>Anopheles</italic> species readily blood-feed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), suggesting that this is typical of the genus, whereas <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> virgins do so only under specific conditions and these responses vary among strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) (and references within). Whether blood-fed <italic>Aedes</italic> virgins suppress subsequent feeding is likely also context dependent with reports suggesting both that they do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>) and do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Post-blood-meal suppression of host-seeking - well characterised and robust in mated <italic>Aedes</italic> - appears weaker in mated <italic>Anopheles</italic> and can be lifted prior to oviposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>). Indeed, we too observed a stronger post-blood-meal suppression of feeding in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> than in <italic>An. stephensi</italic> (compare <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Few studies have investigated this suppression in <italic>Anopheline</italic> virgins, but when they do, they report a weak suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>). Taken together, <italic>An. stephensi</italic> displays characteristics of both <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Anopheline</italic> feeding patterns - its virgin feeding patterns align more closely with other Anophelines, yet, like mated <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, it still exhibits clear suppression of blood-feeding until oviposition.</p>
<p>What mechanisms might underlie such mating-induced modulation of blood-feeding? In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, mating induces a suite of behavioural changes - including increased protein and sugar intake - that are mediated by male-derived sex-peptide that acts on central brain circuits in the female brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>). These changes are anticipatory in nature rather than a homeostatic control of feeding behaviour to meet reproductive demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In mosquitoes, the molecular mechanisms driving post-mating behavioural changes are not likely to be the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>). Instead, mating-derived modulators such as HP1 in <italic>Aedes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>) and male-deposited steroid hormone (20-hydroxyecdysone) in <italic>Anopheles</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>) have been shown to induce sexual refractoriness. Whether they also shape feeding decisions remains unknown.</p>
<p>We have identified two neuropeptides - <italic>RYa</italic> and <italic>sNPF</italic> - that act synergistically to promote blood-feeding in <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. Our data are consistent with a model where an increase in <italic>sNPF</italic> levels in the brain - likely released by a cluster of neurons in the SEZ - as well as in the midgut, promotes a state of blood-hunger. Whether this reflects gut-to-brain communication or parallel, tissue-local computations to modulate behaviours remains unclear, especially since we detected the transcript of both <italic>sNPF</italic> and its receptor in both tissues. Inter-organ signalling is well established in feeding regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>). For example, gut-derived NPF in flies can influence brain circuits to increase protein intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>). More broadly, feeding behaviour is likely regulated by a distributed network of hormonal and neuronal cues across multiple organs. Signals from the ovary, fatbody, and other nutrient-sensing tissues may also contribute, acting through both central and peripheral circuits. Many of these inputs remain to be identified.</p>
<p>It is possible that <italic>sNPF</italic> promotes blood-feeding independent of <italic>RYa</italic>. However, we were unable to knock <italic>sNPF</italic> down completely to test this. Its synergistic requirement with <italic>RYa</italic>, despite no apparent modulation of <italic>RYa</italic> or its receptor, could result from a general state of hunger that <italic>RYa</italic> promotes, in the context of which, we were able to uncover the blood-feeding role of the diminished <italic>sNPF</italic>. Since many neurons co-express these receptors, it is possible that neurons downstream of <italic>sNPF</italic> or <italic>RYa</italic> expressing neurons integrate the two inputs to modulate behaviour.</p>
<p>We note that our findings differ from those reported in <italic>Aedes</italic>. In <italic>Aedes sNPF</italic> and <italic>RYamide</italic> act as satiety brakes—peptide or receptor activation curbs host-seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>) —whereas in <italic>Anopheles</italic>, our knockdowns show that the same neuropeptides act as a hunger signal, stimulating blood-feeding. While these differences are interesting, in the context of their evolutionary histories, and the known differences in how neuropeptides can act differently across species, they are not entirely unexpected. <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> lineages diverged <italic>≈</italic>150-200 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>), and the two genera have since diverged in almost every facet of biology—diel activity, host preference, feeding and oviposition sites, egg-desiccation tolerance, genome size, and chemosensory repertoires among other traits. Neuropeptide pathways are known to drive opposing behaviours in different species: <italic>sNPF</italic> is known to be orexic in <italic>D. melanogaster, A. mellifera, L. decemlineata, B. mori</italic>, and <italic>P. americana</italic>, while it has anorexic effects in <italic>S. gregaria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>). Against this backdrop, it is unsurprising that the same neuropeptide pathway can drive opposite behaviours in <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic>. These comparative studies underscore a key lesson for vector control strategies in general. A strategy that is effective in one mosquito species may inadvertently boost vectorial capacity in another. Behavioural interventions, chemical modulators, and even gene-drives therefore require rigorous cross-species validation because results from one mosquito species cannot be assumed to hold true for another.</p>

<title>Mosquito culture</title>
<p><italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> (Indian strain; Bangalore strain, TIGS-1) and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (Bangalore collection) were reared in BugDorm cages and maintained at 26-28°C, 70-80% relative humidity with a photo-period of 12h light: 12h dark. All the behavioural assays were performed at these conditions of temperature and humidity. Larvae were fed on a mixture of yeast and dog biscuit (1:3 ratio) and cultured in trays in appropriate densities to prevent over-crowding. Adult mosquitoes were provided <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to 10% sugar solution (8% sucrose +2% glucose +0.05% methyl paraben +5% vitamin syrup (Polybion SF Complete, Merck Ltd.)) at all times, unless specified otherwise. Females were provided O+ve human blood, secured periodically from blood banks, both for general maintenance and feeding assays.</p>

<title>Blood-feeding assay: first blood-meal, 0-120h post-emergence (D0-D5)</title>
<p>All <italic>An. stephensi</italic> feeding experiments were performed from ZT12-ZT15 and <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> experiments from ZT10-ZT12 (Zeitgeber time 0 is defined as the time of lights ON).</p>
<p>0-7h old mosquitoes were cold anaesthetised and collected during the day in 1100ml paper cups covered with a net and secured with a rubber band. These were maintained at the conditions of temperature and humidity described above. To collect virgins, males were separated at the time of collection. 20 females with males (1:1 ratio) or without males were collected for each trial and were aged appropriately with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to 10% sugar solution (supplementary figure S1A).</p>
<p>Females were assayed for their blood-feeding behaviour from the day of emergence (D0, 0-7h old) to 5 days of age (D5), every 24h. They were provided constant access to sugar, except when they were offered blood. A detailed schematic has been shown in figure S1A. On the day of the test, appropriately aged females were offered a blood-meal via a Hemotek feeder (Hemotek Ltd), which was maintained at 37°C and perfumed with human skin odours. It has been reported that female mosquitoes need to be ‘activated’ to take blood-meals. This involves the presentation of CO<sub>2</sub> (and other host-cues) to the females, likely because CO<sub>2</sub> has been shown to gate temperature and visual cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>). So, prior to offering the blood-meal, the mosquitoes were ‘activated’ by the presentation of a hand placed above the cup for 5 minutes, followed by 3 exhalations from the experimenter. Additionally, blood was supplemented with 1mM ATP (Sigma A6419) before loading the feeder (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1B</xref>). Females were allowed to feed for 60-90mins in dark and abdomens were scored visually for presence of blood, irrespective of the amount ingested (inset, figure S1A). For D0, no sugar was provided at the time of collection. Females were allowed to acclimatise for at least 30 mins in the cups and then offered a choice of both sugar and blood simultaneously, to assess their preference for blood soon after emergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">figure S1A</xref>).</p>
<p>In the case of co-housed females, males and females were housed together from the time of collection until the day of the experiment. Males were separated post-hoc and spermathecae of the females were dissected to score for the presence or absence of sperm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1G</xref>). All the assays with virgin and co-housed females were performed in parallel by a single experimenter. Mosquitoes from at least 4 independent batches were tested for each day of the experimental timeline. For <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, both virgin and mated females (mating status was confirmed via post-hoc dissection of spermathecae and all co-housed females were found to be mated) were tested for first blood-meal at only 8days post-emergence (D8, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1C</xref>). Behavioural experiments were performed the same way as described for <italic>An. stephensi</italic>.</p>

<title>Blood-feeding assay: second blood-meal, 24-96h post-first blood-meal (D1<sup>B</sup>-D4<sup>B</sup>)</title>
<p>To ensure that the second blood-meal is not driven due to an incomplete first blood-meal, we selected only fully-engorged females to test for subsequent feedings (figure S1A). 5days old <italic>An. stephensi</italic> (both virgins and co-hosued with males) and 7-9days old <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (mated, as previously determined) were fed on blood and fully fed females were separated and collected in paper cups as described above. As a female takes about 2 days to digest blood, the second blood-meal ingested 24h post-first blood-meal (D1<sup>B</sup>) was detected by the presence of Rhodamine B (Sigma R6626), which fluoresces in the red range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">figure S1A</xref>). Spiking the second blood-meal with Rhodamine B (0.04<italic>µ</italic>g/<italic>µ</italic>L of blood) allowed visualisation of the freshly ingested blood, without affecting the feeding efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">supplementary figure S1B-D</xref>). To assess feeding at subsequent days (D2<sup>B</sup>-D4<sup>B</sup>), abdomens were dissected to differentiate between the bright red freshly ingested blood from the dark and clotted first blood-meal. In the case of co-housed <italic>An. stephensi</italic> females, spermathecae were not dissected to confirm mating as females were presumed to be mated when collected for this assay (5days old and co-housed with males for the entire duration from the time of emergence), as previously determined in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1G</xref>.</p>
<p>To confirm whether mating suppresses subsequent feeding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1H</xref>), fully fed virgins were collected and allowed to mate for 3-4 days with aged-match males. No males were introduced in the virgin-only controls. Blood-feeding assay was performed as described above. Spermathecae were dissected post-hoc to determine the mating status and unmated females were not considered for the final analysis. Datasets with less than 80% total mating were discarded.</p>

<title>Blood-feeding assay: post-oviposition, 24-48h post-egg laying (D1<sup>○</sup>-D2<sup>○</sup>)</title>
<p>For blood-feeding behaviour post-oviposition, fully fed females were separated and a water cup lined with moist paper (ovipositor) was provided for egg laying 2days post-blood-meal (determined in a separate assay described below, supplementary figure S1E; figure S1A). Females were allowed to lay eggs overnight. The following morning, non-gravid females were visually identified by their lean bellies and separated in cups. Blood-feeding assay was performed the same evening for 1day post-oviposition (D1<sup>○</sup>) and the following day (D2<sup>○</sup>), as described above.

Eggs laid were counted the next day and a fresh ovipositor was provided. This cycle was repeated for the next 5 days. Total eggs laid each day were divided by the number of females present at the time of counting (supplementary figure S1E).</p>

<title>Sugar-feeding assay for <italic>An. stephensi</italic></title>
<p>As mosquitoes feed on sugar in small bouts, as opposed to a replete blood-meal, we assessed sugar-feeding behaviour of females in windows of 24h for each test day. 0-7h old mosquitoes were collected during the day, separated in cups and aged appropriately. They were given access to 10% sugar solution at all times, as described above, except for the day of emergence (D0) when no sugar was provided at the time of collection (similar to the blood-feeding assay performed at D0).</p>
<p>To assess their sugar-feeding behaviour on the day of emergence (D0), 0-7h old females were acclimatised in the cups for 1h and sugar spiked with Rhodamine B (1mg/25ml of sugar; Sigma R6626) was presented for 2.5-3h. The fluorescence of Rhodamine B in the red channel allowed visualisation of even the tiniest amounts of sugar ingested by a female (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">figure S1G</xref>). For D1 feeding, 3-10h old females (with access to normal sugar so far) were then provided with Rhodamine B-sugar and allowed to feed on it for 24h. For D2 feeding, 27-34h old females (with access to normal sugar so far) were fed on Rhodamine B-sugar for the next 24h and scored as D2. This cycle was repeated until D5. In the case of co-housed females, males were separated post-hoc and spermathecae of the females were dissected to score for the presence or absence of sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">figure S1H</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess sugar-feeding post-blood-meal, females fully fed on blood were collected and separated in cups, as described above. They were allowed to feed on Rhodamine B-sugar for 24h following a blood-meal and scored as D1<sup>B</sup>. The next set of females (with access to normal sugar so far) were then provided with Rhodamine B-sugar from 24h-48h post-bloodmeal and scored as D2<sup>B</sup>. This cycle was repeated until 4 days post-blood-meal (D4<sup>B</sup>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>For sugar-feeding post-oviposition, blood-fed females were provided an ovipositor 3 days later and were forced to oviposit during daytime by artificially creating dark conditions. Oviposited females (non-gravid) were then visually identified, separated and presented with Rhodamine B-sugar for the following 24h and scored as D1<sup>○</sup>. The next set (with access to normal sugar so far) was then provided with Rhodamine B-sugar, 24-48h post-oviposition and scored as D2<sup>○</sup>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1E</xref>). For each day tested, females were dissected post-hoc and scored for absence of mature ovaries, as a sign of successful oviposition. Gravid females were not considered for the analysis.</p>

<title>Dual choice assay of blood and sugar</title>
<p>Mosquitoes were collected as described above. Males and females were cohoused for 4-6days with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to sugar. To assess the choice between sugar and blood, mosquitoes were either given continuous access to normal sugar (sugar-sated) or starved with water 24h prior to the assay (sugar-starved). At the time of the assay, post-activation (as described above), blood and Rhodamine B-spiked sugar (1mg/25ml of sugar, Sigma R6626) were provided in parallel. After 60mins, abdomens were scored visually for ingestion of blood under white light, and under fluorescent microscope (red channel) for ingestion of sugar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">figure S1F</xref>). Co-housed males served as an internal control for sugar-feeding. As males are unable to feed on blood, they were only scored for presence or absence of Rhodamine B-spiked sugar.

<title>Statistical analysis of feeding behaviours</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using R (version 4.4.2) and Graph-Pad Prism (v10.2.0). Blood-feeding and sugar-feeding behaviours of virgins and co-housed females in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1D, E</xref>, were analysed using Generalized Linear Mixed-effects Models (GLMMs) with a binomial distribution and logit link function. The models were fitted using the “glmer” function from the “lme4” package in R. The probabilities of blood-or sugar-feeding, both pre-and post-blood-meal were modeled as a function of Day (age) and Group (virgin vs. cohoused with males), including their interaction term to test whether group differences varied across days. Replicate identities (BioID) and larval batches (only for first blood-meal in sugar-fed females) were included as random factors to account for replicate-level and batch-level variations respectively. Post-hoc analyses were conducted using estimated marginal means (emmeans package) for age-effects within groups (p-value adjusted for multiple comparisons using Tukey’s method) and pairwise comparison between groups at each day (p-value adjusted using Bonferroni method). To test whether mating success altered the sugar- and blood-feeding propensity of females co-housed with males, the probabilities of feeding were modeled only the co-housed data, as a function of Day (age) and Mating (yes or no), including their interaction term and accounting for variation due to replicate IDs (BioID). Statistical significance was set at α = 0.05 for all analyses. Complete model outputs are provided in supplementary sheet1. Statistical analyses for data in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C, 1F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1H</xref> were performed using GraphPad Prism (v10.2.0) with appropriate tests as indicated in figure legends.</p>

<title>Y-maze olfactory assay for host-seeking behaviour in <italic>An. stephensi</italic></title>
<p>A 30inch Y-maze was constructed as per the WHO guidelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241505024">https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241505024</ext-link>). Each arm of the Y-maze had a trapping port, while the stem was attached to a holding port. Each port had a mesh screen at one end, while the other was fitted with a sliding door to trap or release mosquitoes. The holding port was attached to a fan which pulled air from the two arms, over the mosquitoes, and out at a velocity of 0.3-0.6m/s. Optic flow information (alternate black and white stripes) was placed underneath the Y-maze to act as visual guide for navigation.</p>
<p>Following conditions were tested: D0 virgins, D5 sugarfed virgins, D5 sugar-fed mated females (D5M), 3days post-blood-meal virgins (D3<sup>B</sup>), 3days post-blood-meal mated females (D3<sup>B</sup>M), and 2days post-oviposition females (D2<sup>○</sup>). For mated conditions, females were co-housed with males for 5days post-emergence and assumed to be mated based on our previous findings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1G</xref>). For each condition, mosquitoes were collected and provided <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to sugar as described above. Females were transferred to holding ports 7-8h prior to the assay and were starved during this time with only access to water. For each run, mosquitoes were acclimatised for 5 minutes: 2 min with clean air and 3 minutes with an experimenter presenting a hand at one of the arms and simultaneously exhaling at resting rates. To account for disruption in airflow, the hand of a mannequin was placed at the other arm (control). Post-acclimatisation, the door of the holding port was opened to release the mosquitoes and they were allowed to make a choice for 5 minutes in the presence of continued host-cues. The ports were then closed and mosquitoes in each arm counted. All the mosquitoes trapped in a port, sitting on the door or resting on the half-length of the Y-arm were considered as “attracted” to that stimuli (host or control, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>). Participation percentage was also calculated as number of mosquitoes that passed halfway through the Y-stem/total number of mosquitoes released (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">figure S1I</xref>).</p>
<p>Several controls were included to avoid experimental artefacts. Each experimental day started with a blank trial (where no stimuli were presented on either arm of the Y-maze) and the side of the host-cues presentation was alternated with each trial to eliminate side biases. Trials for blood-fed virgins and mated females were done both in parallel and on multiple days to eliminate the influence of external factors which might be present on a given day. When testing bloodfed females, aged-matched sugar-fed females (blood-hungry) were included as positive controls where ever possible, with satisfactory results. Lastly, we made sure that at least 50% of the mosquitoes had made either choice in all runs, except for D0 (newly emerged females) and blank runs. In the rare cases that this was not true, we did not consider those for the analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (v10.2.0). To compare the attraction of females to hostcues and control in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref>, each time-point was treated as an independent experiment and p-values were computed for each pair-wise comparison.</p>

<title>Bulk RNA sequencing of central brains and data analysis</title>
<p>For bulk RNA sequencing, central brains were dissected from the following conditions: D0 and D5 sugar-fed males; D0 and D5 sugar-fed virgin females; 1day post-blood-meal virgin (D1<sup>B</sup>) and mated females (D1<sup>B</sup>M) and 1day post-oviposition females (D1<sup>○</sup>). For post-blood-meal conditions, 5days old females were fed on blood and fully fed females were separated for sample preparation. Females co-housed with males for 5 days were assumed to be mated based on our previous findings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1G</xref>). Three replicates from independent batches were prepared for each condition.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes were cold anaesthetised before dissections. Central brains (ie. brains without optic lobes) were dissected in RNase-free 1X PBS and immediately placed into ACME solution (13:3:2:2 of water, methanol, acetic acid, and glycerol) on ice, which mildly fixes the tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>). For each condition, 100 brains were dissected per replicate. The mildly fixed brains were washed with cold 1X PBS and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C to remove ACME. Brains were then homogenised in TRIzol (Invitrogen), flash-frozen, and stored at −80°C until RNA extraction. RNA was extracted using Direct-zol RNA MicroPrep (Zymo Research) columns. RNA quantity and quality were assessed using the ThermoFisher Qubit 4 and RNA 6000 Nano kit Bioanalyser, respectively.</p>
<p>The cDNA library was prepared for each sample using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep kit (Catalog no-E7765L), with an average fragment size of 250 bp. Some of the library samples were subjected to size and quality checks using a bioanalyser. Paired-end sequencing was carried out on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 sequencing platform, generating 2×100 bp reads. The library preparation and sequencing were performed at the Next Generation Genomics Facility (NGGF) at Bangalore LifeScience Cluster.</p>
<p>Post-sequencing, samples were demultiplexed and delivered as raw Fastq files. After passing the quality check using the FastQC tool, the reads were mapped onto the reference <italic>An. stephensi</italic> transcriptome (NCBI RefSeq assembly GCF013141755.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>) using Kallisto v0.43.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>) with default parameters. 81-87% of reads aligned to the mosquito transcriptome.</p>
<p>Transcript-level abundance was quantified using Kallisto and gene-level summarisation was performed using the Tximport function in R, with transcript isoform information retained (supplementary sheet 2). Using the EgdeR package, the raw counts were converted to Counts Per Million (CPM) and log2 transformed before data filtering (genes with less than 1 CPM in at least 3 or more samples were filtered out) and normalisation, using the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the prcomp function in R and visualised using the ggplot function. Data was checked for batch effects using gPCA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref>) in R and the test statistic “delta” was found to be 6.957686e-05, with a p-value of &lt;0.001, indicating no batch-effects.</p>

<title>Differential gene expression analysis</title>
<p>Differential expression analysis was performed using the Limma package in R. A design matrix was created to specify the sample conditions, and the Voom function was used to estimate the mean-variance relationship across genes. A linear model was then fitted to the data using the mean-variance relationship. Bayesian statistics were calculated for the data by creating a contrast matrix to extract the linear model fit. To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the “decide-Tests” function was used by applying a fold change threshold of 2 (log2fc=1) and a FDR (false discovery rate) adjusted p-value cut-off of 0.05. The number of genes identified to be upregulated and downregulated in each pair-wise comparison are shown in figure S2A and the details are provided in supplementary sheet 3.</p>
<p>To plot Transcripts Per Million (TPM) values as heatmaps, the Fastq files for the central brain samples were mapped onto the reference <italic>An. stephensi</italic> transcriptome and abundance was quantified using Kallisto the same way as described above. Gene-level summarisation was done using import-Tx as described above, except all the isoforms of a given transcript were mapped to a single gene (supplementary sheet2). The resultant TPM values were first filtered for TPM&gt;0.1 in each sample. Next, the genes that were not quantified in at least 2 of the 3 replicates of each sample group were removed. The filtered dataset were then log10 transformed and heatmaps were plotted using the pheatmap function inR. To construct heatmaps of genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">supplementary figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">S4</xref>), key enzymes of the respective canonical pathways were manually curated based on the existing literature.

<p>Injected females were allowed to recover in paper cups with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to sugar and assessed for blood-feeding behaviour at 3 days post-injection, as previously described. Fed and unfed females were visually scored and whole heads and abdomens were collected separately for analysis. Total RNA was extracted using Direct-zol RNA MicroPrep (Zymo Research) columns, as per the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was quantified using Qubit Broad range assay (Invitrogen). For each sample, 200-220ng RNA was used to prepare cDNA using the SuperScript™ IV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen 18090050) or Maxima H Minus Reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific EP0752). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using PowerUp™ SYBR™ Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) to determine the knockdown efficiency. Relative mRNA abundances were calculated using the delta-delta Ct method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref>), normalised to RpS7. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (v10.2.0). All the primers used in the study are listed in <xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">supplementary table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>To assess the sugar-feeding behaviour of dsRNA injected females (<italic>dssNPF, dsRYa</italic> and <italic>dsRYa+sNPF</italic>), injections were performed as described above. Injected females were allowed to recover with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to normal sugar for the first two days, which was then replaced with Rhodamine B-spiked sugar (1mg/25ml of sugar, Sigma R6626) for the next 24h. Control females were treated similarly. The blood-feeding assay was performed 3 days post-injection as described above, with both blood and sugar provided in parallel. Abdomens were scored visually for ingestion of blood under white light, and under fluorescent microscope (red channel) for ingestion of sugar (figure S9A).</p>

<title>Hybridisation chain reaction (HCR)</title>
<p>Previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref>) was modified to perform HCR <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisations on brain and gut tissues collected from females under three different conditions: D0 (not interested in blood), D5 virgins (blood-hungry) and D2<sup>B</sup>, mated (blood-sated). All the reagents, including the probes, amplifiers and buffers were procured from Molecular Instruments Inc. A set of custom-designed 20 probe pairs were used per target gene: <italic>sNPF (118511038), RYa (118513478)</italic> and their receptors. To find <italic>sNPF</italic> and <italic>RYa</italic> receptors in <italic>An. stephensi</italic>, putative protein sequences were blasted against orthologs in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster, Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>An. gambiae</italic>. Based on high identities, consistent in all three organisms, <italic>118517381</italic> and <italic>118507167 (NPY receptor type 2)</italic> were identified as <italic>RYa receptor (RYaR)</italic> and <italic>sNPF receptor (sNPFR)</italic> respectively.</p>
<p>5‐7 brains for each target, per condition were dissected in ice cold PBS and fixed with 4% PFA (in PBS) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Post-washing steps with PTw (0.1% Tween-20 in PBS), 4 times 10 mins each, tissues were permeabilised using detergent solution (50mM Tris-Cl, pH7.5, 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, pH8, 0.5% Tween-20, 1% SDS) for 30 mins at room temperature. Brains were then pre-hybridised in probe hybridisation buffer for 30 mins at 37°C, followed by incubation with neuropeptide probes (0.8pmol each) at 37°C for 48h in a humid chamber. Samples were washed with pre-warmed wash buffer, 4 times 15 mins each, at 37°C to remove unbound probes. This was followed by 2 washes, 5 mins each with 5X SSCT (0.1% Tween-20 in 5X SSC) at room temperature. Samples were then pre-amplified using amplification buffer for 30 mins at room temperature. For each sample, 2<italic>µ</italic>L (3<italic>µ</italic>M stock) of each hairpins were mixed and prepared by heating at 95°C for 90secs for annealing. They were allowed to cool to room temperature for 30mins in a dark chamber and 100<italic>µ</italic>L amplification buffer was added to the mix. Brains were incubated in the hairpin solution for 12-16h at 37°C in dark and excess hairpins were washed off with multiple 5X SSCT washes: twice for 5 mins, twice for 30mins, once for 5 mins. For nc82 staining, all the steps were performed in 0.5% PTw buffer (0.5% Tween-20 in PBS). Brains were equilibrated in 0.5% PTw and incubated with anti-mouse nc82 (1:200; DSHB, RRID: AB2314866) for three overnights at 4°C. Post-washing, goat anti-mouse Alexa-fluor405 (1:400, Invitrogen) was added and samples were left in dark, for one-two overnights at 4°C. After washing off the unbound secondary antibody, samples were equilibrated for at least an hour in Vectashield and mounted in Vectashield for imaging. <italic>In situs</italic> against neuropeptide receptors were performed the same way, except the washing steps to remove the unbound probes were performed at 42°C and samples were incubated with the hairpin solution at room temperature (to minimise background). As controls for background signal, samples were prepared the same way, except no probes were added in the hybridisation buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS10">figure S10E</xref>). Samples for all three conditions were dissected, processed and imaged the same day.</p>
<p>Protocol for gut <italic>in situs</italic> was adapted from Slaidina et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref>). 5-8 gut samples for each target, per condition were dissected in ice-cold PBS and fixed with 4% PFA (in PTw) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Post-washing steps with PTw, tissues were dehydrated on ice with graded methanol washes: 25% methanol (in PTw), 50% methanol (in PTw), 75% methanol (in PTw) and 100% methanol for 10 mins each. Samples were stored in 100% methanol for up to a month, at −20°C. For rehydration, samples were washed sequentially with graded methanol: 75% methanol (in PTw), 50% methanol (in PTw), 25% methanol (in PTw), followed by a wash in permeabilisation solution (1% Triton-X in PBS). Samples were permeabilised for 2h at room temperature and fixed again with 4% PFA (in PTw) for 20 minutes. Following 10mins washes: washed once with PTw, twice with 50%PTw/50% 5X SSCT and twice with 5X SSCT, samples were pre-hybridised in probe hybridisation buffer for 30 mins at 37°C, followed by incubation with probes (0.8pmol each) at 37°C for 48h in a humid chamber. Post washing steps with wash buffer at 37°C and 5X SSCT at room temperature, samples were pre-amplified in amplification buffer for 30 mins at room temperature. Hairpins were prepared the same way as described above and samples were incubated in hairpin solutions for 12-16h in dark at room temperature. Following 2 washes 5 mins each with 5X SSCT, samples were incubated with DAPI (1:1000 in 5X SSCT) for one hour at room temperature. Samples were washed with 5X SSCT, 4 times, 10mins each and equilibrated in Vectashield for at least an hour before mounting. As controls for background signal, samples were prepared the same way, except no probes were added in the hybridisation buffer (figure S11G, H). Samples for different conditions, prepared on different days and stored at −20°C, were processed and imaged together. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (v10.2.0). All samples were imaged at Central Imaging and Flow Cytometry Facility (CIFF) at NCBS. Images were acquired with a 40X/1.3NA or 10X/0.4NA (whole guts) objectives at a resolution of 512×512 pixels, on an Olympus FV3000 system. Images were viewed and manually analysed using ImageJ/FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref>).

<caption><title>Standardization of various behavioural assays to study feeding behaviours in <italic>An. stephensi</italic></title>
<p>A. Detailed schematic of the assay designed to assess the blood-feeding behaviour of virgins and co-housed females across the reproductive cycle. 0-7h old mosquitoes were collected and about 20 females (with or without 20 males) were separated into cups. Each cup was aged appropriately and tested on the relevant day (see methods for more details). Number of blood-fed mosquitoes were visually scored, irrespective of the quantity fed. Representative images of differently fed females are shown in A’. Females were tested for first blood-meal from the day of emergence (D0) to five days of age, every 24h. Spermathecae of co-housed females were dissected post-hoc to determine the mating status. To assay for the second blood-meal, fully fed females were collected and aged appropriately in groups of 20. To assess feeding 1day post-first blood-meal (D1<sup>B</sup>), Rhodamine B was spiked in the second blood-meal offered to the females. The subsequent days (D2<sup>B</sup>-D4<sup>B</sup>) were tested without any such spiking (grey box; see methods for more details). To assay for blood-feeding behaviour in females after oviposition (D1<sup>○</sup>-D2<sup>○</sup>), freshly oviposited females were collected and aged in groups of 20 for the appropriate time in cups (blue box; see methods for more details). In all cases, females were presented with host-cues prior to the assay and testing was performed as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1B</xref> (see methods for more details). B. Standardisation of spiking Rhodamine B dye in blood to assess feeding 24h post-first blood-meal (D1<sup>B</sup>). To assay for the second blood-meal, blood-fed females were collected, aged for 24h and offered Rhodamine B-spiked blood in a Hemotek. All other assay parameters remained the same as for the first blood-meal (see methods for more details). Widefield fluorescent images of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>An. stephensi</italic> fed on second blood-meal spiked with Rhodamine B are shown. Images on the left (black box) show mosquitoes not fed and fed on un-spiked blood (without Rhodamine B), as controls for autofluorescence from body tissues and blood itself, respectively. Fluorescence from Rhodamine B added to the second blood-meal enabled identification of fresh blood intake in previously fed mosquitoes reliably. C,D. Comparison of feeding behaviours of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females (C) and <italic>An. stephensi</italic> females (D) fed on blood with and without Rhodamine B at the indicated age. Females fed similarly on both indicating that Rhodamine B itself does not affect feeding behaviour. Unpaired t-test; n.s.: not significant, p&gt;0.05. 16-20 females/trial. n= 5 trials/group. D5M: 5days post-emergence, mated; D2<sup>B</sup>M: 2days post-blood-meal, mated; D8M: 8days post-emergence, mated). E. Determining optimal oviposition timing in <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. Females were tested in groups of 10 and average number of eggs laid per group are shown at the indicated day after the first blood-meal. Dashed lines connect the eggs laid by each group on the indicated day. Majority of the eggs were laid 2days after blood-meal. 10 females/group, n=10 replicates/group. D0<sup>B</sup>-D5<sup>B</sup>M: 0-5days post-blood-meal, mated. F. Standardisation of the dual choice assay, to determine the choice between blood and sugar in sugar-sated and sugar-starved <italic>An. stephensi</italic> females, co-housed with males. Widefield fluorescent images of females fed on either blood, sugar or both are shown. White arrowhead marks the fluorescence from sugar (spiked with Rhodamine B) in the abdomens of females engorged on blood, indicating that the female has fed on both. This is not observed in the females fed on blood alone. Females fed on sugar alone can be visualised by the fluorescent lean bellies. Unfed females exhibit no fluorescence or engorgement. G. Widefield fluorescent images of female <italic>An. stephensi</italic> fed on sugar spiked with Rhodamine B. This setup was used to study the sugar-feeding behaviour of virgins and co-housed females across the reproductive cycle. Addition of Rhodamine B to standard sucrose solution enabled visualisation of even the smallest amounts ingested, as indicated by the white arrowheads, under the fluorescent microscope. H.

<p>Expression patterns of genes (listed on the right) involved in sugar metabolism via different pathways, across the reproductive cycle in the central brain and in the fat body, midgut and ovary of blood-hungry females, are represented as heatmaps. Green box shows downregulation of genes involved in glucose utilisation and the magenta box represents genes involved in glucose storage. Note that both are low in the brains of blood-fed females indicating that the brain goes into a state of ‘sugar rest’ after a blood-meal. Analysing publicly available data from the midgut, ovary, and fat body of sugar-fed females suggest that energy expenditure via the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway of glucose metabolism is high in these tissues, likely to prime them for the blood-meal. RNA-seq data from all central brain samples in triplicates and single sample data for fat body, midgut and ovary (taken from Prasad et al., 2017) are represented as z-score normalised log10 (TPM+1) values. TPM values of zero were excluded from z-score transformation and are displayed as grey cells.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study uses a combination of behavioral and molecular techniques to identify neuromodulators that influence blood-feeding behavior in the disease vector, Anopheles stephensi. Through a combination of gene expression analysis and RNA knockdown, the authors identify neuropeptides RYamide and sNPF as candidate regulators for blood-feeding, demonstrate behavioral changes upon co-knockdown, and anatomically characterize their expression patterns. While the evidence for behavioral characterization and expression mapping is <bold>solid</bold>, the evidence supporting a direct causal role for these neuropeptides in promoting host-seeking remains unproven.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Bansal et al. present a study on the fundamental blood and nectar feeding behaviors of the critical disease vector, Anopheles stephensi. The study encompasses not just the fundamental changes in blood feeding behaviors of the crucially understudied vector, but then uses a transcriptomic approach to identify candidate neuromodulation pathways which influence blood feeding behavior in this mosquito species. The authors then provide evidence through RNAi knockdown of candidate pathways that the neuromodulators sNPF and Rya modulate feeding either via their physiological activity in the brain alone or through joint physiological activity along the brain-gut axis (but critically not the gut alone). Overall, I found this study to be built on tractable, well-designed behavioral experiments.</p>
<p>Their study begins with a well-structured experiment to assess how the feeding behaviors of A. stephensi change over the course of its life history and in response to its age, mating, and oviposition status. The authors are careful and validate their experimental paradigm in the more well-studied Ae. aegypti, and are able to recapitulate the results of prior studies, which show that mating is a prerequisite for blood feeding behaviors in Ae. aegypt. Here they find A. Stephensi, like other Anopheline mosquitoes, has a more nuanced regulation of its blood and nectar feeding behaviors.</p>
<p>The authors then go on to show in a Y-maze olfactometer that ,to some degree, changes in blood feeding status depend on behavioral modulation to host cues, and this is not likely to be a simple change to the biting behaviors alone. I was especially struck by the swap in valence of the host cues for the blood-fed and mated individuals, which had not yet oviposited. This indicates that there is a change in behavior that is not simply desensitization to host cues while navigating in flight, but something much more exciting is happening.</p>
<p>The authors then use a transcriptomic approach to identify candidate genes in the blood-feeding stages of the mosquito's life cycle to identify a list of 9 candidates that have a role in regulating the host-seeking status of A. stephensi. Then, through investigations of gene knockdown of candidates, they identify the dual action of RYa and sNPF and candidate neuromodulators of host-seeking in this species. Overall, I found the experiments to be well-designed. I found the molecular approach to be sound. While I do not think the molecular approach is necessarily an all-encompassing mechanism identification (owing mostly to the fact that genetic resources are not yet available in A. stephensi as they are in other dipteran models), I think it sets up a rich line of research questions for the neurobiology of mosquito behavioral plasticity and comparative evolution of neuromodulator action.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>I am especially impressed by the authors' attention to small details in the course of this article. As I read and evaluated this article, I continued to think about how many crucial details could potentially have been missed if this had not been the approach. The attention to detail paid off in spades and allowed the authors to carefully tease apart molecular candidates of blood-seeking stages. The authors' top-down approach to identifying RYamide and sNPF starting from first principles behavioral experiments is especially comprehensive. The results from both the behavioral and molecular target studies will have broad implications for the vectorial capacity of this species and comparative evolution of neural circuit modulation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are a few elements of data visualizations and methodological reporting that I found confusing on a first few read-throughs. Figure 1F, for example, was initially confusing as it made it seem as though there were multiple 2-choice assays for each of the conditions. I would recommend removing the &quot;X&quot; marker from the x-axis to indicate the mosquitoes did not feed from either nectar, blood, or neither in order to make it clear that there was one assay in which mosquitoes had access to both food sources, and the data quantify if they took both meals, one meal, or no meals.</p>
<p>I would also like to know more about how the authors achieved tissue-specific knockdown for RNAi experiments. I think this is an intriguing methodology, but I could not figure out from the methods why injections either had whole-body or abdomen-specific knockdown.</p>
<p>I also found some interpretations of the transcriptomic to be overly broad for what transcriptomes can actually tell us about the organism's state. For example, the authors mention, &quot;Interestingly, we found that after a blood meal, glucose is neither spent nor stored, and that the female brain goes into a state of metabolic 'sugar rest', while actively processing proteins (Figure S2B, S3)&quot;.</p>
<p>This would require a physiological measurement to actually know. It certainly suggests that there are changes in carbohydrate metabolism, but there are too many alternative interpretations to make this broad claim from transcriptomic data alone.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Bansal et al examine and characterize feeding behaviour in Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. While sharing some similarities to the well-studied Aedes aegypti mosquito, the authors demonstrate that mated females, but not unmated (virgin) females, exhibit suppression in their blood-feeding behaviour. Using brain transcriptomic analysis comparing sugar-fed, blood-fed, and starved mosquitoes, several candidate genes potentially responsible for influencing blood-feeding behaviour were identified, including two neuropeptides (short NPF and RYamide) that are known to modulate feeding behaviour in other mosquito species. Using molecular tools, including in situ hybridization, the authors map the distribution of cells producing these neuropeptides in the nervous system and in the gut. Further, by implementing systemic RNA interference (RNAi), the study suggests that both neuropeptides appear to promote blood-feeding (but do not impact sugar feeding), although the impact was observed only after both neuropeptide genes underwent knockdown.</p>
<p>Strengths and/or weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript was well-written; however, the authors should review carefully, as some sections would benefit from restructuring to improve clarity. Some statements need to be rectified as they are factually inaccurate.</p>
<p>Below are specific concerns and clarifications needed in the opinion of this reviewer:</p>
<p>(1) What does &quot;central brains&quot; refer to in abstract and in other sections of the manuscript (including methods and results)? This term is ambiguous, and the authors should more clearly define what specific components of the central nervous system was/were used in their study.</p>
<p>(2) The abstract states that two neuropeptides, sNPF and RYamide are working together, but no evidence is summarized for the latter in this section.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 1</p>
<p>
Panel A: This should include mating events in the reproductive cycle to demonstrate differences in the feeding behavior of Ae. aegypti.</p>
<p>
Panel F: In treatments where insects were not provided either blood or sugar, how is it that some females and males had fed? Also, it is unclear why the y-axis label is % fed when the caption indicates this is a choice assay. Also, it is interesting that sugar-starved females did not increase sugar intake. Is there any explanation for this (was it expected)?</p>
<p>(4) Figure 3</p>
<p>
In the neurotranscriptome analysis of the (central) brain involving the two types of comparisons, can the authors clarify what &quot;excluded in males&quot; refers to? Does this imply that only genes not expressed in males were considered in the analysis? If so, what about co-expressed genes that have a specific function in female feeding behaviour?</p>
<p>(5) Figure 4</p>
<p>
The authors state that there is more efficient knockdown in the head of unfed females; however, this is not accurate since they only get knockdown in unfed animals, and no evidence of any knockdown in fed animals (panel D). This point should be revised in the results test as well. Relatedly, blood-feeding is decreased when both neuropeptide transcripts are targeted compared to uninjected (panel C) but not compared to dsGFP injected (panel E). Why is this the case if authors showed earlier in this figure (panel B) that dsGFP does not impact blood feeding? In addition, do the uninjected and dsGFP-injected relative mRNA expression data reflect combined RYa and sNPF levels? Why is there no variation in these data, and how do transcript levels of RYa and sNPF compare in the brain versus the abdomen (the presentation of data doesn't make this relationship clear).</p>
<p>(6) As an overall comment, the figure captions are far too long and include redundant text presented in the methods and results sections.</p>
<p>(7) Criteria used for identifying neuropeptides promoting blood-feeding: statement that reads &quot;all neuropeptides, since these are known to regulate feeding behaviours&quot;. This is not accurate since not all neuropeptides govern feeding behaviors, while certainly a subset do play a role.</p>
<p>(8) In the section beginning with &quot;Two neuropeptides - sNPF and RYa - showed about 25% and 40% reduced mRNA levels...&quot;, the authors state that there was no change in blood-feeding and later state the opposite. The wording should be clarified as it is unclear.</p>
<p>(9) Just before the conclusions section, the statement that &quot;neuropeptide receptors are often ligand-promiscuous&quot; is unjustified. Indeed, many studies have shown in heterologous systems that high concentrations of structurally related peptides, which are not physiologically relevant, might cross-react and activate a receptor belonging to a different peptide family; however, the natural ligand is often many times more potent (in most cases, orders of magnitude) than structurally related peptides. This is certainly the case for various RYamide and sNPF receptors characterized in various insect species.</p>
<p>(10) Methods</p>
<p>
In the dsRNA-mediated gene knockdown section, the authors could more clearly describe how much dsRNA was injected per target. At the moment, the reader must carry out calculations based on the concentrations provided and the injected volume range provided later in this section.</p>
<p>It is also unclear how tissue-specific knockdown was achieved by performing injection on different days/times. The authors need to explain/support, and justify how temporal differences in injection lead to changes in tissue-specific expression. Does the blood-brain barrier limit knockdown in the brain instead, while leaving expression in the peripheral organs susceptible? For example, in Figure 4, the data support that knockdown in the head/brain is only effective in unfed animals compared to uninjected animals, while there is no evidence of knockdown in the brain relative to dsGFP-injected animals. Comparatively, evidence appears to show stronger evidence of abdominal knockdown mostly for the RYa transcript (&gt;90%) while still significantly for the sNPF transcript (&gt;60%).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript investigates the regulation of host-seeking behavior in Anopheles stephensi females across different life stages and mating states. Through transcriptomic profiling, the authors identify differential gene expression between &quot;blood-hungry&quot; and &quot;blood-sated&quot; states. Two neuropeptides, sNPF and RYamide, are highlighted as potential mediators of host-seeking behavior. RNAi knockdown of these peptides alters host-seeking activity, and their expression is anatomically mapped in the mosquito brain (sNPF and RYamide) and midgut (sNPF only).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study addresses an important question in mosquito biology, with relevance to vector control and disease transmission.</p>
<p>(2) Transcriptomic profiling is used to uncover gene expression changes linked to behavioral states.</p>
<p>(3) The identification of sNPF and RYamide as candidate regulators provides a clear focus for downstream mechanistic work.</p>
<p>(3) RNAi experiments demonstrate that these neuropeptides are necessary for normal host-seeking behavior.</p>
<p>(4) Anatomical localization of neuropeptide expression adds depth to the functional findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The title implies that the neuropeptides promote host-seeking, but sufficiency is not demonstrated (for example, with peptide injection or overexpression experiments).</p>
<p>(2) The proposed model regarding central versus peripheral (gut) peptide action is inconsistently presented and lacks strong experimental support.</p>
<p>(3) Some conclusions appear premature based on the current data and would benefit from additional functional validation.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for flagging the schematic in figure 1F. As suggested, we have removed the “X” markers from the x-axis and revised the axis label from “choice of food” to “choice made” to better reflect what food the mosquitoes chose in the assay. For clarity, we have now also plotted the same data as stacked graphs at the bottom of Fig. 1F, which clearly shows the proportion of mosquitoes fed on each particular choice. We avoid the stacked graph as the sole representation of this data, as it does not capture the variability in the data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I would also like to know more about how the authors achieved tissue-specific knockdown for RNAi experiments. I think this is an intriguing methodology, but I could not figure out from the methods why injections either had whole-body or abdomen-specific knockdown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The tissue-specific knockdown (abdomen only or abdomen+head) emerged from initial standardisations where we were unable to achieve knockdown in the head unless we used higher concentrations of dsRNA and did the injections in older females. We realised that this gave us the opportunity to isolate the neuronal contribution of these neuropeptides in the phenotype produced. Further optimisations revealed that injecting dsRNA into 0-10h old females produced abdomen-specific knockdowns without affecting head expression, whereas injections into 4 days old females resulted in knockdowns in both tissues. Moreover, head knockdowns in older females required higher dsRNA concentrations, with knockdown efficiency correlating with the amount injected. In contrast, abdominal knockdowns in younger females could be achieved even with lower dsRNA amounts.</p>
<p>We have mentioned the knockdown conditions- time of injection and the amount dsRNA injected- for tissue-specific knockdowns in methods but realise now that it does not explain this well enough. We have now edited it to state our methodology more clearly (see lines 932-948).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I also found some interpretations of the transcriptomic to be overly broad for what transcriptomes can actually tell us about the organism's state. For example, the authors mention, &quot;Interestingly, we found that  after a blood meal, glucose is neither spent nor stored, and that the female brain goes into a state of metabolic 'sugar rest', while actively processing proteins (Figure S2B, S3)&quot;.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and agree with them. We have now edited our statement to read:</p>
<p>“Instead, our data suggests altered carbohydrate metabolism  after a blood meal, with the female brain potentially entering a state of metabolic 'sugar rest' while actively processing proteins (Figure S2B, S3). However, physiological measurements of carbohydrate and protein metabolism will be required to confirm whether glucose is indeed neither spent nor stored during this period.” See lines 271-277.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Bansal et al examine and characterize feeding behaviour in Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. While sharing some similarities to the well-studied Aedes aegypti mosquito, the authors demonstrate that mated females, but not unmated (virgin) females, exhibit suppression in their bloodfeeding behaviour. Using brain transcriptomic analysis comparing sugar-fed, blood-fed, and starved mosquitoes, several candidate genes potentially responsible for influencing blood-feeding behaviour were identified, including two neuropeptides (short NPF and RYamide) that are known to modulate feeding behaviour in other mosquito species. Using molecular tools, including in situ hybridization, the authors map the distribution of cells producing these neuropeptides in the nervous system and in the gut. Further, by implementing systemic RNA interference (RNAi), the study suggests that both neuropeptides appear to promote blood-feeding (but do not impact sugar feeding), although the impact was observed only  after both neuropeptide genes underwent knockdown.</p>
<p>Strengths and/or weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript was well-written; however, the authors should review carefully, as some sections would benefit from restructuring to improve clarity. Some statements need to be rectified as they are factually inaccurate.</p>
<p>Below are specific concerns and clarifications needed in the opinion of this reviewer:</p>
<p>(1) What does &quot;central brains&quot; refer to in abstract and in other sections of the manuscript (including methods and results)? This term is ambiguous, and the authors should more clearly define what specific components of the central nervous system was/were used in their study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Central brain, or mid brain, is a commonly used term to refer to brain structures/neuropils without the optic lobes (For example: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07686-5">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07686-5</ext-link>). In this study we have focused our analysis on the central brain circuits involved in modulating blood-feeding behaviour and have therefore excluded the optic lobes. As optic lobes account for nearly half of all the neurons in the mosquito brain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8121336/">https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8121336/</ext-link>), including them would have disproportionately skewed our transcriptomic data toward visual processing pathways.</p>
<p>We have indicated this in figure 3A and in the methods (see lines 800-801, 812). We have now also clarified it in the results section for neuro-transcriptomics to avoid confusion (see lines 236-237).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The abstract states that two neuropeptides, sNPF and RYamide are working together, but no evidence is summarized for the latter in this section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now added a statement “This occurs in the context of the action of <italic>RYa</italic> in the brain” to end of the abstract, for a complete summary of our proposed model.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 1</p>
<p>Panel A: This should include mating events in the reproductive cycle to demonstrate differences in the feeding behavior of Ae. aegypti.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our data suggest that mating can occur at any time between eclosion and oviposition in <italic>An. stephensi</italic> and between eclosion and blood feeding in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. Adding these into (already busy) 1A, would cloud the purpose of the schematic, which is to indicate the time points used in the behavioural assays and transcriptomics.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Panel F: In treatments where insects were not provided either blood or sugar, how is it that some females and males had fed? Also, it is unclear why the y-axis label is % fed when the caption indicates this is a choice assay. Also, it is interesting that sugar-starved females did not increase sugar intake. Is there any explanation for this (was it expected)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologise for the confusion. The experiment is indeed a choice assay in which sugar-starved or sugar-sated females, co-housed with males, were provided simultaneous access to both blood and sugar, and were assessed for the choice made (indicated on the x-axis): both blood and sugar, blood only, sugar only, or neither. The x-axis indicates the choice made by the mosquitoes, not the choice provided in the assay, and the y-axis indicates the percentage of males or females that made each particular choice. We have now removed the “X” markers from the x-axis and revised the axis label from “choice of food” to “choice made” to better reflect what food the mosquitoes chose to take.</p>
<p>In this assay, we scored females only for the presence or absence of each meal type (blood or sugar) and are therefore unable to comment on whether sugar-starved females consumed more sugar than sugarsated females. However, when sugar-starved, a higher proportion of females consumed both blood and sugar, while fewer fed on blood alone.</p>
<p>For clarity, we have now also plotted the same data as stacked graphs at the bottom of Fig. 1F, which clearly shows the proportion of mosquitoes fed on each particular choice. We avoid the stacked graph as the sole representation of this data as it does not capture the variability in the data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 3</p>
<p>In the neurotranscriptome analysis of the (central) brain involving the two types of comparisons, can the authors clarify what &quot;excluded in males&quot; refers to? Does this imply that only genes not expressed in males were considered in the analysis? If so, what about co-expressed genes that have a specific function in female feeding behaviour?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is indeed correct. We reasoned that since blood feeding is exclusive to females, we should focus our analysis on genes that were specifically upregulated in them. As the reviewer points out, it is very likely that genes commonly upregulated in males and females may also promote blood feeding and we will miss out on any such candidates based on our selection criteria.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 4</p>
<p>The authors state that there is more efficient knockdown in the head of unfed females; however, this is not accurate since they only get knockdown in unfed animals, and no evidence of any knockdown in fed animals (panel D). This point should be revised in the results test as well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Perhaps we do not understand the reviewer’s point or there has been a misunderstanding. In figure 4D, we show that while there is more robust gene knockdown in unfed females, blood-fed females also showed modest but measurable knockdowns ranging from 5-40% for <italic>RYamide</italic> and 2-21% for <italic>sNPF</italic>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Relatedly, blood-feeding is decreased when both neuropeptide transcripts are targeted compared to uninjected (panel C) but not compared to dsGFP injected (panel E). Why is this the case if authors showed earlier in this figure (panel B) that dsGFP does not impact blood feeding?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We realise this concern stems from our representation of the data. Since we had earlier determined that <italic>dsGFP</italic>-injected females fed similarly to uninjected females (fig 4B), we used these controls interchangeably in subsequent experiments. To avoid confusion, we have now only used the label ‘control’ in figure 4 (and supplementary figure S9) and specified which control was used for each experiment in the legend.</p>
<p>In addition to this, we wanted to clarify that fig 4C and 4E are independent experiments. 4C is the behaviour corresponding to when the neuropeptides were knocked down in both heads and abdomens.</p>
<p>4E is the behaviour corresponding to when the neuropeptides were knocked down in only the abdomens. We have now added a schematic in the plots to make this clearer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, do the uninjected and dsGFP-injected relative mRNA expression data reflect combined RYa and sNPF levels? Why is there no variation in these data,…</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In these qPCRs, we calculated relative mRNA expression using the delta-delta Ct method (see line 975). For each neuropeptide its respective control was used. For simplicity, we combined the <italic>RYa</italic> and <italic>sNPF</italic> control data into a single representation. The value of this control is invariant because this method sets the control baseline to a value of 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>…and how do transcript levels of RYa and sNPF compare in the brain versus the abdomen (the presentation of data doesn't make this relationship clear).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct in pointing out that we have not clarified this relationship in our current presentation. While we have not performed absolute mRNA quantifications, we extracted relative mRNA levels from qPCR data of 96h old unmanipulated control females. We observed that both <italic>sNPF</italic> and <italic>RYa</italic> transcripts are expressed at much lower levels in the abdomens, as compared to those in the heads, as shown in the graphs inserted below.</p>

<p>(6) As an overall comment, the figure captions are far too long and include redundant text presented in the methods and results sections.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for flagging this and have now edited the legends to remove redundancy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Criteria used for identifying neuropeptides promoting blood-feeding: statement that reads &quot;all neuropeptides, since these are known to regulate feeding behaviours&quot;. This is not accurate since not all neuropeptides govern feeding behaviors, while certainly a subset do play a role.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that not all neuropeptides regulate feeding behaviours. Our statement refers to the screening approach we used: in our shortlist of candidates, we chose to validate <italic>all</italic> neuropeptides.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) In the section beginning with &quot;Two neuropeptides - sNPF and RYa - showed about 25% and 40% reduced mRNA levels...&quot;, the authors state that there was no change in blood-feeding and later state the opposite. The wording should be clarified as it is unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We were referring to an unchanged proportion of the blood fed females. We have now edited the text to the following:</p>
<p>“Two neuropeptides - <italic>sNPF</italic> and <italic>RYa</italic> - showed about 25% and 40% reduced mRNA levels in the heads but the proportion of females that took blood meals remained unchanged”. See lines 338-340.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Just before the conclusions section, the statement that &quot;neuropeptide receptors are often ligand promiscuous&quot; is unjustified. Indeed, many studies have shown in heterologous systems that high concentrations of structurally related peptides, which are not physiologically relevant, might cross-react and activate a receptor belonging to a different peptide family; however, the natural ligand is often many times more potent (in most cases, orders of magnitude) than structurally related peptides. This is certainly the case for various RYamide and sNPF receptors characterized in various insect species.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and apologise for the mistake. We have now removed the statement.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) Methods</p>
<p>In the dsRNA-mediated gene knockdown section, the authors could more clearly describe how much dsRNA was injected per target. At the moment, the reader must carry out calculations based on the concentrations provided and the injected volume range provided later in this section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now edited the section to reflect the amount of dsRNA injected per target. Please see lines 921-931.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is also unclear how tissue-specific knockdown was achieved by performing injection on different days/times. The authors need to explain/support, and justify how temporal differences in injection lead to changes in tissue-specific expression. Does the blood-brain barrier limit knockdown in the brain instead, while leaving expression in the peripheral organs susceptible?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To achieve tissue-specific knockdowns of <italic>sNPF</italic> and <italic>RYa</italic>, we optimised both the time of injection as well as the dsRNA concentration to be injected. Injecting dsRNA into 0-10h females produced abdomen specific knockdowns without affecting head expression, whereas injections into 96h old females resulted in knockdowns in both tissues. Head knockdowns in older females required higher dsRNA concentrations, with knockdown efficiency correlating with the amount injected. In contrast, abdominal knockdowns in younger females could be achieved even with lower dsRNA amounts, reflecting the lower baseline expression of <italic>sNPF</italic> in abdomens compared to heads and the age-dependent increase in head expression (as confirmed by qPCR). It is possible that the blood-brain barrier also limits the dsRNA entering the brain, thereby requiring higher amounts to be injected for head knockdowns.</p>
<p>We have now edited this section to state our methodology more clearly (see lines 932-948).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For example, in Figure 4, the data support that knockdown in the head/brain is only effective in unfed animals compared to uninjected animals, while there is no evidence of knockdown in the brain relative to dsGFP-injected animals. Comparatively, evidence appears to show stronger evidence of abdominal knockdown mostly for the RYa transcript (&gt;90%) while still significantly for the sNPF transcript (&gt;60%).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we explained earlier, this concern likely stems from our representation of the data. Since we had earlier determined that <italic>dsGFP</italic>-injected females fed similarly to uninjected females (fig 4B), we used these controls interchangeably in subsequent experiments. To avoid confusion, we have now only used the label ‘control’ in figure 4 (and supplementary figure S9) and specified which control was used for each experiment in the legend.</p>
<p>In addition to this, we wanted to clarify that fig 4C and 4E are independent experiments. 4C is the behaviour corresponding to when the neuropeptides were knocked down in both heads and abdomens. 4E is the behaviour corresponding to when the neuropeptides were knocked down in only the abdomen. We have now added a schematic in the plots to make this clearer.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript investigates the regulation of host-seeking behavior in Anopheles stephensi females across different life stages and mating states. Through transcriptomic profiling, the authors identify differential gene expression between &quot;blood-hungry&quot; and &quot;blood-sated&quot; states. Two neuropeptides, sNPF and RYamide, are highlighted as potential mediators of host-seeking behavior. RNAi knockdown of these peptides alters host-seeking activity, and their expression is anatomically mapped in the mosquito brain (sNPF and RYamide) and midgut (sNPF only).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study addresses an important question in mosquito biology, with relevance to vector control and disease transmission.</p>
<p>(2) Transcriptomic profiling is used to uncover gene expression changes linked to behavioral states.</p>
<p>(3) The identification of sNPF and RYamide as candidate regulators provides a clear focus for downstream mechanistic work.</p>
<p>(3) RNAi experiments demonstrate that these neuropeptides are necessary for normal host-seeking behavior.</p>
<p>(4) Anatomical localization of neuropeptide expression adds depth to the functional findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The title implies that the neuropeptides promote host-seeking, but sufficiency is not demonstrated (for example, with peptide injection or overexpression experiments).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Demonstrating sufficiency would require injecting sNPF peptide or its agonist. To date, no small-molecule agonists (or antagonists) that selectively mimic sNPF or RYa neuropeptides have been identified in insects. An NPY analogue, TM30335, has been reported to activate the <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> NPY-like receptor 7 (NPYLR7; Duvall et al., 2019), which is also activated by sNPF peptides at higher doses (Liesch et al., 2013). Unfortunately, the compound is no longer available because its manufacturer, 7TM Pharma, has ceased operations. Synthesising the peptides is a possibility that we will explore in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The proposed model regarding central versus peripheral (gut) peptide action is inconsistently presented and lacks strong experimental support.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The best way to address this would be to conduct tissue-specific manipulations, the tools for which are not available in this species. Our approach to achieve head+abdomen and abdomen only knockdown was the closest we could get to achieving tissue specificity and allowed us to confirm that knockdown in the head was necessary for the phenotype. However, as the reviewer points out, this did not allow us to rule out any involvement of the abdomen. This point has been addressed in lines 364-371.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Some conclusions appear premature based on the current data and would benefit from additional functional validation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The most definitive way of demonstrating necessity of <italic>sNPF</italic> and <italic>RYa</italic> in blood feeding would be to generate mutant lines. While we are pursuing this line of experiments, they lie beyond the scope of a revision. In its absence, we relied on the knockdown of the genes using dsRNA. We would like to posit that despite only partial knockdown, mosquitoes do display defects in blood-feeding behaviour, without affecting sugar-feeding. We think this reflects the importance of <italic>sNPF</italic> in promoting blood feeding.</p>

<p>We sincerely apologise for the oversight. We have now incorporated line numbers in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) There are a few statements in the text that I think may need clarification or might be outside the bounds of what was actually studied here. For example, in the introduction &quot;However, mating is dispensable in Anophelines even under conditions of nutritional satiety&quot;. I am uncertain what is meant by this statement - please clarify.</p>

<p>(3) Typo/Grammatical minutiae:</p>
<p>a) A small idiosyncrasy of using hyphens in compound words should also be fixed throughout. Typically, you don't hyphenate if the words are being used as a noun, as in the case: e.g. &quot;Age affects blood feeding.&quot;. However, you would hyphenate if the two words are used as a compound adjective &quot;Age affects blood-feeding behavior&quot;. This may not be an all-inclusive list, but here are some examples where hyphens need to either be removed or added. Some examples:</p>
<p>&quot;Nutritional state also influences other internal state outputs on blood-feeding&quot;: blood-feeding -&gt; blood feeding</p>
<p>&quot;... the modulation of blood-feeding&quot;: blood-feeding -&gt; blood feeding</p>
<p>&quot;For example, whether virgin females take blood-meals...&quot;: blood-meals -&gt; blood meals</p>
<p>&quot;.... how internal and external cues shape meal-choice&quot;-&gt; meal choice</p>
<p>&quot;blood-meal&quot; is often used throughout the text, but is correctly &quot;blood meal&quot; in the figures.</p>
<p>There are many more examples throughout.</p>

<p>We apologise for these errors and appreciate the reviewer’s keen eye. We have now fixed them throughout the manuscript.</p>

<p>We apologise for the typo and thank the reviewer for spotting it. We have now corrected this.</p>

<p>I found re-referencing C and D at the end of their statements makes it look as thought C precedes the &quot;Relative mRNA expression&quot; and on a first read through, I thought the figure captions were backwards. I'd recommend reformating here and throughout consistently to only have the figure letter precede its relevant caption information, e.g.:</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Separately from the clarifications and limitations listed above, the authors could strengthen their study and the conclusions drawn if they could rescue the behavioural phenotype observed following knockdown of sNPF and RYamide. This could be achieved by injection of either sNPF or RYa peptide independently or combined following knockdown to validate the role of these peptides in promoting blood-feeding in An. stephensi. Additionally, the apparent (but unclear) regionalized (or tissue-specific) knockdown of sNPF and RYamide transcripts could be visualized and verified by implementing HCR in situ hyb in knockdown animals (or immunohistochemistry using antibodies specific for these two neuropeptides).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In a follow up of this work, we are generating mutants and peptides for these candidates and are planning to conduct exactly the experiments the reviewer suggests.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The loss-of-function data suggest necessity but not sufficiency. Synthetic peptide injection in non-host seeking (blood-fed mated or juvenile) mosquitoes would provide direct evidence for peptide-induced behavioral activation. The lack of these experiments weakens the central claim of the paper that these neuropeptides directly promote blood feeding.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As noted above, we plan to synthesise the peptide to test rescue in a mutant background and sufficiency.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Some of the claims about knockdown efficiency and interpretation are conflicting; the authors dismiss Hairy and Prp as candidates due to 30-35% knockdown, yet base major conclusions on sNPF and RYamide knockdowns with comparable efficiencies (25-40%). This inconsistency should be addressed, or the justification for different thresholds should be clearly stated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have not defined any specific knockdown efficacy thresholds in the manuscript, as these can vary considerably between genes, and in some cases, even modest reductions can be sufficient to produce detectable phenotypes. For example, knockdown efficiencies of even as low as about 25% - 40% gave us observable phenotypes for <italic>sNPF</italic> and <italic>RYa</italic> RNAi (Figure S9B-G).</p>
<p>No such phenotypes were observed for <italic>Hairy</italic> (30%) or <italic>Prp</italic> (35%) knockdowns. Either these genes are not involved in blood feeding, or the knockdown was not sufficient for these specific genes to induce phenotypes. We cannot distinguish between these scenarios.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The observation that knockdown animals take smaller blood meals is interesting and could reflect a downstream effect of altered host-seeking or an independent physiological change. The relationship between meal size and host-seeking behavior should be clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the reduced meal size observed in <italic>sNPF</italic> and <italic>RYa</italic> knockdown animals could result from their inability to seek a host or due to an independent effect on blood meal intake. Unfortunately, we did not measure host-seeking in these animals. We plan to distinguish between these possibilities using mutants in future work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Several figures are difficult to interpret due to cluttered labeling and poorly distinguishable color schemes. Simplifying these and improving contrast (especially for co-housed vs. virgin conditions) would enhance readability.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We regret that the reviewer found the figures difficult to follow. We have now revised our annotations throughout the manuscript for enhanced readability. For example, “D1<sup>B</sup>” is now “D1<sup>PBM</sup>” (post-bloodmeal) and “D1<sup>O</sup>” is now “D1<sup>PO</sup>” (post-oviposition). Wherever mated females were used, we have now appended “(m)” to the annotations and consistently depicted these females with striped abdomens in all the schematics. We believe these changes will improve clarity and readability.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The manuscript does not clearly justify the use of whole-brain RNA sequencing to identify peptides involved in metabolic or peripheral processes. Given that anticipatory feeding signals are often peripheral, the logic for brain transcriptomics should be explained.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct in pointing out that feeding signals could also emerge from peripheral tissues. Signals from these tissues – in response to both changing nutritional and reproductive states – are then integrated by the central brain to modulate feeding choices. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, increased protein intake is mediated by central brain circuitry including those in the SEZ and central complex (Munch et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2017; Goldschmidt et al., 2023). In the context of mating, male-derived sex peptide further increases protein feeding by acting on a dedicated central brain circuitry (Walker et al., 2015). We, therefore focused on the central brain for our studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The proposed model suggests brain-derived peptides initiate feeding, while gut peptides provide feedback. However, gut-specific knockdowns had no effect, undermining this hypothesis. Conversely, the authors also suggest abdominal involvement based on RNAi results. These contradictions need to be resolved into a consistent model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and recognise their concern. Our reasons for invoking an involvement of the gut were two-fold:</p>
<p>(1) We find increased sNPF transcript expression in the entero-endocrine cells of the midgut in blood-hungry females, which returns to baseline  after a blood-meal (Fig. 4L, M).</p>
<p>(2) While the abdomen-only knockdowns did not affect blood feeding, every effective head knockdown that affected blood feeding also abolished abdominal transcript levels (Fig. S9C, F). (Achieving a head-only reduction proved impossible because (i) systemic dsRNA delivery inevitably reaches the abdomen and (ii) abdominal expression of both peptides is low, leaving little dynamic range for selective manipulation.) Consequently, we can only conclude the following: 1) that brain expression is required for the behaviour, 2) that we cannot exclude a contributory role for gut-derived <italic>sNPF</italic>. We have discussed this in lines 364-371.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The identification of candidate receptors is promising, but the manuscript would be significantly strengthened by testing whether receptor knockdowns phenocopy peptide knockdowns. Without this, it is difficult to conclude that the identified receptors mediate the behavioral effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that functional validation of the receptors would strengthen the evidence for <italic>sNPF</italic> and _RYa_mediated control of blood feeding in <italic>An. stephensi.</italic> We selected these receptors based on sequence homology. A possibility remains that sNPF neuropeptides activate more than one receptor, each modulating a distinct circuit, as shown in the case of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tachykinin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10184743/">https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10184743/</ext-link>). This will mean a systematic characterisation and knockdown of each of them to confirm their role. We are planning these experiments in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors compared the percentage changes in sugar-fed and blood-fed animals under sugar-sated or sugar-starved conditions. Figure 1F should reflect what was discussed in the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Perhaps this concern stems from our representation of the data in figure 1F? We have now edited the xaxis and revised its label from “choice of food” to “choice made” to better reflect what food the mosquitoes chose to take.</p>
<p>For clarity, we have now also plotted the same data as stacked graphs at the bottom of Fig. 1F, which clearly shows the proportion of mosquitoes fed on each particular choice. We avoid the stacked graph as the sole representation of this data because it does not capture the variability in the data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor issues:</p>
<p>(1) The authors used mosquitoes with belly stripes to indicate mated females. To be consistent, the post-oviposition females should also have belly stripes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now edited all the figures as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In the first paragraph on the right column of the second page, the authors state, &quot;Since females took blood-meals regardless of their prior sugar-feeding status and only sugar-feeding was selectively suppressed by prior sugar access.&quot; Just because the well-fed animals ate less than the starved animals does not mean their feeding behavior was suppressed.</p>

<p>Perhaps there has been a misunderstanding in the experimental setup of figure 1F, probably stemming from our data representation. The experiment is a choice assay in which sugar-starved or sugar-sated females, co-housed with males, were provided simultaneous access to both blood and sugar, and were assessed for the choice made (indicated on the x-axis): both blood and sugar, blood only, sugar only, or neither. We scored females only for the presence or absence of each meal type (blood or sugar) and did not quantify the amount consumed.</p>

<p>(3) The figure legend for Figure 1A and the naming convention for different experimental groups are difficult to follow. A simplified or consistently abbreviated scheme would help readers navigate the figures and text.</p>

<p>We regret that the reviewer found the figure difficult to follow. We have now revised our annotations throughout the manuscript for enhanced readability. For example, “D1<sup>B</sup>” is now “D1<sup>PBM</sup>” (post-bloodmeal) and “D1<sup>O</sup>” is now “D1<sup>PO</sup>” (post-oviposition).</p>

<p>(4) In the last paragraph of the Y-maze olfactory assay for host-seeking behaviour in An. stephensi in Methods, the authors state, &quot;When testing blood-fed females, aged-matched sugar-fed females (bloodhungry) were included as positive controls where ever possible, with satisfactory results.&quot; The authors should explicitly describe what the criteria are for &quot;satisfactory results&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologise for the lack of clarity. We have now edited the statement to read:</p>
<p>“When testing blood-fed females, age-matched sugar-fed females (blood-hungry) were included wherever possible as positive controls. These females consistently showed attraction to host cues, as expected.” See lines 786-790.</p>

<p>(5) In the first paragraph of the dsRNA-mediated gene knockdown section in Methods, dsRNA against GFP is used as a negative control for the injection itself, but not for the potential off-target effect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that <italic>dsGFP</italic> injections act as controls only for injection-related behavioural changes, and not for off-target effects of RNAi. We have now corrected the statement. See lines 919-920.</p>
<p>To control for off-target effects, we could have designed multiple dsRNAs targeting different parts of a given gene. We regret not including these controls for potential off-target effects of dsRNAs injected.</p>
