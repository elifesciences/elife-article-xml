<title>Abstract</title><p>Specific character traits of mineralized endoskeletal tissues need to be clearly defined and comprehensively examined among extant chondrichthyans (elasmobranchs, such as sharks and skates, and holocephalans, such as chimaeras) to understand their evolution. For example, tiles of mineralized polygonal structures called tesserae occur at cartilage surfaces in chondrichthyans, but recent studies showing trabecular mineralization at elasmobranch cartilage surfaces suggest that tesserae are not as common as previously thought. Also, while areolar mineralized tissue in elasmobranchs is generally considered a unique, shared chondrichthyan feature, some chondrichthyan species demonstrate bone-like tissues in both a specific region of tesserae termed the cap zone and continuous (not tiled) mineralized neural arches. To clarify the distribution of specific endoskeletal features among extant chondrichthyans, adult skeletal tissues in a holocephalan chimaera (spotted ratfish) and two elasmobranchs (small-spotted catshark and little skate) were characterized using synchrotron radiation and desktop micro-CT imaging, and histological and immunofluorescent assays. Endoskeletal mineralization in the ratfish, catshark, and little skate varied both quantitively in tissue mineral density (TMD), and qualitatively in the morphology and localization of mineralized structures and tissues. For example, TMD of several skeletal elements was significantly lower in ratfish, compared to catshark and little skate. Trabecular and areolar mineralization were shared among these extant chondrichthyan species, but tesserae and bone-like tissues were not. Interestingly, three separate analyses argued that the adult chimaera endoskeleton has features of the embryonic little skate endoskeleton. Generally, this study proposes specific terminology for character states of the extant chondrichthyan endoskeleton and infers those states in ancestral chondrichthyans with reference to fossil data.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The skeleton of chondrichthyans, or cartilaginous fishes, has long fascinated evolutionary biologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Daniel, 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Janvier, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kölliker, 1860</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Maisey, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ørvig, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Smith and Hall, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wurmbach, 1932</xref>). However, only in the past two decades has an active research community revealed the histological and molecular complexity of extant chondrichthyan skeletal tissues. Even so, these studies are limited in scope, focussing mostly on specific skeletal features of the Elasmobranchii subclass of extant Chondrichthyes, such as sharks, skates, and rays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dean et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eames et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Johanson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kemp and Westrin, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Omelon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Porter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Seidel et al., 2016</xref>), with only a few including the Holocephali subclass, such as chimaera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gillis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Herbert et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pears et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Seidel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Smith et al., 2020</xref>). Unfortunately, an in-depth description of the extant holocephalan endoskeleton is lacking, leading to a deficit in understanding skeletal tissue character states across extant chondrichthyans.</p>
<p>Like most vertebrates, skeletal mineralization in extant chondrichthyans occurs by incorporation of biominerals into extracellular compartments of skeletal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Golub, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lowenstam, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Omelon et al., 2014</xref>), giving rise to diverse mineralized tissue types in several anatomical sites of the chondrichthyan endoskeleton (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Traditionally recognized as a defining endoskeletal feature of Chondrichthyes, tesserae form a mineralization pattern consisting of an array of distinct, polygonal units at the surface of cartilages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kemp and Westrin, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Maisey, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Maisey et al., 2021</xref>). In skates, however, a recently characterized trabecular mineralization pattern lies directly underneath the polygonal pattern of tesserae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>). In fact, the cartilage surface in several endoskeletal regions of skates and rays only contains the trabecular mineralization pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jayasankar et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that polygonal tesserae may not be as common as traditionally thought. Like polygonal tesserae, the little skate trabecular mineralization also forms an arrayed pattern, but the repeating units are in the form of trabecular struts interspersed by unmineralized regions, leading us to call them trabecular tesserae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Atake and Eames, 2021</xref>). Descriptions of a trabecular mineralization pattern in the endoskeleton of sharks or chimaeras are currently lacking, leaving open the possibility that this is a phenotype specific to the Batoidea superorder (including skates and rays) of the subclass Elasmobranchii. In some chimaeras, the surfaces of cartilage in the anterior fused vertebrae (synarcual) and chondrocranium have sheets of mineralization that abut one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pears et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Seidel et al., 2020</xref>), but these do not have an arrayed pattern of repeating units, so perhaps they should not be called tesserae.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Recent evidence suggests that histological features of tesserae may vary according to the mineralization pattern. Traditional polygonal tesserae have distinct histological zones, with a cap zone superficial to a body zone near the surface of chondrichthyan cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kemp and Westrin, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Seidel et al., 2016</xref>). While skates have polygonal tesserae, trabecular tesserae in little skate have very small or even absent cap zones overlying extensive body zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, specific regions of tesserae termed spokes are hypermineralized and often devoid of cells, and spokes appear to be a common feature of tesserae regardless of their mineralization pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pears et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Seidel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Seidel et al., 2016</xref>). Careful 3D spatial analyses are needed to correlate histological zones and mineralization patterns of tesserae.</p>
<p>Some chondrichthyans have mineralized endoskeletal tissues that have been characterized as bone-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Atake and Eames, 2021</xref>). For example, the cap zone of tesserae displays bony features, like elongate cell lacunae in a mineralized ECM of densely packed type I collagen (Col1) fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kemp and Westrin, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Seidel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Seidel et al., 2016</xref>). Unlike the cap zone, the body zone displays typical features of hyaline cartilage, which is the main cartilage type in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Goldring et al., 2006</xref>). The body zone consists of round chondrocyte lacunae embedded in a mineralized matrix abundant in loosely packed type II collagen (Col2) fibers and sulfated glycosaminoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Enault et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Seidel et al., 2017</xref>). As another example of bone-like tissue, several elasmobranch species have a non-tiled, mineralized perichondral tissue in their neural arches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bordat, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eames et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kemp and Westrin, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Seidel et al., 2016</xref>). The neural arch bone-like tissue demonstrates morphological and histological features of perichondral bone, including a compact mineralization pattern, elongate cell lacunae, canaliculi-like channels connecting adjacent lacunae, and tightly packed Col1 fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bordat, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eames et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kemp and Westrin, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Peignoux-Deville et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rossert and de Crombrugghe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Seidel et al., 2017</xref>). Bone-like tissues might be a defining feature of extant chondrichthyans, but relevant data from chimaeras are needed.</p>
<p>Finally, areolar mineralized tissue is generally considered a unique feature of the extant chondrichthyan endoskeleton, characterized mostly in elasmobranchs as large sheets of mineralization in the notochordal sheath of the vertebral body (centrum) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Didier, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ridewood and MacBride, 1921</xref>). Areolar mineralized tissue typically contains concentric lamellae of elongate lacunae in a fibrocartilage-like extracellular matrix and a compact mineralization pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Criswell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dean and Summers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eames et al., 2007</xref>). Mineralized centra are not thought to be common in chimaeras, but when present, they can appear as multiple mineralized rings in each vertebral segment, which contrasts with the grossly biconcave morphology of segmented centra in elasmobranchs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gadow and Abbott, 1895</xref>).</p>
<p>With hopes of revealing shared and clade-specific features among chondrichthyans, here we clarify many of the unresolved issues highlighted above, proposing specific terminology for character states of the extant chondrichthyan endoskeleton (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Testing the hypothesis that extant chondrichthyans have homologous histological and morphological traits of endoskeletal mineralized tissues, adult tissues in several endoskeletal regions of the spotted ratfish <italic>Hydrolagus colliei</italic> (chimaera), small-spotted catshark <italic>Scyliorhinus canicula</italic> (shark), and little skate <italic>Leucoraja erinacea</italic> (skate) were characterized using synchrotron radiation and desktop micro-CT imaging, and histological and immunofluorescent assays. Tesseral mineralization, cap zones, and neural arch bone-like tissues were absent in the ratfish, but present in these elasmobranchs. Three separate analyses argued that the endoskeleton of this chimaera displays histological and morphological features of the embryonic little skate endoskeleton. While additional chondrichthyan species can bolster these findings, the data argue that trabecular and areolar mineralization patterns, but not tesserae, are shared among extant chondrichthyans. Considering fossil outgroups, we finish by inferring ancestral and derived character states of the chondrichthyan endoskeleton.</p>

<title>Adult mineralized tissues in spotted ratfish had lower tissue mineral density (TMD) than small-spotted catshark or little skate</title>
<p>To assess whether chimaeras demonstrate skeletal mineralization in anatomical sites that are homologous to those of elasmobranchs, 3D rendering of micro-CT images of anterior regions of adult ratfish were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A,B</xref>). Micro-CT images revealed mineralized tissues in several endoskeletal regions, including neural arches and centra of segmented vertebrae (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C,D</xref>), skeletal elements in the pharyngeal skeleton (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), and the fused vertebral synarcual (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F,G</xref>). Although elasmobranchs mineralize neural arches in their precaudal and caudal vertebrae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eames et al., 2007</xref>), mineralized neural arches were present mainly in precaudal vertebrae of ratfish (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C,D</xref>; data not shown). Mineralized skeletal elements in the pharyngeal skeleton included the basihyal, Meckel’s, ceratohyal, basibranchial, hypobranchials, and ceratobranchial (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Spinal nerve foramina are common in the synarcual of cartilaginous fishes and were present in the ventral sides of the ratfish synarcual (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Claeson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Johanson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pears et al., 2020</xref>). Unlike the synarcual in skates and other batoids, where mineralized centra are not discernible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Claeson, 2011</xref>), the synarcual in ratfish had distinct mineralized centra for its entire length (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p>

<p>TMDs of the synarcual, neural arches, and centra in ratfish, catshark, and little skate were quantitated and compared, where possible, since sharks do not have a synarcual (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). Because little skate does not have centra within the synarcual, centra in the ratfish synarcual were digitally segmented and excluded for synarcual TMD data. The average TMD of the ratfish synarcual was 0.31± 0.11 gHA/cm<sup>3</sup>, significantly lower than the TMD of the little skate synarcual, which was 0.94 ± 0.04 gHA/cm<sup>3</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = 6.5×10<sup>−4</sup>). Similarly, the TMD of ratfish neural arches (0.40 ± 0.05 gHA/cm<sup>3</sup>) was significantly lower than the TMD of neural arches of either catshark (0.81 ± 0.04 gHA/cm<sup>3</sup>; <italic>p</italic> =9 x10<sup>−5</sup>) or little skate (0.96 ± 0.04 gHA/cm<sup>3</sup>; <italic>p</italic> =4.5×10<sup>−10</sup>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>).

<title>Neural arches in ratfish lacked bone-like tissue</title>
<p>To clarify whether chimaeras have bone-like tissue like elasmobranchs, micro-CT and histological analyses of neural arches in segmented precaudal vertebrae of ratfish were compared to neural arches in segmented precaudal vertebrae of catshark and little skate. Mineralization of neural arches in ratfish was organized in a non-continuous pattern of small compact and trabecular regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).

Alcian blue staining of sulfated proteoglycans marked cartilage in most neural arch regions in ratfish, while only the cartilaginous core regions of catshark and little skate neural arches were Alcian blue-positive (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G-I</xref>). The neural arch core in catshark was mostly unmineralized cartilage, while that of little skate was mineralized cartilage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H,I</xref>). Birefringence of picrosirius-stained, tightly packed collagen fibers (likely reticular) were observed in muscles lateral to neural arches in all three species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J-L</xref>). Birefringence was not observed in ratfish neural arches, whereas birefringence in neural arch bone-like tissues was observed in catshark and little skate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K,L</xref>). Most regions (including unmineralized cartilage and mineralized tissue) in ratfish neural arches demonstrated Col2 immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>).

<title>Novel characterization of non-tesseral trabecular mineralization in ratfish and catshark showed the absence of a bone-like cap zone</title>
<p>To clarify whether tesserae are defining endoskeletal features of extant chondrichthyans, morphological patterns and histological features of mineralized tissues were characterized in ceratohyals of ratfish, caudal vertebrae of catshark, and precaudal vertebrae and hyomandibulae of little skate.

However, the trabecular pattern in ratfish and catshark was not as clearly organized into arrays of repeating trabecular units like that of trabecular tesserae in little skate, and for this reason, trabecular patterns in ratfish and catshark were characterized as non-tesseral. In the hyomandibulae and other skeletal elements of little skate, including synarcual, propterygium, and vertebral transverse processes, a trabecular mineralization pattern occurred underneath the superficial polygonal tesseral pattern (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D,H</xref>,H’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>).

<p>To assess whether trabecular mineralized tissues in ratfish, catshark, and little skate exhibit similar histological features, cross sections of tissues with non-tesseral patterns were compared to those with tesseral patterns. Non-tesseral mineralized tissues in Alcian blue-positive perichondral regions in ratfish ceratohyals and catshark haemal arches stained with Alizarin red (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I,J</xref>; perichondrium marked by straight dashed line). The discrete organization of mineralized tissues and Alcian blue and Alizarin red staining patterns of non-tesseral mineralized tissues in ratfish and catshark were similar to the tesseral body zone in little skate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I-L</xref>). However, Alcian blue-positive cartilage separated Alizarin red-positive non-tesseral mineralized tissues from overlying perichondrium in ratfish and catshark (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I,J</xref>). A bone-like cap zone just below the perichondrium was only present in tesseral mineralized tissues in little skate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K,L</xref>; perichondrium marked by straight dashed line). The bone-like cap zone stained more intensely than the body zone with Alizarin red and was relatively smaller and larger in trabecular tesserae and polygonal tesserae, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K,L</xref>). Perichondrium of both non-tesseral and tesseral mineralized tissues stained with the general connective tissue dye fast green (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3M-P</xref>). Matrix of the little skate bone-like cap zone was fast green-positive and had birefringent collagen fibers, but these staining patterns were not observed in non-tesseral mineralized tissues in ratfish and catshark (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3M-T</xref>). Instead, regions just below the perichondrium of ratfish ceratohyals and catshark haemal arches stained for sulfated proteoglycans by Safranin O and were Col2-positive cartilage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3M,N</xref>,Q,R). Staining patterns of non-tesseral mineralized tissues in ratfish and catshark were generally consistent with those of mineralized cartilage in the tesseral body zone of little skate, although chondrocyte lacunae in these regions were not obvious in ratfish (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I-T</xref>). Therefore, histological features of trabecular mineralized tissues in ratfish ceratohyals and catshark haemal arches were similar to only the body zones of tesserae in little skate, which consisted of mineralized cartilage.</p>

<title>Spatial organization of histological features correlated with trabecular and polygonal mineralization patterns</title>
<p>Given that trabecular mineralized tissues typically have small or even absent cap zones, and polygonal tesserae typically have large cap zones, histology and micro-CT segmentation were used to see whether there was a correlation between histological features and mineralization patterns in ratfish and little skate. After demineralization, non-tesseral tissues in ratfish and tesseral tissues in little skate exhibited spokes, which are regions of very low cellularity in the body zone that often appeared as tears or sectioning artifacts and did not stain strongly with any Trichrome dye (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-C</xref>). Non-spoke regions of the body zone stained either slightly blue for collagen fibers with Trichrome’s aniline blue or magenta with Trichrome’s acid fuchsin, and these staining patterns were consistent in non-tesseral and tesseral tissues. Tightly-wound collagen fibers were marked by Trichrome’s acid fuchsin, but only in the larger and smaller cap zones of little skate polygonal and trabecular tesserae, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-C</xref>). Also, the presence of elongate lacunae distinguished the cap zone from other tesseral regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-C</xref>).</p>

(<bold>D-I</bold>) 3D renderings of synchrotron micro-CT data showed that hypermineralized spokes (*, segmented in blue) were in the body zone of ratfish non-tesseral trabeculae (D,G) or little skate trabecular (E,H) or polygonal (F,I) tesserae. Tesseral cap zones could also be segmented clearly (red) in little skate (E,F,H,I). (<bold>J-O</bold>) Segmented 3D renderings demonstrated that spokes in ratfish were patchy in deep (J) or superficial (M) views, while little skate spokes displayed a radiating pattern traversing most of the trabecular patterns in either trabecular (K,N) or polygonal (L,O) tesserae. The smaller cap zone in trabecular tesserae (N) was not laterally extensive enough to display a superficial polygonal pattern like that of polygonal tesserae (O).

<p>Enough histological features were also visible in synchrotron radiation micro-CT renderings (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-F</xref>), making it possible to segment and analyze the spatial correlation between mineralization patterns and histological features, such as cap zone and spokes (red and blue, respectively, in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G-I</xref>). Segmentation of 3D renderings of deep surface views showed that hypermineralized spokes were localized to non-tesseral and tesseral trabecular mineralization patterns in ratfish and little skate, respectively (blue in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J-L</xref>). Unlike the well-organized spokes seen in trabecular patterns of little skate tesserae, spokes in ratfish trabecular mineralized tissues were patchy and less-organized. Therefore, both non-tesseral and tesseral trabecular mineralization patterns correlated with, and appeared to derive from, spokes and non-spoke regions within body zones.</p>
<p>Unlike little skate polygonal tesserae, trabecular mineralized tissues in ratfish and trabecular tesserae in skate both displayed identical trabecular mineralization patterns whether viewed from the superficial or deep surfaces of the cartilage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J,K</xref>,M,N). The smaller cap zones in trabecular tesserae were discernible on the superficial surface, but they were not as laterally extensive as cap zones of polygonal tesserae (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H,I</xref>,N,O). Thus, larger and laterally extensive cap zones appeared to be the reason why polygonal tesserae displayed a superficial polygonal mineralization pattern.</p>

<title>Qualitative and quantitative features of centra in the adult ratfish were similar to those of little skate embryos</title>

To shed light on differences in adult centra morphology, morphological and histological features of centra in a developmental series of little skate were compared to those of adult ratfish. In little skate embryos and hatched juveniles, desktop micro-CT renderings showed mineralization in the centrum and pairs of neural arches, basidorsals, and haemal arches of each vertebral segment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-C</xref>). Expanding upon recent work showing that anterior and posterior segments of somites fuse during skate vertebral development, similar to tetrapods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Criswell and Gillis, 2020</xref>), independent anterior and posterior mineralizations of each interneural appeared to later fuse during development. For example, independent mineralization of the posterior and anterior interneurals were visible in stage 32 little skate embryos, whereas the dorsal and ventral aspects of each appeared fused by stage 33, and they were fully fused in a 6.5cm DW juvenile (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-C</xref>). In adult ratfish, each vertebral segment of paired neural arches and basidorsals had an average of six centra (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Digital segmentation of synchrotron radiation (SR) micro-CT renderings showed that centra in little skate stage 32 embryos were slightly constricted in the middle of each element’s anterior-posterior axis, and the extent of this constriction progressed through 6.5 cm disc width (DW) juveniles, when the classic biconcave morphology was present (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E-G</xref>). SR micro-CT renderings showed that adult ratfish centra were constricted to a similar extent as younger centra in little skate embryos (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E,F</xref>,H).

<p>To further confirm these morphological and histological similarities of centra in little skate embryos and adult ratfish, TMDs of centra in the developmental series of little skate were compared to that of adult ratfish.

In addition, polygonal tesserae are traditionally associated with chondrichthyans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kemp and Westrin, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Maisey, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Marramà et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Seidel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wilga and Ferry, 2015</xref>), but trabecular tesserae were recently characterized in skates and rays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jayasankar et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Two main qualities of this paper go a long way in revealing features of the ancestral chondrichthyan endoskeleton. First, we explicitly identifed discrete character states of extant chondrichthyan endoskeletons (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), helping to unify terminology of important features for the growing chondrichthyan research community. Second, we presented extensive, side-by-side comparative data across various extant chondrichthyans, two elasmobranch species (small-spotted catshark and little skate) and one chimaera/holocephalan (spotted ratfish). Including ratfish is another critical aspect of this paper, because holocephalans are generally understudied, but must be considered when inferring ancestral chondrichthyan traits. Importantly, previous characterization of skeletal mineralization in other adult chimaeridae neither focused on segmented neural arches to analyze bone-like tissues or areolar mineralization, nor clarified histological zones of tesserae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Debiais-Thibaud, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pears et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Seidel et al., 2020</xref>)</p>
<p>Our new data and other published data across various extant and fossil chondrichthyan species can be compiled to compare character states of the extant endoskeleton and infer the ancestral condition (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). In what appears to be a novel character trait of crown chondrichthyans, trabecular mineralization occurs in many endoskeletal regions in several elasmobranch and chimaera species, including some fossil chondrichthyans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Coates et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jayasankar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Maisey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ørvig, 1951</xref>). Among extant chondrichthyans, trabecular mineralization always forms near the surface of cartilage, but the exact mineralization pattern varies. Little skate, along with all other batoids and some selachians examined, have arrayed patterns of discrete trabecular units, similar to the repeating polygonal units of traditional tesserae, supporting their description as trabecular tesserae. On the other hand, a non-arrayed trabecular mineralization pattern, not emphasized in chondrichthyans before, appears to be present in catshark and some other selachians and in ratfish and all other chimaeras examined, including <italic>Callorhinchus milii</italic> and <italic>Chimaera monstrosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pears et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Seidel et al., 2020</xref>). To distinguish this pattern from the regular, arrayed patterns of polygonal and trabecular tesserae, we propose the term “non-tesseral trabecular mineralization”. Given that some fossil chondrichthyans, such as <italic>Gladbachus</italic>, <italic>Climatius</italic>, <italic>Doliodus</italic>, and <italic>Cobelodus</italic>, also appear to display this mineralization pattern in their endoskeletons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Coates et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Maisey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ørvig, 1951</xref>), non-tesseral trabecular mineralization might be a new plesiomorphic (ancestral) character of chondrichthyans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Maisey et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Character states of mineralized tissues in various extant and fossil chondrichthyan species suggest shared and derived features.</title><p>Non-tesseral trabecular mineralization (NTT) is likely a symplesiomorphic (shared ancestral) character of stem and crown chondrichthyans, because it is pervasive in fossil and extant chondrichthyans. Polygonal (PT) and trabecular (TT) tesseral mineralization patterns appear to be absent in extant holocephalans and stem chondrichthyans, but their presence in some extant elasmobranchs and a fossil holocephalan suggest that these tesseral mineralizations are synapomorphic (shared derived) characters of crown chondrichthyans, subsequently lost in extant holocephalans. Areolar (AR) mineralized tissue is present in extant elasmobranchs and holocephalans, but its absence in stem chondrichthyans suggests that it is a synapomorphic character of crown chondrichthyans. The absence of neural arch bone-like tissue (BLT) in holocephalans further supports the conclusion that it is a synapomorphic character of elasmobranchs. The presence of a histological body zone (BZ) in either tesseral or non-tesseral mineralized tissues of stem and crown chondrichthyans suggests that the body zone is a symplesiomorphic character of all chondrichthyans. The histological cap zone (CZ) in some elasmobranchs, along with the inference that polygonal tesserae in a fossil holocephalan means that they had cap zones, suggests that the cap zone is also a synapomorphic character of crown chondrichthyans. 0, 1, andindicate absence, presence, and unknown, respectively, of characters for the listed species.

<p>Bone-like tissues do not appear to be shared among extant chondrichthyans, while areolar mineralization does seem to be shared (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Morphological and histological features of bone-like tissues in neural arches or tesseral cap zones are present in catshark, little skate, and many other elasmobranch species, but absent in ratfish and <italic>C. monstrosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eames et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kemp and Westrin, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Seidel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Seidel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Seidel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wurmbach, 1932</xref>). While these data refute the hypothesis that bone-like tissues generally are a symplesiomorphic (shared ancestral) feature of extant chondrichthyans, they further support the hypothesis that neural arch perichondral bone-like tissue is a synapomorphic (shared derived) character of elasmobranchs, but subsequently lost in several lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Maisey et al., 2021</xref>). On the other hand, similar features of centra are observed in ratfish, catshark, little skate, and many other extant chondrichthyans examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Criswell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dean and Summers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Debiais-Thibaud, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eames et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Porter et al., 2006</xref>). Since most data on areolar mineralization focussed on elasmobranchs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Criswell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eames et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ridewood and MacBride, 1921</xref>), histological features of multiple-ringed centra in other chimaera should be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Didier, 1995</xref>). Stem chondrichthyans did not appear to mineralize their centra, so data from extant chondrichthyans argue that areolar mineralized tissue is likely a synapomorphic character of crown chondrichthyans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Frey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Maisey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Miles, 1970</xref>).</p>
<p>Cap and body zones are histological terms that traditionally describe chondrichthyan tesserae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dean and Summers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kemp and Westrin, 1979</xref>), but data from adult samples of ratfish, catshark, little skate, and several other species argue that the body zone is the only histological zone of endoskeletal mineralization shared by extant chondrichthyans (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Recent histological data of tesserae are few and limited to sharks, skates, and rays, where cap and body zones have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eames et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Enault et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kemp and Westrin, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Seidel et al., 2017</xref>). While birefringent fibers marked the cap zones in both polygonal and trabecular tesserae in little skate, non-tesseral trabeculae in catshark and ratfish did not have discernible cap zones. In contrast to commonly-accepted knowledge, these catshark data suggest that even sharks do not always have the cap zone. Taken alongside recent published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Maisey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pears et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Seidel et al., 2020</xref>), no living species of chimaera likely has cap zones. On the other hand, Safranin O staining and Col2 immunofluorescence showed that histological body zones generated the mineralized endoskeletal cartilage of ratfish, catshark, and little skate. In total, these data suggest that the ancestral stem chondrichthyan generated most of its endoskeletal mineralization with histological body zones, although as the next paragraph highlights, cap zones might have been lost secondarily in chimaera and some shark species.</p>
<p>Digitally segmented 3D regions of micro-CT renderings showed, for the first time, exact spatial correlations between histological zones and mineralization patterns, potentially impacting histological interpretations of fossils. Strikingly, large and laterally extensive cap zones were the basis of the traditional polygonal tesseral mineralization pattern in little skate. Accordingly, similar polygonal tesserae recently described in fossil holocephalans likely have cap zones in addition to body zones and a trabecular tesseral mineralization underlying the polygonal mineralization pattern, and these might have been lost secondarily during holocephalan evolution (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Atake et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pears et al., 2020</xref>). Increased descriptive power from synchrotron imaging of polygonal tesserae in fossil elasmobranchs and holocephalans can clarify this point. Two other correlations were identified here in body zones. First, spokes were located in body zones. Second, spoke and non-spoke regions of the body zone comprised the trabecular mineralization patterns, regardless of whether these were organized as arrayed tesserae or not. Spokes appeared much more spatially organized in polygonal tesserae and trabecular tesserae than in the non-tesseral trabecular mineralization pattern. By extension of the body zone correlation with trabecular mineralization, trabecular mineralization of some fossil elasmobranchs and holocephalans like <italic>Palaeobates polaris</italic> and <italic>Cladoselache</italic> might derive solely from body zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Maisey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ørvig, 1951</xref>). Given such dramatic variation in extant and fossil chondrichthyans, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of tesseral and non-tesseral mineralization patterns is a wide open field of future study.</p>
<p>Finally, three independent features suggested that the adult ratfish endoskeleton shared features of the embryonic little skate endoskeleton. First, tissue mineral density (TMD) was significantly lower in a number of adult ratfish endoskeletal elements, compared to adult catshark and little skate. In fact, the TMD of adult ratfish centra was indistinguishable from the TMD of embryonic little skate centra. Second, in contrast to previous assertions that mineralized centra in chimaeras were unconstricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Didier, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gadow and Abbott, 1895</xref>), micro-CT renderings of ratfish centra showed slight constriction, which was like those of centra in little skate embryos. Third, even histological similarities of centra in little skate embryos and adult ratfish were discovered. Both had elongate cell lacunae organized in concentric lamellae only in the mineralized middle layer of the centrum.</p>
<p>A tantalizing possibility is that the similarities between adult ratfish and embryonic little skate endoskeletons represents the effects of a phenomenon termed paedomorphism, or the derived condition of an adult species retaining embryonic traits of an ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Garstang, 1922</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Liem, 2001</xref>). Given lower TMD in many adult ratfish endoskeletal elements, the ratfish might generally have paedomorphic endoskeletal development, because as mineralized skeletal tissues develop, their TMD tends to increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Forbes, 1976</xref>). The genetic basis for reduced skeletal mineralization in chimaeras should be investigated further, especially since the only published full chondrichthyan genome was from <italic>Callorhinchus milii</italic> (Callorhinchidae) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Venkatesh et al., 2014</xref>), and Callorhinchidae is the only chimaera family, for example, that does not mineralize their centra (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Didier, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gadow and Abbott, 1895</xref>). Our findings on slight constriction of centra in both adult ratfish and embryonic little skate independently supported a previous assertion that the perichordal sheath in adult chimaeras remained at a stage corresponding to that of embryonic elasmobranchs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gadow and Abbott, 1895</xref>). Additional future discoveries, however, would be needed to support the idea that the endoskeleton of ratfish (perhaps even extant holocephalans generally) is paedomorphic with respect to that of the common ancestor of holocephalans and elasmobranchs. First, these traits (lower endoskeletal TMD, slight morphological constriction of centra, and elongated lacunae in the only mineralized (middle) layer of centra) must be present in this last common ancestor. Second, primitive holocephalans must have altered these traits. Hopefully, paleontologists can resolve these issues.</p>
<p>In summary, analyses of extant and fossil data suggest different features of the chondrichthyan endoskeleton appeared (and disappeared) at different times during evolution of this fascinating clade (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The widespread distribution of non-tesseral trabecular mineralization among fossil stem and extant crown chondrichthyans argue that this is a symplesiomorphic chondrichthyan character. Areolar mineralization is widespread among extant chondrichthyan species, but absent in early stem chondrichthyans, suggesting it evolved in a later stem chondrichthyan that gave rise to holocephalans and elasmobranchs. The presence of tesserae in extant elasmobranchs and the fossil holocephalan <italic>Cobelodus</italic> argues that this trait was lost secondarily in extant holocephalans. Bone-like tissues in cap zones or neural arches appears restricted to extant elasmobranchs. Extant species have correlations between the histological body zone and any form of trabecular mineralization on the one hand, and the cap zone and polygonal tesserae on the other. Given these correlations, the body zone might also be symplesiomorphic for all chondrichthyans, while the cap zone might be synapomorphic for crown chondrichthyans, secondarily lost in extant holocephalans.</p>

<p>General comment:</p>
<p>This is a very valuable and unique comparative study. An excellent combination of scanning and histological data from three different species is presented. Obtaining the material for such a comparative study is never trivial. The study presents new data and thus provides the basis for an in-depth discussion about chondrichthyan mineralised skeletal tissues.</p>
<p>Comments on previous revisions:</p>
<p>The manuscript has been revised and improved and can be published. A very nice manuscript, indeed. My only recommendation (point of discussion, not a requirement) would still be to think about the claim of paedomorphosis in a holocephalan.</p>
<p>Within the chondrichthyes, how distant holocephali are in relation to elasmobranchii remains uncertain, holocephali are quite a specialised group. Holocephali are also older than Batoidea and Selachii. As paedomorphosis is a derived character, I imagine it is difficult to establish that development in an extant holocephalan is derived compared to development in elasmobranchii. If this type of development would have been typical for the &quot;older&quot; holocephali it would not be paedomorphic. Also, the uncertainty how distant holocephali are from elasmobranchii makes it difficult to identify paedomorphosis with reference to chondrichthyes.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>It seems as if the main point of the paper is about the new data related to rat fish although your title is describing it as extant cartilaginous fishes and you bounce around between the little skate and ratfish. So here's an opportunity for you to adjust the title to emphasize ratfish is given the fact that leader you describe how this is your significant new data contribution. Either way, the organization of the paper can be adjusted so that the reader can follow along the same order for all sections so that it's very clear for comparative purposes of new data and what they mean. My opinion is that I want to read, for each subheading in the results, about the the ratfish first because this is your most interesting novel data. Then I want to know any confirmation about morphology in little skate. And then I want to know about any gaps you fill with the cat shark. (It is ok if you keep the order of &quot;skate, ratfish, then shark, but I think it undersells the new data).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The main points of the paper are 1) to define terms for chondrichthyan skeletal features in order to unify research questions in the field, and 2) add novel data on how these features might be distributed among chondrichthyan clades. However, we agree with the reviewer that many readers might be more interested in the ratfish data, so we have adjusted the order of presentation to emphasize ratfish throughout the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The imagery and new data availability for ratfish are valuable and may help to determine new phylogenetically informative characters for understanding the evolution of cartilaginous fishes. You also allude to the fossil record.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the nice feedback.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Opportunities:</p>
<p>I am concerned about the statement of ratfish paedomorphism because stage 32 and 33 were not statistically significantly different from one another (figure and prior sentences). So, these ratfish TMDs overlap the range of both 32 and 33. I think you need more specimens and stages to state this definitely based on TMD. What else leads you to think these are paedomorphic? Right now they are different, but it's unclear why. You need more outgroups.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sorry, but we had reported that the TMD of centra from little skate did significantly increase between stage 32 and 33. Supporting our argument that ratfish had features of little skate embryos, TMD of adult ratfish centra was significantly lower than TMD of adult skate centra (Fig1).  Also, it was significantly higher than stage 33 skate centra, but it was statistically indistinguishable from that of stage 33 and juvenile stages of skate centra.  While we do agree that more samples from these and additional groups would bolster these data, we feel they are sufficiently powered to support our conclusions for this current paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Your headings for the results subsection and figures are nice snapshots of your interpretations of the results and I think they would be better repurposed in your abstract, which needs more depth.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included more data summarized in results sub-heading in the abstract as suggested (lines 32-37).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Historical literature is more abundant than what you've listed. Your first sentence describes a long fascination and only goes back to 1990. But there are authors that have had this fascination for centuries and so I think you'll benefit from looking back. Especially because several of them have looked into histology and development of these fishes.</p>
<p>I agree that in the past 15 years or so a lot more work has been done because it can be done using newer technologies and I don't think your list is exhaustive. You need to expand this list and history which will help with your ultimate comparative analysis without you needed to sample too many new data yourself.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added additional recent and older references: Kölliker, 1860; Daniel, 1934; Wurmbach, 1932; Liem, 2001; Arratia et al., 2001.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I'd like to see modifications to figure 7 so that you can add more continuity between the characters, illustrated in figure 7 and the body of the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We address a similar comment from this reviewer in more detail below, hoping that any concerns about continuity have been addressed with inclusion of a summary of proposed characters in a new Table 1, re-writing of the Discussion, and modified Fig7 and re-written Fig7 legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Generally Holocephalans are the outgroup to elasmobranchs - right now they are presented as sister taxa with no ability to indicate derivation. Why isn't the catshark included in this diagram?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While a little unclear exactly what was requested, we restructured the branches to indicate that holocephalans diverged earlier from the ancestors that led to elasmobranchs. Also in response to this comment, we added catshark (<italic>S. canicula</italic>) and little skate (<italic>L. erinacea</italic>) specifically to the character matrix.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the last paragraph of the introduction, you say that &quot;the data argue&quot; and I admit, I am confused. Whose data? Is this a prediction or results or summary of other people's work? Either way, could be clarified to emphasize the contribution you are about to present.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sorry for this lack of clarity, and we have changed the wording in this revision to hopefully avoid this misunderstanding.</p>

<p>This is a very valuable and unique comparative study. An excellent combination of scanning and histological data from three different species is presented.

</disp-quote>
<p>many thanks for the kind words</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I have, however, some comments. Some information is lacking and should be added to the manuscript text. I also suggest changes in the result and the discussion section of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>The reader gets the impression almost no research on chondrichthyan skeletal tissues was done before the 2010 (&quot;last 15 years&quot;, L45). I suggest to correct that and to cite also previous studies on chondrichthyan skeletal tissues, this includes studies from before 1900.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added additional older references, as detailed above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Material and Methods:</p>
<p>Please complete L473-492: Three different Micro-CT scanners were used for three different species? ScyScan 117 for the skate samples. Catshark different scanner, please provide full details. Chimera Scncrotron Scan? Please provide full details for all scanning protocols.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We clarified exact scanners and settings for each micro-CT experiment in the Methods (lines 476-497).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>TMD is established in the same way in all three scanners? Actually not possible. Or, all specimens were scanned with the same scanner to establish TMD? If so please provide the protocol.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, the same scanner was used for TMD comparisons, and we included exact details on how TMD was established and compared with internal controls in the Methods. (lines 486-488)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Please complete L494 ff: Tissue embedding medium and embedding protocol is missing. Specimens have been decalcified, if yes how? Have specimens been sectioned non-decalcified or decalcified?</p>
<p>Please complete L506 ff: Tissue embedding medium and embedding protocol is missing. Description of controls are missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Methods were updated to include these details (lines 500-503).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Results:</p>
<p>L147: It is valuable and interesting to compare the degree of mineralisation in individuals from the three different species. It appears, however, not possible to provide numerical data for Tissue Mineral Density (TMD). First requirement, all specimens must be scanned with the same scanner and the same calibration values. This in not stated in the M&amp;M section. But even if this was the case, all specimens derive from different sample locations and have, been preserved differently. Type of fixation, extension of fixation time in formalin, frozen, unfrozen, conditions of sample storage, age of the samples, and many more parameters, all influence TMD values. Likewise the relative age of the animals (adult is not the same as adult) influences TMD. One must assume different sampling and storage conditions and different types of progression into adulthood. Thus, the observation of different degrees of mineralisation is very interesting but I suggest not to link this observation to numerical values.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These are very good points, but for the following reasons we feel that they were not sufficiently relevant to our study, so the quantitative data for TMD remain scientifically valid and critical for the field moving forward.  Critically, 1) all of the samples used for TMD calculations underwent the same fixation protocols, and 2) most importantly, all samples for TMD were scanned on the same micro-CT scanner using the same calibration phantoms for each scanning session.  Finally, while the exact age of each adult was not specified, we note for Fig1 that clear statistically significant differences in TMD were observed among various skeletal elements from ratfish, shark, and skate.  Indeed, ratfish TMD was considerably lower than TMD reported for a variety of fishes and tetrapods (summarized in our paper about icefish skeletons, who actually have similar TMD to ratfish: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/joa.13537">https://doi.org/10.1111/joa.13537</ext-link>).</p>
<p>In  , however, we added a caveat to the paper’s Methods (lines 466-469), stating that adult ratfish were frozen within 1 or 2 hours of collection from the wild, staying frozen for several years prior to thawing and immediate fixation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Parts of the results are mixed with discussion. Sometimes, a result chapter also needs a few references but this result chapter is full of references.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, we reduced background-style writing and citations in each Results section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Based on different protocols, the staining characteristics of the tissue are analysed. This is very good and provides valuable additional data. The authors should inform the not only about the staining (positive of negative) abut also about the histochemical characters of the staining. L218: &quot;fast green positive&quot; means what? L234: &quot;marked by Trichrome acid fuchsin&quot; means what? And so on, see also L237, L289, L291</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We included more details throughout the Results upon each dye’s first description on what is generally reflected by the specific dyes of the staining protocols. (lines 178, 180, 184, 223, 227, and 243-244)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Please completely remove figure 7, please adjust and severely downsize the discussion related to figure 7. It is very interesting and valuable to compare three species from three different groups of elasmobranchs. Results of this comparison also validate an interesting discussion about possible phylogenetic aspects. This is, however, not the basis for claims about the skeletal tissue organisation of all extinct and extant members of the groups to which the three species belong. The discussion refers to &quot;selected representatives&quot; (L364), but how representative are the selected species? Can there be a extant species that represents the entire large group, all sharks, rays or chimeras? Are the three selected species basal representatives with a generalist life style?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These are good points, and yes, we certainly appreciate that the limited sampling in our data might lead to faulty general conclusions about these clades.  In fact, we stated this limitation clearly in the Introduction (lines 126-128), and we removed “representative” from this revision.  We also replaced general reference to chondrichthyans in the Title by listing the specific species sampled.  However, in the Discussion, we also compare our data with previously published additional species evaluated with similar assays, which confirms the trend that we are concluding.  We look forward to future papers specifically testing the hypotheses generated by our conclusions in this paper, which serves as a benchmark for identifying shared and derived features of the chondrichthyan endoskeleton.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Please completely remove the discussion about paedomorphosis in chimeras (already in the result section). This discussion is based on a wrong idea about the definition of paedomorphosis. Paedomorphosis can occur in members of the same group. Humans have paedormorphic characters within the primates, Ambystoma mexicanum is paedormorphic within the urodeals. Paedomorphosis does not extend to members of different vertebrate branches. That elasmobranchs have a developmental stage that resembles chimera vertebra mineralisation does not define chimera vertebra centra as paedomorphic. Teleost have a herocercal caudal fin anlage during development, that does not mean the heterocercal fins in sturgeons or elasmobranchs are paedomorphic characters.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that discussion of paedomorphosis should apply to members of the same group.  In our paper, we are examining paedomorphosis in a holocephalan, relative to elasmobranch fishes in the same group (Chrondrichthyes), so this is an appropriate application of paedomorphosis.  In response to this comment, we clarified that our statement of paedomorphosis in ratfish was made with respect to elasmobranchs (lines 37-39; 418-420).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>L432-435: In times of Gadow &amp; Abott (1895) science had completely wrong ideas bout the phylogenic position of chondrichthyans within the gnathostomes. It is curious that Gadow &amp; Abott (1895) are being cited in support of the paedomorphosis claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>If paedomorphosis is being examined within Chondrichthyes, such as in our paper and in the Gadow and Abbott paper, then it is an appropriate reference, even if Gadow and Abbott (and many others) got the relative position of Chondrichthyes among other vertebrates incorrect.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The SCPP part of the discussion is unrelated to the data obtained by this study. Kawaki &amp; WEISS (2003) describe a gene family (called SCPP) that control Ca-binding extracellular phosphoproteins in enamel, in bone and dentine, in saliva and in milk. It evolved by gene duplication and differentiation. They date it back to a first enamel matrix protein in conodonts (Reif 2006). Conodonts, a group of enigmatic invertebrates have mineralised structures but these structure are neither bone nor mineralised cartilage. Cat fish (6 % of all vertebrate species) on the other hand, have bone but do not have SCPP genes (Lui et al. 206). Other calcium binding proteins, such as osteocalcin, were initially believed to be required for mineralisation. It turned out that osteocalcin is rather a mineralisation inhibitor, at best it regulates the arrangement collagen fiber bundles. The osteocalcin -/- mouse has fully mineralised bone. As the function of the SCPP gene product for bone formation is unknown, there is no need to discuss SCPP genes. It would perhaps be better to finish the manuscript with summery that focuses on the subject and the methodology of this nice study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We completely agree with the reviewer that many papers claim to associate the functions of SCPP genes with bone formation, or even mineralization generally.  The Science paper with the elephant shark genome made it very popular to associate SCPP genes with bone formation, but we feel that this was a false comparison (for many reasons)!  In response to the reviewer’s comments, however, we removed the SCPP discussion points, moving the previous general sentence about the genetic basis for reduced skeletal mineralization to the end of the previous paragraph (lines 435-439).  We also added another brief Discussion paragraph afterwards, ending as suggested with a summary of our proposed shared and derived chondrichthyan endoskeletal traits (lines 440-453).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Further Strengths and Opportunities:</p>
<p>Your headings for the results subsection and figures are nice snapshots of your interpretations of the results and I think they would be better repurposed in your abstract, which needs more depth. It's a little unusual to try and state an interpretation of results as the heading title in a results section and the figures so it feels out of place. You could also use the headings as the last statement of each section, after you've presented the results. In order I would change these results subheadings to:</p>
<p>Tissue Mineral Density (TMD)</p>
<p>Tissue Properties of Neural Arches</p>
<p>Trabecular mineralization</p>
<p>Cap zone and Body zone Mineralization Patterns</p>
<p>Areolar mineralization</p>
<p>Developmental Variation</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sorry, but we feel that summary Results sub-headings are the best way to effectively communicate to readers the story that the data tell, and this style has been consistently used in our previous publications.  No changes were made.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>You allude to the fossil record and that is great. That said historical literature is more abundant than what you've listed. Your first sentence describes a long fascination and only goes back to 1990. But there are authors that have had this fascination for centuries and so I think you'll benefit from looking back. Especially because several of them have looked into histology of these fishes. You even have one sentence citing Coates et al. 2018, Frey et al., 2019 and ørvig 1951 to talk about the potential that fossils displayed trabecular mineralization. That feels like you are burying the lead and may have actually been part of the story for where you came up with your hypothesis in the beginning... or the next step in future research. I feel like this is really worth spending some more time on in the intro and/or the discussion.</p>

<p>We’ve added older REFs as pointed out above.  Regarding fossil evidence for trabecular mineralization, no, those studies did not lead to our research question.  But after we discovered how widespread trabecular mineralization was in extant samples, we consulted these papers, which did not focus on the mineralization patterns per se, but certainly led us to emphasize how those patterns fit in the context of chondrichthyan evolution, which is how we discussed them.</p>

<p>I agree that in the past 15 years or so a lot more work has been done because it can be done using newer technologies. That said there's a lot more work by Mason Dean's lab starting in 2010 that you should take a look at related to tesserae structure... they're looking at additional taxa than what you did as well. It will be valuable for than you to be able to make any sort of phylogenetic inference as part of your discussion and enhance the info your present in figure 7. Go further back in time... For example:</p>
<p>de Beer, G. R. 1932. On the skeleton of the hyoid arch in rays and skates. Quarterly</p>
<p>Journal of Microscopical Science. 75: 307-319, pls. 19-21.</p>
<p>de Beer, G. R. 1937. The Development of the Vertebrate Skull. The University Press,Oxford.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, we have read all of Mason’s work, citing 9 of his papers, and where possible, we have incorporated their data on different species into our Discussion and Fig7.  Thanks for the de Beer REFs.  While they contain histology of developing chondrichthyan elements, they appear to refer principally to gross anatomical features, so were not included in our Intro/Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Most sections with in the results, read more like a discussion than a presentation of the new data and you jump directly into using an argument of those data too early. Go back in and remove the references or save those paragraphs for the discussion section. Particularly because this journal has you skip the method section until the end, I think it's important to set up this section with a little bit more brevity and conciseness.  For instance, in the first section about tissue mineral density, change that subheading to just say tissue mineral density. Then you can go into the presentation of what you see in the ratfish, and then what you see in the little skate, and then that's it. You save the discussion about what other elasmobranch's or mineralizing their neural arches, etc. for another section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We dramatically reduced background-style writing and citations in each Results section (other than the first section of minor points about general features of the ratfish, compared to catshark and little skate), keeping only a few to briefly remind the general reader of the context of these skeletal features.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I like that your first sentence in the paragraph is describing why you are doing. a particular method and comparison because it shows me (the reader) where you're sampling from. Something else is that maybe as part of the first figure rather than having just each with the graph have a small sketch for little skate and catch shark to show where you sampled from for comparative purposes. That would relate back, then to clarifying other figures as well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>done (also adding a phylogenetic tree).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Second instance is your section on trabecular mineralization. This has so many references in it. It does not read like results at all. It looks like a discussion. However, the trabecular mineralization is one of the most interesting aspect of this paper, and how you are describing it as a unique feature. I really just want a very clear description of what the definition of this trabecular mineralization is going to be.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In addition to adding Table 1 to define each proposed endoskeletal character state, we have changed the structure of this section and hope it better communicates our novel trabecular mineralization results.  We also moved the topic of trabecular mineralization to the first detailed Discussion point (lines 347-363) to better emphasize this specific topic.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Carry this reformatting through for all subsections of the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, we significantly reduced background-style writing and citations in each Results section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I'd like to see modifications to figure 7 so that you can add more continuity between the characters, illustrated in figure 7 and the body of the text. I think you can give the characters a number so that you can actually refer to them in each subsection of the results. They can even be numbered sequentially so that they are presented in a standard character matrix format, that future researchers can add directly to their own character matrices. You could actually turn it into a separate table so it doesn't taking up that entire space of the figure, because there need to be additional taxa referred to on the diagram. Namely, you don't have any out groups in figure 7 so it's hard to describe any state specifically as ancestral and wor derived. Generally Holocephalans are the outgroup to elasmobranchs - right now they are presented as sister taxa with no ability to indicate derivation. Why isn't the catshark included in this diagram?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The character matrix is a fantastic idea, and we should have included it in the first place!  We created Table 1 summarizing the traits and terminology at the end of the Introduction, also adding the character matrix in Fig7 as suggested, including specific fossil and extant species.  For the Fig7 branching and catshark inclusion, please see above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>You can repurpose the figure captions as narrative body text. Use less narrative in the figure captions. These are your results actually, so move that text to the results section as a way to truncate and get to the point faster.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>By figure captions, we assume the reviewer refers to figure legends.  We like to explain figures to some degree of sufficiency in the legends, since some people do not read the main text and simply skim a manuscript’s abstract, figures, and figure legends.  That said, we did reduce the wording, as requested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>More specific comments about semantics are listed here:</p>
<p>The abstract starts negative and doesn't state a question although one is referenced. Potential revision - &quot;Comprehensive examination of mineralized endoskeletal tissues warranted further exploration to understand the diversity of chondrichthyans... Evidence suggests for instance that trabecular structures are not common, however, this may be due to sampling (bring up fossil record.) We expand our understanding by characterizing the skate, cat shark, and ratfish... (Then add your current headings of the results section to the abstract, because those are the relevant takeaways.)&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We re-wrote much of the abstract, hoping that the points come across more effectively.  For example, we started with “Specific character traits of mineralized endoskeletal tissues need to be clearly defined and comprehensively examined among extant chondrichthyans (elasmobranchs, such as sharks and skates, and holocephalans, such as chimaeras) to understand their evolution”.  We also stated an objective for the experiments presented in the paper: “To clarify the distribution of specific endoskeletal features among extant chondrichthyans”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the last paragraph of the introduction, you say that &quot;the data argue&quot; and I admit, I am confused. Whose data? Is this a prediction or results or summary of other people's work? Either way, could be clarified to emphasize the contribution you are about to present.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sorry for this lack of clarity, and we have changed the wording in this revision to hopefully avoid this misunderstanding.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the second paragraph of the TMD section, you mention the synarcual comparison. I'm not sure I follow. These are results, not methods. Tell me what you are comparing directly. The non-centrum part of the synarcual separate from the centrum? They both have both parts... did you mean the comparison of those both to the cat shark? Just be specific about which taxon, which region, and which density. No need to go into reasons why you chose those regions here.. Put into methods and discussion for interpretation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We hope that we have now clarified wording of that section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Label the spokes somehow either in caption or on figure direction. I think I see it as part of figure 4E, I, and J, but maybe I'm misinterpreting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based upon histological features (e.g., regions of very low cellularity with Trichrome unstained matrix) and hypermineralization, spokes in Fig4 are labelled with * and segmented in blue.  We detailed how spokes were identified in main text (lines 241-243; 252-254) and figure legend (lines 597-603).</p>
