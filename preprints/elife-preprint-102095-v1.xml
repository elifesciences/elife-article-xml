<title>Abstract</title><p>The microstructure of cells within human cerebral cortex varies across the cortical ribbon, where changes in cytoarchitecture and myeloarchitecture are thought to endow each region of cortex with its unique function. While fine-scale relative to a cell, these changes at population level impact architectural properties of cortex measurable in vivo by noninvasive MRI, such as the thickness and myelin content of cortex. This raises the question of whether or not we can use these in vivo architectural measures to understand cortical organization, function, and development more broadly. Using human visual cortex as a test bed, we demonstrated two architectural gradients, one in which cytoarchitecture and myeloarchitecture converge and another in which they diverge. These two gradients underlie the structural and functional topography of visual cortex, even predicting the presence of new visual field maps. Moreover, the two gradients show distinct visual behavior relevance and lifespan trajectory. These findings provide a more general framework for understanding human cortex, showing that architectural gradients are a measurable fingerprint of functional organization and ontogenetic routines in the human brain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A fundamental goal of brain science is to elucidate the functional properties of the structural elements of the brain, at an appropriate organizational scale. Classical architectural brain maps including cytoarchitectonic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and myeloarchitectonic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> maps, derived from postmortem brain sections, have revealed strong correspondence with the functional properties of the cerebral cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Recent observations of spatial gradients in gene expression across human cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, especially in genes controlling the shape and distribution of dendrites and myelin, also suggest that functional differences across cortex are linked to broad changes in architectural properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. However, these architectural maps are often examined in isolation, lacking interrogation across different maps and individuals. It remains uncertain whether any common or distinct patterns exist among these maps, and if they can offer more reliable and sensitive indicators of functional, behavioral, and developmental relevance. Technological advances in MRI have made it possible to map architectural correlates in human cortex in a noninvasive and individual-specific way, and to test whether any key architectural features of the cortex reflect its functional organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Leveraging the field’s deep understanding of functional organization of visual cortex relative to cortical folding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, we focus here on visual cortex as a test bed to understand how the architectural patterns of the cortical mantle relates to changes in function. More explicitly, to what extent individuals demonstrate shared architectural features of visual cortex which could be derived from multiple kind of architectural measurements; and how might these structural patterns differ in development and capture differences in visual function and behavior?<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Answering such a question would require a large-scale, multimodal MRI dataset to appropriately capture the architectural variations at the level of the population. To that end, we combine three datasets from the Lifespan Human Connectome Project (HCP) which together sample the human lifespan from 5 to 100 years of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, and ask if there are shared motifs in architectural features of cortex across individuals and development. Based on T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) images, we produce for each individual two distinct maps: a map of cortical thickness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and a map of the T1w/T2w signal ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. While the thickness map is thought to be attributable to the organization of neuronal, glial, and neuropil tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, the ratio map is thought to be sensitive to the density of myelinated and neurite structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, which we refer to more broadly as tissue density. In the case of visual cortex, general trends along the cardinal axes have been observed in architectural features such as myelination and cortical thickness in adults and infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, as well as functional properties of neurons such as receptive field size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> and temporal sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. A model explicitly linking these architectural and functional variations across the cerebrum, one that can generalize to yet-mapped regions of cortex as well as explain behavior and dynamics across the lifespan, would be a steppingstone towards bridging structural and functional properties of the living human brain.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>Results</title>
<p>To extract the latent spatial patterns underlying cortical architecture across both properties and individuals, the thickness and tissue density maps from each hemisphere are concatenated across individuals to perform a spatial principal component analysis (PCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> in which participants are features and cortical vertices are samples. As a result, the concatenated maps were linearly decomposed into a collection of orthogonal principal components, consisting of spatial maps (i.e., scores) and individual weights (i.e., loadings) in pairs. The former explains how the architectural properties change across the cortical sheet on each component and the latter describes how individuals’ maps contribute to each component (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). The resulting first two principal components (PCs) describe over 50% of architectural variance across the cortical sheet (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). Because they are very similar for the two hemispheres (Figure S1), only data from the right hemisphere are presented here for clarity. The contributions of thickness and tissue density indicate that each PC relied on an integration of the two architectural measures at a given spatial location (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>), rather than a single feature, thus revealing architectural patterns of visual cortex (i.e., score maps) not visible through a single measure alone (Figure S2).</p>

</fig>
<p>Given the strong inter-individual correlations within cortical thickness and tissue density maps, along with the notable anti-correlation between these two sets of architectural maps (Figure S3a), it is anticipated that the first two PCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>) would capture the convergent and divergent patterns between group average maps of cortical thickness and tissue density. We confirmed this by performing a correlation analysis between PC1 and convergent pattern (thickness map + inversed tissue density map), and between PC2 and divergent pattern (thickness map - inversed tissue density map). As illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>, the converging/diverging maps of the group average thickness and inversed density maps are highly correlated with the PC1/2 maps (both rs = 0.997, ps &lt;0.001). This indicates that the PCs have a straightforward and intuitive interpretation. Specifically, PC1 effectively captures the convergence of cortical thickness and tissue density (i.e., how they vary together), while PC2 represents the spatial divergence from this commonality.</p>
<p>Looking into the spatial topography of the two PCs, both PC1 and PC2 maps form spatial gradients whose values change smoothly as one traverses the cortical surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). Specifically, gradient 1 (i.e., PC1 map), shows an increase in value as one travels from the fundus of the calcarine sulcus either dorsally towards the intraparietal sulcus or ventrally into the anterior temporal lobe. Higher PC1 vertex values correspond to lower tissue density and a thicker cortical sheet (Figure S3b). Interestingly, gradient 2 demonstrates an alternating pattern that fluctuates across cortex. Positive (negative) PC2 scores correspond to higher (lower) thickness or tissue density than expected from PC1 (Figure S3b). Gradient 2 seems to be broadly organized into four distinct zones, mirroring the visual cortex’s division from early visual field maps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> into the ventral, lateral, and dorsal processing streams of the visual cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Quantitatively, the distribution of values for gradient 1 shift across the four processing streams while the value distributions of gradient 2 are evenly sampled within each processing stream (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>). Furthermore, gradient 2 exhibits a higher spatial frequency in the distribution of its values. That is, for a given pair of vertices separated by a short distance, gradient 2 tends to show a larger difference in values compared to the more spatially homogenous gradient 1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref>). It should be noted that maps of cortical thickness had any variance explainable by curvature removed to account for known thickness differences between gyri and sulci, ruling out the possibility that the alternating architectural pattern was caused by the folding of the underlying cortical sheet. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that gradient 1 acts as a global gradient enveloping the entire visual cortex, while gradient 2 acts as a local gradient specific to individual visual streams.</p>
<p>To get a deeper understanding of the shape of these topographies, we produced simulated models using cortical geometry for the two spatial gradients. For gradient 1, the calcarine sulcus was used as the fiducial line, and vertices of the cortical surface were assigned values based on their minimal geodesic distance to the calcarine sulcus. This simple simulation was able to capture 57.1% of the explainable variance in the topography of gradient 1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1h</xref>, left), similar to prior distance-based models of this well-known gradient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Gradient 2, which was more complicated in shape, could nonetheless be simulated using anchor points positioned at local minima within each visual processing stream (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1h</xref>, right), and vertices of the cortical surface were assigned values based on their minimal geodesic distance to these anchor points. This map of geometric distance also captured a sizeable portion of the variance (17.7%) within the gradient 2 map. These simulation results again highlight the global and local characteristics of the two gradients.</p>
<p>Given that gradient 1 values show smooth changes as one travels from early to high-level visual cortex, we hypothesize that it will recapitulate the hierarchical organization of functional features across visual cortex. To test this, we examined the spatial similarity between the architectural gradients and the population receptive field (pRF) properties as measured by the HCP 7T retinotopy dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. The pRF represents the portion of visual space in which a stimulus evokes a response in a given voxel, and pRF size increases along the visual processing hierarchy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. We found that gradient 1 was highly correlated with pRF size (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>) and the known ranking of visual field maps across cortex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>), while gradient 2 was not. Strikingly, gradient 1 explains functional features of visual cortex (receptive field size, hierarchical rank) better than the gradient derived from resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) within visual cortex (Figure S4a-c). Further evidence for this hypothesis can be found when examining temporal properties of visual cortex function. It is widely recognized that the frequency at which the BOLD signal fluctuates during resting-state functional MRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> is different in distinct regions of cortex. This temporal property of the BOLD signal, quantified as a fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, correlates well with temporal properties of receptive fields in visual cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Here, we find that this temporal gradient as measured by fALFF is well-described by gradient 1 in a simple regression analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>The functional and microstructural properties of the two architectural gradients.</title>
<p><bold>(a)</bold> Gradient 1 was highly correlated with the pRF size (r=0.66), while the gradient 2 was not (r=0.03). <bold>(b)</bold> Gradient 1 was perfectly correlated with the hierarchical rank of the 10 visual areas within the ventral visual stream (Spearman rank ρ=1.00), while gradient 2 was not. <bold>(c)</bold> The functional significance of the architectural gradients was evaluated by measuring to what extent each gradient is related to areal differentiation of the visual cortex (left) and the global functional organization measured by fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) from resting-state fMRI (right). The combination of gradients 1 and 2 greatly improved the predictive power of classifying visual areas compared to using either gradient alone. However, gradient 1 contributes more than gradient 2 in predicting the global-scale functional organization (i.e., fALFF map). <bold>(d)</bold> Cell body density from the BigBrain dataset is quantified for each cortical layer at each vertex and correlated with each gradient map. Gradient 1 was mainly correlated with cell body density in Layers III and IV, while gradient 2 was mainly correlated with cell body density in Layer I. <bold>(e)</bold> The architectural gradient 2 predicts the presence of novel visual field maps in the anterior temporal lobe.

Shaded regions represent bootstrapped 68% confidence intervals.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Thus, the convergence relationship between cortical thickness and density across visual cortex appears related to broad changes in functional features. In contrast, gradient 2 appears to act more locally, showing greater spatial inhomogeneity with interdigitating peaks and valleys of scores within individual visual streams. We hypothesized that these local deviations from the canonical thickness and density of cortex underlie the finer-scale division of visual cortex into categorically distinct regions. That is, does the arealization of cortex into distinct regions involve these regions becoming more distinct from a prototypical cortical sheet (i.e., gradient 1)? To test this, we hypothesize that gradient 2, when combined with gradient 1, will improve the differentiation of cortical regions as defined by the HCP multimodal parcellation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Through a classifier-based analysis, regional classification was significantly higher when gradient 2 is combined with gradient 1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). Additionally, the two architectural gradients outperform the first two gradients derived from resting-state functional MRI in a similar classification approach (Figure S4d).</p>
<p>Lastly, if the two architectural gradients truly relate to the functional organization of visual cortex in distinct ways, then these differences should be mirrored in the way cytoarchitecture contributes to each structural gradient. Based on the BigBrain dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, we extracted cell body density data for each of the six cortical layers to produce six structural maps projected onto the cortical surface. For gradient 1, we find that changes in its structural features correlate strongly with cell density of layers III and IV, where the pronunciation of layer IV decreases with increasing distance from the calcarine sulcus. Gradient 2 was most correlated with cell density of layer I, with positive scores overlapping cortex with thicker superficial layers of cortex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). Because layers III and IV are primarily involved in feedforward connections whereas layer I plays a predominant role in feedback projections, this finding might suggest that gradient 2 is a structural fingerprint of differential feedback connectivity in visual cortex.</p>
<p>Given the relatively tight correspondence between these architectural gradients and the functional organization of visual cortex, can this structural-functional coupling generalize to regions of visual cortex that have not yet been mapped? Upon examination of the topology of gradient 2, a pattern emerges between the gradient and retinotopic representations. While most of the anchor points for the gradient 2 map simulation correspond to visual field map clusters which share a foveal representation (V1-V4, VO1-2, IPS0-1, IPS2-3, TO1-2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, one additional anchor appeared in the anterior temporal lobe near the location where the occipitotemporal sulcus (OTS) merges with the collateral sulcus (CoS) more medially (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d,h</xref>). If we assume a correspondence between gradient 2 anchors and visual field map clusters, then this anterior-most anchor would suggest an additional cluster of visual field maps in the anterior temporal lobe, one which has not yet been described in the literature. To test this hypothesis, and potentially demonstrate the predictive power of these architectural gradients to unmapped cortex, we performed pRF mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> on 12 participants with high-contrast, socio-ecological images to better drive neurons of high-level visual cortex often tuned for such complex objects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We indeed find a cluster of visual field maps in the anterior temporal lobe located medially overlapping the CoS and extending laterally towards the OTS usually just beyond the anterior tip of the fusiform gyrus but sometimes overlapping it (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>). This location is consistent with a previous report of face-selectivity in the anterior temporal lobe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> and is located within perirhinal cortex and approximately located at the border between Brodmann areas 35 and 36<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. These maps were observable in the majority of hemispheres (23/24 hemispheres; see Figure S5). This cluster of maps shows a clear radial representation of pRF eccentricity, with voxels near the center of the cluster sampling central visual space, and those near the outer boundary of the cluster sampling peripheral visual space. Perpendicular to this radial eccentricity representation was a representation of polar angle, with two upper visual field representations separated by a shared lower visual field representation, usually oriented at an oblique angle to the CoS but sometimes parallel with it (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e,f</xref>). Consistent with spatial computations in earlier visual field maps, these anterior temporal maps, which we call here AT-1 and AT-2, have pRF centers that mainly sample the contralateral visual field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, although it was not uncommon for pRF centers to sample ipsilateral visual space (Figure S5). Lastly, a hallmark feature of visual pRFs is that they increase in size as one ascends the visual processing hierarchy, and the positive relationship between pRF eccentricity and size tends to become more dramatic as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. To test this, we extract pRF fits from vertices with variance explained greater than 10%. We find that consistent with its high position within the processing hierarchy, pRF sizes are significantly larger than in earlier visual field maps V1 through V3, and the linear function relating pRF eccentricity and size yielded larger slopes compared to V1-V3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref>).</p>
<p>If these architectural gradients are capable of extrapolating to functional representations in visual cortex, to what extent can they also describe the behaviors supported by visual cortex? In addition to providing spatial maps of scores, the PCA provides a weight or sense of fit describing how a given participant relates to a given gradient. To answer the question above, a canonical correlation analysis (CCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> was performed to examine how individual participant weights for the two gradients can predict the individual behavioral performance from 15 vision-related behavioral tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>, both gradients show significant correlation with visual ability. However, in comparison to the architectural convergence pattern (gradient 1), the divergence pattern (gradient 2) demonstrates a stronger correlation with visual behaviors. Moreover, the two gradients are associated with distinct and unrelated behavioral profiles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>): Behavioral variables related to attention, visual acuity and inhibitory control are more closely associated with gradient 1, while vocabulary comprehension, fluid intelligence, spatial orientation processing ability, and nonverbal episodic memory ability are more strongly linked to the gradient 2. The distinct behavioral mapping profiles of the convergence and divergence gradients further underscore each architectural gradient’s unique contribution to brain function and highlighting the cognitive importance of the architectural gradients.</p>

<p>If these architectural gradients across the cortical sheet correspond to differences in cortical tissue content, brain function, and behavior, as evidenced above, then they should also change across the lifespan, given that behavior and neocortical tissue structure develop dramatically during childhood across visual cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. The two spatial gradients described above were derived from the young adult dataset (HCP-YA). We can therefore repeat the spatial component analysis at various stages of the lifespan. We can ask if the first two principal gradients replicate in these separate stages, and determine how they may change, if at all, across the lifespan using HCP development (HCP-D) and aging (HCP-A) datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. We binned participants in equal-sized windows of increasing age, deriving within each window the top PCs and correlating their score maps with that from the young adult dataset. To distinguish the PCs of each age window from the PCs of the young adult dataset, we referred those derived from developmental age-bins as lifespan components (LC). We found that LC1 and LC2 from the developmental (n = 652 participants, 351 females, ages 5-21), adult (n = 1070, 586 females, ages 22-37), and aging (n = 725 participants, 406 females, ages 36-100) data at every age bin show a high correspondence to gradient 1 and gradient 2 from the young adult data respectively, compared to other LCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>). This demonstrates that the two gradients derived from lifespan data at each window replicate those of the young adult dataset, allowing us to trace their developmental trajectories.</p>
<p>Examining the correlation between the young adult gradient and LC within each developmental window, we first found that LCs, as expected, are stable during young adulthood (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>, middle). However, we found a linear change across childhood, with the topography of LC1 and LC2 becoming more adult-like with maturation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>, left). The trajectory of each LC was unique. LC2 showed a significantly larger developmental effect than LC1, with an annualized rate of change (AROC) four times that of LC1(0.86% vs. 0.20%). Finally, if gradients solidify their structural topography across childhood and adolescence, do they show degeneration in later adulthood? We can make two a priori hypotheses here: first, that both LCs will show linear loss of their adult-like topographies and second, that LC2 will show more rapid degeneration than LC1, consistent with the developmental retrogenesis trends observed in white matter development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. The sliding-window gradient analysis on the aging dataset revealed that both hypotheses are supported, LC1 and LC2 both show linear loss of their topographies with LC2 (AROC: −0.17%) showing more dramatic degeneration than LC1 (AROC: −0.04%) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>, right).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Overall, we provide evidence for two architectural gradients across human visual cortex, each of which captures a distinct relationship between the thickness and tissue density of the cortical sheet. While the first gradient captures a relationship in which thickness and density measures vary in agreement with one another, the second captures a relationship in which these two features diverge from one another. The convergence map of cortical thickness and tissue density scaffolds the cortex into a processing hierarchy, while the divergence map between these features appears to contribute to the finer-scale arealization of the cortex into distinct regions. These two architectural gradients together describe well the broader functional landscape and seem to relate to unique aspects of cytoarchitecture across cortex. Where the first gradient correlates strongly with pRF size of the visual system, and is capable of ranking regions into their ground-truth hierarchical ordering, the second gradient appears to differentiate visual cortex into distinct zones within a hierarchical level. The second gradient not only predicted the location of a new cluster of visual field maps, but demonstrated more dynamic changes across the lifespan which may correlate with visual behavior development.</p>
<p>These data would suggest that gradient 2 tracks the functional differentiation of visual cortex into unique regions, wherein regions occupying the same hierarchical level within gradient 1 show distinct values in gradient 2. The current data offer strong evidence in this regard through two separate observations. First, adding the divergent gradient into a classifier along with the convergent gradient significantly improved classification performance of cortical region labels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). Second, cortical regions where divergent gradient scores transitioned from positive to negative values appeared to be spatially related to the location of shared foveal representations in visual field map clusters. By showing that a novel set of visual field maps could be observed in perirhinal cortex where such a transition zone existed in the structural measures of the divergent gradient, provides strong empirical evidence for the predictive power of these structural metrics on the functional topography of the brain. These new visual field maps also provide greater context for previous observations of a face-selective region in the anterior temporal lobe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, which may neighbor or overlap these novel AT field maps. This relationship would be consistent with previous work showing that face-selective regions on the fusiform gyrus neighbor foveal representations of nearby visual field map clusters in more posterior portions of ventral occipitotemporal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Given that gradient 2 shows the strongest relationship to behavior and tracks developmental changes across the lifespan, it might suggest that the differential development between cortical regions during childhood more strongly drives maturation of visual behavior, compared to global structural changes. Indeed, previous work has shown that divergent developmental trajectories between category-selective regions of high-level visual cortex underlies behavioral maturation of high-level visual abilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> and that a disruption in this differential structural development may underlie disorders of high-level vision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Future work can examine if functional arealization at earlier developmental timepoints, as in infancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, follows this prediction.</p>
<p>Likewise, our results hold implications for understanding human neurodevelopment. The nearly mirror symmetric development and degeneration of these architectural gradients between childhood and later adulthood offer strong evidence that gradient 2 follows the pattern of retrogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> across the lifespan. It is presently unclear if the changes in cortical tissue during childhood that drive the developmental emergence of gradient 2 are the same tissue compartments which degenerate later in life (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>). Indeed, while our current analyses focus on cortex, the expanse of visual cortex described here is innervated by several major white matter pathways such as the vertical occipital<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, the inferior longitudinal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, and the arcuate fasciculi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, all of whose development has been shown to be behaviorally relevant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Therefore, the extent to which these architectural changes reflect local tissue structure versus connectomic features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> should be clarified in future work. Furthermore, while gradient 1 described a prototypical relationship between the thickness and density of tissue in the cortical sheet, gradient 2 captures how these two features diverge from this canonical relationship and exhibits greater behavioral relevance across a range of visual behaviors. This might suggest that the patterning of cortex into distinct cortical regions necessitates deviation from a canonical cortical sheet, reminiscent of the protocortex hypothesis of gestational neurodevelopment in which largely similar progenitor cells in the primordial cortex differentiate as a result of distinct thalamic inputs across cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. The morphological changes during gestation that lead to arealization of cortex into distinct regions are certainly distinct from the childhood structural measures quantified here through MRI, but may nonetheless suggest that the ontogenetic routines which serve to differentiate cortex into cytoarchitectonically distinct zones during gestation likely have long-term influences on the postnatal development observed here.</p>
<p>These findings offer evidence that there are architectural gradients, measurable with MRI, that are shared across individuals. These shared patterns of cortical sheet morphology track the functional organization and computations of the underlying cortical sheet across the human lifespan. These findings provide a normative benchmark for future work examining how deviations from these shared mesoscale architectural patterns underlie neurological disorders.</p>

<p>The publicly available data from the HCP Young Adult (HCP-YA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>, Development (HCP-D) and Aging (HCP-A)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> were used in the study. The three large-scale brain imaging studies collect behavioral and multi-modal MRI data in healthy participants from 5 to 100 years of age, and thus provide us with opportunities to characterize brain changes across the human lifespans. Only structural MRI, resting-state fMRI and behavioral data were used in the study. The use and analyses were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Beijing Normal University (No. ICBIR_A_0111_001) and Princeton University (No. 13074).</p>
<p>After excluding participants with invalid MSM-All registration and those without any resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data, we obtained multi-modal MRI and behavioral data for 1070 HCP-YA participants (586 females, ages 22-37, S1200 release). For each participant, T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) structural images (0.7mm isotropic voxels) and functional images (2mm isotropic voxels; TR=720ms) were acquired on the HCP’s customized 3-Tesla Siemens Skyra scanner using a 32-channel head coil. The rs-fMRI paradigm included two sessions, each session itself including two runs with opposite phase-encoding directions (R/L and L/R, each 15 minutes long).

Cortical thickness was measured as the shortest distance between each vertex on the white matter surface and the pial surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, while cortical tissue density was measured by the ratio of T1w to T2w<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.

The PCs are sorted in decreasing order according to the amount of variance explained by each of the component.

<p>For the two sets of individual weights (i.e., myelin/neurite density weights and cortical thickness weights) associated with each of architectural gradient, we carried out a single integrated multivariate analysis using canonical correlation analysis (CCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, to simultaneously co-analyze the two sets of gradients along with 15 behavioral variables from all participants. CCA aims to identify symmetric linear relations between the two sets of variables. That is, we used CCA to find components that relate the two sets of weights from each gradient to 15 sets of participants’ behavioral measures. Each CCA component identifies a linear combination of two weights and a linear combination of behavioral variables, where the variation in strength of involvement across participants is maximally correlated. The normalized magnitude of behavioral weights, obtained by dividing each squared behavioral weight by the total sum of all squared weights, was used to characterize the behavioral profile of an architectural gradient and reveal how the two gradients are different in predicting the same set of behavioral variables.</p>

<title>The development of the architectural gradients across the lifespan</title>
<p>We divided HCP-D, HCP-YA, and HCP-A participants into different age windows (subgroups) in ascending order of age. Among them, the participants of HCP-D and HCP-A were sorted by their age in months, while HCP-YA sorted in years because no month information was provided. Each window consisted of 50 participants and had a step size of ten. As a result, there are 61, 103, and 68 age windows generated for HCP-D, HCP-YA, and HCP-A data, respectively. To characterize the changes of the architectural gradients across the human lifespan, we conducted PCA on the stacked tissue density and thickness maps of each window as we did in the whole HCP-YA data. We label the principal components from each age window as lifespan components (LC) to differentiate them from the original PCs derived from the HCP-YA dataset. To determine if the observed LCs were similar to the PCs from the HCP-YA data, we calculated the Pearson’s correlation coefficients between the HCP-YA PCs and the top ten LCs for each window. The LC which shows strongest correlation with a PC was considered to be the correspondence LC to the PC in that age window. Lastly, how the observed gradients from each age window change relative to the gradient from the HCP-YA was measured by the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between their score maps. The changes along age were then charted (i.e., developmental trajectories). A linear model was then constructed to characterize the developmental trajectory within each of three datasets. The slope of the linear model was defined as the annualized rate of change (AROC) in the architectural gradients.</p>

<p>This study provides a <bold>valuable</bold> perspective on visual cortex architecture by identifying two cortical gradients that change across the lifespan and have distinct functional and structural features. The first gradient captures well-mapped variations in cortical thickness and myelination markers from early sensory to higher-order cortex, while the second gradient shows divergence in these measures with a more localized structure, notably predicting a previously unknown cluster of visual field maps in the anterior temporal lobe. The large-scale lifespan data are <bold>compelling</bold>, but the evidence overall is <bold>incomplete</bold> with key questions around methodical checks and implementation, the standard of evidence for the new visual maps, and how the gradient model relates to sharp tissue boundaries parcellating the cortex.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript uses large-scale existing datasets that span almost the full range of human life (5-100 years) to identify two distinct architectural cortical gradients within the visual cortex. These gradients are distinct: in one, cytoarchitecture and myeloarchitecture converge and in the other, they diverge. The authors tested whether these gradients mapped onto known functional properties of the visual cortex, as well as accounting for visual behaviours that are impacted throughout the lifespan. The manuscript also reports the identification of a hitherto unknown cluster of visual field maps in the anterior temporal lobe.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A major strength of the current manuscript is the use of large-scale measurements of human brain structure throughout the lifespan, courtesy of the Human Connectome Project Initiative. The scope of this cross-sectional analysis would be rare, if not impossible to achieve through an individual project.</p>
<p>The approach employed holds promise for assessing the link between large-scale anatomical gradients in the brain and functional/behavioural properties. The current manuscript focuses on the visual cortex but the approach could easily be implemented across the brain in general.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the evidence in favour of the two gradients largely supports the claims, the evidence for a new visual field map cluster in the anterior temporal lobe falls short of the level used historically when identifying visual field maps in the visual cortex and is, at present, not convincing.</p>
<p>More specifically, the progressions of polar angle within the putative anterior lobe cluster are highly variable across subjects. Few subjects have convincing polar angle reversals at either the horizontal or vertical meridians. In other cases, a putative border is shown that spans different polar angles, which does not align with the accepted definitions for visual field maps in the cortex.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors used large MRI data sets of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and also conducted additional pRF analyses to describe the structural architecture of the human visual cortex in reference to its functional features. By conducting a PCA, they identify 2 components that explain around 50% of the variance, the driven by a positive co-variance between cortical thickness and T1/T2 ratio, the second by their negative co-variance. The first PC spans most early visual cortex and hence shows a relation to pRF size when taking both early and late visual areas into account. The second is more variable in location and does not relate to pRF size or visual hierarchy. The relationship between these two gradients to cell body density using the BigBrain is explored.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors make an attempt to describe the overall architectural features of the cortex and link it to features of functional representations, and the underlying histology, using different sets of datasets and methods, including histology. They highlight that investigating the structural architecture of the cortex provides important information on their intrinsic organization and common features.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The neurobiological model does not take into consideration present knowledge about the microstructural organization of the visual system. This limits the way the results are interpreted correctly. Critical information on the layer-specific myeloarchitecture and cytoarchitecture (and their relation to cortical thickness), as explored for example by Sereno et al. 2013 Cereb Cortex, is missing. There is no information given with respect to how different visual areas differ in their microstructural profile. It is also not mentioned that cortical parcellation is indeed characterized by sharp boundaries between areas, rather than structural gradients, so it remains unclear why focusing on a gradient is of interest. The authors cite the parcellation atlas by Glasser et al. 2016, but do not discuss the rationale of this publication, which was not the definition of gradients, but the definition of sharp boundaries for cortex parcellation. Indeed (as explained below), the results of the authors seem to a large extent to be driven by cortex parcellation, but instead of acknowledging this fact, the authors write (line 179) that &quot;we hypothesize that these local deviations from the canonical thickness and density of cortex underlie the finer-scale division of visual cortex into categorically distinct regions. That is, does the realization of the cortex into distinct regions involve these regions becoming more distinct from a prototypical cortical sheet (i.e., gradient 1)?&quot; - While the first sentence is reasonable, the second sentence is pure speculation ignoring present knowledge on cortical parcellation of this area according to which there is no &quot;prototypical cortical sheet&quot;, but each area has its distinct microstructural profile.</p>
<p>Instead of building on present, detailed knowledge of brain anatomy and in-vivo cortex parcellation of the visual system and its known relation to visual maps, the authors focus on two metrics of cortex architecture (mean T1/T1 over depth and cortical thickness), and conduct a PCA to explore their shared variance. It needs to be clarified if the PCA was conducted correctly. There is no mention of standardizing the variables, which could bias the results. In addition, in a PCA, all possible features are categorized as vector components, and those are scanned through the samples, hence, one such analysis per vertex. But the authors write &quot;in which participants are features and cortical vertices are samples&quot; and &quot;the thickness and tissue density maps were concatenated&quot;. This needs clarification. The architecture of the PCA should be visualized better.</p>
<p>Because the PCA only contains two features, PC1 is driven by the positive relationship between cortical thickness and mean T1/T2, whereas PC2 is driven by their negative relationship. Because in the early visual cortex, cortical thickness and mean T1/T2 correlate positively, it naturally follows that PC1 relates to pRF size (but mediated by the actual cortex parcellation). However, it is unclear why this insight is interesting. I also do not share the view that &quot;these findings demonstrate that gradient 1 acts as a global gradient enveloping the entire visual cortex (...) while gradient 2 acts as a local gradient specific to individual visual streams&quot;. I think this relationship between cortical thickness and T1/T2 ratio does not have much to do with local and global gradients. But if so, stronger arguments as to why this should be the case should be presented.</p>
<p>What the authors make of this result (particularly the discussion starting line 366) is not clear to me. I cannot follow the line of argumentation, which in my view is too far away from the data.</p>
