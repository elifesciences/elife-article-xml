<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion channel that plays a vital role in water and ion secretion on epithelial surfaces. Loss of function in CFTR causes the life-threatening disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The functionally open state of CFTR has so far eluded detailed structural characterization. Although multiple near-atomic resolution structures of CFTR have been solved under conditions that promote channel opening, they all lack a continuous ion conduction pathway. In recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, structural fluctuations of human CFTR in a hydrated lipid bilayer led to the observation of transient Cl<sup>-</sup> conducting states, but the stability and conduction properties of these putative open states were not established. Here, we conduct massively repeated simulations initiated from these Cl<sup>-</sup> permeable conformations. Reproducible structural relaxation of the pore leads to a stable open conformation featuring five symmetrically arranged pore-lining helices. Unlike previously reported structures, this novel penta-helical arrangement reproduces experimentally determined properties of the open pore, including a Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance close to that measured at physiological voltages. Together, our results support the validity of this newly identified pore conformation as a model of the fully open channel. Detailed analysis highlights the role of cationic pore-lining residues in the Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation mechanism and suggests that the kinks observed in several transmembrane helices play a role in channel gating.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>CFTR is an anion channel that facilitates water and ion secretion from the cells of epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berger et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Riordan et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Saint-Criq and Gray, 2017</xref>). It is vital for the healthy function of exocrine organs in respiratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Smith et al., 1996</xref>), digestive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ishiguro et al., 2009</xref>), and reproductive systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Loss of function in CFTR causes cystic fibrosis, a devastating genetic disease that shortens life expectancy primarily due to its deleterious impact on lung health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Elborn, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Smith et al., 1996</xref>). Over the past three decades, CFTR has been extensively studied with the aim of understanding the molecular pathology of cystic fibrosis – from its folding and processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bose et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Lukacs and Verkman, 2012</xref>) to gating and ion conduction mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hwang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Linsdell, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though CFTR functions as an ion channel, it belongs to the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters – specifically, the ABCC exporter subfamily with type IV transmembrane fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dassa and Bouige, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ikuma and Welsh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Thomas et al., 2020</xref>). Like other ABCC proteins, CFTR consists of two transmembrane domains (TMDs), which form a gated pore in the membrane, and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) which bind and hydrolyze ATP during gating. In addition, CFTR possesses a disordered R-domain that becomes phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) before the channel undergoes ATP-dependent gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cheng et al., 1991</xref>). During gating, ATP binding promotes dimerization of the NBDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ikuma and Welsh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Levring et al., 2023</xref>); as a result, two ATP-binding sites are formed at the interface between the NBDs: a catalytic site and a degenerate site which are differentiated by their ability to hydrolyze ATP. Once it has been stabilized by bound ATP, the dimerization of NBDs promotes conformational changes in the TMDs and opening of the gate. Subsequent hydrolysis of ATP at the catalytic site ultimately results in the separation of the NBDs and closure of the gate.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, invaluable structural insights into the functional states of the gating cycle have been gained. Near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structures have been determined for the unphosphorylated, ATP-free state, as well as for the phosphorylated, ATP-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Fiedorczuk and Chen, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Liu et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zhang and Chen, 2016</xref>). The folded domains of CFTR can be regarded as consisting of two half-channels, each of which consists of one NBD, four TM helices from a TMD, and two crossover TM helices from the other TMD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) – namely, half-channel 1 (TM helices 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 11 and NBD1) and half-channel 2 (TM helices 7, 8, 9, 12, 4, 5 and NBD2). Chloride ions enter the channel cavity through a lateral portal between the two half-channels. A bottleneck region, sometimes referred to in the literature as the channel gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gao and Hwang, 2015</xref>) or selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gao and Hwang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Levring and Chen, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Linsdell, 2016</xref>), separates the lumen of the channel (inner vestibule) from the extracellular space (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The structures provide insights into the mechanism of channel activation via phosphorylation. Comparison of cryo-EM maps for unphosphorylated and phosphorylated CFTR revealed that, upon phosphorylation, the R-domain is disengaged from the two half-channels, allowing ATP-induced NBD dimerization to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zhang and Chen, 2016</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Although more than ten near-atomic resolution (&lt; 4 Å) cryo-EM structures of NBD-dimerized CFTR have been determined to this date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Fiedorczuk et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Fiedorczuk and Chen, 2022a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">2017</xref>), none of them appear to provide an open pathway for Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation – a defining feature of the open state. In these structures, the channel appears closed at the bottleneck despite its activation by phosphorylation, ATP and, in some cases, activity enhancing drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Fiedorczuk and Chen, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">2017</xref>). Whether these phosphorylated, ATP-bound structures represent the functional open state has been elusive and somewhat contentious. On the one hand, some of these structures were proposed to represent the <italic>bona fide</italic> open state of the channel as they could narrowly accommodate fully dehydrated Cl<sup>-</sup> ions in the gate region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Levring and Chen, 2024</xref>). However, this hypothesis disregards the high dehydration penalty of Cl<sup>-</sup> and the fact that CFTR is also permeable to anions larger than Cl<sup>-</sup>, both of which considerations suggest that the pore bottleneck is significantly wider in the open state than in existing experimentally derived structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Linsdell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998</xref>). Accordingly, these ATP-bound structures have also been called “near-open” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Linsdell, 2018</xref>) or “quasi-open” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Simon and Csanády, 2021</xref>), implying that they closely resemble, but do not represent, the truly functional open state of CFTR. Uncertainties regarding the physiological relevance of structural models have been raised in studies of other ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dämgen and Biggin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Deng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gonzalez-Gutierrez et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, there is evidence that the transmembrane solvent environment (lipids vs detergents) during structural determination can affect the structure of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dalal et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Deng et al., 2020</xref>). The use of detergents has been suggested to explain the observed closed-pore structures of CFTR despite the activating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cottrill et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The above considerations raise the possibility that the near-open state may spontaneously relax to the open state in a lipid bilayer—a rationale that has been exploited successfully in MD simulation studies of other ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amaral et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cerdan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chakrabarti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Shrivastava and Sansom, 2000</xref>) and motivated two recent computational studies of CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Farkas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zeng et al., 2023</xref>). In simulations of the near-open state of zebrafish CFTR, a structure highly similar to that of human CFTR, embedded in a lipid bilayer, the radius of the pore bottleneck was only wide enough to allow Cl<sup>-</sup> passage transiently, with no spontaneous Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation event observed on a sub-microsecond time scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Farkas et al., 2020</xref>). Using an enhanced sampling technique to help Cl<sup>-</sup> ions overcome the energy barrier in the bottleneck, two divergent Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation pathways were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Farkas et al., 2020</xref>). In the other study, repeated μs-long simulations of the putative near-open state of human CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zeng et al., 2023</xref>) led to the observation of rare and transient Cl<sup>-</sup> conducting bursts: in two out of ten simulations, a total of 17 Cl<sup>-</sup> ions traversed the pore bottleneck in the presence of a strong TM voltage of -500 mV. Three distinct exit pathways were observed. Consistent with hydrophobic gating from a closed (dry or de-wetted) to a putative open (hydrated or wetted) state, these permeation bursts were accompanied by structural fluctuations of pore-lining TM helices leading to widening and wetting of the pore bottleneck.</p>
<p>These two simulation studies afford insight into the mechanism of Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation that goes beyond the ion pathway inferred from static structures of CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Farkas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zeng et al., 2023</xref>). Consistent with the assumption that the latter are nearly open, the second study demonstrates that conformational fluctuations in the sub-microsecond time scale can lead to gate opening and ion permeation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zeng et al., 2023</xref>). However, this result was obtained under an artificially high TM voltage, raising the question of whether the true open state of CFTR was attained. Indeed, the transient nature of the conduction bursts observed suggests that further structural relaxation may be required to reach a stable, fully open state that can support Cl<sup>-</sup> currents at physiological voltages.</p>
<p>Here, we aim to elucidate the functional open state structure of human CFTR by building upon that previous study. To overcome sampling limitations, we performed hundreds of µs-long MD simulations extended from Cl<sup>-</sup> permeable conformations of ATP-bound, NBD-dimerized human CFTR obtained previously. Over a total sampling time of 719 µs and across a broad range of voltage, further structural relaxation of the channel involving the reproducible rearrangement of helices in the outer region of the TMD led to a stable conformation featuring five symmetrically arranged pore-lining helices. This novel arrangement satisfies experimentally determined properties of the open pore, including Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance, and likely represents a valid model of fully open human CFTR under physiological conditions. The Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation mechanism and implications for channel gating are analyzed and discussed.</p>

<title>A novel, penta-helical pore conformation</title>
<p>We performed 719 replicates of microsecond-long unrestrained MD simulations of ATP-bound, NBD-dimerized human CFTR, most of which were initiated from Cl<sup>-</sup> permeable conformations obtained in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zeng et al., 2023</xref>). The overall structure of the protein remained stable, with an average RMSD &lt; 2 Å for Cα atoms in the TM region (Figure 2 – figure supplement 1). The NBDs remained dimerized and the fluctuation of TM helices in the plane of the inner leaflet was limited (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, the amplitude of structural fluctuations in the plane of the outer leaflet, which hosts the extracellular end of the pore, was noticeably larger (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Remarkably, while the planar distribution of most TM helices relative to the rest of the helical bundle was essentially unimodal, both TM1 and TM11 sampled bimodal distributions, with one state closer to the TM helical bundle (“in”) and the other ∼4 Å farther away (“out”) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A and C</xref>). The two states were sampled in nearly equal proportions by both helices (in:out ratio of 54:46 for TM1; 60:40 for TM11). Transitions between the two states of TM1 and TM11 were also well sampled, occurring in 240 and 328 out of 719 trajectories, respectively. Importantly, the positions of TM1 and 11 were anti-correlated, in that as TM1 moved away from the centre of the pore, TM11 moved towards it, resulting in a symmetrical pentagonal pore lined by TM helices 1, 6, 8, 11, and 12 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C and D</xref>). The anti-correlation of TM1 and 11 positions is confirmed by principal component analysis (PCA) of the spatial coordinates of TM helices, which reveals that four conformational states, labelled α to δ, were sampled in our simulations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The first principal component (PC1), which accounts for 25% of structural fluctuations in the conformational ensemble, captures the collective movements of TM helices 1, 2 and 11 leading to the symmetrical pentagonal pore or α state (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B and C</xref>, Figure 3 – figure supplement 2). In contrast, PC2, which accounts for 8% of structural fluctuations, captures comparatively more subtle movements of TM helices, as both β and γ states are characterized by a “squeezed” arrangement of pore-lining helices (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B and D</xref>). This squeezed arrangement also dominates in the δ state, which includes the near-open cryo-EM structure (PDB: 6MSM) and occupies a location intermediate between the other three conformational states (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A and B</xref>). To gauge the stability of the four conformational states, we analyzed the time evolution of their fractional population by considering all 719 MD trajectories in parallel. While the populations of α, β, and γ either increased or remained stable, the population of state δ decreased over the 1-µs simulation time, confirming that the cryo-EM structure is a metastable intermediate state in a lipid bilayer environment (Figure 3 – figure supplement 1).</p>

<p>Among all states sampled, the structure of state α is the most compatible with the open state of human CFTR. As a result of the symmetric arrangement of the five pore-lining helices, the radius of the pore bottleneck was larger by 0.5∼1 Å compared to the other states (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, Figure 4 – figure supplement 1). Notably, α is the only state featuring TM11 as a pore-lining helix due to the movement of this helix towards the centre of the pore. Such movement brings TM11 closer to TM6 and away from TM12, consistent with cross-linking experiments suggesting the close proximity of bottleneck-lining residues of TM6 and TM11 in the open state (Fig. 4 – figure supplement 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Wang and Linsdell, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the solvent-accessible surface areas (SASA) of bottleneck-lining residues T1115 and S1118 from TM11 are both greater compared to states β-δ, consistent with experimental findings that these residues are accessible to aqueous reagents in the open state (Fig. 4 – figure supplement 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fatehi and Linsdell, 2009</xref>). Overall, state α exhibits experimentally demonstrated features of the open pore, indicating that it most likely represents the open state of CFTR compared to the existing cryo-EM structures as well as all the other TM conformational states sampled in our simulations.</p>

<title>Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation pathway</title>
<p>In our previous study of human CFTR, Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation events occurred in 2 out of 10 microsecond-long MD simulations carried out at -500 mV TM voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zeng et al., 2023</xref>). We identified three distinct Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation pathways through the pore bottleneck: the “1-6” and “1-12” pathways, in which Cl<sup>-</sup> ions exited through lateral openings between the extracellular ends of TM helices 1 &amp; 6 and 1 &amp; 12, respectively; and the “intermediate” pathway, in which Cl<sup>-</sup> ions travelled along a straight path in between the other two pathways (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A and B</xref>). It was also found that the pathway taken by permeating Cl<sup>-</sup> ions depended on minor differences in the structure and arrangement of pore-lining helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zeng et al., 2023</xref>). Remarkably, only one of these two simulations briefly sampled putative open state α. Moreover, in addition to α, Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation events also occurred in states γ and δ, from which some Cl<sup>-</sup> permeable snapshots served as starting configurations for the extended simulations in the present study (Figure 5 – figure supplement 1). Due to the small number of permeation events, the relative importance of the three permeation pathways as well as the corresponding pore structures could not be determined from the previous study. Our current simulation set contains more than 2000 Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation events, amongst which all three permeation pathways were sampled. However, the pathway taken by Cl<sup>-</sup> ions is strongly influenced by the conformation of the channel pore (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Whereas virtually all Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation followed the 1-6 pathway in states β and γ, all three permeation pathways were sampled in both α and δ. Note that the enlarged pore bottleneck in state α allowed permeant Cl<sup>-</sup> ions to occupy the region that previously separated the intermediate and 1-12 pathways, blurring the boundary between them (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A and B</xref>). As such, the intermediate and 1-12 pathways shall henceforth be collectively referred to as the “central” pathway.</p>

<p>Despite the abundance of hydrophobic residues in the bottleneck region (-5 &lt; <italic>z</italic> &lt; 5 Å), permeant Cl<sup>-</sup> ions are partially solvated by polar and charged residues, including S341, T338, R334, Y914, Y917 and S1118 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, Figure 6 -- figure supplement 1). Direct binding to pore residues is responsible for the partial dehydration of Cl<sup>-</sup> ions, which lose 1 to 3 water molecules out of an average of 7.3 ± 0.8 from their first solvation shell in bulk water (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D and E</xref>). Remarkably, in ∼15% of permeation events, the sidechains of non-polar residues lining the bottleneck, such as F337, also formed direct contacts with Cl<sup>-</sup> ions and disrupted their solvation shell. Experimental studies have shown that mutations at residues R334, F337, T338, and Y914 affect the relative permeability among anions according to their hydration free energy – the greater the dehydration cost, the less permeable the ion, a mechanism known as lyotropic selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Levring and Chen, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Linsdell et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Negoda et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, these findings support the role of these residues in partial dehydration of Cl<sup>-</sup> ions in the rate limiting step of permeation. Because these residues appear to line the 1-6 pathway in the cryo-EM structure, this pathway was recently suggested to be the only Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Levring and Chen, 2024</xref>). As noted above, it was proposed that the existing “near-open” cryo-EM structures in fact represent the functional open state of the channel, whereby fully dehydrated Cl<sup>-</sup> ions pass through the 1-6 pathway without requiring further pore widening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Levring and Chen, 2024</xref>). Our findings challenge this proposed picture of Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation in two respects. First, following TM movements, the bottleneck region of the pore expands, which allows Cl<sup>-</sup> ions to permeate through two diverging pathways instead of a single pathway. Second, permeant Cl<sup>-</sup> ions only ever undergo partial dehydration, regardless of which pathway (1-6 or central) is taken (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D and E</xref>, Figure 6 – figure supplement 1).</p>

<title>Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance</title>
<p>From numerous Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation events at different TM voltages, we next evaluate the Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance of the channel. To quantify the Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance of states α–γ, we partitioned the simulation trajectories by state and computed the Cl<sup>-</sup> current in terms of the number of translocation events over time spent in each state at different voltages. Across all negative TM voltages, the putative open state α is most permeable to Cl<sup>-</sup> ions, exhibiting a Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance of 3±1 pS, a value approaching the range of 6∼10 pS measured experimentally at physiological voltages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Sheppard and Welsh, 1999</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, states β-δ showed almost no Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance at low negative TM voltages (-100 &lt; <italic>U</italic> &lt; 0 mV) and only produced Cl<sup>-</sup> currents lower than state α at high negative voltages, suggesting that they are unlikely to be functional open states. At positive TM voltages, however, all four states virtually lost the ability to conduct Cl<sup>-</sup> ions (e.g. 0.5±1 pS for state α at 0 &lt; <italic>U</italic> &lt; +100 mV). This result is at odds with the linear IV relationship across all voltages, from negative to positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Sheppard and Welsh, 1999</xref>). Although some studies have reported minor inward rectification at positive voltages for the wild-type channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cai et al., 2003</xref>), the rectification of IV-curves computed from our MD simulations is much stronger.</p>

<p>To explain the observed low conductance and strong inward rectification compared to experiment, we examined factors influencing Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation. Chloride ions traversing the bottleneck region made frequent direct contact with positively charged R334. Notably, the sidechain of R334 can adopt two distinct conformations differing by 6 Å in the axial position of the center of charge: one pointing up and away from the pore bottleneck (“up”) as seen in the PDB structure; the other dunking down and extending into the bottleneck region (“down”) to form an ion pair with permeant Cl<sup>-</sup> ions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A and B</xref>). When R334 is down, the average Cl<sup>-</sup> ion density in the bottleneck as well as Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance are increased (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C-E</xref>). As a control, the Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance of the channel was unaffected by the conformational state of the sidechain of R134, another pore-lining arginine from the inner vestibule whose sidechain sampled two slightly different conformations (Figure 8 – figure supplement 1), indicating that the observed conductance enhancement is unique to R334.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the sidechain of R334, whether in the up or down conformation, can form a salt-bridge with either E1124 or E1126, two residues in the middle of flexible extracellular loop 6 (ECL-6) linking TM11 and 12.

</fig>
<p>Our analysis shows that the configuration of charged residues at the extracellular mouth of the pore affect the conductance of the penta-helical pore. The most favourable conditions for Cl<sup>-</sup> conduction are: 1) the dunked conformation of R334, which assist Cl<sup>-</sup> ions to cross the narrowest region of the pore; and 2) the disengagement of two ECL-6 Glu residues from the conduction pathway. The apparent conductance of the penta-helical pore at each voltage is strongly correlated with the fraction of time when these two conditions are met (Figure 9 – figure supplement 1). The fact that these conditions were seldom satisfied at positive voltages explains the observed rectification. This bias is likely due at least in part to the fact that the positive electric field tends to push cationic R334 upwards and anionic ECL-6 Glu sidechains downwards towards the pore, resulting in a greater likelihood of charge pairing between these residues. In addition, it is possible that initial conformations of the ECL-6 loop do not reflect equilibrium and more generally, that the conformational equilibria of the extracellular loops are not adequately sampled in the simulations. In particular, interactions with other extracellular loops that could help keep ECL-6 away and disengaged from the central pore may not be modelled accurately. In that perspective, the omission of 11 residues in glycosylated loop ECL-4 linking TM7 and 8, which was not modeled in structural studies to date or in the present study but is close to ECL-6, could alter the conformational properties ECL-6.</p>
<p>Experimental evidence supports the role of R334 in enhancing Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance in CFTR. For instance, loss-of-charge, CF-causing mutation R334W shows reduced Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance compared to wild-type (cftr2.org, n.d.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Sheppard et al., 1993</xref>). Our results suggest that the ability of R334 sidechain to extend into the pore bottleneck is an important feature of the functional open state of CFTR. In support of this finding, it was shown that R334 becomes less accessible from the extracellular space in the open state than in the closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). The down conformation of the R334 sidechain could be stabilized through cation-π and π-π interactions with the aromatic ring of F337 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>, Figure 8 – figure supplement 2). Consistent with this observation, both R334K and F337A single-point mutants displayed reduced conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ge et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gong and Linsdell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Linsdell et al., 2000</xref>). It should be noted that classical forcefields such as the one that we are using, which approximate electronic distributions as atomic point charges, do not explicitly capture the electric quadrupole contributions of aromatic rings in π-interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lemkul, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Mackerell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">MacKerell et al., 1998</xref>). As such, it is possible that these interactions stabilize the down conformation of R334 sidechain to a greater extent than captured in our simulations, which could result in greater Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance and a better agreement with experimental single channel recordings. On the other hand, there is no evidence supporting the roles of E1124 or E1126 in CFTR function. Instead, recent study suggests that E1124A and E1126P mutations retain or slightly improve the function of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Simon and Csanády, 2021</xref>), suggesting that the presence of negative charges at these two positions is not required for function and may even be inhibitory, consistent with our conclusion.</p>
<p>Taken together, the above results validate state α as the functional open state of human CFTR. Although limitations were identified in the accuracy of the conformational ensemble of loop residues at the extracellular mouth of the pore, the pentameric conformation of pore helices derived in the current study is stable and consistent with CFTR function. Our findings provide a realistic, physiological depiction of Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation through the open state of CFTR, which features a wide central pathway and a side pathway between TM helices 1 and 6, with a preference for the central pathway (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). We shall henceforth refer to state α as the “MD-open” state. In contrast, ion translocation only occurs at large, non-physiological voltages for states β-δ, confirming their status as “near-open” conformations. States β and γ shall be referred to as stable “MD-closed” states to distinguish them from the metastable near-open state δ.</p>

<p>Having characterized the structure of the functional open state of the channel, we next seek to gain structural insights into CFTR gating. In addition to extensive simulations of the NBD-dimerized, ATP-bound CFTR, we performed 20 replicates of 1-microsecond-long simulations of the ATP-unbound, NBD-separated cryo-EM structure of closed state human CFTR (PDB: 5UAK) in a hydrated lipid bilayer. Consistent with past MD simulation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Corradi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Tordai et al., 2017</xref>), the NBDs either partially or fully dimerized in 15 out of 20 trajectories (Figure 10 – figure supplement 1).</p>
<p>Dimerization occurred very rapidly due to the fact that the structural model is missing the R-domain that keeps two half-channels apart in the closed, unphosphorylated state of the channel. This omission makes the initial NBD-separated conformation highly unstable. In the presence of the R-domain, one expects that the dimerization of NBDs would occur much more slowly as the R-domain gradually disengages from the two half-channels upon phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Despite the rapid dimerization of the NBDs, the arrangement of the extracellular TM helical segments remained unchanged over the 1-µs simulation time (Figure 10 – figure supplement 2), indicating that further conformational changes in the TM region need to occur for the gate to open following NBD dimerization. Accordingly, comparison of the MD-open state with the structural ensemble obtained after fast NBD dimerization of the closed state highlights persistent structural differences in the extracellular segments of TM helices, especially in half-channel 2. In particular, pore opening requires movement of the extracellular end of TM8 towards the center of the pore by ∼8 Å and TM12 away from it by ∼7 Å (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A-C</xref>, Figure 10 – video 1). To accommodate the outward movement of TM12, the extracellular ends of TM helices 10 and 11 must move apart from each other (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10D</xref>). The same conformational changes of TM helices 8 and 12 from the ATP-unbound closed state to the near-open state were previously identified based on the comparison between closed and near-open cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Contrary to the previous hypothesis, however, our results suggest that reaching the open state from near-open state does not involve further conformational changes in these two helices (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

<p>Whereas reaching the open state from the ATP-unbound, NBD-separated closed state primarily involves the closure of two half-channels at the NBDs and rearrangements of TM helices 8 and 12 within half-channel 2, reaching the MD-open state from near-open states primarily involves the movements of TM helices within half-channel 1, with the analysis above showing that collective motions of TM helices 1, 2, and 11 were the dominant changes involved in channel opening (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). What is the structural mechanism underlying such a movement? A notable aspect of the CFTR structure is the abundance of kinks in the TM helices, of which all except TM7 contain at least one kink. Helical kinks often result from structural distortions due to proline or glycine residues, which impart structural flexibility within the helix and have been suggested to facilitate conformational changes in other transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chamberlain et al., 2003</xref>; S.P. Sansom and Weinstein, 2000). In human CFTR, we identified five sites where helical kinks undergo changes between MD-closed and MD-open states: two on TM1, at G85 and P99; two on TM2, at G126 and P140; and one on TM11 at W1098 (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A</xref>). At P99, the average kink angle increases slightly from ∼20° in the MD-closed states to ∼25° in the MD-open state (Figure 11 – figure supplement 1A and B). In contrast, at G85, G126, and P140, reaching the MD-open state involves changes in the orientation of the kinks rather than in the magnitude of kink angles. Specifically, upon reaching the MD-open state from the MD-closed states: (1) the middle segment of TM1 (residues 85-96) swivels with respect to the intracellular segment (residues 78-85) by ∼20° (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11F and G</xref>); (2) the extracellular segment of TM2 (residues 117-128) swivels with respect to the middle segment (residues 129-138) by ∼40° (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B and C</xref>); and (3) the middle segment of TM2 swivels with respect to the intracellular segment (residues 140-149) by ∼30° (Figure 11 – figure supplement 1C and D). Finally, at the W1098 hinge point, the kink angle is larger in the MD-open state by ∼8° compared to the MD-closed states, while the extracellular segment (residues 1098-1118) also swivels around the middle segment (residues 1077-1097) by ∼20° (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11D</xref>). Among all observed patterns implicated for channel opening, the changes in kink at W1098 and in swivel at G85 and G126 are the most strongly correlated with the transition between MD-closed and MD-open states (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11C</xref>, E and G). Altogether, changes in both the magnitude and the orientation of these helical kinks, even if not necessarily all occurring simultaneously, underlie the structural transition between MD-open and MD-closed states (Figure 11 – video 1).</p>

<p>Studies of CFTR gating have understandably been focused on the coupling between conformational changes in the TMDs and ATP-binding-induced NBD dimerization. In this process, the gate opens in the TMDs in response to NBD dimerization, resulting in ion conduction bursts as observed in single channel recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cai et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, even during conduction bursts with dimerized NBDs, brief interruptions occur frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Levring et al., 2023</xref>). The transitions between conducting state and such “flicker closures” have been interpreted as ATP-independent gating events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Correspondingly, it is possible that conformational dynamic transitions such as those observed in our simulations of MD-open and MD-closed states correspond to such ATP-independent gating. In support of the functional relevance of helical kink flexibility at these sites, single-point mutations of G85, P99, and G126 are known to cause CF (cftr2.org, n.d.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Decaestecker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Sheppard et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wagner et al., 1994</xref>). Although functional and clinical data associated with P140 are not currently available, this residue is noteworthy for being in a π-bulge, a type of helical defect linked to functional roles in other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cooley et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, our analysis shows that changes in the magnitude of the kink angle near W1098 are strongly correlated to transitions between MD-closed and MD-open states (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11E</xref>). This finding may seem surprising considering that unlike proline and glycine, tryptophan is not usually associated with helix kinks. However, consistent with the functional importance of this locus, W1098R and W1098C are CF-causing mutations (cftr2.org, n.d.).</p>
<p>Our results show that changes in helical kinks can affect the relative arrangement of pore-forming helices and are involved in near-open to open transitions in CFTR. Such changes are also likely to play a role in gating, as suggested by the fact that multiple residues located at helical kinks in TM helices are loci of CF mutations. The role of small changes in helical conformations in gate opening and closing has been noted in other ion channels. In the CorA magnesium channel, gating is coupled to a 10-degree change in the tilt of kinked pore-lining helices that modulates the diameter of the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chakrabarti et al., 2010</xref>). In Kv and MthK channels, gating involves a ∼10-degree change in the internal kink of pore-lining helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Fowler and Sansom, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Gu and de Groot, 2020</xref>). In NavM channels, the open state is reached through a local α-to-π transition of a pore-lining helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Choudhury et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Choudhury and Delemotte, 2023</xref>). These examples, along with our findings on CFTR, show that the gating of ion channels can involve changes in helical structure as well as global conformational changes.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, we have derived and characterized a structural model of the open state of human CFTR through massively repeated MD simulations of a near-open structure of the ATP-bound, NBD-dimerized channel. Reproducible structural relaxation of the pore in a lipid bilayer leads to a stable open state structure featuring an approximately symmetric arrangement of five transmembrane helices lining an expanded pore bottleneck region. The functional relevance of this penta-helical open state is demonstrated by its ability to sustain Cl<sup>-</sup> currents at physiological voltages with a conductance comparable to experimentally measured values. The detailed analysis of ion solvation and ion-channel interactions highlights the role of cationic residues in the ion conduction mechanism throughout the permeation pathway and reveals how the R334 sidechain facilitates the translocation of partly dehydrated Cl<sup>-</sup> ions through the hydrophobic pore bottleneck.</p>
<p>While the present study does not address the allosteric mechanism linking NBD dimerization to channel opening, it provides insights into the gating mechanism in the pore domain (TMDs). The comparison of closed and open state structures suggests that ATP-dependent gating at long timescale primarily involves rearrangements of TM helices within half-channel 2, whereas the changes governing near-open to open transitions, which may be relevant to ATP-independent gating on a faster timescale, occur within half-channel 1. In this process, opening and closing of the hydrophobic pore bottleneck involves changes in the orientation and magnitude of flexible kinks in TM helices.</p>
<p>Understanding the structure and functional dynamics of CFTR is an important step towards unraveling the molecular pathology of CF. As a case in point, we note that several residues shown in this study to be implicated in pore opening and Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation are loci of CF-causing mutations. Future studies of the atomistic open-state structure of human CFTR derived in this work should help gain a better understanding of gating and conduction as well as their defects in CF-causing mutants.</p>

<title>Molecular Systems</title>
<p>The preparation of the system containing ATP-bound, NBD-dimerized CFTR was described in detail in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Zeng et al., 2023</xref>). Briefly, the structural model of phosphorylated, ATP-bound human E1371Q CFTR (PDB: 6MSM) was used. The PDB structure is missing certain loop regions (residues 410-434, 890-899, 1174-1201, and 1452-1489) and the disordered R-domain (residues 638-844), which are not modelled in our study. All chains were acetylated at the N-termini and amidated at the C-termini. Two Mg-ATP moieties bound to the protein at the NBD interface in the PDB structure were kept, while all other putative lipids and an unknown helix at the TMD-NBD interface were removed. The Mg-ATP bound human CFTR was embedded in a hydrated POPC bilayer with 150 mM NaCl using CHARMM-GUI server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Jo et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>For the ATP-free, NBD-separated CFTR, the simulation box was prepared in a similar way. The structural model of unphosphorylated, ATP-free human wild-type CFTR (PDB: 5UAK) was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Residues that were missing in the PDB structure were not modeled, including a short N-terminal segment (1-4), the loops connecting each TMD-NBD pair (403-438, 1173-1206), the R-region (646-843), the extracellular loop between TM7 and TM8 (884-908), and the segment at the C-terminal end of NBD2 (1437-1489). A putative helix from the R-domain in the PDB structure with unknown amino acid composition was removed. Before embedding the CFTR protein into lipids, the PPM server of Orientations of Proteins in Membranes (OPM) database was used to determine the starting position of the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Lomize et al., 2012</xref>). The model for CFTR with Mg-ATP bound was then embedded in a POPC bilayer and solvated in water with 150 mM NaCl using the CHARMM-GUI server without water or ions inside the channel pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Jo et al., 2008</xref>). A total of 255 POPC molecules added around the protein per periodic box.</p>

<p>All MD simulations were conducted using GROMACS versions 2016 and later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>). The CHARMM36 forcefield was used for protein, lipids, ions, ATP, together with the TIP3P water model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Best et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Huang and MacKerell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Klauda et al., 2010</xref>). Simulations were run at constant temperature and pressure (<italic>T</italic> = 300 K, <italic>p</italic> = 1 atm) at 2 fs integration timesteps. Constant temperature was maintained using the Nosé–Hoover thermostat (τ<italic><sub>T</sub></italic> = 0.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hoover, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Nosé, 1984</xref>); constant pressure was maintained using the Parrinello-Rahman barostat (τ<sub>p</sub> = 2.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Nosé and Klein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Parrinello and Rahman, 1980</xref>). Semi-isotropic pressure coupling was used, with isothermal compressibility set to 4.5×10<sup>-5</sup> bar<sup>-1</sup> both in the <italic>xy</italic>-plane and along the <italic>z</italic>-axis. Nonbonded interactions were calculated using Verlet neighbor lists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Páll and Hess, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Verlet, 1967</xref>). Lennard-Jones interactions were cut off at 1.2 nm and a force-based switching function with a range of 1.0 nm was used. The particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method was used to compute electrostatic interactions with a real-space cut-off of 1.2 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Darden et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Essmann et al., 1995</xref>). The LINCS algorithm was used to constrain covalent bonds involving H atoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hess, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>For initial simulations started from the PDB structures of CFTR, the system was subjected to energy minimization followed by a multi-step <italic>NpT</italic> equilibration protocol. The system was first subjected to steepest descent energy minimization until maximum force dropped below 1000 kJ/mol/nm. Random velocities were generated at the beginning of the <italic>NpT</italic> equilibration phase, which was conducted in three 10-ns stages, successively with protein heavy atoms, protein backbone atoms, and protein Cα atoms restrained (force constant <italic>k</italic> = 1000 kJ/mol/nm<sup>2</sup> in <italic>xyz</italic> directions). <italic>NpT</italic> equilibration was followed by production run without restraints. All production run was 1-μs-long. For simulations with TM voltage, a constant electric field of strength between -32 mV/nm and +32 mV/nm was applied along the <italic>z</italic>-axis of the simulation box which is normal to the lipid bilayer. During the production runs, the <italic>z</italic>-dimension of the simulation box stabilized to and fluctuated around 16.5 nm. In all simulations, new random velocities were generated at the beginning of production runs. For extended simulations, snapshots from different timepoints of other MD trajectories were used as the initial configurations. No extra energy minimization or equilibration phase precedes extended production runs.</p>
<p>Among all simulations incorporated in the analysis, 649 of which started from both Cl<sup>-</sup> permeable and impermeable configurations obtained in our previous study, and 50 of which were further extended from these simulation trajectories. For completeness, the dataset analyzed herein also includes 20 simulation trajectories obtained from our previous study, which started from the experimental “near-open” structure (PDB: 6MSM). Information about the initial configurations and how the extended trajectories are spawned are presented in Table 1 and Supplementary file 1.</p>

Chloride current at a certain voltage in a certain state is computed by <italic>I</italic> = <italic>eN</italic>/<italic>t</italic>, where <italic>e</italic> is the elementary charge, <italic>N</italic> is the number of translocation events, and <italic>t</italic> is the total time spent in the state. Simple linear regression without intercept was used to construct the current-voltage curve and determine the channel conductance (i.e. slope of the fit to current vs voltage plot).</p>

<title>Helix kink analysis</title>
<p>The descriptors used to characterize helix kink, specifically kink and wobble/swivel angles, are inspired by the ProKink approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Visiers et al., 2000</xref>). The kink angle between two helical segments were calculated as the angle between their principal axes. To compute the swivel angle, the protein structure from all snapshots were reoriented such that one of the helical segments is aligned with the <italic>z</italic>-axis. The swivel angle is represented as the azimuth angle of the other helical segment around the z-axis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The goal of this study was to overcome the apparent difficulty in constructing structural models of the open state of the CFTR chloride channel. While several CFTR structural models at near-atomic resolution have been published under a variety of conditions, none of them have demonstrated a pore open across the full dimension of the plasma membrane. Instead, these have routinely been referred to as &quot;near-open&quot; models. In the present study, the authors extended their findings from a prior paper from their group that investigated a series of brief MD simulations, a small number of which exhibited permeation events where chloride ions permeated the pore. This study included massively repeated simulations initiated from these aforementioned Cl permeable conformations. Extensive analysis of the data identified a novel penta-helical structure that comprises the channel pore. This comprehensive study attempted to explain several features of conducting CFTR channels, including single-channel conductance, selectivity, and the mechanisms linking the ATP-induced dimerization of the cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) to the opening of the channel pore (a.k.a., &quot;pore-gating&quot;.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strength of this study is its comprehensive nature. The approaches applied are cutting-edge and beyond, and are used to explain many different aspects of channel function in CFTR. The strength of evidence is very strong. The paper is extremely well-written, and the arguments are well-supported.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness is that none of the novel conclusions (i.e., those arising solely from this study and not previously published (have been supported by experimental confirmation. That is typical of computational studies such as this.</p>

<p>Although recent cryo-EM structures of the CFTR ion channel were reported in a putative open state (ATP-bound, NBD-dimerized), it remains unclear whether these structures explain the conductive properties of the open channel observed in functional experiments. To investigate this, the authors conducted extensive molecular dynamics simulations at different voltages. The simulations are started from snapshots of their prior work, based on the experimental putative open state and including conditions with high negative voltage. Their analysis reveals that the cryo-EM structure represents a near-open metastable state, with most trajectories transitioning to either more closed or more open conformations, leading to the identification of a potential new open state. Permeation rate analysis shows that, unlike the other states, the proposed open state exhibits functional conductive properties of the open channel, although a strong inward rectification, inconsistent with experimental data, is also noted. Further structural analysis and simulations of ATP-unbound closed states offer additional mechanistic insights.</p>
<p>Overall, this work tackles key questions about CFTR: What is the true open conductive state? Does the ATP-bound cryo-EM structure reflect an actual open state? What is the ion permeation mechanism, and what structural changes occur during the closed-to-open transition? Which residues are critical, particularly those linked to diseases like CF? The study, based on a comprehensive set of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, including a range of physiologically relevant voltages, provides important insights in this regard. It identifies key structural states, permeation pathways, critical residues, and conductance properties that can be directly compared to functional data. Notably, the analysis identifies a new open state of the channel, which, systematic analysis convincingly demonstrates is a conductive conformation of the channel, in line with experimental data at negative voltages. The authors carefully address some of the limitations of their results, exploring and discussing discrepancies with functional experiments, such as inward rectification. The work is also very well written, with a clear and logical presentation of key findings.</p>
<p>The main weakness of this study is that the simulation data rely on the conventional CHARMM36 force field for Cl− ions, which has been shown to significantly underestimate the interaction between Cl− and proteins (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2021, 17, 6240-6261). For example, the conventional CHARMM36 force field destabilizes the Cl-binding site in CLC-ec1. The latter ion unbinds irreversibly during microseconds-long simulations which is at odds with the experimental binding affinity.</p>
<p>This imbalance in Cl−/protein/water interactions could significantly impact the CFTR simulations, potentially altering state populations and Cl− permeability. Notably, recent work by Levring and Chen (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2024) identifies a likely Cl− binding site in the bottleneck region of the channel, which contradicts the simulation results showing low occupancy Cl− ions in this region (Fig. 1B and Fig. 6A). This discrepancy may be due to the underestimation of Cl−/protein interactions. Indeed, Orabi et al. have proposed corrections that specifically tune these interactions, including those with aromatic residues, in line with the binding site geometry suggested by Levring and Chen. This imbalance in interactions may also lead to an underestimation of the conductance in the experimental near-open state.</p>
<p>
Balanced Cl−/protein interactions could also influence voltage/current relationships, potentially affecting the degree of inward rectification. For example, higher Cl− occupancy in the bottleneck region may stabilize the down state of R334, along with other measured interactions, thereby increasing conductance as the authors have shown.</p>
<p>The experimental evidence reported and discussed by the authors in support of the proposed open state is largely qualitative. For instance, in Figure 4 Supplement 2 there is a significant overlap in the distances and SASA distributions of open and near-open states for the reported residues (are those residues water accessible in the simulations?).</p>
<p>Given the known limitations of the standard CHARMM36 Cl− force field and in the absence of robust experimental validation of the proposed open state, I recommend validating at least part of the results using an independent set of simulations (not started from the previous ones) with an updated Cl− force field. It would be especially important to reassess whether the experimental near-open state is truly metastable and less probable than the new open state, and confirm that the near-open state exhibits negligible conductance.</p>
<p>A minor point worth discussing is whether the observed inward rectification may be influenced by hysteresis or incomplete equilibration, as many simulations were started from prior trajectories at large negative voltages and may not have fully relaxed. For instance, is not uncommon that small structural changes in backbone and sidechains occur in several microseconds (Shaw et al., Science, 2010). That said, discrepancies in current-voltage relationships are not unexpected due to challenges in simulation sampling and force field accuracy (J Gen Physiol 2013 May;141(5):619-32) as the authors stated.</p>
<p>Another minor point to address is the preparation of the simulation setup for the ATP-free structure of the protein. It would be helpful to specify whether any particular controls or steps were taken, given that the structure is based on a relatively low resolution (3.87 Å) model.</p>

<p>Background:</p>
<p>Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel whose dysfunction underlies cystic fibrosis, a life-limiting condition caused by thick, sticky mucus buildup in the lungs and other organs. Despite multiple high-resolution structures of CFTR, these snapshots have all captured the channel in a non-conducting or &quot;closed&quot; conformation - even when the protein was prepared under conditions that should favor channel opening. This discrepancy has posed a key challenge: how can a channel be experimentally observed as closed while physiological tests demonstrate it conducts chloride ions?</p>
<p>Key Findings:</p>
<p>(1) Stable Open Conformation</p>
<p>Through repeated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of human CFTR in lipid bilayers, researchers observed a reproducible, stable open state. Unlike previous transient openings seen in single-run or short simulations, this conformation remains consistently permeable over extended timescales.</p>
<p>(2) Penta-Helical Arrangement</p>
<p>The authors highlight a &quot;penta-helical&quot; pore-lining arrangement in which five transmembrane helices symmetrically organize to create a clear ion-conduction pathway. This novel configuration resolves the previously puzzling hydrophobic bottleneck found in cryo-EM structures.</p>
<p>(3) Conductance Close to Experimental Values</p>
<p>By analyzing chloride ion flow under near-physiological voltages, they calculate a channel conductance aligning well with electrophysiological measurements. This alignment provides strong support that the observed structure is functionally relevant.</p>
<p>(4) Roles of Key Residues</p>
<p>Several positively charged (cationic) residues in the pore appear crucial for guiding and stabilizing chloride ions. Simultaneously, small kinks in certain helices may act as structural &quot;hinges,&quot; allowing or blocking chloride passage.</p>
<p>How to Interpret These Results:</p>
<p>(1) Bridging a Major Gap: The study tackles the mismatch between static &quot;closed&quot; CFTR structures and their known open-channel function. Successfully capturing a stable open state in MD simulations is a significant step toward reconciling what cryo-EM data shows versus what physiological experiments have long told us.</p>
<p>(2) Strength in Multiple Replicas: Running many simulation repeats (rather than relying on a single trajectory) lends credibility. Only if a phenomenon is reproducible across multiple runs can it be considered robust.</p>
<p>(3) Consistency with Mutational Data: Observing that known functional hotspots (e.g., specific charged residues) play a key role in the new pore model further validates these findings.</p>
<p>Important Caveats and Limitations:</p>
<p>(1) Simulation Timescales vs. Biology</p>
<p>
Even extended MD (on the microsecond scale) is still much faster, simpler, and more controlled than real cellular processes.</p>
<p>(2) Physiological existence of the penta-helical pore</p>
<p>
Although the simulations and results are highly compelling, several factors leave open the possibility of a physiological open conformation differing from the observed penta-helical pore. These factors include ATP hydrolysis, interactions with physiological binding partners, the native membrane environment, and regions not modeled in the CFTR structures, such as the R domain. Most importantly, the transmembrane voltage is very high (500mV).</p>
<p>Bottom Line:</p>
<p>This work delivers a long-awaited, near-physiological view of CFTR's open conformation. It provides a foundational structure against which future experimental and computational studies can be compared. By demonstrating reliable chloride conduction and matching established biophysical data, these simulations bring us closer to understanding - and potentially targeting - CFTR's gating mechanism in health and disease. Readers should applaud the breakthroughs while recognizing that further exploration (including more complex in vitro and in vivo experiments) will still be necessary to capture the full dynamism of CFTR in the living cell environment.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The structural mechanism of anion permeation through the open CFTR pore has remained unresolved and is subject to ongoing debate. That is because even in CFTR structures obtained under conditions that normally maximally activate the channel (phosphorylation + ATP + non-hydrolytic mutations + potentiator drugs) a bottleneck region in the pore, too narrow to allow passage of hydrated chloride ions, is observed.</p>
<p>The present study uses molecular dynamics (MD) simulations initiated from such &quot;quasi-open&quot; states to address local conformational dynamics of the pore. The authors conclude that the quasi-open structure stably relaxes to a fully open conformation on the sub-microsecond time scale. They provide a detailed analysis of this fully open structure and of the mechanism of chloride permeation. They conclude that two major exit pathways (a central and a peripheral) exist for chloride ions, and that the ions remain near-fully hydrated throughout the pore: chloride-protein interactions displace only 1-2 waters from the first solvation shell. Furthermore, the simulations provide some hints for conformational changes involved in gating.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings are interpreted in the context of the large body of published functional studies on CFTR permeation properties, and caveats are adequately discussed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions on gating would benefit from further discussions. In particular, a fair comparison of the timescale at which channel gating happens, and that of the MD simulations would strengthen the manuscript.</p>
