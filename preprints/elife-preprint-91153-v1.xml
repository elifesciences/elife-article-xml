<title>Abstract</title><p>Detailed characterization of interneuron subtypes in primary visual cortex (V1) has greatly contributed to understanding visual perception, yet the role of chandelier cells (ChCs) in visual processing remains poorly characterized. Using viral tracing we found that V1 ChCs predominantly receive monosynaptic input from local layer 5 pyramidal cells and higher-order cortical regions. Two-photon calcium imaging and convolutional neural network modelling revealed that ChCs are visually responsive but weakly selective for stimulus content. In mice running in a virtual tunnel, ChCs respond strongly to locomotion and halting visual flow, suggesting arousal-related activity. Visuomotor experience in the tunnel diminished visual responses of ChCs and induced structural plasticity of ChC boutons and axon initial segment length. Finally, ChCs only weakly inhibited pyramidal cells. These findings suggest that ChCs provide an arousal-related signal to layer 2/3 pyramidal cells that may modulate their activity and/or gate plasticity of their axon initial segments during behaviorally relevant events.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The neocortex contains a diverse set of inhibitory interneuron subtypes. The characterization of their connectivity and functions has greatly contributed to our comprehension of cortical circuits and their role in visual perception. The realization that disinhibitory circuits can regulate visual responses based on context has helped to understand mechanisms underlying attention, visual segmentation, predictive processing and plasticity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></italic>). While most cortical interneuron subsets in primary visual cortex (V1) are well-characterized, much remains unknown about the axo-axonic chandelier cells (ChCs) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></italic>) due to the difficulty of genetically targeting them. The recent discovery that vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2 (Vipr2) is a marker for cortical ChCs and the availability of Vipr2-Cre mice have now made it possible to perform thorough analyses of this enigmatic cell type (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>ChCs are unique among interneuron subtypes in that they exclusively innervate pyramidal cells (PyCs) at their axon initial segment (AIS), the site where action potentials are generated (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></italic>). This anatomical organization has led to the idea that ChCs may exert powerful control over action potential (AP) generation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></italic>). However, there is considerable controversy about whether ChC innervation of the AIS causes inhibition or excitation of PyCs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></italic>). A recent study found that ChCs in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) depolarize the AIS during the first 2-3 weeks after birth, while they cause hyperpolarization or shunting in adult mice (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>). Accordingly, the few studies that have manipulated ChC activity in adult mice <italic>in vivo</italic> also found an inhibitory effect on PyCs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>On top of the limited understanding of their impact on neuronal excitability, there is also little know about the connectivity of ChCs in V1 and their response properties (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></italic>). In prelimbic cortex, ChCs receive input from local and contralateral PyCs in deep layer 3, while they preferentially innervate more superficial amygdala-innervating PyCs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></italic>). This non-reciprocal connectivity pattern suggests that ChCs may shape communication hierarchies between cortical networks. Interestingly, superficial layer 2/3 (L2/3) PyCs in V1 also receive more ChC synapses than deep layer 3 PyCs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>), but whether connections are non-reciprocal remains unknown. Recent studies using <italic>in vivo</italic> two-photon calcium imaging in V1 show that ChC activity is highly correlated with pupil size and locomotion (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></italic>), indicating arousal-related ChC activity consistent with what has been observed in other brain regions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></italic>). However, visually evoked activity has also been observed in V1 ChCs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></italic>). This activity profile is similar to that of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)+ interneurons and neurogliaform cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></italic>), which are both known to receive strong top-down inputs from higher-order cortical areas. It is not known whether this is also true for ChCs, but if so, an interesting possibility would be that ChCs shape the communication hierarchy of cortical networks providing visual and contextual information.</p>
<p>ChCs have also been implicated in regulating various forms of plasticity. In S1, it was found that ChCs alter the number of synapses at the AIS based on the activity of their postsynaptic targets, suggesting that ChCs may play a role in homeostatic control of PyC activity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>). A contribution to homeostatic scaling of neuronal output is consistent with the observation that the size of the PyC soma is proportional with the number of ChC synaptic contacts (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></italic>). Furthermore, in CA1 it was discovered that optogenetic suppression of ChCs during spatial exploration favors place field remapping (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></italic>). In premotor cortex it was found that suppressing the influence of ChCs reduced performance in a learned motor task (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></italic>). Finally, in the binocular zone of developing V1, elimination of ChCs during development was found to be crucial for the maturation of inputs from the ipsilateral eye and depth perception (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></italic>). Together, these studies suggest that ChCs may regulate plasticity by directly altering the excitability of their targets at the AIS or reducing the ability of PyCs to undergo changes of their excitatory synaptic inputs.</p>
<p>Here, we analyzed ChCs in L2/3 of V1 to understand their role in visual processing and plasticity. We find that ChCs receive inputs from local L5 PyCs and higher cortical regions and exhibit weak selectivity for visual stimulus content. Imaging ChC activity in mice running through a virtual tunnel showed that they respond to locomotion and visuomotor mismatch, indicating arousal-related activity. Surprisingly, visuomotor experience in the virtual tunnel strongly decreased ChC visual responses. It also resulted in plasticity of the length of PyC AISs and their innervation by ChCs. Finally, ChCs exerted only mild inhibitory influence on PyCs, affecting only a small proportion of cells. Our findings suggest that ChCs predominantly respond to arousal related to locomotion or unexpected events/stimuli, and act to modulate activity or plasticity of L2/3 PyCs in V1.</p>

<title>ChCs receive input from long-range sources and L5 PyCs in V1</title>
<p>We first identified the sources of synaptic input to ChCs in V1 using trans-synaptic retrograde rabies tracing. In order to label ChCs in layer 2/3, we made use of Vipr2-Cre mice, in which Cre recombinase is selectively expressed in cortical ChCs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></italic>). In superficial V1 of these mice, we injected Cre-dependent AAV vectors expressing the avian glycoprotein EnvA receptor TVA and rabies glycoprotein (G) on day 1, followed by a glycoprotein-deleted (dG) rabies virus on day 27 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></italic>) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A,B</xref></bold>). Most labeled neurons were located on the border between L1 and L2/3 and displayed typical ChC morphology (<bold>Fig. S1A,B</bold>). Quantification based on morphological properties revealed that 87% (287/329) of labeled neurons were ChCs. (<bold>Fig. S1A,B)</bold>. This specificity matches that of Cre driver lines for other inhibitory subtypes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></italic>). We tested the specificity of the rabies virus by injecting it without the AAV helper vectors and found no labeled neurons (<bold>Fig. S1C</bold>). We then quantified neurons providing monosynaptic input to ChCs across the brain of four mice also injected with the AAV helper vectors. This revealed that ChCs received long-range inputs from various thalamic and cortical regions (e.g., dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, lateral posterior nucleus, retrosplenial cortex, and S1), matching long-range inputs described for other interneuron subsets in V1 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></italic>). The most abundant sources of presynaptic partners of ChCs, however, were found locally in L5 and to a lesser extent in L1-4 of V1 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>). Labeled L5 neurons had pyramidal shaped cell bodies and dendritic spines, indicating that L5 inputs to ChCs are excitatory (<bold>Fig. S1D-F</bold>). This local innervation pattern was reminiscent of ChCs in S1 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></italic>), but differed significantly from the innervation pattern of ChCs in the prefrontal cortex where they predominantly receive input from contralaterally-projecting PyCs in deep layer 3 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></italic>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To test the monosynaptic nature of the long-range input cells observed with rabies tracing, we used optogenetic stimulation in combination with electrophysiological recordings in acute V1 slices. For these experiments we injected an AAV vector driving expression of ChR2-eYFP in retrosplenial cortex for optogenetic stimulation. This area was chosen because it contained more input neurons than any other brain area that was sufficiently distal from V1 to prevent potential leakage of the viral vector into V1 itself. We also injected a Cre-dependent AAV vector driving mCyRFP1 expression in V1 to label ChCs and performed whole-cell recordings in V1 slices three weeks later (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>-F</bold>). Local optogenetic activation of RSC boutons in V1 generated inward currents in ∼85% (11/13) of voltage-clamped ChCs. The resulting excitatory postsynaptic potentials were abolished in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), but reappeared upon additional application of the potassium-channel blocker four-aminopyridine (4-AP) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref></bold>), which facilitates optogenetically evoked synaptic release in absence of action potential generation. These data corroborate the idea that RSC inputs onto V1 ChCs are monosynaptic (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></italic>). Repeated optogenetic stimulation (20 Hz) resulted in synaptic depression (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref></bold>), indicating RSC synapses may have a high release probability (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Finally, we performed paired recordings of L2/3 PyCs and ChCs to test their local connectivity within V1 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J-K</xref></bold>). Inducing action potentials in ChCs generated postsynaptic responses in ∼45% (5/11) of PyCs. However, none of the 11 ChCs we recorded from responded to local PyC stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J-K</xref></bold>), indicating a highly non-reciprocal connectivity motif. It also indicated that only few if any local L2/3 PyCs provide synaptic input to ChCs. It should be noted that the use of whole cell recordings with high chloride internal solution as performed here precludes determining whether ChC input on PyCs causes hyperpolarization or depolarization. These findings suggest that the rabies-labeled L1-4 neurons providing monosynaptic input to ChCs are predominantly inhibitory neurons, in line with previous work showing that V1 ChCs receive local input from L2/3 SST+ interneurons as well as neurogliaform cells (L2/3 NGCs), but not from L2/3 PyCs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>). This is further supported by the distributed localization of the labeled neurons, their presence in L1 and the observation that they lacked spines and that the soma appeared non-pyramidal (<bold>Fig. S1D-F</bold>). Taken together, these results show that ChCs in V1 receive substantial input from local L5 PyCs, inhibitory neurons and long-range sources, while they locally innervate L2/3 PyCs.</p>

We injected adult Vipr2-Cre mice with an AAV vector driving expression of GCaMP6f under the control of a short CaMKIIa promoter to label putative PyCs and a Cre-dependent AAV vector driving expression of mRuby2-GCaMP6f to label ChCs in V1.

<p>We first assessed activity of ChCs and L2/3 PyCs during spontaneous behavior by tracking running speed and pupil size while mice were viewing a uniform gray screen (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, Movie S1</bold>). We restricted our field of view to the border between L1 and L2/3, where superficial ChCs are positioned. In line with earlier work, correlation analysis between calcium activity and both running speed and pupil size revealed that ChCs were mostly active during states of high arousal, more so than L2/3 PyCs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref></bold>, multilevel statistical analyses were performed using a Linear Mixed Effects Model to account for dependencies in the data and variance between mice, see methods) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></italic>). In addition, ChCs within the same field of view were highly correlated with each other, much more so than L2/3 PyCs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref></bold>), suggesting that ChCs distribute a synchronized signal during high arousal.</p>
<p>To test whether ChCs also responded to visual stimuli, we examined their orientation and direction tuning by showing mice 1 s moving oriented gratings (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, Movie S2</bold>). Although both ChCs and L2/3 PyCs had strong visual responses, ChCs were weakly tuned and showed a lower orientation selectivity index (OSI) than L2/3 PyCs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>-G</bold>). The direction selectivity index (DSI) was similar between cell types.</p>

<title>ChCs are weakly selective to visual information</title>
<p>The highly synchronized ChC activity, its correlation with arousal, and the relatively weak orientation tuning of ChCs suggested that while they signal behaviorally relevant events, they may only weakly encode visual stimulus features. To assess this more thoroughly, we assessed the visual response properties of ChCs. Artificial visual stimuli such as oriented gratings can reveal tuning to isolated stimulus parameters. However, experimental constraints limit the number of receptive field properties that can be tested this way. In addition, due to the nonlinear response selectivity of visual neurons, receptive field properties defined using gratings do not always generalize well to natural vision (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></italic>). Therefore, to obtain a more complete picture of the cells’ visual receptive field properties we used natural stimuli in combination with a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to model single-cell visual responses and visualize their putative most exciting inputs (MEIs) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></italic>) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>). For this experiment, we used two new groups of mice. In one group, we injected Vipr2-Cre mice with an AAV vector driving expression of GCaMP8m (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></italic>) (to label L2/3 PyCs and ChCs) and a Cre-dependent AAV vector driving expression of mCyRFP1 (to label ChCs). Since our rabies tracing results revealed that V1 L5 PyCs were the most abundant source of synaptic input to ChCs, we targeted L5 PyCs in a second group of mice. We selectively labeled L5 PyCs using a tail vein injection of a Cre-dependent PhP.eB-serotyped (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></italic>) AAV vector driving expression of GCaMP6f in Rbp4-Cre mice (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></italic>) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>). We then recorded neural activity in both groups while mice were shown a set of 4000 natural images, with 40 of these images being shown 10 times each. We used the neural responses of individual neurons to determine their selectivity, and subsequently, to optimize a CNN and obtain an estimate of the cells’ most exciting inputs (MEIs) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We first focused on properties derived from recorded neuronal responses (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-E</xref> and Fig. S2A</bold>). ChCs responded strongly to natural images, comparable to L2/3 PyCs and L5 PyCs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>). In order to test the selectivity of neurons for specific natural stimuli, we made use of the subset of 40 images that we presented 10 times. For each cell, we sorted the average responses to these images based on their strength, creating a ranked distribution that revealed differences in stimulus selectivity between cell types (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>). L2/3 PyCs and L5 PyCs responded strongly to only a few images, indicating high selectivity. In contrast, ChCs were weakly selective as shown by their strong responses to many images. We quantified image selectivity for each neuron by calculating sparsity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></italic>). High sparsity indicates strong responses to only a few images, while low sparsity indicates equal responsiveness to many images. As evident from their flattened curve in the ranked distribution, ChCs had significantly lower sparsity than L2/3 PyCs and L5 PyCs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, inset</bold>). Next, we reasoned that if ChCs are weakly selective for visual stimuli, their between-cell correlation should remain high even during exposure to variable visual input. Indeed, correlations between ChCs were considerably higher than those for L2/3 PyCs and L5 PyCs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>), similarly to the situation during spontaneous behavior (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). Finally, to test whether ChC activity contained less information about the visual stimuli than L2/3 PyC activity, we performed population decoding on the 40 images using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). We compared decoding accuracy using all ChCs (n = 34) with that of a distribution of accuracies obtained from randomly subsampling equal numbers of L2/3 PyCs (see methods). Decoding accuracy of ChCs was significantly lower than of L2/3 PyCs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref></bold>). Together, these results show that ChCs are visually responsive, but weakly selective to visual information.</p>
<p>While orientation tuning and sparsity are useful measures of selectivity, they do not provide information about the type of stimuli that excite the neurons most strongly. To determine the MEI of each neuron, we used the responses of individual ChCs, L2/3 PyCs and L5 PyCs to optimize a pre-trained CNN (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></italic>). First, we obtained predicted (artificial) responses from the pre-trained CNN to a batch of the natural images. We then fit a mapping function from predicted responses to neuronal responses (recorded from the mice). The mapping function consisted of a set of spatial weights to model the location and spatial extent of the RF and a set of feature weights to model the feature selectivity (e.g. orientation) of each neuron. To fit the model, we compared the neuronal responses with the predicted responses made by the CNN. We repeated this process several times using different batches of natural images. On each iteration, we changed both the spatial and feature weights of the model to minimize the error between neuronal responses and predicted responses, until no further improvements were made. The result of this optimization was the final model, comprising an artificial copy of each individual neuron that could be used to predict visual responses which are highly representative of the neuron’s visual response properties (see methods and <bold>Fig. S2B-C</bold>).</p>
<p>The CNN allowed us to obtain an MEI for each neuron by presenting artificial visual stimuli (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref></bold>, see methods) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>). MEIs can reveal complex non-linear RF properties such as corners, curves and textures that represent optimal visual input, which is otherwise difficult to quantify in a single metric. Inspection of the MEIs and quantification of predicted responses to simple artificial stimuli revealed striking differences between cell types. For instance, MEIs of L2/3 PyCs often displayed clearly oriented edge-like patterns with sharp ON and OFF regions, which were much less apparent in ChCs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref></bold>), while L5 PyCs showed a mixed form of selectivity, including both edge-like patterns as well as more complex textures. In line with this observation and in agreement with our orientation tuning experiments (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-E</xref></bold>), the modeled ChCs had lower OSIs than L2/3 PyCs and L5 PyCs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref></bold> and <bold>Fig. S2D</bold>). Furthermore, ChC MEIs mostly lacked high contrast patterns, containing high spatial frequencies (SFs). Accordingly, the quantification of contrast tuning and SF of modeled neurons revealed that ChCs were less contrast tuned than L2/3 PyCs and L5 PyCs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref></bold> and <bold>Fig. S2E</bold>) and preferred lower SFs than L5 PyCs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref></bold>), which might be related to the interdependence between contrast sensitivity and SFs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></italic>). The smooth and featureless MEIs of ChCs were further reflected by their larger RFs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Finally, given that ChCs receive most of their inputs from local L5 PyCs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>), we asked whether ChC MEIs could be the result of combinations of L5 PyC inputs. We generated MEIs to maximize the response of combinations of L5 PyCs and found that many of the resulting MEIs were less structured and lacked clearly oriented edge-like patterns (<bold>Fig. S2F</bold>). The similarity of these MEIs with those we found for ChCs is in line with the idea that ChCs are driven by input from large number of L5 PyCs (but do not exclude alternative explanations). Together with the observation that the activity of ChCs is strongly influenced by non-visual factors such as arousal, these results support a view in which ChCs are visually responsive but mostly invariant to the spatial and featural arrangement of visual stimuli.</p>

<title>Locomotion and visuomotor mismatch drive chandelier cell activity in a virtual tunnel</title>
<p>To determine how the interaction between behavior and visual input drives the activity of ChCs, we recorded their calcium responses in V1 of mice in a virtual tunnel paradigm. We designed the tunnel in a way that allowed us to examine L2/3 PyC and ChC activity in response to multiple variables, such as visual stimuli, locomotion and visuomotor mismatch (errors between expected and perceived visual input) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B</xref></bold>). In the first, one-meter-long section of the tunnel (“visual section”), two visual patterns (grating and checker) were repeated three times on a white noise background (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>, left). The second section (“non-visual”) immediately followed the visual section. It consisted of an even, gray area and included an auditory cue predicting a reward (cue at t = 1 s, reward at t = 3 s) and a 6 s waiting period before the next trial started (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>, right). Mice were trained in a minimum of 6 training sessions, during which they became acquainted to the tunnel and learned to lick for a reward. After training, mice performed the task twice under the two-photon microscope, allowing us to record 1256 PyCs and 38 ChCs from a total of 12 locations in 6 mice (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>ChCs were highly active at the onset of the visual section of the tunnel but became suppressed when the visual stimuli appeared (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-D</xref></bold> and <bold>Fig. S3A-B</bold>). Interestingly, while a large subpopulation of PyCs were activated by the visual stimuli, many others showed a similar activity profile as ChCs, suggesting functionally separate populations of PyCs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>). In order to test this, we performed hierarchical clustering on z-scored average activity in the visual section of the tunnel. We used silhouette analysis to examine the separation distance between clusters for different numbers of clusters, which showed that the optimal number of clusters was two (<bold>Fig. S3C</bold>). Examination of the two clusters of PyCs revealed that they had opposite activity patterns. Cluster 1 was activated by visual stimuli but suppressed in the non-visual section, while cluster 2 was suppressed by visual stimuli but activated in the non-visual section, like ChCs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-D</xref></bold>). Thus, we named the PyCs in these clusters ‘visually responsive PyCs’ (V-PyCs) and ‘non-visually responsive PyCs’ (NV-PyCs) respectively.</p>
<p>Although the difference between the two clusters was striking, silhouette evaluation cannot rule out a lack of functional clustering: i.e., where the true number of clusters is one. Therefore, to test whether our data were better described by two clusters or one, we compared the separability of the visual response distributions obtained for the real V-PyCs and NV-PyCs to the separability of 1000 random combinations using a permutation test (<bold>Fig. S3C-F</bold>, see methods). The separability between V-PyCs and NV-PyCs was higher than expected by chance (<bold>Fig. S3F</bold>), indicating that V-PyCs and NV-PyCs are functionally separate clusters in our tunnel paradigm.</p>

<title>ChCs have similar response properties as non-visual PyCs</title>
<p>Previous research has demonstrated that a significant fraction of V1 PyCs exhibit strong visuomotor mismatch responses when the visual flow of the tunnel is abruptly stopped while the mice are still running (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></italic>). Recent evidence suggests that PyCs with visuomotor mismatch responses may belong to a genetically distinct subpopulation that is less visually responsive (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></italic>). Therefore, we assessed whether the two populations of PyCs we identified also differed in terms of their visuomotor mismatch responses. In a subset of trials, we briefly interrupted the visual flow for 0.5 s while the mice were running, to create a visuomotor mismatch. NV-PyCs displayed stronger responses to both the visuomotor mismatch and the onset of running compared to the V-PyCs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-F</xref>, I-J</bold>). These findings support the idea that different populations of PyCs in L2/3 exist, one primarily responding to visual stimuli and the other to locomotion and visuomotor mismatch.</p>
<p>ChCs showed a similar but more pronounced activity pattern compared to NV-PyCs: they were active at the start of the tunnel, while the visual stimuli in the tunnel suppressed their activity (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C,D</xref>,G,H</bold>). Like NV-PyCs, ChCs were mostly driven by locomotion (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref></bold>) and showed strong responses to visuomotor mismatch (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E,I</xref></bold>). In line with this, we found that ChCs were more strongly correlated with NV-PyCs than with V-PyCs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4K</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>It is known that a subpopulation of ChCs express parvalbumin (PV) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></italic>). Indeed, ChCs in adult V1 can be selectively labeled using the combination of markers Vipr2 and PV (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></italic>), but it is not known whether PV<sup>+</sup>-ChCs and Vipr2-ChCs (which includes both PV<sup>+</sup> ChCs and PV<sup>-</sup> ChCs) are functionally different. We therefore tested whether PV<sup>+</sup> ChCs had similar response properties as Vipr2-ChCs by repeating our tunnel experiments using two Vipr2-Cre X PV-FlpO x AI65(RCFL-tdTom) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></italic>) mice (<bold>Fig. S3G</bold>). We found that PV<sup>+</sup>-ChCs showed identical activity patterns as Vipr2-ChCs (<bold>Fig. S3H-P</bold>). In addition, in this smaller sample of mice we found the same separation of V-PyCs and NV-PyCs as described in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>.</p>
<p>Finally, we assessed the activity of ChCs when visual flow was uncoupled from the running speed of the mouse (open loop condition). This revealed that responses to sudden halts in visual flow that were independent of locomotion were much weaker than responses to closed loop visuomotor mismatch (<bold>Fig. S3Q</bold>). In addition, open loop onset of visual flow when the mouse was not running resulted in a suppression of ChC activity (<bold>Fig. S3Q</bold>). We conclude that in mice trained in our virtual tunnel paradigm, ChCs responded predominantly to locomotion and visuomotor mismatch when visual flow stopped during running, while they were suppressed by visual stimuli or when visual flow started while mice were stationary.</p>

<title>Experience-dependent visual plasticity of ChCs and NV-PyCs</title>
<p>The observation that ChCs are suppressed by visual stimulation in the virtual tunnel was unexpected, as our grating (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>) and natural image (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>) experiments showed that ChCs are activated by oriented moving gratings and natural images. However, our passive viewing experiments were performed in mice largely naive to visual stimulation. In contrast, mice behaving in our tunnel paradigm were repeatedly exposed to visual stimulation during the tunnel training phase before we started recording neural activity during behavior. We therefore hypothesized that the observed suppression of ChCs by visual stimulation in the tunnel was caused by experience-dependent plasticity induced by the repeated exposure to visual stimulation during training. To test this, we assessed visual responses in the same neurons to moving oriented gratings before and after training in the virtual tunnel, while mice were passively viewing the stimuli.</p>
<p>In naive mice, both PyCs and ChCs responded strongly to visual stimulation. Interestingly, the same ChCs showed weak or even suppressed visual responses after mice had been trained in the tunnel (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-D</xref></bold>). In contrast, the response strength of PyCs was only mildly and non-significantly reduced after training (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref></bold>). OSI and DSI were unchanged after training (PyC OSI: p = 0.1316, PyC DSI: p = 0.9573, ChC OSI: p = 0.2199, ChC DSI: p = 0.9774, table S1). These results indicate that ChC responses underwent sensory-evoked plasticity during the repeated visual exposure, even though the visual stimuli were different from those encountered during training in the virtual tunnel. This is in line with our observation that ChCs are weakly selective to visual stimuli.</p>

<title>Visuomotor experience in the virtual tunnel induces plasticity of ChC-AIS connectivity</title>
<p>Previous work has shown that prolonged chemogenetic activation of ChCs or PyCs results in plasticity of ChC bouton numbers at the AIS (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>). In addition, PyC activation also causes geometric plasticity of the AIS location and/or length (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></italic>). We therefore hypothesized that, in addition to the changes in response properties of ChCs, the visuomotor experience in the virtual tunnel paradigm may induce axonal plasticity of ChCs. To test this hypothesis, we used immunohistochemistry on V1 slices to visualize L2/3 PyC AISs and boutons of tdTomato-labeled ChCs in naive mice and mice after virtual tunnel training (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We first quantified putative ChC boutons on the AIS of L2/3 PyCs (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref></bold>). While the average number of ChC boutons per AIS remained constant (∼2-3 ChC boutons/AIS, <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B,C</xref></bold>), we observed that visuomotor experience increased the fraction of AISs being contacted by ChCs (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref></bold>). We also found that the AIS of PyCs in trained mice were shorter than in naive mice (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E-F</xref></bold>), resulting in an increased density of ChC boutons (i.e. ChC boutons per µm AIS length, <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref></bold>).

<title>ChCs weakly inhibit PyC activity independent of locomotion speed</title>

<p>Considering the strong modulation of ChCs by arousal, we next looked at effects of ChC silencing on L2/3 PyC activity across different locomotion speeds. Binning activity based on locomotion speed again revealed the relationship between locomotion and ChC activity and to a lesser extent L2/3 PyC activity (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref></bold>). Although the locomotion modulation curve of ChCs decreased in both amplitude and steepness after SalB injection, only the amplitude was affected for PyCs. Indeed, a linear fit of activity as a function of locomotion speed before and after SalB injection confirmed that the intercept but not the slope of the fit was increased for PyCs (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D-E</xref></bold>). We found no differences in the control group (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H-K</xref></bold>). We also quantified the percentage of PyCs that significantly altered their overall activity level upon ChC silencing. Significantly more neurons increased their activity after SalB injection than in the control group (KORD: 21%, Control: 13%, χ<sup>2</sup>-test p &lt; 0.001), while in contrast fewer neurons decreased their activity (KORD: 7%, Control: 11%, χ<sup>2</sup>-test p &lt; 0.001). Finally, to test whether the effect of silencing ChCs preferentially affected PyCs that were weakly or strongly modulated by locomotion, we correlated the locomotion modulation index (LMI) for each PyC with the change in ΔF/F due to ChC silencing (after minus before). The correlation was weak and not significant (r = 0.0068, p = 0.7827), showing that ChCs do not differentially target PyCs based on locomotion modulation.</p>
<p>We conclude that in contrast to the idea that ChCs exert powerful control over action potential generation, these results suggest that ChCs only weakly modulate PyC activity, affecting only a relatively small population of cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we investigated the connectivity and function of chandelier cells (ChCs) in V1. We find that ChCs receive input from local L5 PyCs and higher-order cortical regions and show strong arousal-related activity. While they are also visually responsive, ChCs are weakly selective for stimulus content. Furthermore, we found that visuomotor experience in a virtual tunnel paradigm induces plasticity of the visual responses of ChCs as well as their axo-axonic synapses at L2/3 PyC AISs.</p>
<p>Recent EM reconstructions have shown that although most L2/3 PyCs in V1 receive ChC input, the number of ChC boutons on the AISs of PyCs varies significantly and correlates with their size and laminar depth (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). Accordingly, we found that ChCs provided GABAergic inputs to many of the L2/3 PyCs in their vicinity. Unexpectedly, our retrograde rabies virus tracing experiments showed that ChCs receive most of their input from local L5 PyCs. In keeping with the identified circuits, we did not detect L2/3 PyCs providing inputs to ChCs using dual patch clamp recordings, suggesting that the rabies labeled neurons in layers 1-4 were predominantly interneurons, in line with previous work (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>). ChCs also received long-range inputs from various thalamic and cortical regions (e.g., dLGN, LP, RSC, S1), matching those innervating other interneuron subsets in V1 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></italic>). Optogenetic activation of cortical feedback induced responses in almost all V1 ChCs and repeated stimulation caused synaptic depression, indicating a high release probability, which is usually seen in strong cortical inputs to V1 interneurons (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></italic>). Taken together, the connectivity pattern of ChCs in V1 thus appears to be non-reciprocal, as is also observed in prelimbic cortex (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></italic>). However, in contrast to prelimbic cortex where ChCs receive input from deep layer 3 PyCs, we show here that V1 ChCs receive most of their input from layer 5.</p>
<p>Although ChCs in V1 are sparse and the number of starter ChCs in our rabies tracing experiments was relatively low, we found large numbers of L5 PyCs providing monosynaptic input to them. This means that each ChC receives input from many L5 PyCs, which could explain the low selectivity of ChC responses we observed to natural images compared to those of L2/3 and L5 PyCs. This is also supported by the MEIs we obtained from the pre-trained CNN. MEIs of L5 PyCs were often high-contrast oriented patterns, like those of L2/3 PyCs, or more complex textures.</p>
<p>Instead, MEIs of ChCs were of lower contrast and less structured and similar to MEIs created to maximally drive large numbers of L5 PyCs. Combined inputs from L5 PyCs with diverse tuning properties are also expected to result in tuning to low spatial frequencies, large RFs and low orientation tuning, matching the modelled ChCs. Finally, modelled ChCs also displayed weak contrast tuning. This is an expected consequence of the preference for low spatial frequencies, as these require lower contrast to be detected (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>In our virtual tunnel paradigm, ChCs were active during locomotion but even more so during visuomotor mismatch caused by halting the tunnel while the mice were running. Surprisingly, ChC activity was suppressed by the visual stimuli in the tunnel, or when the visual flow started while the mice were stationary. We found that this apparent discrepancy with the strong responses to natural stimuli could be explained by experience-dependent plasticity of ChC activity: while ChCs responded vigorously to oriented-bar stimuli in naive mice, these responses were almost absent after training in the virtual tunnel. While the underlying plasticity mechanisms remain to be investigated, there are several possibilities. First, it could be caused by reduced excitatory synaptic transmission of visual input to ChCs or increased visually driven inhibition. Second, the plasticity could involve changes in the response properties of L5 PyCs providing input to ChCs. Interestingly, recent evidence shows that during visuomotor behavior, intratelencephalic (IT) L5 PyCs respond in a similar fashion as ChCs in that they respond to running and visuomotor mismatch but are suppressed by unexpected visual flow (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></italic>). Whether L5 IT PyCs are the main L5 PyC subset providing input to ChCs remains to be investigated. A third option is that the experience-dependent changes in ChC activity are related to arousal. ChCs were previously shown to display arousal-related activity in various brain regions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></italic>), which matches our observation that their activity is highly correlated with running and pupil size. In addition, the neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh) is involved in axonal arborization of developing ChCs, further underlining the relationship between ChCs and arousal (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></italic>). During training in the virtual tunnel, mice become acquainted with visual stimuli and learn that running consistently results in visual flow. After training, visual stimuli may thus cause less arousal while unexpected visual flow halt during running may cause more. In line with this idea, it was recently shown that visuomotor mismatch induces strong noradrenergic input to V1 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Noradrenergic input has been shown to depolarize ChCs in frontal cortex (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></italic>). However, we did not identify neuromodulatory inputs to ChCs in our rabies tracing experiment. Possibly, these inputs act predominantly through extrasynaptic receptors and were therefore not labeled by the transsynaptic rabies approach. Future experiments may reveal to what extent plasticity of ChC responses is stimulus specific or arousal related.</p>
<p>When examining how neurons respond to expected or unexpected visual input, it is useful to consider the concept of predictive coding (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></italic>). In this framework, an internal representation of the world is compared with sensory inputs and updated based on prediction errors: the differences between the expected and actual sensory inputs. These prediction errors can be negative, signaling the absence of an expected visual stimulus, or positive, signaling the presence of an unexpected visual stimulus. It has been suggested that prediction errors may be computed by L2/3 PyCs, while the internal representation is encoded by local L5 PyCs and top-down inputs from higher order brain regions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></italic>). Previous work has shown that in V1, L2/3 PyCs indeed respond to mismatches between visual flow and locomotion (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></italic>). Recent evidence suggests that two genetically defined subpopulations of L2/3 PyCs preferentially respond to (unexpected) visual stimuli, which could be considered positive prediction errors, or visuomotor mismatch, which could be seen as negative prediction errors (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></italic>). In line with these findings, we observed two functional clusters of PyCs in L2/3, one responding predominantly to visual stimuli (V-PyCs) and the other to visuomotor mismatch (NV-PyCs).</p>
<p>Prediction error responses require inhibitory neurons to compute the difference between expectation and actual visual input. As ChCs receive input from L5 and higher order cortical regions, they might contribute to calculating positive prediction errors by subtracting the internal representation (i.e. the predicted stimulus) from the actual visual input. However, as ChCs only mildly inhibited L2/3 PyCs, they may not be well suited for this function. Moreover, given that ChCs are highly correlated in their activity, it seems unlikely that they contain high dimensional prediction error information. Predictive coding also involves updating of the internal representation based on prediction errors. Recent evidence suggests that this plasticity requires a gating signal that is provided by noradrenergic input (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></italic>). One option is therefore that ChCs also encode arousal and play a role in the regulation of plasticity.</p>
<p>An intriguing possible mechanism through which ChCs could regulate plasticity is by controlling geometric modifications of the AIS of L2/3 PyCs. We found that visuomotor experience in the virtual tunnel resulted in AIS shortening and more AISs with putative ChC contacts. This is in agreement with previous studies revealing modifications in the density distribution of ChC boutons on PyC AISs in premotor cortex upon motor learning, and in S1 upon chemogenetically activating L2/3 PyCs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></italic>). Changes in ChC innervation may alter the excitability of PyCs by reducing action potential generation. Considering our observation that <italic>in vivo</italic> chemogenetic silencing of ChCs only mildly increased L2/3 PyC activity, their electrical contribution to vetoing action potential output seems, if anything, limited and affects only a small proportion of cells. These findings are thus in contrast with the general notion that ChCs exert powerful control over PyC output (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></italic>), but consistent with computational simulations predicting a relatively small inhibitory effect of GABAergic innervation of the AIS, possibly involving shunting inhibition (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></italic>). Increasing L2/3 PyC activity, like visuomotor experience, also decreased AIS length (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></italic>), which is known to reduce PyC excitability (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></italic>) and likely represents a homeostatic plasticity mechanism. Whether such geometric AIS plasticity is regulated by ChCs is not known. Interestingly, ChC boutons face postsynaptic sites where cisternal organelles are located with micrometer precision (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></italic>). As cisternal organelles are implicated in calcium signaling and AIS plasticity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></italic>), ChCs may thus effectively influence these events. In this scenario, ChC activation could prevent homeostatic AIS shortening of L2/3 PyCs if their activity occurs during behaviorally relevant, arousal inducing events. Testing this hypothesis would require, for example, studying the consequences of synchronous or asynchronous activation of ChCs and PyCs on AIS plasticity. The emerging availability of mouse models to genetically target ChCs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></italic>) and novel live markers of the AIS (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></italic>) are making such experiments possible.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our comprehensive study of the function and connectivity of ChCs in V1 reveals that ChC activity is primarily driven by arousal-inducing events such as unexpected visual stimuli, visuomotor mismatch and locomotion. We also observed remarkable plasticity of ChC responses by visuomotor experience, as well as in their innervation of the AIS. Interestingly, our results indicate that <italic>in vivo</italic>, ChCs do not exert strong control over action potential generation at the AIS, but only provide a weak inhibitory influence on PyC activity. Future experiments may reveal whether ChCs provide a gating signal for AIS plasticity and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.</p>

<p>For all cranial surgical procedures, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% induction, 1.6% maintenance in oxygen).

For viral injections targeting L2/3 in all experiments except those used for CNN modeling, the skull was exposed, three small craniotomies were drilled in the skull overlying right V1 (centered around 2.9 mm lateral, 0.5 mm anterior to lambda), and one injection of 70-120 nl virus (titer ∼10E12 viral genomes per mL) in each craniotomy at a depth of approximately 250 µm was made. We used one or more of the following viruses as indicated in the figures: AAV9-CaMKIIa-GcaMP6f, AAV1-CAG-flex-mRuby2-GcaMP6f, AAV1-hSyn1-GcaMP6f, AAV-PHP.eB-shortCAG-dlox-GcaMP6f(rev)-dlox, AAV5-hDlx-DIO-eYFP-t2A-TVA, AAV9-hDlx-DIO-oG, Rbv-ΔG-mCherry, AAV1-hDlx-dlox-hKORD-mCyRFP1(rev)-dlox, AAV1-hDlx-dlox-ChrimsonR-tdTomato(rev)-dlox, AAV9-CaMKIIa-ChR2-eYFP (also see key resource table).

<p>All visual stimuli for two-photon imaging were presented on a gamma-corrected full HD LED monitor using OpenGL and Psychophysics Toolbox 3 running on MATLAB (Mathworks).

For passive visual stimulation before and after training, we used full screen square gratings (0.05 cpd) of different contrasts (0-0.05-0.1-0.2-0.4-0.8-1) moving in one of eight different directions (45° apart, 1 cps). Stimuli were presented for 1 s with a random inter trial interval of 4-6 s and repeated a minimum of eight times each.</p>

The left half of the corridor was displayed on a monitor positioned at a 45° angle and viewed through a mirror, giving the perception of a symmetrical tunnel. The virtual environment was created using Psychophysics Toolbox 3 and OpenGL running on MATLAB. The corridor was 100 cm long and its walls were covered in a black and white Gaussian noise texture, with visual stimuli superimposed. This included three vertical gratings and three checkerboard stimuli placed 11 cm apart between the distances of 22-77 cm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Following a run through the visual part of the corridor, mice were exposed to a luminance-matched gray screen, followed by an 8 kHz auditory cue after 1 s, and then received a 5 µl water reward 2 s later. Mice were trained over a minimum of six sessions, with one session per day, until they consistently completed over 70 trials. Mice continued to be trained in between imaging sessions until the experiment was completed. For open loop experiments, visual flow speed was set at a constant 20 cm/s. Visuomotor mismatches were only introduced during the experimental sessions and were achieved by briefly halting the visual flow for 0.5 s at random locations in the visual section of the tunnel where visual stimuli appeared (between 20-80 cm). Mismatches were restricted to periods where the mouse was running during closed loop sessions and periods where the mouse was stationary during open loop sessions.</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Two-photon imaging experiments were performed on a two-photon microscope (Neurolabware) equipped with a Ti-sapphire laser (Mai-Tai ‘Deepsee’, Spectraphysics; wavelength, 920 nm) and a 16×, 0.8 NA water immersion objective (Nikon) at a zoom of 1.6× for L2/3 imaging and a zoom of 2× for L5 imaging. The microscope was controlled by Scanbox (Neurolabware) running on MATLAB. Images were acquired at a frame rate of 15.5 or 31 Hz. In some sessions, we performed dual-plane imaging at 31 Hz using an electrically tunable lens (OptoTune), resulting in an effective frame rate of 15.5 Hz per plane. For L2/3 experiments, somatic imaging was performed at ∼150-300 µm depth. For L5 experiments, we recorded apical dendrites at a depth of ∼200 µm. Pupil size and position was tracked at the imaging frame rate using an IR camera (Dalsa Genie).</p>

<title>Preprocessing</title>
<p>We used the SpecSeg toolbox for preprocessing as described in detail before (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></italic>). In short, we performed rigid motion correction using NoRMCorre (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></italic>) followed by automated region-of-interest (ROI) selection based on cross-spectral power across pixels. After manual refinement, raw ROI signals were extracted and corrected for neuropil by subtracting the average pixel values in an area surrounding each ROI multiplied by 0.7. ΔF/F traces were made by subtracting a moving baseline (10<sup>th</sup> percentile over 5000 frame windows) and dividing by a linear fit over that baseline. Matching of chronically recorded neurons was performed using the chronic matching module of SpecSeg.</p>

<title>Passive sessions</title>
<p>For comparing single-cell responses between conditions we first matched neurons that we chronically imaged across multiple sessions. For subsequent analyses we only selected neurons that we found back in all sessions relevant for that analysis (e.g., pre-post or pre-tunnel-post). For statistical analyses, we took the mean ΔF/F trace over all stimuli and computed the baseline-corrected average from 0.2 to 1.2 s after stimulus onset for each cell. We removed all trials in which the running speed exceeded 1 cm/s anywhere from 1 s before until 4 s after stimulus onset.</p>
<p>To correlate activity with estimates of arousal, mice were allowed to freely run or rest in front of a gray monitor for ∼10 min. We computed the correlation coefficient between calcium activity of each cell with running speed and pupil size using the ‘corr’ function in MATLAB. For pairwise correlations between neurons within each cell type, we computed the average correlation coefficient during stationary periods (running speed &lt; 1 cm/s) for each cell with all other cells of that type within the field of view. For displaying purposes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), we z-scored single cell traces over the entire 10 min session.</p>
<p>For orientation– and direction tuning we took the baseline-corrected average from 0.2 to 1.2 s after stimulus onset for each cell. For tuning and response strength calculations in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> we only included contrasts higher than 0.7. For orientation tuning, the mean responses to the eight orientations (θ) were fit with a single circular Gaussian using nonlinear least-squares fitting as follows:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="537780v3_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where R(θ) is the response to the grating of orientation θ, C is an offset term, Rp is the response to the preferred orientation, ang<sub>ori</sub>(x)=min[abs(x), abs(x –180),abs(x +180)] wraps angular differences to the interval 0° to 90°,and σ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian. For direction tuning, the mean responses to the eight directions (θ) were fit with a double circular Gaussian:

where R(θ<sub>k</sub>) is the response to the orientation θ<sub>k</sub> (in radians). Direction tuning strength was also assessed using 1-CircVar using the following equation for directional data:

where θ<sub>k</sub> is the direction of the grating (in radians). Orientation and direction tuning responses were normalized to their maximum response before calculating 1-CircVar. Orientation and direction tuning curves used for plotting were computed by shifting the average tuning curve to the cell’s fitted preferred direction, followed by averaging across cells to compute cell type averages.</p>

<title>CNN model</title>
<p>As input to our CNN model we used spike probabilities generated using CASCADE (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></italic>) from neuronal responses to 2600 natural images. We took the single-cell average spike probability between 0 and 0.5 s after stimulus onset as the response to each natural image. To model the neuronal responses we employed a pre-trained CNN (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></italic>) (“Inception v1”) and fit a mapping function to the activations of a target layer (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></italic>). In brief, for each neuron we learned a set of 2D spatial weights (<italic>W<sub>s</sub></italic>) with size equal to the size of a channel of the target CNN layer (i.e. the pixels) and a set of feature weights (<italic>W<sub>f</sub></italic>) with size equal to the number of channels of the target CNN layer. The <italic>W<sub>s</sub></italic> learned the spatial RF of each neuron, while the <italic>W<sub>f</sub></italic> learned their feature selectivity as a weighted sum over the features of the pre-trained CNN layer. Thus, the predicted response of a neuron <italic>n</italic> <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="537780v3_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> was computed according to:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="537780v3_ueqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
Where <italic>X<sub>l</sub></italic> are the batch-normalized activations from the target CNN layer <italic>l</italic>. The weights were jointly optimized across all neurons to minimize the prediction error <italic>L<sub>error</sub></italic> regularized by a combination of a smoothing Laplacian loss (<italic>L<sub>Laplace</sub></italic>: see below) over <italic>W<sub>s</sub></italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></italic>), to encourage smooth spatial RFs, a L1 loss (ℒ<sub>1</sub>: see below) over <italic>W<sub>f</sub></italic> to encourage sparsity/selectivity of the features (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>) and a L2 loss (ℒ<sub>2</sub>: see below) over both parameters (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></italic>). Thus the cost function was computed as follows:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="537780v3_ueqn6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
Where <italic>y<sub>n</sub></italic> is the response of neuron <italic>n</italic>. The hyper-parameters (<italic>l</italic>, λ<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>, λ<italic><sub>f</sub></italic>, λ<sub>2</sub> and the learning rate) were selected using a grid search and then selecting the combination yielding the highest correlation in the training set. For all cell types, the best target CNN layer (<italic>l</italic>) was “<italic>conv2d2</italic>”. The model was implemented in PyTorch (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></italic>) and optimized with Adam (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></italic>) in 600 epochs with a batch size of 128 and early stopping (every 200 epochs, decay factor = 3).</p>
<p>After training, we generated the MEIs by optimizing the pixels in the input to maximize the response of each model neuron independently. To ensure the stability and interpretability of the MEIs, we introduced preconditioning and regularizations to avoid high-frequency artifacts (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></italic>), and specifically frequency penalization and transformations (padding, jittering, rotation and scaling). Optimization of the MEIs was done using Lucent (i.e. PyTorch implementation of Lucid (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></italic>)) with Adam (learning rate = 1e-2, weight decay = 1e-3) in 50 epochs. To generate MEIs for combinations of L5 PyCs (<bold>Fig. S2F</bold>), we first randomly chose 10 starter L5 PyCs. On each iteration we then added 5 random L5 PyCs (except for the first iteration, where we added 4) and optimized a ‘composite MEI’ by maximizing the summed responses from all neurons.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for each neuron we computed a few metrics either directly on the data or by analyzing model responses to novel stimuli. The response strength of each neuron was computed by taking the maximum response of the time-course averaged over all images, divided by the standard deviation of the response in the 200 ms before the stimulus onset. In addition to the 3,600 images used for training, we also recorded responses to 40 images that were presented 10 times each (4,000 images in total) to test the generalization performance of the model. We computed the selectivity to visual input as the sparsity of their response distribution (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></italic>), going from 0 (not sparse) to 1 (maximally sparse) as follows:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="537780v3_ueqn7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
Where <italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic> is the response to <italic>i<sup>th</sup></italic> image and 40 is the number of test images.</p>
<p>For population decoding, we performed LDA using the ‘fitcdiscr’ function in Matlab on the neuronal responses to the 40 test images. For each decoding run, we trained an LDA decoder by randomly selecting 80% of the trials and then testing the decoder on the remaining 20% of trials. We repeated this procedure 50 times to account for variability between trials. For ChCs, we used the total population (n = 34) and averaged the resulting 50 decoding accuracies. For L2/3 PyCs, we performed 1000 iterations of 50 runs each by randomly subsampling 34 neurons on each iteration. For each iteration we then averaged the 50 runs, resulting in a distribution of 1000 decoding accuracies. Statistical significance was determined using a permutation test of the average ChC decoding accuracy (12.55%) versus the distribution of 1000 L2/3 PyC accuracies. Chance level decoding was at 2.5% (40 images total).</p>
<p>We also computed the oracle correlation of each neuron by correlating the responses to multiple repetitions of the same 40 test images and then taking the average correlation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></italic>). Only neurons with an oracle correlation higher than zero were included in the model. In order to test the performance of the model we correlated the predicted responses with the recorded neuronal responses to the 40 test images (not used for training). The resulting ‘cross-validation correlations’ were largely identical to the oracle correlations for all cell types (<bold>Fig. S2B-C</bold>).</p>
<p>We computed the RF size as the full width at half maximum of a 2D Gaussian fitted to <italic>W<sub>s</sub></italic> of each neuron. Neurons with RF size &gt; 40 degrees were excluded from analysis.</p>
<p>We determined the orientation tuning by showing to the model neurons full-contrast Gabor gratings with 8 different orientations (22.5 degrees apart), 5 spatial frequencies (from 0.02 to 0.08 cycles per degree) and 2 phases (0 and 90 degrees). The orientation selectivity index (OSI) was computed using 1-CircVar as above.</p>
<p>For SF tuning we used 12 SFs (0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6). The preferred SF was defined as the SF at which the max response for each neuron occurred.</p>
<p>We measured contrast sensitivity using full screen gratings of increasing contrast (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) followed by calculating a linear fit across the contrast tuning responses. We took the slope of the fit as the contrast sensitivity for each neuron.</p>
<p>For pairwise correlations of spike probabilities between neurons within each cell type, we computed the average correlation coefficient during stationary periods (running speed &lt; 1 cm/s) for each cell with all other cells of that type within the field of view.</p>

<title>Virtual tunnel</title>
<p>For the analysis of tunnel data, we removed trials that took longer than 15 s from start until reward delivery. To compute activity as a function of location in the tunnel (0-100 cm) we divided the tunnel into 50 bins of 2 cm each and averaged activity of all frames occurring in a bin, followed by averaging over trials for each cell. Activity for each cell in the non-visual part of the tunnel was time-locked to exit from the visual part until 9 s later and subsequently averaged over trials. For this analysis we removed all trials containing visuomotor mismatch events. Locomotion traces were made by averaging locomotion speed across all trials for each session, followed by averaging normalized traces (between 0 and 1) over mice. For single-cell average activity in the visual part of the tunnel we took the mean activity between 20-80 cm and subtracted the mean activity between 0-20 cm. For the non-visual part, we averaged the entire trace for each cell.</p>
<p>For clustering, we z-scored trial-averaged traces in the visual section of the tunnel from all PyCs as input for the ‘linkage’ function in MATLAB with ‘ward’ as method. We then performed clustering using the ‘cluster’ function with the optimal number of clusters as determined by silhouette evaluation of the traces. Since the result of silhouette evaluation could not exclude the possibility that only 1 cluster was optimal, we tested the separability of the V-PyCs and NV-PyCs clusters using a permutation test. In order to do this, we first computed an average trace combined for the visual and non-visual section for each cell. We then z-scored this trace, and computed the visual response by averaging the z-scored values between 20-80 cm in the visual section of the tunnel. This procedure therefore gave us a single visual responsiveness value for each cell. Next, we binned this distribution of visual responsiveness over neurons into <italic>n</italic> bins, and normalized the sum of all counts to 1, such that <italic>P</italic> and <italic>Q</italic> describe the discretized probability mass functions for the V-PyCs and NV-PyCs respectively. We then calculated the separability in visual responsiveness between the V-PyCs and NV-PyCs clusters using the Bhattacharyya distance (BD):
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="537780v3_ueqn8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
Here, <italic>P<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>Q<sub>i</sub></italic> are the frequencies of samples in ‘visual response’ bin <italic>i</italic>. The real data we observed gave a BD of 0.4262. Finally, we quantified whether this separability value was higher than could be expected by chance, and therefore whether the V-PyCs and NV-PyCs groups indeed represented distinct clusters. To this end, we generated a distribution of 1000 randomized BD values obtained by shuffling the visual and non-visual responses of all cells, and repeating the procedure as described above. Statistical significance was determined using a permutation test of 0.4262 versus the distribution of 1000 shuffle-randomized populations.</p>
<p>We calculated mismatch responses after correcting for location of the mismatch events, as spatial location in the tunnel can modulate activity of V1 cells even when visual input is identical(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></italic>, <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></italic>). First, we averaged activity across mismatch trials for each cell. For each mismatch event we then randomly subsampled from control trials (without mismatch events) at identical locations in the tunnel. We repeated this 100 times and subtracted the average trace over repetitions from the real mismatch trace before baseline-correcting for each neuron. Mismatch amplitude was calculated by taking the average of the corrected trace between 0.2 and 1.2 s after mismatch onset. We z-scored each neuron’s visual, non-visual and visuomotor mismatch trace for display purposes only (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Locomotion onset traces were based on running onsets in the non-visual part of the tunnel. Onsets were defined as the first frame in the non-visual section (and after reward delivery) where the average running speed was less than 5 cm/s in a 0.5 s interval preceding the frame, and more than 5 cm/s in the 2 s following the frame. Responses were defined as the baseline-corrected average between 0 and 2 s after onset.</p>
<p>Closed loop visual flow onset traces were made by time-locking (rather than distance) each trial to the start of the visual section. Responses were quantified as the baseline-corrected average between 0.5 and 2 s after trial onset, as the first 20 cm of the tunnel contained no visual stimuli. Only trials that took less than 10 s in the visual section were included in this analysis.</p>
<p>During open loop sessions, the running speed of the mice was uncoupled from visual flow speed, which was fixed at 20 cm/s and followed the regular trial structure. Open loop visual flow onsets were defined as the start of the visual section in trials where the mouse was stationary throughout the visual section. Open loop VF halts were defined as 0.5 s pauses in the VF during stationary trials in open loop condition. For comparison of closed loop mismatch with open loop VF halt we only included trials in closed loop condition during which locomotion speed at mismatch onset was between 5 and 30 cm/s such that the average onset speed was similar as during open loop VF halts (20 cm/s).</p>
<p>Correlations of ChC activity with V-PyCs and NV-PyCs were performed by computing a correlation coefficient on the average ΔF/F trace of the visual and non-visual section combined between pairs of cells. For each ChC, we then averaged the correlation coefficients of that ChC with all V-PyCs or NV-PyCs in that session.</p>

<title>Chemogenetic experiments</title>
<p>For passive chemogenetic experiments we used naïve mice injected with AAV9-CaMKIIa-GCaMP6f along with the inhibitory DREADD AAV1-hDlx-dlox-KORD-mCyRFP1 (KORD group) or AAV1-hDlx-dlox-ChrimsonR-tdTomato (Control group). We recorded activity of PyCs and ChCs for 15 min under gray screen conditions, after which mice were injected with SalB (10 mg/kg in saline, s.c.). Five minutes later, we again recorded activity for 15 minutes. Mice were allowed to run or rest freely. For the analysis of overall activity before and after injection of SalB, we calculated the average ΔF/F of all frames in both recordings for each cell, before averaging over cells for each type. Locomotion modulation curves were computed for each cell by averaging activity over all frames during which the mouse was running at defined speeds within a range. The first bin contained frames during which the mouse was fully stationary (speed = 0 cm/s). All subsequent bins contained frames during which the running speed was between that bin and the previous bin (i.e., bin ‘10’ contained speeds 5-10 cm/s). Speeds &gt;20 cm/s were not included in the analysis as several mice did not reach those speeds in either of the sessions. To get the final population curves we averaged over cells for each type. We computed a linear fit over all samples of activity and running speeds for each cell and session and took the coefficients estimates as the intercept and slope. We then averaged over cells for each type. The locomotion modulation index (LMI) was calculated for each cell as follows:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="537780v3_ueqn9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
Where Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F<sub>run</sub></italic> is the average activity during frames when the mouse was running (&gt;1 cm/s) and Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F<sub>stat</sub></italic> is the average activity during frames when the mouse was not running (&lt;1 cm/s). We then computed a correlation coefficient between the LMI and the difference in ΔF/F due to ChC silencing.</p>
<p>To calculate whether individual neurons were significantly affected by the SalB injection we compared activity before and after injection for each neuron by comparing the within session differences in activity (random fluctuations within the pre session) with the between session differences in activity (pre versus post) using a permutation test as follows. First, to reduce the correlations between subsequent frames we averaged activity in 30 frame (∼2 s) bins, resulting in ‘n’ bins. Next, to calculate within session differences in activity, we split the binned pre session in two halves and calculated the difference in activity between both halves. We repeated this procedure ‘n’ number of times, circularly shifting the starting point for splitting the data by one bin on each iteration, resulting in a permutation distribution of n-bin intra-differences in activity. To calculate the between session differences in activity, we used the same procedure but instead compared the first halves of the pre and the post session. In addition, we randomized the starting point for splitting the data of the post session. We computed significance for each cell using a permutation test on the averaged inter difference activity values versus the intra difference permutation distribution.</p>

<p>At ∼3 months of age, mice were sacrificed for preparation of acute brain slices containing V1. Mice were deeply anesthetized by application of pentobarbital s.p. (60 mg/kg bodyweight).

The brain was swiftly removed and submerged in NMDG-ACSF (composition see above). 300 μm thick coronal slices were cut using a Leica VT 1200S vibratome (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar Germany). Slices were allowed to recover for 15 min. at 35 °C in NMDG-ACSF.

Cells were visualized with a 40× water immersion objective (Achroplan, NA 0.8, IR 40×/0.80 W, Carl Zeiss Microscopy) with infrared optics and oblique contrast illumination. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Harvard Apparatus) to an open tip resistance of 4 – 5 MΩ and filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM) 130 K-Gluconate, 10 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na2-GTP, and 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine (pH 7.25, ∼280 mOsm) for recordings of ChCs. Patch-clamp recordings were either performed with an Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices) or a Dagan BVC-700A (Dagan Corporation). Signals were analogue low-pass filtered at 10 kHz (Bessel) and digitally sampled at 50 kHz using an A-D converter (ITC-18, HEKA Elektronik Dr. Schulze GmbH) and the data acquisition software Axograph X (v.1.5.4, Axograph Scientific). Bridge-balance and capacitances were fully compensated in current clamp. Series resistance was compensated to &gt; 75% in voltage clamp. The ChCs were identified as mCyRFP-positive neurons in layer 2/3 of V1 which had a characteristic high-frequency firing pattern (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>).

<p>For mapping of RSC inputs to ChCs, we patched ChCs that were surrounded by a high density of eYFP+ axons. We flashed brief pulses of blue light (10% laser power, resulting in an output intensity of 5.7 mW) with the 470 nm laser line of a laser diode illuminator (LDI-7, 89 North, USA) through the imaging objective above the cell soma and apical dendrites. We recorded the postsynaptic currents in voltage-clamp mode with a –60 mV holding potential and postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) were acquired in current clamp mode at <italic>I</italic> = 0 holding. For confirmation of monosynaptic inputs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></italic>), we first washed in TTX to the bath (5 min.) to block all action potential induced synaptic release and measured the optogenetically induced PSPs. Next, we applied for 5 minutes the specific sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX, 500 nM, Tocris) in combination with potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 1 mM, Tocris) to facilitate transmitter release at monosynaptic connections from RSC to ChC and recorded the PSP amplitudes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). For characterization of the synaptic connection type (facilitating or depressing) we stimulated with a series of five pulses (5ms, 20Hz).

<p>For ChC bouton quantification we used 5 naive and 3 trained mice injected with AAV9-CaMKII-GCaMP6f and AAV5-hSyn1-flex-ChrimsonR-tdTomato. For AIS quantification we used an additional two trained mice injected with AAV9-CaMKII-GCaMP6f and AAV1-CAG-flex-mRuby2-GCaMP6f. Mice were perfused with 15 ml of ice-cold PBS followed by 30 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were extracted and post-fixed for 2 hours in 4% PFA at 4°C. Brain were cut in 50 µm slices and selected for staining such that there was ∼200 µm between slices. A total of 2 to 3 slices containing V1 were used for staining per mouse. We used the following antibodies: Guinea pig-anti-RFP (Synaptic Systems, #390004, 1:500), Rabbit-β-IV-Spectrin (Biotrend, provided by Maren Engelhardt, 1:500), Goat-anti-guinea pig Alexa Fluor 594 (Thermofisher, #A11076, 1:1000), Goat-anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermofisher, #A32733, 1:1000). For the staining, slices were blocked for 90 min in 10% normal goat serum (NGS) and 0.5% Triton in PBS followed by incubation in primary antibodies overnight (5% NGS and 0.5% Triton in PBS). After three washing steps the slices were incubated with secondary antibodies for 120 min at room temperature. After three more washing steps slices were mounted on SuperFrost Plus glass slides (Fisher Scientific) using fluorescence-preserving mounting medium (Vectashield). Imaging was performed with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope using a 63× N.A. 1.40 oil-immersion objective at a frame size of 1024 x 1024 pixels. We collected z-stack images at 0.5 µm steps. Z-stacked images were processed in Neurolucida (MBF Bioscience) and AISs and ChC boutons were manually traced. We only included AISs that had a clear beginning and end.</p>

<title>Retrograde tracing</title>
<p>Adult Vipr2-Cre mice were unilaterally injected with 90 nl of AAV5-hDlx-DIO-eYFP-t2A-TVA and AAV9-hDlx-DIO-oG(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></italic>) in V1 (2.8 mm lateral and 0.5 mm anterior from lambda at a depth of 300 µm) followed by RabV-envA-mCherry 26 days later. After 7 days, mice were perfused as described above and their brains post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4°C. After cryoprotection (48 h in 30% sucrose at 4°C) and snap freezing in liquid nitrogen slices were stored at –80°C before sectioning. We made 75 µm thick coronal slices using a cryostat (CM3050 S, Leica) and mounted sections on superFrost Plus glass slides (Fisher Scientific) using Vectashield mounting medium. Imaging for quantification was performed with an Axioscan.Z1 slide scanner (ZEISS, Germany) at 20× and a Leica SP8 confocal microscope using a 40× (NA 1.4) and 63× (NA 1.40) oil-immersion objective at a resolution of 1024×1024.</p>
<p>To quantify the mCherry+ input cells, we followed the QUINT workflow(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></italic>). First, we manually inspected and organized individual images using QuPath and converted them from .czi to .png and .tif in MATLAB. Next, we trained a pixel/object classifier in Ilastik (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></italic>) on a representative subset of images from each mouse and used it to subsequently segment all images for all mice. The output from Ilastik was then recolored using ImageJ. Finally, we registered the slice images to the Allen Brain Reference Atlas using quickNII(<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></italic>) and quantified them using Nutil and MATLAB.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All statistical details for each experiment are shown in figures and figure legends and in <bold>Table S1</bold>. Statistics on slice physiology experiments were performed using Prism9 (GraphPad Software). All other statistical analyses were performed using Linear Mixed Effects Models (LMEM, ‘fitlme’ function in MATLAB) or permutation tests. For LMEM, we considered the response parameter (e.g., visual response magnitude) as a fixed effect and session/mouse as random effect. LMEM takes into account that samples (e.g. neurons) might not be fully independent (e.g. they were obtained from the same session/mouse). We performed a one-way ANOVA on the LMEM followed by a post-hoc coefTest using Tukey’s HSD to correct for multiple comparisons. Box plots represent the median, the 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the distributions.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> work shows <bold>compelling</bold> evidence that Chandelier cells in the visual cortex receive inputs most prominently from local layer 5 pyramidal neurons, only mildly inhibit L2/3 pyramidal neurons, and respond massively to visuomotor mismatch. It also indicates that visual experience in the virtual tunnel activates a plasticity mechanism in Chandelier cells which could be due to the particular visuo-motor coupling experienced in this setting, although a specific control is lacking for this conclusion. This study will be of interest to neuroscientists involved in cortical circuits, visual processing, and predictive coding research.</p>

<p>Overall, the experiments are well-designed and the results of the study are exciting. We have one major concern, as well as a few minor comments that are detailed in the following.</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>
1. The authors suggest that &quot;Visuomotor experience induces functional and structural plasticity of chandelier cells&quot;. One puzzling thing here, however, is that mice constantly experience visuomotor coupling throughout life which is not different from experience in the virtual tunnel. Why do the authors think that the coupled experience in the VR induces stronger experience-dependent changes than the coupled experience in the home cage? Could this be a time-dependent effect (e.g. arousal levels could systematically decrease with the number of head-fixed VR sessions)? The control experiment here would be to have a group of mice that experience similar visual flow without coupling between movement and visual flow feedback. Either change would be experience-dependent of course, but having the &quot;visuomotor experience dependent&quot; in the title might be a bit strong given the lack of control for that. We would suggest changing the pitch of the manuscript to one of the conclusions the authors can make cleanly (e.g. Figure 4).</p>
<p>Minor:</p>
<p>
2. &quot;ChCs shape the communication hierarchy of cortical networks providing visual and contextual information.&quot; We are not sure what this means.</p>
<p>3. &quot;respond to locomotion and visuomotor mismatch, indicating arousal-related activity&quot; This is not clear. We think we understand what the authors mean but would suggest rephrasing.</p>
<p>4. 'based on morphological properties revealed that 87% (287/329) of labeled neurons were ChCs&quot; Please specify the morphological properties used for the classification somewhere in the methods.</p>
<p>5. We may have missed this - in the patch clamp experiment (Fig.1 H-K), please add information about how many mice/slices these experiments were performed in.</p>
<p>6. &quot;These findings suggest that the rabies-labeled L1-4 neurons providing monosynaptic input to ChCs are predominantly inhibitory neurons&quot;. We are not sure this conclusion is warranted given the sparse set of neurons labelled and the low number of cells recorded in the paired patch experiment. We would suggest properly testing (e.g. stain for GABA on the rabies data) or rephrasing.</p>
<p>7. Figure 2E. A direct comparison of dF/F across different cell types can be subject to a problematic interpretation. The transfer function from spikes to calcium can be different from cell type to cell type. Additionally, the two cell populations have been marked with different constructs (despite the fact that it's the same GECI) further reducing the reliability of dF/F comparisons. We would recommend using a different representation here that does not rely on a direct comparison of dF/F responses (e.g. like the &quot;response strength&quot; used in Figure 3B). Assuming calcium dynamics are different in ChCs and PyCs - this similarity in calcium response is likely a coincidence.</p>
<p>8. If ChCs are more strongly driven by locomotion and arousal, then it's a bit counterintuitive that at the beginning of the visual corridor when locomotion speed consistently increases, the activity of ChCs consistently decreases. This does not appear to be driven by suppression by visual stimuli as it is present also in the first and last 20cm of the tunnel where there are no visual stimuli. How do the authors explain this?</p>
<p>9. The authors mention that &quot;ChC responses underwent sensory-evoked plasticity during the repeated visual exposure, even though the visual stimuli were different from those encountered during training in the virtual tunnel&quot;. How would this work? And would this mean all visual responses are reduced? What is special about the visual experience in the virtual tunnel? It does not inherently differ from visual experience in the home cage, given that the test stimuli (full field gratings) are different from both.</p>
<p>10. Just as a point to consider for future experiments: For the open-loop control experiments, the visual flow is constant (20cm/s) - ideally, this would be a replay of the running speed the mouse previously generated to match statistics.</p>
<p>11. We would recommend specifying the parameters used for neuropil correction in the methods section.</p>
<p>12. If we understand correctly, the F0 used for the dF/F calculation is different from that used for division. Why is this?</p>
<p>13. Authors compare neuronal responses using &quot;baseline-corrected average&quot;. Please specify the parameters of the baseline correction (i.e. what is used as baseline here).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Seignette et al. investigated the potential roles of axo-axonic (chandelier) cells (ChCs) in a sensory system, namely visual processing. As introduced by the authors, the axo-axonic cell type has remained (and still is) somehow mysterious in its function. Seignette and colleagues leveraged the development of a transgenic mouse line selective for ChC, and applied a very wide range of techniques: transsynaptic rabies tracing, optogenetic input activation, in vitro electrophysiology, 2-photon recording in vivo, behavior and chemogenetic manipulations, to precisely determine the contribution of ChCs to the primary visual cortex network.</p>
<p>The main findings are 1) the identification of synaptic inputs to ChC, with a majority of local, deep layer principal neurons (PN), 2) the demonstration that ChC is strongly and synchronously activated by visual stimuli with low specificity in naive animals, 3) the recruitment of ChC by arousal/visuomotor mismatch, 4) the induction of functional and structural plasticity at the ChC-PN module, and, 5) the weak disinhibition of PNs induced by ChCs silencing. All these findings are strongly supported by experimental data and thoroughly compared to available evidence.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This article reports an impressive range of very demanding experiments, which were well executed and analyzed, and are presented in a very clear and balanced manner. Moreover, the manuscript is well-written throughout, making it appealing to future readers. It has also been a pleasure to review this article.</p>
<p>In sum, this is an impressive study and an excellent manuscript, that presents no major flaws.</p>
<p>Notably, this study is one of the first studies to report on the activities and potential roles of axo-axonic cells in an active, integrated brain process, beyond locomotion as reported and published in V1. This type of research was much awaited in the fields of interneuron and vision research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are no fundamental weaknesses; the latter mainly concern the presentation of the main results.</p>
<p>The main weakness may be that the different sections appear somehow disconnected conceptually.</p>
<p>Additionally, some parts deserve a more in-depth clarification/simplification of concepts and analytic methods for scientists outside the subfield of V1 research. Indeed, this paper will be of key interest to researchers of various backgrounds.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors set out to characterize the anatomical connectivity profile and the functional responses of chandelier cells (ChCs) in the mouse primary visual cortex. Using retrograde rabies tracing, optogenetics, and in vitro electrophysiology, they found that the primary source of input to ChCs are local layer 5 pyramidal cells, as well as long-range thalamic and cortical connections. ChCs provided input to local layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, but did not receive reciprocal connections.</p>
<p>With two-photon calcium imaging recordings during passive viewing of drifting gratings, the authors showed that ChCs exhibit weakly selective visual responses, high correlations within their own population, and strong responses during periods of arousal (assessed by locomotion and pupil size). These results were replicated and extended in experiments with natural images and prediction of receptive field structure using a convolutional neural network.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the authors employed a learned visuomotor task in a virtual corridor to show that ChCs exhibit strong responses to mismatches between visual flow and locomotion, locomotion-related activation (similar to what was shown above), and visually-evoked suppression. They also showed the existence of two clusters of pyramidal neurons with functionally different responses - a cluster with &quot;classically visual&quot; responses and a cluster with locomotion- and mismatch-driven responses (the latter more correlated with ChCs). Comparing naive and trained mice, the authors found that visual responses of ChCs are suppressed following task learning, accompanied by a shortening of the axon initial segment (AIS) of pyramidal cells and an increase in the proportion of AIS contacted by ChCs. However, additional controls would be required to identify which component(s) of the experimental paradigm led to the functional and anatomical changes observed.</p>
<p>Finally, using a chemogenetic inactivation of ChCs, the authors propose weak connectivity to pyramidal cells (due to small effects in pyramidal cell activity). However, these results are not unequivocally supported, as the baseline activity of ChCs before inactivation is considerably lower, suggesting a potentially confounding homeostatic plasticity mechanism might already be operating.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors bring a comprehensive, state-of-the-art methodology to bear, including rabies tracing, in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, in vitro electrophysiology, optogenetics and chemogenetics, and deep neural networks. Their analyses and statistical tests are sound and for the most part, support their claims. Their results are in line with previous findings and extend them to the primary visual cortex.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
- Some of the results (e.g. arousal-related responses) are not entirely surprising given that similar results exist in other cortical areas.</p>
<p>- Control analyses regarding locomotion patterns before and after learning the task (Figure 5), and additional control experiments to identify whether functional and anatomical changes following task learning were due to learning, repeated visual exposure, exposure to reward, or visuomotor experience would strengthen the claims made.</p>
<p>- The strength of the results of the chemogenetics experiment is impacted by the lower baseline activity of ChCs that express the KORD receptor. At present, it is not possible to exclude the presence of homeostatic plasticity in the network *before* the inactivation takes place.</p>
