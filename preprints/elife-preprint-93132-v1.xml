<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>Y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an important inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter that exerts its biological function by binding to GABA receptors, which not only play an important role in neuromodulation, but also involved in regulating the development of tumors. Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit delta (<italic>GABRD</italic>) encodes the δ subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, its impact on breast cancer has not been clearly studied. This study is aiming to reveal the relationship between <italic>GABRD</italic> and breast cancer development.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We performed a tissue microarray to quantify <italic>GABRD</italic> expression levels in tumor tissue and paracarcinoma tissue. The regulation of <italic>GABRD</italic> in the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of breast cancer was examined by a loss-of-function study. A GeneChip microarray was used to probe GABRD for potential downstream molecules. The interaction between GABRD and CDK1 was verified by a set of functional tests and rescue experiments as well as coimmunoprecipitation.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p><italic>GABRD</italic> was expressed at significantly higher levels in tumor tissues and was associated with advanced tumor progression. Silencing <italic>GABRD</italic> resulted in a significant decrease in proliferation and migration and an increase in apoptosis of breast cancer. <italic>GABRD</italic> regulated the cell cycle by directly interacting with CDK1, which was identified as an important downstream target.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p><italic>GABRD</italic> is the breast cancer-related gene and highlights the importance of the GABRD–CDK1 axis in regulating breast cancer proliferation, which provides potential for the development of novel therapeutics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy and the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with approximately 2.26 million new cases in 2020, making breast cancer the world’s most prevalent cancer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Currently, breast cancer treatment mainly consists of the combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormonal therapy. The precise treatment of tumors by molecular-targeted therapy has recently appeared to be an important method, providing additional therapeutic options for several molecular subtypes of breast cancer and improving treatment outcomes. However, breast cancer treatment is limited by the lack of more effective targets and drugs. Therefore, identifying novel and effective biomarkers may improve breast cancer prognoses and provide new therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>As the predominant and most prevalent inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is involved in GABAergic signaling to mediate the synaptic inhibition of neuronal activity in the mammalian brain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). GABA transmits signals by binding with its receptors, which mainly include GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The most closely related receptor, the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, is a pentamer assembled from multiple subunits that form a chloride channel(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Among them, the δ subunit is encoded by the <italic>GABRD</italic> gene. <italic>GABRD</italic> gene abnormalities have been found to be closely related to spontaneous epilepsy and have attracted the attention of researchers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Most previous studies on <italic>GABRD</italic> have focused on neurological diseases, and several studies have recently revealed the possible functional role of <italic>GABRD</italic> in tumors. Studies based on genomics datasets including mRNA expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database showed that <italic>GABRD</italic> expression was associated with corticotrophinomas, hepatocellular carcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma and other tumors, which indicated that <italic>GABRD</italic> might serve as a potential biomarker to predict patient prognoses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). However, little is known about the involvement of <italic>GABRD</italic> in the tumorigenesis and progression of breast cancer.</p>
<p>Herein, <italic>GABRD</italic> expression levels in breast cancer and normal tissue samples from patients combined with their correlations with clinical–pathological characteristics were analyzed by tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry (IHC). We identified <italic>GABRD</italic> as a key gene in breast cancer tumorigenesis and progression. Then, we knocked down <italic>GABRD</italic> in MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cell lines through lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) silencing. <italic>GABRD</italic> functions in cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis were investigated in the aforementioned cell lines and xenograft mouse models. GeneChip microarray analysis revealed that CDK1 is a critical target protein regulated by <italic>GABRD</italic>, which was verified by gene rescue experiments. Our research aimed to evaluate the role of <italic>GABRD</italic> in breast cancer progression and unveil the potential associated mechanisms.</p>

<p>Breast cancer expression profile was obtained from the TCGA database and the normal tissue RNA-seq profile was obtained from the TCGA database and GTEx database. By comparing the expression differences of GABA<sub>A</sub>R and GABA<sub>B</sub>R subunits in tumor and normal tissues, it was found that GABRD was highly expressed in breast tumors and the difference was the most significant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). GABRD expression in breast cancer tissue and normal tissue was then determined by tissue microarrays. Representative images are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>. We found that GABRD expression in breast cancer tissue was markedly increased compared with that in paracarcinoma tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, C</xref>). A total of 55.6% of tumor tissues showed high <italic>GABRD</italic> expression, while 0% of paracarcinoma tissues showed high <italic>GABRD</italic> expression (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). By combining the IHC analysis results with clinicopathological information, we found that <italic>GABRD</italic> expression possessed a significant correlation with the clinical stage, T-cell infiltration and tumor size (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, according to Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, <italic>GABRD</italic> gene expression was significantly related to the overall survival of breast cancer patients, suggesting that high <italic>GABRD</italic> expression predicted a more unfavorable prognosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Knockdown of <italic>GABRD</italic> expression inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion potential of breast cancer cells and enhanced apoptosis</title>
<p>After cell lines with stable <italic>GABRD</italic> knockdown were constructed using lentiviral-mediated shRNA interference, the effects of <italic>GABRD</italic> knockdown on cell proliferation were assessed by cell counting using Celigo. The numbers of cells in the sh<italic>GABRD</italic> and shCtrl groups within five days after lentivirus infection was recorded over time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Compared with the shCtrl group, the sh<italic>GABRD</italic> group showed significantly inhibited cell proliferation in both MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cell lines (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001).</p>

<p>The wound healing assay and transwell assay were used to measure cell migration and invasion. In the wound healing assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), we found that the relative cell migration distance was significantly shorter in the sh<italic>GABRD</italic> group than in the shCtrl group. The 30 h MDA-MB-231 cell migration rate in the sh<italic>GABRD</italic> group was reduced by 35% (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001). The 48 h BT-549 cell migration rate in the sh<italic>GABRD</italic> group was reduced by 76% (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001). The Transwell metastasis rate in the sh<italic>GABRD</italic> group was decreased by 93% in the MDA-MB-231 cell line (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001) and 82% in the BT-549 cell line (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001) compared with the shCtrl group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). This indicated that MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 breast cancer cells exhibited significantly reduced invasive tendencies after <italic>GABRD</italic> knockdown.</p>
<p>Flow cytometry assays were performed to further detect the effects of <italic>GABRD</italic> on apoptosis and the cell cycle distribution. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> shows a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the sh<italic>GABRD</italic> group compared with the shCtrl group (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001) in both cell lines. Furthermore, the relevant genes in the human apoptosis signaling pathway were also detected using an apoptosis antibody array. Compared with the shCtrl group, the expression of Bax, Caspase3, Fas, p27, p53, and SMAC was significantly higher in the sh<italic>GABRD</italic> group, but the expression of IGF-II, Survivin, sTNF-R1, and XIAP was significantly lower in the sh<italic>GABRD</italic> group (Fig. S1). Cell cycle analysis revealed a significant increase in the number of sh<italic>GABRD</italic> cells in G2 phase compared with the shCtrl group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). The results indicated that the inhibitory effect of <italic>GABRD</italic> knockdown on cell proliferation was most likely mediated by G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.</p>

<p>The tumorigenicity of <italic>GABRD</italic> was further tested in a nude mouse assay in which <italic>GABRD</italic> knockdown cells (sh<italic>GABRD</italic>) and normal negative control MDA-MB-231 cells (shCtrl) were inoculated subcutaneously, and tumor growth was assessed. The tumors in the two groups of nude mice are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>.

Tumor growth was monitored using luciferase imaging. The quantitative analysis of fluorescence expression showed that expression in the sh<italic>GABRD</italic> group was significantly lower than that in the shCtrl group, and the tumor weights followed the same trend (<italic>p&lt;</italic>0.01, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, D</xref>). In addition, H&amp;E staining and Ki-67 staining showed that Ki-67 expression in the tumors of the sh<italic>GABRD</italic> group was lower than that in the shCtrl group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>), which further verified that <italic>GABRD</italic> knockdown inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>GABRD regulates breast cancer progression by modulating CDK1</title>
<p>To further investigate the mechanism by which <italic>GABRD</italic> modulates breast cancer progression, we searched for potential downstream target genes of <italic>GABRD</italic> by IPA analysis based on Affymetrix GeneChip data. In total, 1008 genes were differentially expressed between <italic>GABRD</italic> knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells and normal control cells. After <italic>GABRD</italic> knockdown, 250 genes were upregulated, and 758 genes were downregulated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Subsequently, these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were subjected to enrichment analysis based on the IPA database. Notably, we found that DEGs were more concentrated in cell cycle regulatory signaling pathways, such as G2/M checkpoint regulation and estrogen-mediated S-phase entry (Fig. S2A). The disease and function enrichment of the DEGs also included cancer and the cell cycle (Fig. S2B). This result indicated that the downstream regulation of <italic>GABRD</italic> was closely related to the cell cycle.</p>

<p>We constructed a network of gene–gene interactions among HMGB1 signaling, estrogen-mediated S-phase entry, the IGF-1 signaling pathway, and other interacting genes with <italic>GABRD</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Among these interactions, <italic>GABRD</italic> could indirectly affect HMGB1 signaling, estrogen-mediated S-phase entry, the IGF-1 signaling pathway, and several downstream genes, such as <italic>AKT2</italic> and <italic>CDK1</italic>. Based on the above results, we then concentrated on potential downstream genes associated with <italic>GABRD</italic>-induced breast cancer tumorigenesis using q-PCR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Based on the gene expression changes in candidate downstream genes after <italic>GABRD</italic> knockdown, we selected several genes that were significantly decreased, including <italic>CDK1, CDCA3, CDCA5, MYC, ERK, P-ERK, CCND1</italic>, and <italic>PI3KCA</italic>. Next, we used western blotting to separately verify the expression of potential downstream genes. After lentivirus infection, compared with the shCtrl group, the expression of <italic>CDK1, CDCA3</italic>, and <italic>MYC</italic> in the sh<italic>GABRD</italic> group was downregulated, and the expression of <italic>CDCA5</italic> did not change significantly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Based on the above results, we assumed that <italic>CDK1</italic> was a potential downstream gene of <italic>GABRD</italic> and conducted a coimmunoprecipitation assay (co-IP) for verification (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). The results showed that the whole-cell lysate contained CDK1 and GABRD proteins. Subsequently, the whole-cell lysates of the control and CDK1-FLAG groups were immunoprecipitated with the FLAG antibody, and the obtained proteins were detected with GABRD, CDK1, and FLAG antibodies. The results showed a clear GABRD band, indicating an interaction between GABRD and CDK1.</p>

<title>GABRD modulates CDK1 to promote cell proliferation by influencing the cell cycle and G2/M transition</title>
<p>As mentioned above, <italic>GABRD</italic> showed a great impact on the cell cycle, and we performed cell cycle analysis to further verify the mechanism by which the GABRD–CDK1 axis affects breast cancer progression.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel receptor that mediates rapid synaptic transmission inhibitory effects under physiological conditions. Various neuropsychiatric diseases are associated with GABA signaling, such as schizophrenia, depression, epilepsy, and posttraumatic stress disorder syndrome. GABRD is the δ subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, and its main function is still under investigation. Most studies have shown that <italic>GABRD</italic> is closely related to the occurrence of various neurological and mental disorder-related symptoms and diseases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Recently, some studies have reported the <italic>GABRD</italic> gene expression levels are involved in the development of several malignancies. In particular, the mutation and overexpression of <italic>GABRD</italic> can cause the proliferation of tumor cells, especially in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, and breast invasive carcinoma(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Andrew M. Gross reported that increased <italic>GABRD</italic> levels that could lead to functional changes in the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor might play a role in tumor cell differentiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Despite these studies, the role and mechanism of <italic>GABRD</italic> in breast cancer are still unknown. Our study, for the first time, revealed the relationship between <italic>GABRD</italic> and breast cancer.</p>
<p>In this study, we gained insight into the difference in <italic>GABRD</italic> gene expression between tumor tissues and normal tissues in breast cancer patients and its correlations with clinicopathological data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The tissue microarray results showed that <italic>GABRD</italic> was overexpressed in breast cancer tissues, which was also closely related to clinical progression and survival. To further verify our conclusion, we analyzed breast cancer and paracarcinoma tissue expression data from the TCGA database and compared the expression levels of <italic>GABRD</italic>, and the results also indicated that <italic>GABRD</italic> was upregulated in breast cancer tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>GABRD</italic> might be related to aggressive tumor features, such as tumor size and clinical stage (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, it significantly affects the prognoses and survival of patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>)</p>
<p>The effects of <italic>GABRD</italic> on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer were explored (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). After <italic>GABRD</italic> knockdown, breast cancer cells exhibited suppressed proliferation and increased apoptosis. The expression of apoptosis-related molecules, such as Bax, p27, and p53, also showed significant differences. In addition, <italic>GABRD</italic> knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, suggesting a role in breast cancer metastasis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The critical role of <italic>GABRD</italic> was also confirmed in a xenograft mouse model test, which showed a decreased tumor burden according to tumor size and fluorescence analyses in the <italic>GABRD</italic>-knockdown group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In summary, we demonstrated that <italic>GABRD</italic> expression was associated with malignant behaviors of breast cancer cells. <italic>GABRD</italic> could contribute to the development and progression of breast cancer through various factors.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we explored the mechanisms and key downstream genes potentially regulated by <italic>GABRD</italic>. Through Affymetrix GeneChip analysis and IPA analysis, several potential downstream genes of <italic>GABRD</italic> were selected and then verified by q-PCR and western blotting (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). We found that <italic>CDK1</italic> was tightly associated with <italic>GABRD</italic> expression and might act as a key downstream gene of <italic>GABRD</italic> to regulate breast cancer cell processes. Thereafter, the co-IP test also showed a direct interaction between CDK1 and GABRD. These results revealed that CDK1 acts as a downstream molecule of GABRD and exerts its tumor-regulating function.</p>
<p>The <italic>GABRD</italic>-induced enhancement of proliferation and migration was abrogated by the knockdown of <italic>CDK1</italic>, indicating that <italic>GABRD</italic> regulated tumor characteristics in breast cancer by affecting <italic>CDK1</italic>. For further verification, a rescue experiment using a nude mouse orthotopic breast tumor model was performed. The tumor-suppressing effect of <italic>GABRD</italic> knockdown was rescued by <italic>CDK1</italic> overexpression. The <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment strongly suggested that the interaction of <italic>GABRD</italic> with <italic>CDK1</italic> affected breast cancer development.</p>
<p>CDK1 is a highly conserved protein that functions as a serine/threonine kinase. Through the phosphorylation of a diverse set of substrates, including apoptosis and cell cycle regulators, by CDK1 complexes and their cyclin partners, CDK1 can regulate transitions through distinct cell cycle phases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Previous studies have indicated that <italic>CDK1</italic> overexpression promotes the oncogenesis and progression of several cancers, and <italic>CDK1</italic> inhibition could lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). In addition, Kim et al. found that breast cancer patients with high CDK1 and CDK2 activity had markedly reduced 5-year relapse-free survival compared to breast cancer patients with low CDK1 and CDK2 activity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Moreover, as proposed by Liu et al., CDK1 inhibition has a therapeutic effect on triple-negative breast cancer by inhibiting tumor growth and inducing cell apoptosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), implying that <italic>CDK1</italic> can serve as a potential key gene affecting the outcomes of breast cancer patients. The CDK1/cyclin B1 complex is crucial in regulating the G2-M phase transition based on previous studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Thus, we assumed that <italic>GABRD</italic> could promote tumor proliferation by regulating CDK1 and accelerating the G2/M phase transition. This was verified by flow cytometry detection of the cell cycle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, S3). More cells were arrested in G2 phase after <italic>GABRD</italic> knockdown. In addition, the number of cells in G2 phase was significantly reduced after <italic>GABRD</italic> overexpression, which could be restored by <italic>CDK1</italic> knockdown. In summary, <italic>GABRD</italic> promoted breast cancer proliferation by directly regulating CDK1 to affect the cell cycle, especially in the G2/M phase transition.</p>
<p>Currently, there are many studies and applications of CDK4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer treatment, which can effectively block progression of tumor cells from G1 phase to S phase(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as Palbociclib, are already available on the market. There are few studies on CDK1 inhibitors for treating breast cancer, leaving a broad gap. CDK1 inhibitors can play a significant role in specific tumor subtypes. For instance, MYC-dependent breast cancer cells were sensitive to CDK1 inhibition, excluding CDK4/6 or CDK2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), and aggressive breast tumors with c-myc overexpression were more sensitive to CDK1/2 inhibitors than CDK4/6(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Therefore, CDK1 inhibitors are worthy of further study as potential therapies for specific breast cancer subtypes. As an effective target, GABRD synergistic therapy is expected to promote CDK1 inhibitor function.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our research provides new insights into understanding <italic>GABRD</italic>-mediated CDK1 activation and promotion in breast cancer tumorigenesis. <italic>GABRD</italic> can provide a target for further cell cycle-related therapy development and a potential enhancement of the anticancer effects of CDK1 inhibitors. Further studies regarding the role of <italic>GABRD</italic> and its specific downstream pathway based on CDK1 would be worthwhile. Bitarget combination therapy based on GABRD and CDK1 could also prove helpful based on possible animal and clinical research in the future.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The paper titled &quot;GABRD promotes the progression of breast cancer through CDK1-dependent cell cycle regulation&quot; investigates the role of GABRD, a subunit of the GABAA receptor, in breast cancer progression and its potential association with CDK1-dependent cell cycle regulation. The study is commendable for shedding light on the role of GABRD in breast cancer, but a few areas can be further improved to enhance the significance and completeness of the research.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study presents valuable insights into the role of GABRD and its potential interaction with CDK1 in breast cancer progression.</p>
<p>Recent literature suggests that the neurotransmitter GABA and its receptors play a vital role in regulating various tumors. The paper's innovation lies in revealing GABRD as the most relevant subunit within the GABA receptor family concerning breast cancer and exploring its potential mechanisms in regulating breast cancer progression, including the proposed GABRD-CDK1 axis.</p>
<p>The methods in the study are sufficiently documented to allow replication studies and the quality of the figures and tables is very satisfactory.</p>
<p>In general, this manuscript is well-crafted and addresses a compelling and pertinent topic.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The following minor issues should be addressed:</p>
<p>1. While the study demonstrates the impact of GABRD expression on patient overall survival, it would be beneficial to supplement this with additional survival indicators. Analyzing other survival metrics, such as disease-free survival or progression-free survival, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of GABRD's clinical relevance in breast cancer.</p>
<p>2. The manuscript alludes to GABRD's regulation of the cell cycle through its interaction with CDK1. Elaborating on the specific binding mechanisms and molecular interactions involved in this regulation would provide a more detailed insight into the proposed GABRD-CDK1 axis.</p>
<p>3. The criteria for high and low expression of GABRD In Table 1 and Fig. 1D should be clearly defined.</p>
<p>4. It would be helpful to explain the reason for classifying the tumor size with 3cm (not 2 or 5cm) in Table 2. It would also be helpful to explain whether the differences in GABRD expression in breast cancer subtypes with different HR and HER-2 expression statuses were analyzed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The study demonstrated that GABRD was significantly overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and had correlations with disease progression and patient survival rates. When GABRD was downregulated in breast cancer cells, it resulted in reduced cell growth, increased apoptosis, and hindered cell migration and invasion. The study has identified CDK1 as a downstream target of GABRD in mediating its effects on breast cancer. These findings suggest that GABRD is a promising target for therapies related to cell cycle regulation in breast cancer, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of CDK1 inhibitors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study identifies GABRD as a potential target in breast cancer and provides a new direction for developing breast cancer treatments. The study presents strong clinical correlations of GABARD and the functional studies show that CDK1 is a downstream target of GABARD. The in-vivo studies highlight its therapeutic potential for breast cancer.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The data heavily relies on cell lines and the results lack the mechanistic details on GABARD/CDK1 regulation.</p>
