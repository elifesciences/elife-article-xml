<title>Abstract</title><p>Innate immune cells can acquire a memory phenotype, termed trained immunity, but the mechanism underlying the regulation of trained immunity remains largely elusive. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of Aurora kinase A (AurA) dampens trained immunity induced by β-glucan. ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analysis reveals that AurA inhibition restricts chromatin accessibility of genes associated with inflammatory pathways such as JAK-STAT, TNF and NF-κB pathways. Specifically, AurA inhibition promotes nuclear localization of FOXO3 and the expression of glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), a key enzyme responsible for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) consumption. Metabolomic analysis confirms a reduction in SAM level upon AurA inhibition. As a result of SAM deficiency, trained mouse macrophages exhibit decreased H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 enrichment on gene regions of <italic>Il6 and Tnf</italic>. Additionally, the tumor inhibition effect of β-glucan is notably abolished by AurA inhibition. Together, our findings identify an essential role of AurA in regulating trained immunity via a methylation-dependent manner by maintaining endogenous SAM level through mTOR-FOXO3-GNMT axis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Trained immunity is depicted as a memory state of innate immune cell, independent on adaptive immunity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Naik &amp; Fuchs, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ochando, Mulder, Madsen, Netea, &amp; Duivenvoorden, 2023</xref>). It can be induced by <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine, or microbial component such as β-glucan(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cirovic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kalafati et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Quintin et al., 2012</xref>). Trained immune cells exhibit a rapid and enhanced response to secondary related or unrelated stimulus, relying on chromatin remodeling and metabolic rewiring(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bekkering et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cirovic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Su et al., 2021b</xref>). In trained cells, histone modification associated with active transcription such as H3-histone-lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is enriched in promoter regions of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines, supporting fast gene induction in response to secondary stimulation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Su et al., 2022</xref>). Trained cells typically undergo metabolic rewiring characterized by enhanced glycolysis while the oxidative phosphorylation level shows context-dependent variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Keating et al., 2020</xref>). Intermediate metabolites in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle such as fumarate and succinate function as DNA or histone demethylase inhibitors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arts et al., 2016</xref>), whereas methionine and SAM in one carbon metabolism act as substrates for methyltransferases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ampomah et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, metabolic processing and metabolites intertwined with epigenetic regulation by directly supplying methylation substrates or regulating methylation enzyme activities. SAM, a ubiquitous methyl donor in biological process, can be converted into S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) for the synthesis of cysteine in glutathione metabolism. The ratio of SAM/SAH is critical in support histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 36(H3K36me3) to enhance IL-1β transcription(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). However, it has not been clear how SAM level is regulated in the trained immunity process.</p>
<p>Aurora kinase A (AurA), a serine/threonine kinase, plays a critical role in mitosis and is frequently overexpressed in tumor tissues. Inhibition of AurA in tumor cells restricts cell proliferation, migration and induces cell death(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Donnella et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jingtai et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Tham et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wang-Bishop et al., 2019</xref>). Despite the well-established role of AurA on tumor cells’ growth and tumorigenesis, its function in innate immune cells like macrophages or in inflammation is not well understood(L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ding, Gu, Gao, Xiong, &amp; Zheng, 2015</xref>). A previous study reports that alisertib, a specific inhibitor of AurA, promotes gene expression of demethylase <italic>KDM6B</italic> during THP-1 cell (a human monocyte-like cell line) differentiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Park, Cho, Oh, Kim, &amp; Seo, 2018</xref>). Whether AurA plays a similar role in regulating trained immunity in macrophages remains unknown. Trained immunity can lead to aberrant inflammatory activity as well as enhanced anti-tumor effect(T. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Understanding the role of AurA in trained immunity would enable us to further exploit AurA for clinical application in cancer therapy.</p>
<p>In this study, we screened an epigenetic drug library and found that AurA inhibitors notably attenuated the trained immunity induced by β-glucan. Genetic disruption of AurA also showed a similar inhibitory effect on trained immunity. Mechanistically, AurA inhibition reduced the activation of mTOR signaling, thus leading to the nuclear localization of transcription factor FOXO3. Nuclear FOXO3 promoted the expression of GNMT to decrease the intracellular level of SAM, thereby inhibiting H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 enrichment on the promoters of inflammatory genes such as <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Tnf</italic>. Moreover, pretreatment with alisertib abolished the anti-tumor effect conferred by β-glucan-induced trained immunity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, we conclude that AurA is an essential kinase required for the epigenetic regulation in macrophages and antitumor activity of trained immunity.</p>

<title>Inhibition of Aurora kinase A suppresses trained immunity in macrophages</title>
<p>Trained immunity is orchestrated by epigenetic reprogramming, while the specific epigenetic modulators involved in regulating trained immunity remain incompletely understood. To uncover the key epigenetic modulators in trained immunity, we performed a small molecule inhibitor screening by using an epigenetic drug library (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, Appendix 1—table 1). Briefly, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were trained by β-glucan in the presence of different inhibitors for 24 h, rested for 3 days, and then restimulated by LPS for secondary response. As trained immunity in macrophages strongly induces cytokines production including IL-6 and TNF upon restimulation by pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or DAMPs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chakraborty et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Netea et al., 2020</xref>), we used IL-6 level from the supernatant as a readout in our screening. The targets of the epigenetic drug library were primarily categorized into several major classes, including Aurora kinase family, histone methyltransferase and demethylase (HMTs and KDMs), acetyltransferase and deacetylase (HDACs and SIRTs), JAK-STAT kinase family, AKT/mTOR/HIF, PARP family, and BRD family (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, the drug screening results indicated that most inhibitors targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR and HIF1α exhibited inhibitory effects on trained immunity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">de Graaf et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sohrabi et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, cyproheptadine, an inhibitor of SETD7, also suppressed trained immunity in our screening system(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Keating et al., 2020</xref>). Among total of 305 inhibitors in the compound library, 8 AurA inhibitors showed inhibitory effect on trained immunity-induced IL-6 production in multiple rounds of screening with different concentrations (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To further confirm whether AurA identified in our screening could modulate trained immunity, we optimized β-glucan training protocol and used three AurA-specific inhibitors, and found that all these AurA inhibitors significantly inhibited IL-6 production in β-glucan-trained mouse macrophages (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Among these inhibitors, alisertib is an orally active and highly selective inhibitor for AurA and has been applied in preclinical investigation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bavetsias &amp; Linardopoulos, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mosse et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">O’Connor et al., 2019</xref>). We further observed that alisertib obviously downregulated IL-6 and TNF in trained BMDMs in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting cell viability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref>). Moreover, alisertib also decreased the transcriptional level of <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Tnf</italic> in trained BMDMs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of AurA was increased by β-glucan but was blocked by alisertib (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). To further confirm the role of AurA in trained immunity, we knocked down the expression of AurA by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in BMDMs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Consistently, knocking down of AurA also inhibited the production levels of IL-6 and TNF in trained BMDMs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Consistent with a recent report showing that tumor cells or tumor cell culture supernatant could function as the second stimulus for trained BMDMs(C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ding et al., 2023</xref>), we also observed increased TNF and IL-6 production of trained macrophages upon secondary stimulation using MC38 tumor cells culture supernatant, and such effect was also inhibited by AurA knockdown or inhibition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). To verify whether AurA regulates trained immunity in different cell models, we trained J774A.1 cells as well as THP-1 cells with β-glucan and also observed a reduction of IL-6 and TNF levels under AurA knockdown or inhibition (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Moreover, intraperitoneal administration of alisertib together with β-glucan also attenuated trained immunity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1H-I</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that AurA inhibition suppresses β-glucan-induced trained immunity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Aurora kinase A inhibition remodels chromatin landscape of inflammatory genes</title>
<p>Epigenetic reprogramming towards an open chromatin status is considered the basis for innate immune memory(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jeljeli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Moorlag et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Novakovic et al., 2016</xref>). To clarify the status of chromatin landscape under AurA inhibition, we performed an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) in trained BMDMs. In detail, mice were trained by intraperitoneal injection with β-glucan with or without alisertib, and the bone marrow cells were isolated and differentiated into BMDMs for ATAC-seq analysis (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Principal component analysis showed divergent distribution between AurA-treated and -untreated trained BMDMs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The erased regions by AurA inhibition were mapped into known AurA-regulated cellular processes like “regulation of growth”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Willems et al., 2018</xref>), and inflammatory response-related processes like “myeloid leukocyte activation” and “MAPK cascade” (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Analysis of enriched transcriptional binding motifs indicated that the erased peaks by alisertib were transcriptionally regulated by IRF1/2, FOS and STAT1/2, while the written peaks were transcriptionally regulated by PPARG, KLF4, ELF4 and FOXO1/3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Recent report shows that PPARG and KLF4 were critical transcription factors in controlling genes of macrophage M2 polarization and FOXO3 regulates the expression of multiple genes involved in pathway such as anti-inflammation and oxidative stress resistance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allemann, Lee, Beer, &amp; Saeedi Saravi, 2023</xref>). Consistent with the reduced production of IL-6 and TNF proteins by alisertib, we observed a decreased chromatin accessibility of proinflammatory gene such as <italic>Il6</italic>, <italic>Tnf</italic>, <italic>Cxcl2</italic> and <italic>Il1a</italic> by alisertib intervention (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, the peaks of genes encoded M2 marker <italic>mrc1</italic> as well as <italic>chil3</italic> were enhanced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). These results support that AurA regulate epigenetic changes in β-glucan-induced trained immunity and its inhibition restricts the chromatin accessibility for inflammatory genes in macrophages.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we also performed RNA-seq with the trained BMDMs after LPS restimulation. Analysis of the transcriptome revealed that alisertib inhibited genes associated with pro-inflammatory pathway including “JAK-STAT signaling pathway”, “TNF signaling pathway” as well as “NF-kappa B pathway” in trained BMDMs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). In contrast, the up-regulated genes by alisertib were enriched in anti-inflammation pathway such as “FOXO signaling pathway” (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Additionally, differentially expressed transcription factors were analyzed and mapped into Gene Ontology (GO) with enrichment in “negative regulation of Toll-like receptor signaling pathway”, “negative regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome complex assembly” and “negative regulation of interleukin-6 production” (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). Moreover, multiplex chemokine/cytokines array showed that alisertib decreased the chemokine/cytokines in trained BMDMs such as IL-6, TNF, CXCL2 and IL-1α (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that alisertib restrict chromatin accessibility in genes associated with inflammation activation in trained BMDMs.</p>

<title>Alisertib inhibits glycolysis and remodel TCA cycle</title>
<p>Various studies show that metabolic rewiring such as glycolysis is critical for macrophage memory both in meeting energy demands and epigenetic modification(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bekkering et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bhargavi &amp; Subbian, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Liu et al., 2024</xref>). To determine the metabolic pathway that AurA may regulates in trained immunity, we analyzed the glucose metabolism in trained BMDMs. As expected, β-glucan increased glycolysis as indicated by higher extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), which was inhibited by alisertib, but no obvious change in oxidative phosphorylation level was detected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A-B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</xref>). In accordance with enhanced glycolysis, U-<sup>13</sup>C-glucose tracer showed that β-glucan treatment upregulated the glucose incorporation into lactate, and this induction was significantly inhibited by alisertib (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Meanwhile, metabolites in TCA cycle, including malate, citrate, α-KG, fumarate and succinate, were all decreased in alisertib-treated trained BMDMs (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Previous study showed that fumarate was accumulated in β-glucan treated cells, and it induced epigenetic reprogramming to facilitate trained immunity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arts et al., 2016</xref>). However, alisertib treatment did not affect fumarate accumulation induced by β-glucan (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), but increased tyrosine level (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As a recent report shows tyrosine could be interconverted to fumarate(J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Li et al., 2023</xref>), we speculated the decreased fumarate from TCA cycle by alisertib may be compensated from tyrosine metabolism. Taken together, AurA inhibition inhibits glycolysis and remodels glucose metabolism in trained immunity.</p>

<title>Aurora kinase A regulates S-adenosylmethionine level in trained BMDMs</title>
<p>Next, we planned to identify the specific metabolites that support the function of AurA in trained immunity. KEGG analysis by using the differently expressed genes (DEGs) showed that glutathione (GSH) metabolism was significantly enriched (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). We further found that the intracellular level of GSH in trained BMDMs was notably reduced after AurA inhibition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). It has been reported that β-glucan induces a modified cellular redox status as elevation of ROS level and enhanced synthesis of GSH(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ferreira et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ferreira et al., 2023</xref>). Genetic deletion of genes involved in GSH synthesis disrupts the cellular redox balance and dampens trained immunity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Su et al., 2021a</xref>). To investigate whether AurA functions on trained immunity directly though decreasing GSH, we measured the level of serine and SAM, both of which are precursors of GSH (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). By targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, we found a significant reduction of SAM level under Aura inhibition, while the serine level remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Next, we further detected the downstream products of SAM such as SAH and HCY. Consistently, we observed that alisertib also significantly decreased SAH and HCY in trained BMDMs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). The decreased intracellular level of these precursors of GSH indicated that GSH was probably not a metabolite that AurA directly acted on, and its reduction was a result from SAM deficiency. SAM is directly linked to epigenetics as a methyl donor. For example, SAM induction upregulates the total intracellular level of histone lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) and thus increase H3K36me3 modification at the gene region of <italic>Il1</italic>β to promote IL-1β expression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rodriguez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). Since AurA inhibition resulted in intracellular SAM reduction, we wondered whether SAM upregulation would rescue trained immunity inhibited by alisertib or by AurA knocking down. GNMT is a key enzyme responsible for the conversion from SAM to SAH, and its deficiency blocked the conversion from SAM to SAH and thus leading to the increased ratio of SAM to SAH(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hwang et al., 2021</xref>; C. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Yen, Lin, Chen, Chen, &amp; Chen, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, we found that AurA inhibition upregulated GNMT protein level in trained BMDMs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). To verify whether intracellular SAM level was responsible for AurA-mediated trained immunity, we knocked down GNMT in BMDMs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>), and found that knockdown of GNMT increased the level of SAM while decreased the level of SAH, leading to increased ratio of SAM/SAH under AurA inhibition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of GNMT rescued the IL-6 and TNF production in trained immunity under AurA inhibition in response to MC38 cell culture supernatant and LPS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). These results suggest that AurA promotes trained immunity by supplying endogenous SAM level which is controlled by GNMT.</p>

<title>Inhibition of Aurora kinase A impairs histone trimethylation at H3K4 and H3K36</title>
<p>SAM is a well-known methyl donor for nearly all cellular methylation events including DNA, RNA and histone methylation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Keen &amp; Taylor, 2004</xref>). Recent study reports that SAM deficiency limits histone methylation by phosphorylation of Rph1, which is a demethylase for H3K36me3(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Ye et al., 2019</xref>). Meanwhile, SAM prefers to induce histone methylation changes in targeted sites like K4 without global changes to DNA and RNA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Pham et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether changes in histone methylation occurred when intracellular SAM level was inhibited by AurA inhibition. Among the major active histone methylation markers and repressive markers, we found that trimethylation at H3K4 and H3K36, induced by β-glucan stimulation, were decreased by alisertib. Meanwhile, alisertib did not affect trimethylation at H3K9 and monomethylation at H3K4, accompanied with a modest change but no significant difference in trimethylation at H3K27 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1 A</xref>). Epigenetic modification including H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 promotes chromatin accessibility thus promoting rapid transcription of genes in response to second stimulation in trained immunity. This prompted us to investigate whether alisertib dampened β-glucan-induced epigenetic modification in genes like <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Tnf</italic>. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that both H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 enrichment on <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Tnf</italic> promoters induced by β-glucan were notably decreased by alisertib (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Consistently, knockdown of GNMT recovered the expression level of histone methylation and the enrichment level of H3K4me3 as well as H3K36me3 on gene promoter of <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Tnf</italic>, which was inhibited by alisertib (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B-C</xref>). Therefore, suppression of trained immunity caused by AurA inhibition is a consequence of decreased trimethylation events in histone by SAM deficiency.</p>

<title>Aurora kinase A regulates GNMT through transcription factor FOXO3</title>
<p>Given the role of GNMT in affecting SAM level, we questioned how AurA inhibition mediated GNMT expression in trained immunity. It was reported that nuclear FOXO3 facilitated GNMT expression to regulate the cell redox response(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hwang et al., 2021</xref>). Motif analysis of the ATAC-seq indicated that AurA inhibition promoted FOXO signal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that AurA inhibition upregulated GNMT expression via FOXO3. Firstly, we found that knockdown of FOXO3 inhibited GNMT protein level in BMDMs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Meanwhile, FOXO3 knockdown prevented the enhanced GNMT expression under AurA inhibition and knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B-C</xref>), indicating the involvement of FOXO3 in AurA function. Moreover, knockdown of FOXO3 also restored the trained immunity as indicated by elevation of IL-6 level, which was inhibited by alisertib (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). To further investigate how AurA regulates FOXO3, we detected the phosphorylation level of FOXO3. The result showed that β-glucan stimulation induced the phosphorylation of FOXO3 at Ser315 and AurA inhibition prevented the phosphorylation induction by β-glucan (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Consistently, immunofluorescence detection showed a higher ratio of nuclear enrichment of FOXO3 by AurA inhibition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Nuclear enrichment of FOXO3 is inhibited by AKT-mTOR activation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">van der Vos et al., 2012</xref>). To demonstrate whether the increased FOXO3 nuclear localization by alisertib was associated with AKT-mTOR activation, we checked the activation of AKT-mTOR in trained BMDMs. As expected, both pharmacological and genetic disruption of AurA significantly inhibited β-glucan-induced phosphorylation of AKT-mTOR-S6K-S6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Additionally, mTOR activation by its agonist MHY1485 promoted trained immunity under aurora kinase A inhibition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>), suggesting that mTOR-FOXO3 signaling pathway acts downstream of AurA-mediated trained immunity. In conclusion, these results show the role of transcription factor FOXO3 in AurA-mediated GNMT expression in trained immunity, which depends on the activation of mTOR pathway.</p>

<title>Alisertib abrogates the anti-tumor effect induced by trained immunity</title>
<p>Trained immunity has been implicated in anti-tumor immunity and is considered as a new branch for cancer immunotherapy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bird, 2023</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ding et al., 2023</xref>; T. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). We speculated about whether inhibition of AurA would disrupt the anti-tumor effect induced by β-glucan. Therefore, we conducted a tumor model in mice preinjected with β-glucan (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Training with β-glucan inhibited MC38 tumor growth, but the administration of alisertib abolished the antitumor effect induced by β-glucan (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1 A</xref>). Given that trained immunity mediates long-term effects on myeloid cells via modulation on bone marrow (BM), we performed bone marrow transplantation (BMT) experiment to directly assess whether alisertib acted on BM to inhibit trained immunity <italic>in vivo</italic>. BM cells were isolated from CD45.1<sup>+</sup> mice, which were either trained by β-glucan with or without alisertib administration, or left untrained, and transferred to lethally irradiated CD45.2<sup>+</sup> mice. Four weeks post BMT, CD45.2<sup>+</sup> mice were inoculated with MC38 tumor cells and tumor growth was monitored (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Compared to mice received BM cells from untrained mice, the tumor burden was significantly decreased in mice that had received BM cells from trained mice, but not in mice that received BM cells from trained mice with alisertib intervention (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, the trained immunity-suppressive properties of alisertib can be transferred by BM transplantation to non-trained recipient mice, which confirmed the direct effect of alisertib on BM-derived cells. Next, we investigated the role of macrophages in the anti-tumor effect induced by β-glucan. We analyzed the population of myeloid cells (CD45<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>) as well as the population of myeloid derived macrophages (CD45<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup>) in tumor microenvironment. The population of myeloid cells or macrophage induced by β-glucan or by alisertib intervention showed no changes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6E</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6— figure supplement 1D</xref>). Studies have shown that GNMT is a tumor suppressor gene and its expression is downregulated in tumor tissue(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">DebRoy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Simile et al., 2022</xref>). Considering that AurA inhibition enhanced GNMT expression in BMDMs in our experiment, we detected GNMT expression in tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). We found that TAMs from alisertib-treated mice exhibited a higher expression of GNMT, compared with β-glucan trained mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Moreover, compared with alisertib-treated mice, the CD45<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells in tumor tissue from β-glucan trained mice showed a higher intracellular phospho-S6, suggesting that AurA inhibition inhibited mTOR activation in TAMs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by β-glucan adjuvant as well as trained immunity can modulate tumor microenvironment and contribute to antitumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sui &amp; Berzofsky, 2024</xref>; M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zhang, Kim, &amp; Huang, 2018</xref>). As expected, we observed that β-glucan treatment induced a higher level of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-12p70 in tumor microenvironment, and the enhanced cytokines production was inhibited by alisertib (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1E</xref>). Moreover, intracellular cytokine staining showed that trained immunity promotes the secretion of IL-6 mainly in infiltrated myeloid cells and macrophages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that AurA inhibition dampens anti-tumor effect of trained immunity via bone marrow cells and reprogrammed the phenotype of tumor-infiltrated myeloid cells including macrophages.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Trained immunity defines the memory ability of innate immune cells in response to second challenge. Although the concept of “trained immunity” has been proposed since 2011, the detailed mechanisms that regulate trained immunity are still not completely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Netea, Quintin, &amp; van der Meer, 2011</xref>). In this study, we identified that AurA was required for trained immunity. AurA deficiency or inhibition decreased Il-6 and TNF production in β-glucan-trained BMDMs upon rechallenge by LPS or supernatant from tumor cells. Moreover, alisertib impaired the anti-tumor effect induced by β-glucan. We also discovered that alisertib induced GNMT expression via mTOR-FOXO3 axis and thus promoted SAM consumption, resulting in decreased SAM/SAH ratio and decreased H3K36me3 and H3K4me3 modification on the promotors of inflammatory genes, highlighting the role of AurA kinase as hub for methionine metabolism and epigenetics.</p>
<p>S-adenosylmethionine, is one of the most ubiquitous metabolites in host. It contains methyl group, adenosyl group and ACP group, all of which can be transferred by corresponding transferases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lee, Ren, Jeon, &amp; Liu, 2023</xref>). It is reported that SAM supplement in mammals is consumed for methylation events on DNA or histone proteins, which affects biological process like tissue differentiation and gene expression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dai, Ramesh, &amp; Locasale, 2020</xref>). In macrophages, DNMT transfers methyl group from SAM to DNA and leads to gene repression such as <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Dusp4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ampomah et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ji et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jung, Park, &amp; Ko, 2020</xref>). However, SAM is also reported to play an active role in primary macrophage to increase IL-1β expression in response to LPS, and its precursor methionine can promote M1 macrophage activation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dos Santos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). But whether SAM is involved in trained immunity is not investigated. In our study, AurA inhibition reduced endogenous SAM level in trained BMDMs. It also inhibited the trimethylation at H3K4 and histone H3K36 via upregulating GNMT. GNMT is a glycine methyltransferase, which transfers methyl group from SAM to glycine to lower intracellular SAM level(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Luka, Mudd, &amp; Wagner, 2009</xref>). It is well-known that inhibition of AurA would cause abnormal chromatin segregation and chromatin instability. Previous research report that chromatin instability make sensitivity to SAM and polyamine related gene including GNMT, which might also explain the function of AurA inhibition on SAM(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Islam et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, SAM is the precursor for glutathione. It has been reported that methionine and SAM reduce oxidative damage by increasing glutathione(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2022</xref>). However, we found that AurA inhibition didn’t increase the level of glutathione, which suggests that alisertib inhibited trained immunity independent of glutathione, but through SAM-mediated epigenetic regulation.</p>
<p>AurA belongs to serine and threonine kinase family. It plays critical role in centrosome and chromosome segregation and cell mitosis. Activation of AurA is associated with tumor progression and drug resistance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zhao, Zhang, Yang, &amp; Yang, 2023</xref>). During past two decades, there have been developed more than twenty agents as AurA inhibitors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Attwood, Fabbro, Sokolov, Knapp, &amp; Schioth, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bavetsias &amp; Linardopoulos, 2015</xref>). These agents have been evaluated across metastatic breast cancer, lung cancer, gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma in clinical trials(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Canova et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Haddad et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Melichar et al., 2015</xref>). Among these inhibitors, alisertib is a highly selective inhibitor for AurA. However, alisertib has limited efficacy against both solid and hematological tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Beltran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mosse et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">O’Connor et al., 2019</xref>). In recent years, there are researches trying to explain the resistance to AurA-targeted therapy and reveal feedback loops existed in tumor cells, which contributes to drug resistance. For example, AurA inhibition by alisertib upregulates PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and allows immune escape(X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). AurA inhibition also enhances fatty acid oxidation to overcome the glycolysis attenuation in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>). However, these studies mainly focus on investigating the role of AurA in tumor cells while its role in immune cells is rarely understood. In this study, we identified AurA as a key regulator in promoting trained immunity through epigenetic drug screening. And AurA inhibition significantly decreased the trained immunity induced by β-glucan <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. AurA is described to be expressed and activated in stem-cell like cells, bone marrow and epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Qi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Rio-Vilarino et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>).Clinical data show that alisertib by oral administration rapidly distributes in bone marrow, making bone marrow a site susceptible to side effect(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Oh, Power, Zhang, Daniels, &amp; Elmquist, 2022</xref>). Due to the inhibition effect of alisertib on trained immunity in bone marrow, this may be the potential explanation for the poor therapeutic efficacy or drug resistance of alisertib on patients with cancer. In our primary drug screening, all compounds were examined at a fixed concentration of 5 μM. Despite this limitation, our screening results recapitulated several trained immunity inhibitors previously reported in literature, thereby reinforcing the validity of our screening and highlight some potential molecular targets worthy of further investigation. Overall, our findings provide a potential guidance for AurA inhibitor application in clinical cancer therapy, and the clues for design of new inhibitors such as avoiding targets on bone marrow.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that AurA supports trained immunity by maintain SAM level. As a result of SAM deficiency under AurA inhibition, H3K4m3 and H3K36me3 level are reduced and trained immunity is inhibited. Our finding reveals a novel AurA-SAM metabolic axis as a new mechanism for trained immunity. Furthermore, our findings also identify a potential guidance for the clinical application of AurA, and new clues for the design of next-generation AurA inhibitors in the future.</p>

<p>Drugs screening was performed using a drug library from TargetMol (Shanghai, China). A detailed drugs list was provided in Appendix 1—table 1. For the primary screening, 1×10<sup>5</sup> BMDMs were seeded into 96-wells plate. Following overnight incubation, the BMDMs were trained with β-glucan (100 μg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#G6513) in the presence of drugs at a concentration of 5 μM for 24 h while the secondary screening for parts of the drugs was performed at two concentrations of 0.2 and 1 μM. Control cells received vehicle control DMSO. After 24 h training, cells were washed with 1×PBS and further cultured in fresh complete medium (containing 10% L929 supernatant) for 3 days, followed by LPS stimulation (1 μg/mL). The culture supernatant was subjected to ELISA to measure IL-6. The relative amount of IL-6 was calculated as the fold change of the drugs-treated trained cells compared with the glucan only-treated cells.

<p>For intracellular staining of FOXO3 (1:200, Cat#ab23683, Abcam), BMDMs was grown on glass bottom dishes (Nest, Wuxi) overnight. After indicated treatment, BMDMs were washed twice with 1×PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in RT for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 30 min at RT. Cells were incubated with blocking buffer (1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS) for 30 min at RT. Primary antibody were incubated at 4°C overnight, and the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibody (1:500, Cat# A-11008, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at RT. The dishes were then washed three times with 0.1% TBST with DAPI staining during the first wash. For tumor tissue staining, fresh tumor tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in RT for 24∼48 h and cut into ∼8 μm section after embedded in OCT. The slice was blocked with normal goat serum with 1% Triton X-100 and incubated with primary antibodies including anti-GNMT (1:200, Cat# PA5-100018, Invitrogen), and anti-F4/80 (1:200, Cat#ab90247, Abcam) antibody overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit (1:200, Cat# A-11008, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Alexa Fluor 555 anti-rat (1:200, Cat# 4417, Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h at RT. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (1 mg/mL) and mounted with Prolong GLASS antifade mountant (P10144, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were obtained using a NIKON confocal microscope. The nuclear localization of FOXO3 in trained BMDMs <italic>in vitro</italic> was compared by calculated the ratio of mean nuclear intensity to cytoplasmic intensity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kelley &amp; Paschal, 2019</xref>). For analysis the GNMT expression in tumor associated macrophages, we randomly counted 150∼200 DAPI<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells and draw ROI to report intensity. The representative data in our result showed the mean intensity of counted macrophages.</p>

<p>Fresh tumor tissue was harvested at the end of time point and cut into small pieces. A single-cell suspension was obtained by crushing the tumor tissue through a 100 μm cell strainer in Phosflow lyse/fix buffer (Cat#558049, BD Biosciences) immediately. Subsequently, the suspended cells were washed twice with BD perm/wash buffer (Cat#554723, BD Biosciences). Cells were then stained with the desired antibodies for 30 min at RT in dark. For phospho-S6 staining, cells were incubated with secondary antibody. Cells were analyzed using a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-CD45 BV421 (1:200, Cat#563890, BD Biosciences), anti-CD45.1 FITC (1:200, BioLegend, Cat#110705), anti-CD45.2 BV510 (1:200, BioLegend, Cat#109837), anti-CD11b PerCP Cy5.5 (1:200, Cat# 45-0112-82, Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-F4/80 FITC (1:200, Cat# 11-4801-82, Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-Phospho-S6 (Ser235/236) (1:200, Cat# 4858, Cell Signaling Technology), and Fixable Viability Dye (1:1000, BioLegend, Cat#423105). Anti-rabbit IgG (Alexa Fluor 555 Conjugate) (1:200, Cat# 4413, Cell Signaling Technology) served as the secondary antibody.</p>

<p>The GraphPad Prism version 8.0 was used for statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (Standard Error of Mean) of indicated biological replicates for <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular experiments, while data are presented as mean ± SD (Standard Deviation) of indicated biological replicates for <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment. For statistical significance analysis, two-tailed t-test was used for comparing two mean values; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple-comparison test was applied for comparing three or more mean values with β-glucan group as control; one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison test was applied for comparing multiple mean values under different conditions. The data distribution was assumed to be normal, although this assumption was not formally tested.</p>

<p>In this updated and improved manuscript, the authors investigate the role of Aurora Kinase A (AurA) in trained immunity, following a broader drug screening aimed at finding inhibitors of training. They show AurA is important for trained immunity by looking at the different aspects and layers of training using broad omics screening, followed up by a more detailed investigation of specific mechanisms. The authors finalised the investigation with an in vivo MC-38 cancer model where AurA inhibition reduces beta-glucan's antitumour effects.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experimental methods are generally well-described. I appreciate the authors' broad approach to studying different key aspects of trained immunity (from comprehensive transcriptome/chromatin accessibility measurements to detailed mechanistic experiments). Approaching the hypothesis from many different angles inspires confidence in the results. Furthermore, the large drug-screening panel is a valuable tool as these drugs are readily available for translational drug-repurposing research.</p>
<p>In response to the rebuttal, I would like to compliment and thank the authors for the large amount of work they have done to improve this manuscript. They have removed most of my previous concerns and confusions, and explained some of their approaches in a way that I now agree with them - a great learning opportunity for me as well.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors have adequately responded to my comments and updated the manuscript accordingly.</p>
<p>(2) The authors have removed most of my concerns. Regarding the use of unpaired tests because that is what is often done in the literature: I still don't agree with this, nor do I think that 'common practice' is a solid argument to justify the approach. However, we can agree to disagree, as I know indeed that many people argue over when paired tests are appropriate in these types of experiments. I appreciate that n=2 for sequencing experiments is justifiable in the way these analyses are used as exploratory screening methods with later experimental validation. I also want to thank the authors for reporting biological replicates where relevant and (I should have mentioned this in my original review also) I appreciate they validate some findings in a separate cell line - many papers neglect this important step.</p>
<p>(3) The authors have adequately responded to my comments and updated the manuscript accordingly.</p>
<p>(4) The authors have adequately responded to my comments and updated the manuscript accordingly.</p>
<p>(5) The authors have adequately responded to my comments and updated the manuscript accordingly.</p>
<p>(6) The authors have adequately responded to my comments and updated the manuscript accordingly. They have actually gone above and beyond.</p>
<p>(7) I would like to thank the authors for highlighting this information and taking away my confusion. The authors have adequately responded to my comments and updated the manuscript accordingly.</p>
<p>(8) The authors have adequately responded to my comments and updated the manuscript accordingly.</p>
<p>(9) I still think adding the 'alisertib alone' control would be of great added value, but I can see how it is unreasonable to ask the authors to redo those experiments.</p>
<p>(10) The authors have adequately responded to my comments and updated the manuscript accordingly.</p>
<p>(11) The authors have adequately responded to my comments and updated the manuscript accordingly.</p>
<p>(12) I thank the authors for their work to repeat this experiment with my suggestions included. I am convinced by this nice data. I would recommend that the authors put the data from New Figure 4 also in the manuscript as it adds value to the manuscript (unless I just missed it, I don't see it in Figure 6 or the supplement). Not every reader may look at the reviewer comments/rebuttal documents.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript investigates the inhibition of Aurora A and its impact on β-glucan-induced trained immunity via the FOXO3/GNMT pathway. The study demonstrates that inhibition of Aurora A leads to overconsumption of SAM, which subsequently impairs the epigenetic reprogramming of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, effectively abolishing the training effect.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors identify the role of Aurora A through small molecule screening and validation using a variety of molecular and biochemical approaches. Overall, the findings are interesting and shed light on the previously underexplored role of Aurora A in the induction of β-glucan-driven epigenetic change.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Given the established role of histone methylations, such as H3K4me3, in trained immunity, it is not surprising that depletion of the methyl donor SAM impairs the training response. Nonetheless, this study provides solid evidence supporting the role of Aurora A in β-glucan-induced trained immunity in murine macrophages. The part of in vivo trained immunity antitumor effect is insufficient to support the final claim as using Alisertib could inhibits Aurora A other cell types other than myeloid cells.</p>
<p>Revision:</p>
<p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed the majority of my concerns. In particular, the new bone marrow transplantation data convincingly demonstrate that Aurora A inhibition with Alisertib abolishes the β-glucan-trained antitumor effect-an essential finding supporting the manuscript's conclusions.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer#1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This work regards the role of Aurora Kinase A (AurA) in trained immunity. The authors claim that AurA is essential to the induction of trained immunity. The paper starts with a series of experiments showing the effects of suppressing AurA on beta-glucan-trained immunity. This is followed by an account of how AurA inhibition changes the epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming that are characteristic of trained immunity. The authors then zoom in on specific metabolic and epigenetic processes (regulation of S-adenosylmethionine metabolism &amp; histone methylation). Finally, an inhibitor of AurA is used to reduce beta-glucan's anti-tumour effects in a subcutaneous MC-38 model.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
With the exception of my confusion around the methods used for relative gene expression measurements, the experimental methods are generally well-described. I appreciate the authors' broad approach to studying different key aspects of trained immunity (from comprehensive transcriptome/chromatin accessibility measurements to detailed mechanistic experiments). Approaching the hypothesis from many different angles inspires confidence in the results (although not completely - see weaknesses section). Furthermore, the large drug-screening panel is a valuable tool as these drugs are readily available for translational drug-repurposing research.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive and encouraging comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript contains factual inaccuracies such as:</p>
<p>(a) Intro: the claim that trained cells display a shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis based on the paper by Cheng et al. in 2014; this was later shown to be dependent on the dose of stimulation and actually both glycolysis and OXPHOS are generally upregulated in trained cells (pmid 32320649).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for pointing out this inaccuracy, and we have revised our statement to ensure accurate and updated description in manuscript. We are aware that trained immunity involves different metabolic pathways, including both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation [1, 2]. We also detected Oxygen Consumption Rate (please see response to comment 8 of reviewer#1) but observed no obvious increase of oxygen consumption in trained BMDMs in our experiment setting. As the reviewer pointed out, it might be dependent on the dose of stimulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) Discussion: Trained immunity was first described as such in 2011, not decades ago.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for the inaccurate description, and we have corrected the statement in our revised manuscript as “Although the concept of ‘trained immunity’ has been proposed since 2011, the detailed mechanisms that regulate trained immunity are still not completely understood.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors approach their hypothesis from different angles, which inspires a degree of confidence in the results. However, the statistical methods and reporting are underwhelming.</p>
<p>(a) Graphs depict mean +/- SEM, whereas mean +/- SD is almost always more informative. (b) The use of 1-tailed tests is dubious in this scenario. Furthermore, in many experiments/figures the case could be made that the comparisons should be considered paired (the responses of cells from the same animal are inherently not independent due to their shared genetic background and, up until cell isolation, the same host factors like serum composition/microbiome/systemic inflammation etc). (c) It could be explained a little more clearly how multiple testing correction was done and why specific tests were chosen in each instance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for this thoughtful comment. (a) The data from animal experiments in which trained immunity was induced <italic>in vivo</italic> are presented as mean ± SD, while the statistical results from cell-based experiments are presented as mean ± SEM in the revised manuscript. (b) We have replaced one-tailed test with two-tailed test (see Figure 3J in revised manuscript, with updated <italic>P</italic> value label). We agree that cells derived from the same animal and subjected to different treatment conditions may be deemed paired data. We reanalyzed our data using paired statistical tests. While this led to a slight reduction in statistical significance for some comparisons, the overall trends remained consistent, and our biological interpretation remains unchanged. For in vitro experiments unpaired statistical tests are commonly used in literature [3, 4]. Thus, we still used unpaired test results here. (c) We have provided a detailed description of how multiple comparisons were performed in revised figure legends.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(d) Most experiments are done with n = 3, some experiments are done with n = 5. This is not a lot. While I don't think power analyses should be required for simple in vitro experiments, I would be wary of drawing conclusions based on n = 3. It is also not indicated if the data points were acquired in independent experiments. ATAC-seq/RNA-seq was, judging by the figures, done on only 2 mice per group. No power calculations were done for the in vivo tumor model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for the confusion in our description in figure legends. For the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment, we determined the sample size (n=5, n refers to number of mice used as biological replicates) by referring to the animal numbers used for similar experiments in literatures. And according to a reported resource equation approach for calculating sample size in animal studies [5], n=5-7 is suitable for most of our mouse experiments. The <italic>in vitro</italic> cell assay was performed at least three independent experiments (BMs isolated from different mice), and each experiment was independently replicated at least three times and points represents biological replicates in our revised manuscript. In Figure 1A, 5 biological replicates of these experiments are presented to carefully determine a working concentration of alisertib that would not significantly affect the viability of trained macrophages, and that was subsequently used in all related cell-based experiments. As for seq data, we acknowledge the reviewer's concern regarding the small sample size (n=2) in our RNA-seq/ATAC-seq experiment. We consider the sequencing experiment mainly as an exploratory/screening approach, and performed rigorous quality control and normalization of the sequencing data to ensure the reliability of our findings. For RNA-seq data analysis, we referred to the DESeq2 manual, which specifies that its statistical framework is based on the Negative Binomial Distribution and is capable of robustly inferring differential gene expression with a minimum of two replicates per group. Therefore, the inclusion of two replicates per group was deemed sufficient for our analysis. Nevertheless, the genomic and transcriptome sequencing data were used primarily for preliminary screening, where the candidates have been extensively validated through additional experiments. For example, we conducted ChIP followed by qPCR for detecting active histone modification enrichment in <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Tnf</italic> region to further verify the increased accessibility of trained immunity-induced inflammatory genes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(e) Furthermore, the data spread in many experiments (particularly BMDM experiments) is extremely small. I wonder if these are true biological replicates, meaning each point represents BMDMs from a different animal? (disclaimer: I work with human materials where the spread is of course always much larger than in animal experiments, so I might be misjudging this.).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. In our initially submitted manuscript, some of the statistical results were presented as the representative data (technical replicates) from one of three independent biological replicates (including BMDMs experiments showing the suppression and rescue experiments of trained immunity under different inhibitors or activators, see original Figure 1B-C, Figure 5D, and Figure 5H, also related to Figure 1B-C, Figure 5D, and Figure 5H respectively in our revised manuscript) while other experimental data are biological replicates including CCK8 experiment, metabolic assay and ChIP-qPCR. In response to your valuable suggestion, we have revised the manuscript to present all statistical results as biological replicates from three independent experiments (presented as mean ± SEM), and we have provided all the original data for the statistical analysis results (please see Appendix 2 in resubmit system).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Maybe the authors are reserving this for a separate paper, but it would be fantastic if the authors would report the outcomes of the entire drug screening instead of only a selected few. The field would benefit from this as it would save needless repeat experiments. The list of drugs contains several known inhibitors of training (e.g. mTOR inhibitors) so there must have been more 'hits' than the reported 8 Aurora inhibitors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion and we have briefly reported the outcomes of the entire drug screening in the revised manuscript. The targets of our epigenetic drug library are primarily categorized into several major classes, including Aurora kinase family, histone methyltransferase and demethylase (HMTs and KDMs), acetyltransferase and deacetylase (HDACs and SIRTs), JAK-STAT kinase family, AKT/mTOR/HIF, PARP family, and BRD family (see New Figure 1, related to Figure 1-figure supplement 1B in revised manuscript). Notably, previous studies have reported that inhibition of mTOR-HIF1α signaling axis suppressed trained immunity[6]. Our screening results also indicated that most inhibitors targeting mTOR-HIF1α signaling exhibit an inhibitory effect on trained immunity. Additionally, cyproheptadine, a specific inhibitor for SETD7, which was required for trained immunity as previously reported [7], was also identified in our screening.</p>
<p>JAK-STAT signaling is closely linked to the interferon signaling pathway, and certain JAK kinase inhibitors also target SYK and TYK kinases. A previous drug library screening study has reported that SYK inhibitors suppressed trained immunity [8]. Consistently, our screening results reveal that most JAK kinase inhibitors exhibit suppressive effects on trained immunity.</p>
<p>BRD (Bromodomain) and Aurora are well-established kinase families in the field of oncology. Compared to BRD, the clinical applications of the Aurora kinase inhibitor are still at early stage. In previous studies using inflammatory arthritis models where trained immunity was established, both adaptive and innate immune cells exhibited upregulated expression of AurA [9, 10]. Our study provides further evidence supporting an essential role of AurA in trained immunity, showing that AurA inhibition leads to the suppression of trained immunity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Relating to the drug screen and subsequent experiments: it is unclear to me in supplementary figure 1B which concentrations belong to secondary screens #1/#2 - the methods mention 5 µM for the primary screen and &quot;0.2 and 1 µM&quot; for secondary screens, is it in this order or in order of descending concentration?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments and we are sorry for unclear labelled results in original manuscript (related to Figure 1-supplement 1C). We performed secondary drug screen at two concentrations, and drug concentrations corresponding to secondary screen#1 and #2 are 0.2 and 1 μM respectively. It was just in this order, but not in an order of descending concentration.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(a) It is unclear if the drug screen was performed with technical replicates or not - the supplementary figure 1B suggests no replicates and quite a large spread (in some cases lower concentration works better?)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your question. The drug screen was performed without technical replicates for initial screening purpose, and we need to verify any hit in the following experiment individually. Yes, we observed that lower concentration works better in some cases. We speculate that it might be due to the fact that the drug's effect correlates positively with its concentration only within a specific range. But in our primary screening, we simply choose one concentration for all the drugs. This is a limitation for our screening, and we acknowledge this limitation in our discussion part.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The methods for (presumably) qPCR for measuring gene expression in Figure 1C are missing. Which reference gene was used and is this a suitably stable gene?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for this omission. The mRNA expression of <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Tnf</italic> in trained BMDMs was analyzed by a quantitative real-time PCR via a DDCt method, and the result was normalized to untrained BMDMs with <italic>Actb</italic> (<italic>β-actin</italic>) as a reference gene, a well-documented gene with stable expression in macrophages. We have supplemented the description for measuring gene expression in Material and Methods in our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(6) From the complete unedited blot image of Figure 1D it appears that the p-Aurora and total Aurora are not from the same gel (discordant number of lanes and positioning). This could be alright if there are no/only slight technical errors, but I find it misleading as it is presented as if the actin (loading control to account for aforementioned technical errors!) counts for the entire figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are very sorry for this omission. In the original data, p-Aurora and total Aurora were from different gels. In this experiment the membrane stripping/reprobing after p-Aurora antibody did not work well, so we couldn’t get all results from one gel, and we had to run another gel using the same samples to blot with anti-aurora antibody and used β-tubulin as loading control for total AurA (please see New Figure 2A, also related to original Figure 1D). We have provided the source data for β-tubulin from the same membrane of total AurA (please see Figure 1-source data). To avoid any potential misleading, we have repeated this experiment and updated this Figure (please see New Figure 2B, also related to Figure 1D in revised manuscript) with phospho-AurA, total AurA and β-actin from the same gel. The bands for phospho AurA (T288) were obtained using a new antibody (Invitrogen, 44-1210G) and we have revised this information in Material and Methods. We have provided data of three biological replicates to confirm the experiment result also see New Figure 2B, related to Figure 1D in revised manuscript, and the raw data have been added in source data for Figure 1)</p>

<p>(7) Figure 2: This figure highlights results that are by far not the strongest ones - I think the 'top hits' deserve some more glory. A small explanation on why the highlighted results were selected would have been fitting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the valuable suggestion. Figure 2 (see also Figure 2 in revised manuscript) presented information on the chromatin landscape affected by AurA inhibition to confirm that AurA inhibition impaired key gene activation involved in pro-inflammatory macrophage activation by β-glucan. In Figure 2B we highlighted a few classical GO terms downregulated including “regulation of growth”, “myeloid leukocyte activation” and “MAPK cascade” (see also Figure 2B in revised manuscript), among which “regulation of growth” is known function of Aurora A, just to show that alisertib indeed inhibited Aurora A function in vivo as expected. “Myeloid leukocyte activation” and “MAPK cascade” were to show the impaired pro-inflammatory gene accessibility. We highlighted KEGG terms downregulated like “JAK-STAT signaling pathway”, “TNF signaling pathway” and “NF-kappa B signaling pathway” in Figure 2F (see also Figure 2F in revised manuscript), as these pathways are highly relevant to trained immunity. Meanwhile, KEGG terms “FOXO signaling pathway” (see also Figure 2G in revised manuscript) was highlighted to confirm the anti-inflammation effect of alisertib in trained BMDMs, which was further illustrated in Figure 5 (see also Figure 5 in revised manuscript, illustrating FOXO3 acts downstream of AurA). Some top hits in Figure 2B like “positive regulation of cell adhesion”, and “pathway of neurodegeneration” and &quot;ubiquitin mediated proteolysis&quot; in Figure 2F and 2G, is not directly related to trained immunity, thus we did not highlight them, but may provide some potential information for future investigation on other functions of Aurora A.</p>

<p>(8) Figure 3 incl supplement: the carbon tracing experiments show more glucose-carbon going into TCA cycle (suggesting upregulated oxidative metabolism), but no mito stress test was performed on the seahorse.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this question raised by the reviewer. We previously performed seahorse XF analyze to measure oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in β-glucan-trained BMDMs. The results showed no obvious increase in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) indicated by OCR under β-glucan stimulation (related to Figure 3-figure supplement 1 A) although the carbon tracing experiments showed more glucose-carbon going into TCA cycle. We speculate that the observed discrepancy between increased glucose incorporation into TCA cycle and unchanged OXPHOS may reflect a characteristic metabolic reprogramming induced by trained immunity. The increased incorporation of glucose-derived carbon into the TCA cycle likely serves a biosynthetic purpose—supplying intermediates for anabolic processes—rather than augmenting mitochondrial respiration[6]. Moreover, the unchanged OXPHOS may be attributed to a reduced reliance on fatty acid oxidation- “catabolism”, with glucose-derived acetyl-CoA becoming the predominant substrate. Thus, while overall OXPHOS remains stable, the glucose contribution to the TCA cycle increases. This is in line with reports showing that trained immunity promotes fatty acid synthesis- “anabolism”[11]. Alternatively, the partial decoupling of the TCA cycle from OXPHOS could result from the diversion of intermediates such as fumarate out of the cycle. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) after a mito stress test upon sequential addition of oligomycin (Oligo, 1 μM), FCCP (1 mM), and Rotenone/antimycin (R/A, 0.5 μM), in BMDMs with different treatment for 24 h. β-glucan, 50 μg/mL; alisertib, 1 μM.</p>

<p>(9) Inconsistent use of an 'alisertib-alone' control in addition to 'medium', 'b-glucan', 'b-glucan + alisertib'. This control would be of great added value in many cases, in my opinion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We appreciate that including “alisertib-alone” group throughout all the experiments may further solidify the results. We set the aim of the current study to investigate the role of Aurora kinase A in trained immunity. Therefore, in most settings, we did not include the group of alisertib only without β-glucan stimulation.</p>

<p>(10) Figure 4A: looking at the unedited blot images, the blot for H3K36me3 appears in its original orientation, whereas other images appear horizontally mirrored. Please note, I don't think there is any malicious intent but this is quite sloppy and the authors should explain why/how this happened (are they different gels and the loading sequence was reversed?)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this error. After checking the original data, we found that we indeed misassembled the orientation of several blots in original data submitted. We went through the assembling process and figured out that the orientation of blots in original data was assembled according to the loading sequences, but not saved correctly, so that the orientations in Figure 4A were not consistent with the unedited blot image. We are sorry for this careless mistake, and we have double checked to make sure all the blots are correctly assembled in the revised manuscript. We also provided three replicates of for the Western blot results showing the level of H3K36me3 in trained BMDMs was inhibited by alisertib (as seen in New Figure 7 at recommendation 2 of reviewer#2).</p>

<p>(11) For many figures, for example prominently figure 5, the text describes 'beta-glucan training' whereas the figures actually depict acute stimulation with beta-glucan. While this is partially a semantic issue (technically, the stimulation is 'the training-phase' of the experiment), this could confuse the reader.</p>

<p>(12) Figure 6: Cytokines, especially IL-6 and IL-1β, can be excreted by tumour cells and have pro-tumoral functions. This is not likely in the context of the other results in this case, but since there is flow cytometry data from the tumour material it would have been nice to see also intracellular cytokine staining to pinpoint the source of these cytokines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion. In Figure 6, we performed assay in mouse tumor model and found that trained immunity upregulated cytokines level like IL-6 in tumor tissue, which was downregulated by alisertib administration. In order to rule out the possibility that the detected cytokines such as IL-6 was from tumor cells, we performed intracellular cytokine staining of single cells isolated from tumor tissues (please see New Figure 4). The result showed that only a small fraction of non-immune cells (CD45<sup>-</sup> population) expressed IL-6 (0.37% ± 0.11%), whereas a significantly higher proportion of IL-6-positive cells was observed among CD45<sup>+</sup> population (deemed as immune cells, 13.66% ± 1.82%), myeloid cells (CD45<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>, 15.60% ± 2.19%), and in particular, macrophages (CD45<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup>37.24% ± 3.04%). These findings strongly suggest that immune cells, especially macrophages, are the predominant source of IL-6 cytokine within the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, we also detected higher IL-6 positive population in myeloid cells and macrophages (please see Figure 6I in revised manuscript).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer#2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript investigates the inhibition of Aurora A and its impact on β-glucan-induced trained immunity via the FOXO3/GNMT pathway. The study demonstrates that inhibition of Aurora A leads to overconsumption of SAM, which subsequently impairs the epigenetic reprogramming of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, effectively abolishing the training effect.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors identify the role of Aurora A through small molecule screening and validation using a variety of molecular and biochemical approaches. Overall, the findings are interesting and shed light on the previously underexplored role of Aurora A in the induction of β-glucan-driven epigenetic change.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive and encouraging comments.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Given the established role of histone methylations, such as H3K4me3, in trained immunity, it is not surprising that depletion of the methyl donor SAM impairs the training response. Nonetheless, this study provides solid evidence supporting the role of Aurora A in β-glucan-induced trained immunity in murine macrophages. The part of in vivo trained immunity antitumor effect is insufficient to support the final claim as using Alisertib could inhibits Aurora A other cell types other than myeloid cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the question raised by the reviewer. Though SAM generally acts as a methyl donor, whether the epigenetic reprogram in trained immunity is directly linked to SAM metabolism was not formally tested previously. In our study, we provided evidence suggesting the necessity of SAM maintenance in supporting trained immunity. As for in vivo tumor model, we agree that alisertib may inhibits Aurora A in many cell types besides myeloid cells. To further address the reviewer’s concern, we have performed the suggested bone marrow transplantation experiment (trained mice as donor and naïve mice as recipient) to verify the contribution of myeloid cell-mediated trained immunity for antitumor effect (please see New Figure 8, also related to Figure 6C, 6D and Figure 6-figure supplement 1B and 1C in revised manuscript).</p>

<p>Please also address the points I raised in the public review about statistical approaches. Even more important than the relatively low 'n' is my question about biological replicates. Please clarify what you mean by 'biological replicate'.If you are able to repeat at least the in vitro experiments (if this is too much work pick the most important ones) a few more times this would really strengthen the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. Our biological replicates refer to independently repeated experiments using bone marrow cells isolated from different mice, and n represents the number of mice used. We repeated each experiment at least three times using BMDMs isolated from different mice (n =3, biological replicates). Specifically, we repeated several in vitro experiments showing inhibition of AurA upregulated GNMT in trained BMDMs and showing transcription factor FOXO3 acted as a key protein in AurA-mediated GNMT expression to control trained immunity as well as showing mTOR agonist rescued trained immunity inhibited by alisertib (see New Figure 5, related to Figure 5B-C, Figure 5H in revised manuscript). Additionally, we have provided data with three biological replicates to show the β-glucan induced phosphorylation of AurA (see comment 6 of reviewer#1) and changes of histone modification marker under AurA inhibition and GNMT deficiency (see recommendation 2 of reviewer#2). We also repeated in vivo tumor model to analysis intratumor cytokines (see recommendation 12 of reviewer#1).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) I have the following methodological and interpretative comments for consideration:</p>
<p>Aurora A has been previously implicated in M1 macrophage differentiation and NF-κB signaling. What is the effect of Aurora A inhibition on basal LPS stimulation? Considering that β-glucan + Ali also skews macrophage priming towards an M2 phenotype, as shown in Fig. 2E, further clarification on this point would strengthen the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion. Previous study showed AurA was upregulated in LPS-stimulated macrophages and the inhibition of AurA downregulated M1 markers of LPS-stimulated macrophages through NF-κB pathway but did not affect IL-4-induced M2 macrophage polarization [12]. Consistently, we also found that AurA inhibition downregulated inflammatory response upon basal LPS stimulation as shown by decreased IL-6 level (see New Figure 6). In original Figure 2E (also related to Figure 2E in revised manuscript), we showed an increased accessibility of Mrc1 and Chil3 under “β-glucan +Ali” before re-challenge, both of which are typical M2 macrophage markers. Motif analysis showed that AurA inhibition would upregulate genes controlled by PPARγ (STAT6 was not predicted). Different from STAT6, a classical transcriptional factor in controlling M2 polarization (M2a) dependent on IL-4 or IL-13, PPARγ mediates M2 polarization toward M2c and mainly controls cellular metabolism on anti-inflammation independent on IL-4 or IL-13. Thus, we speculate that inhibition of AurA might promote non-classical M2 polarization, and the details warrant future investigation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 4A, it looks like that H3K27me3 is also significantly upregulated by β-glucan and inhibited by Ali. How many biological replicates were performed for these experiments? It would be beneficial to include densitometric analyses to visualize differences across multiple Western blot experiments for better reproducibility and quantitative assessment. In addition, what is the effect of treatment of Ali alone on the epigenetic profiling of macrophages?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for this confusion. Each experiment was performed with at least three independent biological replicates. In original Figure 4-figure supplement 1 (also related to Figure 4-figure supplementary 1 in the revised manuscript), we presented the densitometric analysis results from three independent Western blot experiments, which showed that β-glucan did not affect H3K27me3 levels under our experimental conditions. Three biological replicates data for histone modification were shown as follows (New Figure 7, as related to Figure 4-figure supplement 1 in revised manuscript). We appreciate that assay for “Ali alone” in macrophages may add more value to the findings. We set the aim of the current study to investigate the role of Aurora kinase A in trained immunity, and we know that alisertib itself would not induce or suppress trained immunity. Therefore, in most settings, we did not test the effect of Alisertib alone without β-glucan stimulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The IL-6 and TNF concentrations exhibit considerable variability (Fig. 3K and Fig. 5H), ranging from below 10 pg/mL to 500-1000 pg/mL. Please specify the number of replicates for these experiments and provide more detail on how variability was managed. Including this information would enhance the robustness of the conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. These experiments were replicated as least three times using BMDMs isolated from different mice. The observed variations in cytokines concentration may be attributed to factors such as differences in cell density, variability among individual mice, and the passage number of the MC38 cells used for supernatant collection. We have prepared new batch of BMDMs and repeated the experiment and provided consistent results in the revised manuscript (please see Figure 5H in revised manuscript). Data for biological replicates have been provided (please see Appendix 2 in resubmit system).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The impact of Aurora A inhibition on β-glucan-induced anti-tumor responses appears complex. Specifically, GNMT expression is significantly upregulated in F4/80- cells, with stronger effects compared to F4/80+ cells as seen in Fig. 6D. To discern whether this is due to the abolishment of trained immunity in myeloid cells or an effect of Ali on tumor cells which inhibit tumor growth, I suggest performing bone marrow transplantation. Transplant naïve or trained donor BM into naïve recipients, followed by MC38 tumor transplantation, to clarify the mechanistic contribution of trained immunity versus off-target effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your valuable suggestion. Following your suggestion, we have performed bone marrow transplantation to clarify that alisertib acts on the BM cells to inhibit anti-tumor effect induced by trained immunity (see New Figure 8, related to Figure 6C-D in revised manuscript). As the results shown below, transplantation of trained BM cells conferred antitumor activity in recipient mice, while transplantation of trained BM cells with alisertib treatment lost such activity, further demonstrating that alisertib inhibited AurA in trained BM cells to impair their antitumor activity.</p>
