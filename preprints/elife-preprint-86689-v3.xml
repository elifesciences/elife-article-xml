<title>Abstract</title><p>The primary cilium plays important roles in regulating cell differentiation, signal transduction, and tissue organization. Dysfunction of the primary cilium can lead to ciliopathies and cancer. The formation and organization of the primary cilium are highly associated with cell polarity proteins, such as the apical polarity protein CRB3. However, the molecular mechanisms by which CRB3 regulates ciliogenesis and the location of CRB3 remain unknown. Here, we show that CRB3, as a navigator, regulates vesicle trafficking in γ-TuRC assembly during ciliogenesis and cilium-related Hh and Wnt signaling pathways in tumorigenesis. <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mice display severe defects of the primary cilium in the mammary ductal lumen and renal tubule, while mammary epithelial-specific <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mice exhibit the promotion of ductal epithelial hyperplasia and tumorigenesis. CRB3 is essential for lumen formation and ciliary assembly in the mammary epithelium. We demonstrate that CRB3 localizes to the basal body and that CRB3 trafficking is mediated by Rab11-positive endosomes. Significantly, CRB3 interacts with Rab11 to navigate GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to CEP290, resulting in intact γ-TuRC assembly. In addition, CRB3-depleted cells are unresponsive to the activation of the Hh signaling pathway, while CRB3 regulates the Wnt signaling pathway. Therefore, our studies reveal the molecular mechanisms by which CRB3 recognizes Rab11-positive endosomes to facilitate ciliogenesis, and regulates cilium-related signaling pathways in tumorigenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epithelial tissues are the most common and widely distributed tissues in the body, and they perform several particular functions. Epithelial tissues are made up of epithelial cells. Establishing apical-basal cell polarity within epithelial cells is a crucial biological process for epithelial homeostasis. Unfortunately, the loss of apical-basal cell polarity is one of the most significant hallmarks of advanced malignant tumors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], and several reports have shown that the loss of some polarity proteins causes disordered cell polarity within epithelial cells, which cannot tightly control cellular growth and migration, ultimately leading to tumor formation, progression, and metastasis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. However, the relationship between polarity proteins and tumorigenesis remains incomplete.</p>
<p>The Crumb complex, located apically, is vital in regulating and maintaining apical-basal cell polarity within epithelial cells. In mammals, three Crumbs orthologs are CRB1, CRB2, and CRB3, and only CRB3 is widely expressed in epithelial cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Our previous studies have shown that CRB3 is expressed at low levels in renal and breast cancers, and abnormal CRB3 expression leads to the disrupted organization of MCF10A cells in three-dimensional (3D) cultures[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Inhibition of CRB3 impairs contact inhibition and leads to migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis of cancer cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Contact inhibition results in growth arrest and causes epithelial cells to enter the quiescent phase, inducing primary cilium formation.</p>
<p>The primary cilium, an antenna-like microtubule-based organelle, is a sensorial antenna that regulates cell differentiation, proliferation, polarity, and tissue organization in most types of mammalian cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Dysfunction of the primary cilium can lead to developmental and degenerative disorders called ciliopathies, such as polycystic kidney disease, nephronophthisis, retinitis pigmentosa, and Meckel syndrome[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Remarkably, many cancers, including melanoma and breast, renal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer, exhibit loss of the primary cilium, most likely during the early stages of tumorigenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. The primary cilium is a significant extension on the apical surfaces of epithelial cells and is maintained by polarized vesicular traffic[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Studies have shown that CRB3b localizes in the primary cilium and that depletion of CRB3 leads to primary cilium loss in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], indicating that CRB3 is necessary for the initiation of ciliogenesis. However, how CRB3 promotes ciliogenesis on the apical surfaces of epithelial cells remains unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we describe a novel conditional deletion of <italic>Crb3</italic> in mice. Our results demonstrate that Crb3 is required to assemble the primary cilium in the mammary gland, kidney, and MEF cells from <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mice. Moreover, we found that <italic>Crb3</italic> deletion promotes breast cancer progression <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additionally, we observed that CRB3 knockdown destabilizes the assembly of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC) during ciliogenesis. Specifically, CRB3 interacts with Rab11 and navigates GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to the basal body of the primary cilium in mammary epithelial cells. We also identified that CRB3 regulates the ciliary Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt signaling pathways in breast cancer. Thus, the polarity protein CRB3 is important for the assembly mechanism of the γTuRC in ciliogenesis and the cilium-related signaling pathways in tumorigenesis.</p>

<title><italic>Crb3</italic> deletion mice exhibit smaller size and anophthalmia</title>
<p>Since <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mice die shortly after birth[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], we generated a novel transgenic mouse model with conditional deletion of <italic>Crb3</italic> using the Cre-loxP system. The loxP sites flanked either side of exon 3 in the <italic>Crb3</italic> gene (Supplementary Fig. 1A). In mammals, CRB3 has two isoforms, CRB3a and CRB3b, distinguished by alternative splicing within the fourth exon of the <italic>CRB3</italic> gene, which in turn produces a protein with 23 amino acid differences at the C terminus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. According to the construction strategy, we are knocking out both isoforms <italic>Crb3a</italic> and <italic>Crb3b</italic> in the mice. The positive embryonic stem (ES) cell clone was confirmed for the wild-type gene (<italic>Crb3</italic><sup>wt/wt</sup>) and recombinant allele (<italic>Crb3</italic><sup>wt/fl</sup>) by Southern blotting (Supplementary Fig. 1B). The genotypes of the wild type, heterozygotes, and homozygotes (<italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>) were detected with specific primers (Supplementary Fig. 1C). We first intercrossed <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> with CMV enhancer/chicken β-actin promoter (CAG)-Cre mice and found that <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>, <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>wt/fl</sup>; CAG-Cre and <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>; CAG-Cre pups were born normally and well developed in size. However, most <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>; CAG-<italic>Cre</italic> pups died within a few days after birth. Few surviving <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>; CAG-<italic>Cre</italic> mice were smaller and showed anophthalmia than littermate <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice at 4 weeks old (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). The eye is an organ with perfect apical-basal cell polarity. However, <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mice showed ocular abnormalities. Together, these results indicate that Crb3 is necessary for eye development.</p>

<title>Deletion of mammary epithelial-specific <italic>Crb3</italic> causes ductal epithelial hyperplasia and tumorigenesis</title>
<p>Based on our earlier studies, which showed that inhibiting CRB3 impairs the organization of breast epithelium, we set out to directly explore the role of Crb3 in mammary gland development. We first developed epithelial cell-specific deletion of <italic>Crb3</italic> in the mammary gland by intercrossing <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat promoter (MMTV)-<italic>Cre</italic> mice. We confirmed the expression of Crb3 in the mammary gland using immunoblotting (both isoforms Crb3a and Crb3b), real-time quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemistry, and Crb3 expression was deficient in mammary epithelial cells with Crb3 knockout (Supplementary Fig. 1D-F).</p>
<p>To assess the function of Crb3 in the development of mammary epithelial cells, we analyzed whole mammary mounts from 8-week-old virgin <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>; MMTV-<italic>Cre</italic> and littermate <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>; MMTV-<italic>Cre</italic> mice displayed significantly increased numbers of terminal end buds (TEBs) and bifurcated TEBs compared to <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C-E</xref>). Histopathology results revealed that normal ductal epithelial cells were arranged as a monolayer in <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, while <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout led to ductal epithelial hyperplasia with increased ductal thickness in <italic>Crb3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>; MMTV-<italic>Cre</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the role of Crb3 in breast cancer tumorigenesis, we observed mammary glands from 9-week-old virgin polyomavirus middle T antigen (PyMT)-cKO-Crb3 and PyMT-WT mice. The mammary glands of PyMT mice progressed to early carcinomas and lost their normal epithelial architecture[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. The PyMT mouse model is widely used to study tumor initiation and development, with a histological progression similar to that of human breast cancer. PyMT-WT mice exhibited loss of epithelial features and developed breast cancer, while PyMT-cKO-Crb3 mice developed larger tumors with faster tumor progression and a poorly differentiated phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Thus, these results suggest that Crb3 knockout leads to ductal epithelial hyperplasia and promotes tumorigenesis.</p>

<title>CRB3 knockdown inhibits lumen formation in acini of mammary epithelial cells</title>
<p>MCF10A cells are spontaneously immortalized human breast epithelial cells with the characteristics of normal breast epithelium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. In 3D basement membrane culture conditions, MCF-10A cells form acini similar to mammary epithelial acini. This makes them a valuable system for studying the morphogenesis and oncogenesis of the mammary epithelium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. To confirm the function of CRB3 in mammary epithelial acini formation, we first knocked down the expression of both CRB3a and CRB3b isoforms using lentiviral shRNA in MCF10A cells (Supplementary Fig. 2A and B). Under the 3D culture system, we found that MCF10A cells infected with a non-targeting shRNA lentivirus formed acini after 6 days (D6) and eventually formed polarized acini with a hollow lumen at D14 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, after CRB3 knockdown, MCF10A cells formed more and larger aberrant acini without a lumen after D6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). Cell proliferation assays of MCF10A cells showed that CRB3 knockdown increased the proliferation rate and accelerated G1 to S phase progression (Supplementary Fig. 2C-E).</p>

<p>To investigate the reason for aberrant acini without lumens, we further studied apoptosis and mitotic spindle orientation during lumen formation in a 3D culture system. The immunofluorescence (IF) results showed that more internal cleaved-caspase 3-positive acini were observed in the control groups than in the CRB3 knockdown groups at D9 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C and D</xref>). Moreover, CRB3b overexpression significantly promoted apoptosis in breast cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. 2F-H). Similarly, the staining of α-tubulin in mitotic cells demonstrated more misorientation of the mitotic spindle in CRB3 knockdown groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E and F</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to verifying the effect of <italic>Crb3</italic> deletion on promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis <italic>in vivo</italic>, we detected these markers in primary tumor tissue from PyMT-WT and PyMT-cKO-Crb3 mice. <italic>Crb3</italic> deletion increased the numbers of proliferative and mitotic cells, and decreased the numbers of apoptotic cells in primary tumors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G and H</xref>). These results demonstrate that CRB3 could promote the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells, disrupt the mitotic spindle orientation, and protect the internal cells from apoptosis during acini formation, ultimately leading to irregular lumen formation and tumor progression.</p>

<title>CRB3 regulates primary cilium formation</title>
<p>The primary cilium is an apical antenna-like extensions in epithelial cells that is known to play an important role in controlling lumen formation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Previous studies have reported that CRB3 knockdown leads to primary cilium loss in MDCK cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanism that regulates ciliogenesis on apical surfaces is still unclear. To investigate the altered effect of CRB3 on ciliogenesis both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, we examined the formation of primary cilia in control MCF10A cells and CRB3 knockdown cells. We found that control MCF10A cells formed primary cilia after becoming confluent, while CRB3 knockdown led to significant ciliogenesis defects (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The number of cells with primary cilium was significantly reduced compared to the control group, but the length of the primary cilium that did exist was not different (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The overexpression of CRB3b in CRB3-depleted MCF10A cells was able to fully restore the formation of primary cilium to levels comparable to the control group (Supplementary Fig. 3A-C). Conversely, CRB3b conditional overexpression by adding doxycycline (+dox) resulted in restoring ciliary assembly in MCF7 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 3D). CRB3b overexpression increased the proportion of primary cilium formation in breast cancer cells, and the length of the restored primary cilium was increased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Importantly, the primary cilium could be directly visualized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). After CRB3 knockdown, the number of MCF10A cells with primary cilia was significantly decreased, while CRB3b conditional overexpression did not increase these populations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>).</p>

<p>To further support these findings <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used breast and kidney tissue to assess ciliogenesis in the <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mouse model. Renal epithelial cells can form prominent primary cilia, and the absence of primary cilia leads to ciliopathies. We used immunofluorescence to detect ciliary formation in the mammary ductal lumen and renal tubule.

<title>CRB3 localizes to the basal body of the primary cilium</title>
<p>CRB3, a polarity protein, is typically localized on the tight junctions of the apical epithelium membrane[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Additionally, we noted that CRB3b is found to be closely colocalized with centrosomes at prophase, metaphase, and anaphase[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. To investigate the relationship between CRB3 and ciliary formation, we first examined CRB3 localization in MCF10A cells expressing CRB3-GFP. In MCF10A cells, exogenous CRB3b was mainly localized at cell tight junctions and could colocalize with pericentrin (a centrosome marker) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). And approximately 40% of cells showed this co-localization of exogenous CRB3b and pericentrin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). To avoid the possibility that a large amount of exogenous overexpression leads to its accumulation at the ER and Golgi, which may affect its co-localization with the centrosome. We also verified this phenomenon by observing the localization of endogenous CRB3 (both isoforms CRB3a and CRB3b) with another centrosome marker. Similarly, we detected that CRB3 accumulated on one side of the cytoplasm and had a CRB3 foci located at the basal body represented by γ-tubulin in MCF10A cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). Importantly, CRB3 knockdown disturbed the accumulation of γ-tubulin at the basal body in confluent quiescence cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C, E</xref>). To demonstrate the relationship of this colocalization to the primary cilium, we employed acetylated tubulin to mark the primary cilium. Double immunostaining showed that this CRB3 foci was the basal body of the primary cilium, and CRB3 knockdown inhibited ciliary assembly in MCF10A cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F, G</xref>). These results suggest that CRB3 is located at the basal body of the primary cilium and that CRB3 knockdown disturbs the accumulation of γ-tubulin in quiescent cells.</p>

<title>CRB3 trafficking is mediated by Rab11-positive endosomes</title>
<p>To better investigate the molecular mechanisms of CRB3 in regulating primary cilium formation, we examined some important genes related to ciliogenesis. However, CRB3 knockdown did not affect the mRNA expression of these genes in MCF10A cells (Supplementary Fig. 4A). Then, we performed coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) tandem mass spectrometry using tagged exogenous CRB3b as bait to identify its interacting proteins (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Pathway aggregation analysis of these proteins revealed that these interacting proteins of CRB3b were significantly involved in Golgi vesicle transport and vesicle organization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). We focused on these pathways because smaller distal appendage vesicle (DAV) formation is critical for ciliogenesis initiation, and it requires the Rab GTPase Rab11-Rab8 cascade to function[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Interestingly, some Rab small GTPase family members identified as CRB3b-binding proteins were aggregated in these pathways, such as Rab10, Rab11A, Rab11B, Rab14, Rab1A, Rab1B, Rab21, Rab2A, Rab32, Rab35, Rab38, Rab5B, Rab5C, and Rab6A.

<p>Rab11-positive vesicles bind to centrosomal Rabin8, leading to ciliary membrane formation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. This finding suggested that the trafficking of Rab11-positive vesicles and polarized vesicles is essential for early ciliary assembly. Next, we examined the polarized vesicle traffic of CRB3 in MCF10A cells. Our studies found that CRB3 could colocalize with EEA1-positive early endosomes, CD63-positive late endosomes, and Rab11-positive recycling endosomes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). In addition, after treatment with dynasore, an endocytosis inhibitor, CRB3 significantly accumulated at the cell membrane after 2 hours, and the colocalization of CRB3 with EEA1-, CD63-, and Rab11-positive endosomes were significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C, D</xref>). We have previously reported that CRB3 regulates cell contact inhibition, which is significantly downregulated in confluent MCF10A cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Moreover, dynasore could rescue the CRB3 downregulation in confluent MCF10A cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). The knockdown of CRB3 did not affect Rab11 expression (Supplementary Fig. 4C). Rab11 knockdown resulted in a predominant localization of CRB3 to the cell membrane and a reduction in intracellular foci (Supplementary Fig. 5A, B). These results suggest that CRB3 colocalizes with EEA1, CD63, and Rab11 on endosomes, and in particular, Rab11-positive endosomes are involved in the intracellular trafficking of CRB3.</p>

<title>CRB3 knockdown destabilizes γTuRC assembly during ciliogenesis</title>
<p>According to our findings, we assumed that CRB3 might be involved in polarized vesicle trafficking. The γ-Tubulin ring complex (γTuRC) is a central regulator of microtubule nucleation and a nucleation site of α-tubulin and β-tubulin at the microtubule[organizing center in mitotic cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Additionally, the primary cilium, a microtubule-based structure attached to the basal body, is transformed from the mother centriole. As we found that CRB3 knockdown disturbed the accumulation of γ-tubulin prompted us to analyze γTuRC assembly in ciliogenesis. The γTuRC is composed of multiple copies of the γ[tubulin small complex (γTuSC), GCP2 and GCP3, plus GCP4, GCP5, and GCP6[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Our findings indicate that CRB3 downregulation did not affect the expression of γTuRC subunits (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). However, we performed co-IPs directed against GCP6 in CRB3-depleted cells and assessed the relative levels of both γTuSC-specific proteins compared with the control shRNA-treated cells. Interestingly, CRB3 knockdown significantly reduced the interaction of GCP6 with GCP3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). To verify this phenomenon, we observed the localization of GCP3 with GCP6 foci in MCF10A cells. Correspondingly, CRB3 downregulation significantly disturbed the colocalization of GCP3 with GCP6 foci in quiescence cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>). To investigate whether CRB3 facilitates γTuRC assembly, we fractionated MCF10A cytoplasmic proteins on sucrose gradients according to published methods[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. We noticed that γTuSC were sedimented mainly in fractions 3, while γTuRC sedimented in fractions 6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>). However, CRB3 downregulation caused most of GCP6 and GCP5 to be precipitated independently of γTuRC in the low-density fractions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that the depletion of CRB3 disrupts molecular interactions between the γTuRC proteins, resulting in a failure of microtubule formation in the primary cilium. However, this depletion may not affect the expression of these molecules during γTuRC assembly. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that CRB3 could facilitate the polarized vesicle trafficking of some γTuRC-specific proteins through Rab11-positive endosomes.</p>

<title>CRB3 interacts with Rab11</title>
<p>To fully prove this hypothesis, we first examined the interaction of CRB3 with Rab11-positive endosomes and γTuRC-specific proteins in MCF10A cells. Using CRB3 as bait, we identified that CRB3 could interact with Rab11, but not GCP6 and GCP3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). In contrast, Rab11 could interact with CRB3 and GCP6 instead of GCP3 by tagging Rab11 as bait (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). The co-IP results showed that CRB3 knockdown did not affect Rab11 interacting with GCP6, but the level of Rab11 binding to GCP6 tended to decrease in MCF10A cells with CRB3 knockdown (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>).

<p>Based on these results, we further detected the region of CRB3b that interacts with Rab11 by using coexpression and co-IP in HEK293 cells. CRB3b is composed of a signal peptide (SP), extracellular domain, transmembrane (TM), FERM-binding domain (FBD), and carboxy-terminal PDZ-binding domain (PBD). We constructed CRB3-GFP fusion proteins by fusing GFP tags to the extracellular domain, as previously reported[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). According to these domains, we also constructed the truncations of CRB3-GFP fusion proteins with serial C-terminal deletions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>) and another Flag-Rab11a fusion protein. The coexpression and co-IP results showed that Flag-Rab11a interacts with full-length CRB3 (1-120), CRB3 (1-116), CRB3 (1-83), and CRB3 (1-58) but not CRB3 (1-26) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). Therefore, the region of CRB3b that interacts with Rab11 is amino acids 27 to 58.</p>
<p>Rab11 is a small GTP-binding protein that plays an essential role in regulating the dynamics of recycling endosomes, which must undergo GDP/GTP cycles. In particular, Rab11a[S25N] is a GDP-locked form, while Rab11a[S20V] and Rab11a[Q70L] are GTP-locked forms[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. To further investigate the interaction between the GTP-bound form of Rab11a and CRB3b, we constructed these mutant variants of Rab11a. Next, we found that CRB3b interacts more strongly with Rab11a[Q70L] and Rab11a[S20V], while weakly interacting with Rab11a[S25N], compared to Rab11aWT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the interaction of CRB3b and Rab11a is dependent on the GTPase activity of Rab11a.</p>

<title>CRB3 navigates GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to CEP290 in the primary cilium</title>
<p>Since CRB3 knockdown does not affect the interaction with Rab11-positive endosomes and γTuRC-specific proteins GCP6, our focus was to determine whether CRB3 affects the localization of GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to the basal body of the primary cilium. We reviewed the identification of CRB3 interacting proteins and found some centriolar proteins. CEP290, for example, is located in the transition zone of the primary cilium and is required for the formation of microtubule-membrane linkers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Then, we verified that exogenous CRB3b could bind to CEP290, Rab11, GCP6 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>), and Rab11 also interacted with CEP290, CRB3-GFP, GCP6 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Similar to <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, the amount of GCP6 bound to Rab11 was reduced within CRB3 knockdown. Importantly, CRB3 knockdown made it difficult for Rab11 to bind CEP290 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). We corroborated these findings by checking the colocalization of the basal body foci of GCP6 and γ-tubulin, γ-tubulin and Rab11 in MCF10A and MEF cells. In quiescence control cells, GCP6 foci and γ-tubulin formed a prominent focus at the basal body of the primary cilium, as observed by immunofluorescence. However, CRB3 downregulation eliminated this focus and significantly disturbed the basal body foci of GCP6 and γ-tubulin in MCF10A cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>), and γ-tubulin and Rab11 in MEF cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). At the beginning of this experiment, we also attempted to show the interaction of CRB3, Rab11 and GCP6 by expressing fluorescence tagged GCP6 protein and using FRET assay. However, the centrosomal foci of fluorescent GCP6 was difficult to capture due to weak signal, and this may require re-overexpression of ninein-like protein (Nlp) to promote γTuRC enrichment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Although CRB3 knockdown had little effect on the formation of GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles, it significantly inhibited γTuRC assembly during ciliogenesis. This, in turn, impacted the transport of GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to the basal body of the primary cilium. Since CRB3 affected the binding of Rab11 and CEP290, we speculate that CRB3 may act as a navigator, navigating GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to the basal body of the primary cilium.</p>

<p>To investigate the effects of primary cilium absence, we examined alterations in the Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt signaling pathways in CRB3-depleted cells. Firstly, we detected the translocation of SMO into the primary cilium and the expression of the target gene GLI1. SAG, a potent Smoothened (SMO) receptor agonist, activates the Hh signaling pathway. However, in MCF10A cells treated with SAG, CRB3 knockdown did not promote SMO translocation into the primary cilium (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8E</xref>). After SAG treatment, the mRNA expression of GLI1 was significantly decreased in CRB3-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8F</xref>). Crb3 knockout did not alter GLI1 expression and nuclear localization in primary tumors of PyMT-cKO-Crb3 mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8H</xref>). We previously reported that CRB3 expression was high in immortalized mammary epithelial cells, whereas loss of CRB3 expression was observed in breast cancer cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. On the other hand, western blotting showed that CRB3 knockdown resulted in significant downregulation of GSK3-β in MCF10A cells. Additionally, β-catenin, the major effector of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, was upregulated. In breast cancer cells, CRB3b overexpression led to upregulation of GSK3-β and downregulation of β-catenin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8G</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 6). Notably, β-catenin was significantly upregulated and markedly localized in the nucleus of PyMT-cKO-Crb3 mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8I</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that CRB3 knockdown cannot activate the Hh signaling pathway but can activate the Wnt signaling pathway, which is ultimately contributes to tumorigenesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Apical-basal cell polarity is essential for cellular architecture, development, and homeostasis in epithelial tissues. However, most malignant cancers lack cell polarity due to the unconstrained cell cycle and cell migration with decreased adhesion. CRB3, an important apical protein, is significantly reduced in various tumor cells and tissues, as well as promotes metastasis and tumor formation in nude mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Here, we generated a novel transgenic mouse model with conditional deletion of Crb3 to investigate the role of polarity proteins in tumorigenesis. <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mice were reported to have cystic kidneys, improper airway clearance in the lung, villus fusion, apical membrane blebs, and disrupted microvilli in intestine airway clearances, which demonstrated that CRB3 is crucial for the development of the apical membrane and epithelial morphogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Importantly, our studies in the <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mouse model suggest that in addition to death after birth, it is characterized by smaller size, ocular abnormality, bronchial smooth muscle layer defect, reduced pancreatic islets, and hyperplasia mammary ductal and renal tubular epithelium (some data not shown). These important phenotypic changes are due to the disruption of epithelial polarity homeostasis, which may ultimately lead to tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>In addition, we observed the absence of primary cilia in the mammary ductal lumen and renal tubule in the <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mouse model. Consistent with other reports, CRB3 knockdown regulated ciliary assembly in MDCK cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, CRB3 was localized in the inner segments of photoreceptor cells and concentrated with the connecting cilium throughout the development of the mouse retina[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. These ocular defect phenotypes closely resemble those of EHD1 knockout mice, which regulate ciliary vesicle formation in primary cilium assembly[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Hence, CRB3 can affect primary cilium formation in various epithelial tissues, such as the breast, kidney, and retina.</p>
<p>Previous literature has reported that CRB3 localizes within the primary cilium in differentiated MDCK cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. However, our findings indicate that it is mainly located on the basal body of the primary cilium in mammary epithelial cells. The immunofluorescence results in these literatures showed that CRB3 was scattered on the primary cilia, with a strong foci at the basal body. Notably, in rat kidney collecting ducts, the localization of CRB3 on primary cilia was significantly reduced, while the obvious localization was at the basal body[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Another study also reported the co-localization of CRB3b and γ[tubulin in MDCK cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. This finding is consistent with our conclusion, and we also verified its co-localization with the centrosome by overexpressing CRB3b in mammary epithelial cells, indicating that CRB3 mainly localizes to the basal body of the primary cilium. Since CRB3b also alters primary cilium formation in the mammary epithelium, it is important to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which CRB3 regulates primary cilium formation. Subsequently, we used mass spectrometry to identify the CRB3b binding protein. Our findings indicate that CRB3b not only binds to some centrosomal proteins, but also plays a significant role in Golgi vesicle transport (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, B). These results are consistent with the results of the endogenous CRB3 staining by laser confocal microscopy (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Specifically, endogenous CRB3 localizes to the centrosome and strongly accumulates in an undefined intracellular structure near the cell nucleus, likely to be the Golgi. However, when we compared the fluorescence microscopy analysis of exogenous CRB3b staining (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), we found that the main localization was observed at the cell tight junctions, which is consistent with the reported molecular function. Additionally, there was a strong accumulation of staining around the cell nucleus, with a shape different from the endogenous staining around the cell nucleus. We speculate that this may be due to excessive overexpression of exogenous proteins, which obstruct the protein secretion pathway and result in the accumulation of the exogenous protein at the ER and Golgi. To better study the cell localization of exogenous CRB3b, a conditional induction expression or knock-in tag on the endogenous CRB3 gene could be used.</p>
<p>Polarized vesicular traffic plays a crucial role in extending the primary cilium on apical epithelial surfaces. However, the molecular mechanism and its relationship to tumorigenesis remain unclear. Here, we reveal that Rab11-positive endosomes mediate the intracellular trafficking of CRB3 and that CRB3 can navigate GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to CEP290, promoting correct γTuRC assembly during primary cilium formation. When cells form tight junctions, CRB3 is mainly localized to the cell membrane, and subsequently, the endosomes participate in the intracellular degradation process of CRB3 on the cell membrane. The intracellular CRB3 can bind to Rab11, which in turn participates in primary cilium assembly. Additionally, in the presence of CRB3, the epithelium can form contact inhibition and an intact primary cilium in quiescence to achieve cellular homeostasis. In contrast, the loss of contact inhibition and primary cilium formation with CRB3 deletion can activate the Wnt signaling pathway, affect the Hh signaling pathway, and disrupt the imbalance of this cellular homeostasis, resulting in significant cell proliferation during tumorigenesis (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Schematic model of CRB3 regulating ciliary assembly.</title>
<p>Graphic summary of prominent phenotypes observed after CRB3 deletion. CRB3 is localized on apical epithelial surfaces and participates in tight junction formation to maintain contact inhibition and cell homeostasis in quiescence. Inside the cell, Rab11-positive endosomes mediate the intracellular trafficking of CRB3, and CRB3 navigates GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to CEP290. Then, GCP6 is involved in normal γTuRC assembly in ciliogenesis. In CRB3 deletion cells, the primary cilium fails to assemble properly, and the Wnt signaling pathway is activated through β-catenin upregulation and nuclear localization, but the Hh signaling pathway fails to be activated. This cellular imbalance is disrupted, leading to tumorigenesis. Abbreviations: γTuRC, γ-tubulin ring complex; TJ, tight junction; EE, early endosome; LE, late endosome.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>The formation of the primary cilium has been divided into several distinct phases. It begins with the maturation of the mother centriole, also known as the centriole-to-basal-body transition[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. DAVs, which are small cytoplasmic vesicles originating from the Golgi and the recycling endosome, accumulate in the vicinity of the distal appendages of the mother centriole[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. In growing RPE1 cells, Rab8a is localized to cytoplasmic vesicles and the Golgi/trans-Golgi network, while Rab8-positive vesicles are rapidly redistributed to the mother centriole by binding to Rab11-positive recycling and endosomes under serum starvation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. The EHD1 protein converts these DAVs to form larger ciliary vesicles, which elongate through continuous fusion with Rab8-positive vesicles to produce the primary cilium membrane[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Therefore, Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, as important transporters, are necessary for primary cilium formation and centriole-basal-body transition in the early phase. Our study found that CRB3 could bind to some members of Rab small GTPase family, significantly participating in Golgi vesicle transport and vesicle organization pathways through mass spectrometry identification. And coexpression and co-IP results showed that CRB3 interacted with Rab11, which mediated the intracellular trafficking of CRB3 within Rab11-positive endosomes at different cell densities.</p>
<p>Unlike motile cilia, primary cilia have a 9+0 structure, consisting of only nine outer doublet microtubules without a central pair. Similar to microtubule assembly at microtubule[organizing centers (MTOCs) during mitosis, γ-tubulin, which is a part of γTuRC, is also concentrated in the basal body of the cilium in interphase[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. γ[tubulin complexes have been shown to form microtubule templates and regulate microtubule nucleation through longitudinal contacts with α[tubulin and β[tubulin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. The γTuRC consists of multiple copies of γTuSC, which is composed of two copies of γ[tubulin and one each of GCP2 and GCP3. Then, GCP2 and GCP3 interact with GCP4, GCP5 and GCP6 to form γTuRC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Our experiments showed that CRB3 knockdown did not affect the expression of the γTuRC-specific proteins GCP3, GCP6, and γ[tubulin, but inhibited the interaction between GCP6 and GCP3, leading to the destabilization of γTuRC. Further analysis revealed that significant colocalization was observed between GCP6- and Rab11-positive vesicles at low cell density, while at high cell density, GCP6 accumulated at the centrosome with GCP3. CRB3 knockdown resulted in the disappearance of this accumulated GCP6. These results indicated that GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles must be transported to the basal body for ciliogenesis. While it is still unclear how CRB3 interferes with γTuRC assembly during primary cilium formation, we hypothesize that Rab11-positive endosomes mediate the intracellular trafficking of CRB3 and that CRB3, as a navigator interacting with CEP290, can navigate GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to the transition zone for γTuRC assembly during primary cilium formation.</p>
<p>CEP290 is a centriolar or ciliary protein that localizes to the centrosomes in dividing cells, the distal mother centriole in quiescent cells, and the transition zone in the primary cilium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Mutations in <italic>CEP290</italic> are associated with various diseases, such as the devastating blinding disease Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis (LCA), nephronophthisis, Senior Lǿken syndrome (SLS), Joubert syndrome (JS), Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), and lethal Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MGS)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. In particular, the phenotypes of CEP290-associated ciliopathies are very similar to those in our <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mouse model, with lethality and ocular and renal abnormalities. CEP290 knockdown significantly decreased the number of cells with primary cilia, and CEP290 knockout mice showed mislocalization of ciliary proteins in the retinas[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Additionally, the depletion of CEP290 disrupts protein trafficking to centrosomes and affects the recruitment of the BBSome and vesicular trafficking in ciliary assembly[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Although CEP290 serves as a hub to recruit many ciliary proteins, it has not been reported to be involved in polarized vesicle trafficking or localization. Our study verified that CEP290 could interact with the polarity protein CRB3. CRB3 knockdown disrupts the interaction between CEP290 and Rab11-positive endosomes. Thus, these results validate our hypothesis. Although CRB3 navigates GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to CEP290, we further need to detect the region of CRB3 interacting with CEP290 and what other cargos are transported by CRB3/Rab11 trafficking vesicles in ciliary assembly.</p>
<p>In addition, our results showed that CRB3 knockdown failed to activate the Hh signaling pathway with SAG in MCF10A cells. Under untreated conditions, PTCH1 located at the ciliary membrane inhibits SMO, and Suppressor of Fused (SuFu) sequesters Gli transcription factors, leading to their degradation. SAG can activate the Hh signaling pathway, resulting in dissociation into the nucleus to regulate the expression of downstream target genes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. The Hh signaling pathway mainly regulates cellular growth and differentiation and is abnormal in different types of tumors. Some studies indicate that cilia are double-sided, promoting and preventing cancer development through the Hh signaling pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is thought that cilia deletion could activate SMO to inhibit tumor growth, while promoting carcinogenesis was induced by activated Gli2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Although SAG cannot activate the Hh signaling pathway in CRB3-depleted cells, further research is needed to determine the role of CRB3 in the carcinogenic process through the ciliary Hh signaling pathway in PyMT-cKO-Crb3 mice. Additionally, another canonical Wnt signaling pathway was altered after CRB3 knockdown. The Wnt signaling pathway is an important cascade regulating development and stemness, and aberrant Wnt signaling has been reported in many cancer entities, especially colorectal cancer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. In our study, CRB3 downregulated the expression of β-catenin. Thus, CRB3 can affect cilium-related signaling pathways in tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>In summary, our study provides novel evidence for the role of the apical polarity protein CRB3 in regulating viability, mammary and ocular development, and primary cilium formation in germline and conditional knockout mice. Deletion of CRB3 caused irregular lumen formation and ductal epithelial hyperplasia in mammary epithelial-specific knockout mice. Further study uncovered a new function of CRB3b in interacting with Rab11, navigating GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to CEP290 for γTuRC assembly during ciliogenesis. In addition, CRB3 also participates in regulating cilium-related Hh and Wnt signaling pathways in tumorigenesis. Understanding these polarity protein-mediated vesicle trafficking mechanisms will shed new light on luminal development and tumorigenesis.</p>

The membranes were subjected to immunoblot assays using antibodies against CRB3 (Santa Cruz, USA, sc-292449, both isoforms CRB3a and CRB3b can be detected), GCP2 (Santa Cruz, USA, sc-377117), GCP3 (Santa Cruz, USA, sc-373758), GCP4 (Santa Cruz, USA, sc-271876), GCP5 (Santa Cruz, USA, sc-365837), GCP6 (Abcam, UK, ab95172), γ-tubulin (Proteintech, USA, #66320-1-Ig), Rab11 (Abcam, UK, ab128913), GFP (Roche, USA, #11814460001), Flag (Sigma, USA, F7425), CEP290 (Santa Cruz, USA, sc-390637), GSK3-β (CST, USA, #12456), β-catenin (CST, USA, #8480), GAPDH (Proteintech, USA, #HRP-6004), and β-actin (Proteintech, USA, #HRP-60008). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (CST, USA, #7074, #7076) were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. Final detection was achieved by using ECL Plus (Millipore, Germany, WBULS0500). Proteins for the immunoprecipitation assay were lysed with NP40 buffer. The cell lysates were detected by a Dynabeads protein G immunoprecipitation kit (Invitrogen, USA, #10007D) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The elution protein complexes were subjected to an immunoblot assay.</p>

<title>Protein identification and bioinformatics analyses</title>
<p>LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted by PTM Bio (Zhejiang, China). Q Exactive<sup>TM</sup> Plus (Thermo, MA, USA) was used for tandem mass spectrometry data analysis. The Blast2GO program against the UniProt database was used to perform functional annotation and classification of the identified proteins. Subsequently, DAVID tools were used to perform pathway enrichment analysis.</p>

<title>Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations</title>
<p>MCF10A cells with CRB3-GFP and CRB3 knockdown were plated on culture slides, and doxycycline (Dox) was added to induce the expression of CRB3-GFP. After the cells were fully confluent, the slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C overnight, followed by 1% osmium tetroxide at 4°C for 1 h. Dehydration was performed at room temperature, and the samples were dried using the critical point drying method. Images were obtained by using a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi TM1000, Japan).</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistics 23.0 for Windows (IBM, Armonk, USA). All experiments were repeated at least three times. The values are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare the differences between two groups. One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test was used for multiple comparisons. The χ<sup>2</sup> test was used to assess the significance of the observed frequencies. <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 was considered an indicator of statistical significance.</p>

<p>This is a <bold>useful</bold> study for scientists interested in cell polarity, epithelial morphogenesis, cancer, and primary cilia. The authors investigate the role of CRB3 in regulating these processes by using a combination of a mammary epithelial cell-specific conditional Crb3 knockout mouse model, and cellular, molecular and biochemical approaches. The results, which are <bold>solid</bold>, supporting and extending previous findings, suggest that CRB3 affects ciliogenesis by a mechanism involving Rab11 and gamma-TuRC.</p>

<p>In this study the authors first perform global knockout of the gene coding for the polarity protein Crumbs 3 (CRB3) in the mouse and show that this leads to perinatal lethality and anopthalmia. Next, they create a conditional knockout mouse specifically lacking CRB3 in mammary gland epithelial cells and show that this leads to ductal epithelial hyperplasia, impaired branching morphogenesis and tumorigenesis. To study the mechanism by which CRB3 affects mammary epithelial development and morphogenesis the authors turn to MCF10A cells and find that CRB3 shRNA-mediated knockdown in these cells impairs their ability to form properly polarized acini in 3D cultures. Furthermore, they find that MCF10A cells lacking CRB3 display reduced primary ciliation frequency compared to control cells, which is supported by rescue experiments and is in agreement with previous studies implicating CRB3 in primary cilia biogenesis. Using a combination of biochemical, molecular- and imaging approaches the authors then provide evidence indicating that CRB3 promotes ciliogenesis by mediating Rab11-dependent recruitment of gamma-tubulin ring complex (gamma-TuRC) component GCP6 to the centrosome/ciliary base, and they also show that CRB3 itself is localized to the base of primary cilia. Finally, to assess the functional consequences of CRB3 loss on ciliary signaling function, the authors analyze the effect of CRB3 loss on Hedgehog and Wnt signaling using cell-based assays or a mouse model.</p>
<p>Overall, the described findings are interesting and in agreement with previous studies showing an involvement of CRB3 in epithelial cell biology, tumorigenesis and ciliogenesis. The results showing a role for CRB3 in mammary epithelial development and morphogenesis in vivo seem convincing. Although the authors provide evidence that CRB3 promotes ciliogenesis via (indirect) physical association with Rab11 and gamma-TuRC, the precise mechanism by which CRB3 promotes ciliogenesis remains to be clarified.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer # 1 (Public Review)</bold></p>
<p>Specific comments</p>
<p>1. For all cell-based assays using shRNA to knock down CRB3, it would be desirable to perform rescue experiments to ensure that the observed phenotype of CRB3 depleted cells is specific and not due to off-target effects of the shRNA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. Based on your suggestions, we performed the rescue experiments to observe any alterations in the primary cilia of CRB3-depleted MCF10A cells with overexpressed CRB3. The revised parts can be found in lines 186-188 and the new Supplementary Figure 3A-C has been added.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 3G: it is very difficult to see that the red stained structures are primary cilia.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, the staining structure of primary cilia in mammary ductal lumen are less clear than that of individual cells and in renal tubule in Figure 3G. We used recognized acetylated tubulin and γ-tubulin to stain the primary cilia, which were clearly labeled in individual cells. However, the labeled primary cilia in renal tubule were longer length and demonstrated a more pronounced structure than those in the mammary ductal lumen. In the mammary ductal lumen of the 10 mice we analyzed, the primary cilia showed shorter length and staining structure than the others shown in Figure 3G. This difference may be due to the distinct characteristics of primary cilia in different tissues.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 5A: it is unfortunate the authors chose not to show the original dataset (Excel file) used for generating this figure; this makes it difficult to interpret the data. It is general policy of the journal to make source data accessible to the scientific community.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In accordance with the journal policy, we have provided the original dataset (Excel file) for Figure 5A, as detailed in “Figure 5–Source Data 1”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors have a tendency to overinterpret their data, and not all claims put forth by the authors are fully supported by the data provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have carefully read through the whole text and have revised the overinterpretation parts. These parts can be found in lines 48-50, lines 93-95, and lines 260-261.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer # 2 (Public Review)</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for recognizing and supporting our research for this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer # 1 (Recommendations For The Authors)</bold></p>
<p>1. Abstract line 48-51: data overinterpretation. The authors cannot claim this based on the data they are presenting. Please modify the statement/temper the claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. We have revised this sentence in the abstract, as well as lines 48-50 for details.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. There are several grammatical errors throughout the manuscript. In particular, the following sentences/statements are either wrong, confusing or non-sensical: lines 55-56; lines 87-90; lines 93-95; lines 385-387; lines 409-410.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your positive comments. We have modified lines 55-56 to become new lines 54-55. These sentences in lines 87-90 and lines 93-95 are difficult to understand and logically problematic, so we have carefully revised this paragraph (new lines 85-90). Lines 385-387 have been deleted as they are non-sensical. Lines 409-410 contain misrepresentations. We have revised them in new lines 408-409.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Lines 257-259: this is data over-interpretation. It is not correct to state CRB3 is highly dynamic without having done any live cell imaging.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. We have revised this sentence, see revised lines 260-261 for details.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 8E: if cells do not make cilia when CRB3 is lost (Figure 3), how is it possible to analyze SMO localization to cilia in these cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. We used immunofluorescence techniques, with acetylated tubulin and SMO co-staining, to analyze the localization of SMO to cilia. The results of immunofluorescent staining of primary cilium and statistical analysis in Figure 3 showed that the proportion of cells with primary cilium was significantly lower in the CRB3 knockdown group, but cells with primary cilium were still present. We used laser confocal microscopy micrographs to identify cells with primary cilium by staining acetylated tubulin, then analyzed the co-localization under the SMO channel, and finally analyzed the proportion of SMO-positive cilia. Several publications (J Cell Biol. 2020;219(6):e201904107; Science. 2008;320(5884):1777-81; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012;109(34):13644-9.) have demonstrated that knocking down genes can affect primary cilium formation, and this method has also been used to examine the localization of SMO-related signaling pathway molecules on primary cilium.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Lines 366-366: based on the relative low magnification of the images in Figure 8H it is difficult to assess the subcellular localization of GLI1 and whether there is a difference between wild type and the Crb3 mutant cells. For example, it is not clear if GLI1 is localizing to the centrosome-cilium axis. Please modify the text accordingly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your good suggestions. As you mentioned, IHC cannot observe the subcellular localization of GLI1 on the centrosome-cilium axis. However, since GLI1 is a transcriptional effector at the terminal end of the Hh signaling pathway, we may not have made it clear that what we observed in the IHC results was the localization of GLI1 in the nucleus. Therefore, we have revised the description accordingly, as described in line 368 and lines 520-521.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 7D, E: the zoomed-in images look pixelated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your positive comments. We have replaced these images in the new Figure 7D and E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 8B: Acetylacte-tub is misspelled.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. We have revised and standardized the acetylated tubulin stain to &quot;Ace-tubulin&quot; in all immunofluorescent images throughout the manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer # 2 (Recommendations For The Authors)</bold></p>
<p>1. <list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>CRB3 is present in mammals as 2 isoforms, A and B, originating from an alternative splicing. In this study, the authors never mention this fact and when using approaches to KO or KD CRB3A/B they are likely to deplete both isoforms which have been shown to have different C-terminal domains and functions (Fan et al., 2007). This is also important for the CRB3 antibodies used in the study since according to the material and methods section they are either against the extracellular domain common to both isoforms or the intracellular domain which is only similar in the domain close to transmembrane between the 2 isoforms. Since the antibodies used in each figure are not detailed it is impossible to know if the authors are detecting CRB3A or B or both. Please provide the information and correct for the actual isoform detected in the data and conclusions.</p>
</list-item></list></p>
<p>From the revised version we know now that CRB3B is used for exogenous expression. It has been shown that each isoform has a different role and localization in cells so why focus only on CRB3B for this study?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your positive comments. First, previous literature has reported that CRB3b localizes in the primary cilium of MDCK cells. We have corrected the Introduction to specify CRB3b (line 81). Secondly, in the methodology section, we show that the CDs sequence of CRB3b was PCR-amplified from RNA extracted from MCF10A cells. We also designed primers specific to CRB3a but were unable to amplify them, indicating that CRB3b is significantly more expressed in epithelial cells than CRB3a. Finally, according to the company recommended by Genecards website for purchasing CRB3 cloning products, the only CRB3 sequence available in the CRB3 cDNA ORF Clone in Cloning Vector, Human (Cat: HG14324-G) from Sino Biological is CRB3b.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. <list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The authors use GFP-CRB3A/B, it is not stated which isoform, over-expression to localize CRB3A/B in MCF10A cells (figure 4A). The levels of expression appear to be very high in the GFP panel and it is likely that the secretory pathway of the cells is clogged with GFP-CRB3A/B in transit from the ER to the plasma membrane. Thus, the colocalization with pericentrin might be due to the accumulation of ER and Golgi around the centrosome. This colocalization should be done with the endogenous CRB3A/B and with a better resolution.</p>
</list-item></list></p>
<p>The authors do not answer about the potential mislocalization of overexpressed exogenous protein.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer's perspective. The large amount of exogenous protein overexpression in the cell could potentially obstruct the protein secretion pathway, resulting in the accumulation of the exogenous protein at the ER and Golgi. Such accumulation could create the false impression of co-localization between CRB3b and the centrosome. To provide additional details (lines 215-217 and lines 426-433), we re-expressed the results exogenously and subsequently used staining of endogenous CRB3 and γ-tubulin in Fig. 4C to confirm the co-localization of CRB3 and the centrosome.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. <list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The staining for CRB3A/B in Figure 4C (red) is striking with a very strong accumulation in an undefined intracellular structure and the authors do not provide any explanation for such a difference with the GFP-CRB3A/B just above.</p>
</list-item></list></p>
<p>The authors explain that two different photonic techniques are used (classical versus confocal) but in a cell biology manuscript confocal microscopy is now the standard technique.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. We have included a discussion on the partial concordance between CRB3's endogenous staining and exogenous expression results in the &quot;Discussion&quot; section, specifically in lines 420-435.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. <list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>In addition, the authors claim (Line 251/252) that Rab11 is necessary for the transport of CRB3A/B but they should KD Rab11 to show this.</p>
</list-item></list></p>
<p>The author's answer is that blocking endocytosis with dynasore is as good as knocking down Rab11 to show its interaction and role in CRB3A/B transport which is not the case.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. As requested by the reviewers, we have conducted experiments to knockdown Rab11 and detect CRB3 intracellular trafficking, as shown in the new Supplementary Figure 5B and added lines 258-260. These results provide additional support for our conclusions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. <list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The domain of CRB3A/B that is necessary for the interaction with Rab11 is the N-terminal part of the extracellular domain. This domain is thus inside the transport vesicles and not accessible from the cytoplasm. Given that Rab11 is a cytoplasmic protein, how the 2 proteins could interact across the membrane? The authors do not even discuss this essential point for their hypothesis.
Comment on the revised version: the authors still do not understand the basic of cell biology since they claim that the extracellular domain of CRB3 can be in contact with Rab11 after endocytosis. Even after endocytosis the extracellular domain of CRB3A/B is inside the lumen of the endosome and not in contact with the cytosol where Rab11 is located. Lines 420-421 of the revised manuscript still claim this interaction between the two proteins without providing the link between the cytosol where Rab11 is and the endosome lumen where the extracellular domain of CRB3A/B is. Please correct.</p>
</list-item></list></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your positive comments. After carefully studying the relevant knowledge, we strongly agree with the reviewer's point of view. We have toned down our claim and removed the description regarding the binding of Rab11 endosomes to specific structural domains of intracellular CRB3 that we were unable to confirm (see lines 443-444 and lines 465-466).</p>
