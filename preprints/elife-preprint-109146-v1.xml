<abstract>
<p>APOE4, the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and ABCA1, required for lipidation of APOE are gene products of the liver X receptor (LXR) receptor. LXR agonists have been validated in animal models as therapeutics for AD, atherosclerosis, and many other diseases. Clinical progress has been thwarted by unwanted hepatic lipogenesis. Structurally diverse LXR ligands were profiled in coregulator TR-FRET (CRT) assays analyzing ligand-induced coactivator recruitment, coactivator selectivity, corepressor dissociation, and LXR isoform selectivity. A multiplex CRT assay was developed to measure synchronous ligand-induced displacement of corepressor by coactivator. Potency for coactivator recruitment to LXRβ correlated with induction of ABCA1 in human astrocytoma cells. Correlation with lipogenic activation of sterol response element (SRE) in hepatocarcinoma cells, was more complex. CRT response was diverse revealing ligands with theoretical full agonist, partial agonist, antagonist, and inverse agonist signatures within the same chemical series, suggesting the scope for precision CRT to guide nonlipogenic LXR agonist design.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) requires post-mortem hallmark neuropathology of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neu-rofibrilliary tangles of intraneuronal tau protein, in combination with characteristic in-life cognitive decline. Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) defines a broader patient population, taking account of observations that: (i) hallmark pathology is not necessary and sufficient for progression to dementia; and (ii) at least half of AD patients manifest multiple forms of neuropathology at death. The original description, by Alois Alzheimer, of AD pathology in the brain of Auguste Deter, in addition to Aβ and tau, has been interpreted to include a third neuropathology: lipid granule accumulation in glial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Although this pathology, associated with lipid droplets, has been relatively forgotten, several modern theories of ADRD pathogenesis, such as the “small particle HDL (high density lipoprotein) hypothesis”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> propose a central role for cholesterol mobilization and lipoprotein transport. The 2020 Lancet Commission on Dementia stated that reducing the risk from diseases such as Type-2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity would have a significant impact on healthy aging with cognition intact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Subsequently, the 2024 Lancet Commission introduced LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol as the highest-contributing modifiable risk factor for dementia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lipid droplets contain esterified cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides and other debris from phagocytosis of neurons and are found in astrocytes and microglia as a normal component of lipid homeostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> The processing of dying cells, a primary task of microglia, relies upon cholesterol metabolism and transport, which when microglia are over-whelmed requires recruitment of astrocytes to assist in phagocytosis, leading to astrogliosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> Under physiological conditions, lipid droplets undergo lipophagy via mitochondrial cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated oxidation of cholesterol to 24-hydroxycholesterol (24HC) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), metabolites that cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Normal cholesterol metabolism and transport utilizes peripheral reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) for clearance to the liver, where cholesterol and metabolites are converted to bile acids. However, aberrant accumulation of lipid droplets in microglia and astrocytes leads to reduced lipophagy, accumulation of cholesterol and reduced production of 27HC. The consequence is elevated cholesterol levels in all cellular membranes, including the plasma membrane where lipid raft malfunction leads to disruption of synapses and multiple signaling pathways. Lipophagy and clearance of excess cholesterol via RCT requires efflux to lipoproteins, which is orchestrated by the nuclear hormone receptor (NR) liver-X-receptor (LXR) and its gene products, including <italic>APOE</italic> (apolipoprotein-E) and <italic>ABCA1</italic> (ATP-binding cassette-A1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> <italic>APOE4</italic> is the major genetic risk factor for ADRD and is associated with aberrant lipid accumulation, notably in microglia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>ABCA1 is expressed ubiquitously throughout the human body, with levels in the periphery highest in liver hepatocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> The 2,261 amino acid human ABCA1 protein is an integral membrane protein consuming ATP to transport cholesterol, phospholipids, and other lipids to apolipoprotein carriers that bind to ABCA1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> ABCA1 associates with cholesterol-rich membrane domains in the plasma membrane and intracellular organelle membranes, including endosomes and lysosomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> ABCA1 functions, in part, to protect cells from excessive and potentially cytotoxic accumulation of free cholesterol. ABCA1 transports lipids to specialized apolipoproteins, APOA1, APOA2, APOA4, APOC1-3, and APOE, to assemble HDL particles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> ABCA1 is uniquely important in early loading of apolipoproteins in the minimally lipidated state,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> in contrast to related ABC family members (e.g. ABCG1/G4) and cholesterol transporters (e.g. SR-B1) that interact with apolipoproteins in their more lipidated states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> Owing to the direct influence of ABCA1 on cellular cholesterol homeostasis, increased ABCA1 activity has many indirect physiological functions. Taken together, the evidence supports ABCA1 as a promising target for therapeutics that might broadly attenuate pathophysiologic processes in the periphery and in the central nervous system (CNS). In the brain, ABCA1 is found in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>ABCA1 associates with cholesterol-rich membrane domains, where it protects cells from excessive, and potentially cytotoxic, cholesterol and lipid accumulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> LDL particles contribute to vascular cholesterol deposition, inflammation, and atherogenesis to drive atherosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> Conversely, HDL particles are anti-atherogenic. HDL facilitates removal of cholesterol from vascular walls and peripheral tissues to the liver for catabolism and excretion, via RCT. HDL, thereby prevents formation of cytotoxic oxidized lipid species and reduces inflammation and atherogenic lesion formation. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> ABCA1 is essential for formation of nascent small HDL particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, and with ABCG1, promotes formation of mature HDL particles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reduced plasma cholesterol efflux capacity, which is directly tied to ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression, synergizes with other components of metabolic syndrome to promote atherogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Oxidation of LDL and other pathological changes that occur during atherogenesis, may down-regulate ABCA1 expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> Tangier disease, characterized by <italic>ABCA1</italic> loss-of-function mutations, leads to premature atherosclero-sis;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> furthermore, <italic>ABCA1</italic> variants that increase AD risk have also been associated with T2D and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> Peripheral atheroprotection via ABCA1 induction promotes cerebrovascular health and preserves BBB integrity and function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> Therefore, the beneficial role of ABCA1 in CNS disorders may derive from central actions and peripheral effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>ABCA1</italic> and other genes involved in cholesterol metabolism, mobilization, and signaling are gene products of LXR. Therapeutic approaches to enhance ABCA1 have been reviewed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> LXR is the primary NR target for pharmacologic induction of ABCA1 expression. LXR agonists have been studied in many disease models, with the most intensive efforts targeting a therapeutic strategy to treat atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>The two NR isoforms, LXRα (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2) mediate gene transcription via transcriptional complexes that bind to specific or shared NR response elements on DNA. LXRα is expressed in liver, small intestine, and adipose, and LXRβ is ubiquitously expressed. LXR forms heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR). Transcriptional complexes are formed by recruitment of coregulator proteins that provide scaffolds for binding of epigenetic tools for DNA and histone writing, erasing, and reading. Since coregulators are shared between NRs, competition for coregulators is one of the many elements allowing crosstalk between different NRs. The canonical mechanism of lig- and activation is the binding of an agonist to the NR dimer, in this case the LXR:RXR heterodimer, leading to coactivator recruitment to the transcriptional complex. In an alternate mechanism, transcriptional repression is maintained by corepressor binding to the unliganded heterodimer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), with ligand binding leading to activation/derepression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The endogenous ligands for LXR are oxysterols (including 22(<italic>R</italic>)-hydroxycholesterol, 24HC, and 27HC) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> that activate LXR via canonical or alternate mechanisms.</p>

<p>LXR controls several transcriptional programs one of which, mediated by the master hepatic regulator sterol-response element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) leads to unwanted lipogenesis, triglyceride (TG) synthesis, and elevated LDL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Adverse effects associated with elevated levels of TG, include steatohepatitis, and hepatomegaly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> The challenge in developing LXR agonists as therapeutics for T2D, CVD, and ADRD has been to avoid the adverse activation of the lipogenic axis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The dominant approach has been to develop agonists selective for LXRβ over LXRα.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> The rationale for developing LXRβ-selective agonists is based on the high expression of LXRα in the liver; however, despite considerable efforts by pharmaceutical companies, selective LXRβ-selective agonists have yet to be successfully translated to the clinic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>A recent paper from Astra Zeneca researchers (Belorusova et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>) specifically addressed the challenge in discovery of LXR ligands as nonlipogenic ABCA1 inducers to treat atherosclerosis. Mouse intestinal ABCA1 and plasma TG were used as binary ligand descriptors that were correlated with LXR readouts, most notably H/D-exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) measurements that inferred ligand-induced conformational changes in the LXR ligand binding domain (LBD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> Coregulator TR-FRET (CRT) measurements of coregulator binding to the LBD have been widely used in the NR field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> A detailed and comprehensive CRT study of LXR ligands, both clinical and late preclinical, has not been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> CRT data has been reported for individual ligands; for example, to claim that LXR agonist IMB-808 was nonlipogenic because of selective recruitment of specific coactivators. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> Since repression of lipogenesis in the liver requires corepressor binding to LXRα, corepressors must be included in CRT studies.</p>
<p>We profiled diverse LXR ligands by CRT, including those studied in clinical trials: (i) to assess NR promiscuity by measuring coactivator recruitment to 9 steroid NRs; (ii) to measure LXRα and LXRβ selectivity by measuring SRC1 coactivator recruitment; (iii) to measure differential coactivator recruitment; (iv) to delineate the effect of putative antagonists, partial agonists, and inverse agonists; and (v) to define corepressor binding in the presence and absence of a coactivator using multiplexed precision CRT (pCRT).</p>
<p>CRT data was correlated with data from reporter assays in astrocytoma and hepatocarcinoma cells, measuring induction of ABCA1 and SREBP1c, respectively. The results from CRT analysis reveal a surprisingly diverse set of responses that would support diverse phenotypes. NRs are viewed as druggable targets given that the efficacy of 16% of approved drugs is mediated by NRs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> The clinical success of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) is based upon tissueselective transcriptional activity that is not predictable <italic>a priori</italic> but is thought to be governed by coregulator recruitment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> More precise understanding of ligand-specific coactivator and corepressor binding, will provide a predictive framework for nonlipogenic LXR modulators and reinvigorate the therapeutic targeting of NRs by small molecules.</p>

<title>Selection of benchmark LXR ligands</title>
<p>First reported in 2000<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, T0901317 (T0) is commonly used as a benchmark or control LXR agonist. Cross-reactivity of LXR agonists with other NRs has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> T0 has been claimed to be an agonist for farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>; although, in our CRT assays potent PXR agonism was observed without evidence for FXR binding. The cross-reactivity of T0 with PXR could confound its use as a control LXR agonist in cellular systems. However, T0 is unique in showing no selectivity between LXR isoforms, which makes it ideal for normalization of CRT data. T0 is the most widely studied LXR agonist, often as a control compound or LXR chemical probe, with dozens of papers reporting effects in preclinical animal models of disease, including AD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> T0 is reliably lipogenic in mouse, hamster, and other models, causing elevated TGs and hepatic steatosis.</p>

<p>A different chemotype was identified using a cell-based ABCA1 reporter system, leading to GSK3987, an LXR agonist that in cell cultures showed concentration-dependent increases in ABCA1, SREBP1c, and cholesterol efflux and concentration-dependent decreases in IL-6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> There is a lack of <italic>in vivo</italic> data, which may explain why this compound has not been used as a chemical probe.</p>
<p>GW3965, first reported in 2002, is widely used as an orally bioavailable selective LXR agonist in preclinical animal models. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> Although the earliest report on GW3965 indicated PXR agonist activity, no binding to PXR is seen in CRT (<italic>vide infra</italic>). In C57Bl/6 mice, the effects of T0 and GW3965 were compared after 3 days treatment, measuring plasma lipids and gene induction in the liver and small intestine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> Responses were highly dose-dependent; however, T0 caused increases in liver weight and TGs, whereas even at 100mg/kg/day, GW3965 had no effect on these liver markers. T0 induced SREBP1c and greatly induced fatty acid synthase (FAS) (38-fold) while GW3965 induced minimal increases in SREBP1c and FAS expression in the liver. GW3965 administration resulted in ABCA1 expression increased 8-fold in the small intestine and 7-fold in peripheral macrophages. Recent dramatic evidence of the benefits of ABCA1 induction by GW3965 was reported in a tauopathy mouse model relevant to AD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> The beneficial effects of low dose GW3965 were replicated by genetic upregulation of <italic>ABCA1</italic>.</p>
<p>The LXR agonist, RGX104 (Abequolixron or SB742881), described as a first-in-class immunotherapy is being studied in cancer clinical trials. RGX104 is the methyl derivative of GW3965 and was compared to GW3965 in hamsters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> Hamsters, unlike mice, express cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and are argued to have a more humanlike lipid metabolism. Both GW3965 and RGX104 caused a dose-dependent increase in plasma TG, LDL-C, and very-low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C). Despite structural similarity, RGX104 significantly increased liver triglycerides but GW3965 did not. Similarly, hepatic gene transcription was weaker for GW3965, although comparable in intestines and peritoneal macrophages. In cynomolgus monkeys, GW3965 increased LDL and HDL at 7 days treatment only, with no effect on TG; whereas, RGX104 gave a robust time-dependent increase in TG and LDL. Without overinterpretation, this study hints at possible tissue-selective actions differentiating GW3965 from RGX104: tissue selectivity is well-known for modulators of other NRs.</p>
<p>Cholesterol mobilization was compared in HepG2 cells for RGX104, GW3965 and T0.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> In these cell cultures, all LXR agonists gave similar induction of ABCA1, ABCG1, FAS, and SREBP1c, which was argued to result in serum-dependent cholesterol efflux with induction of compensatory cholesterol synthesis at a level still leading to cellular cholesterol depletion. Interestingly, steroidal agonists, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, and DMHCA (N,N-dimethyl-3β-hydroxy-cholenamide) did not induce the same response.</p>
<p>The synthetic steroidal LXR agonist, DMHCA, was reported to increase LXRα, ABCA1 and SREBP1c genes in HepG2 and THP-1 cells to a lesser extent than T0 but to decrease SREBP1c in the J774 macrophage cell line and not significantly to elevate FAS in THP-1 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> In THP-1 cells, DMHCA attenuated SREBP1c gene transcription elicited by GW3965 co-treatment, implying partial agonist activity. C57BL/6 mice treated for 6 or 7 days with T0, GW3965, or DMHCA showed increased hepatic gene expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, SREBP1c, FAS, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) for all agonists. In mice, T0 and GW3965 were reported to increase plasma TG and VLDL-C. DMHCA is metabolically labile with poor oral bioavailability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>; nevertheless, low dose oral delivery has been studied in the ob/ob mouse in the context of diabetic retinopathy and bone marrow pathology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like DMHCA, LXR-623 (WAY-252623) is referred to as an LXR partial agonist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> Comparison of LXR-623 with GW3965 in LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> mice confirmed the expected anti-atherosclerotic efficacy of both LXR agonists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> In hamsters, LXR-623 did not cause a dose-dependent increase in plasma TG. In primates a significant increase in liver TG was observed but only at high dose (50 mg/kg/day p.o.) and returned to baseline at day 7 of treatment. Tissues from primates showed elevation of <italic>ABCA1</italic> and <italic>ABCG1</italic> in duodenum and suppression of hepatic genes including <italic>SREBF1, FAS, CYP7A1</italic>, and <italic>LDLR</italic>. The authors concluded that unfavorable lipogenesis was not a class effect of LXR agonists. In the only report on the LXR-623 clinical trial, no data on lipogenesis is reported. Detailed PK/PD correlations were made with ABCA1 transcripts in blood samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> No serious adverse events were reported; however, all 6 participants on the highest 300 mg dose reported neurologic or psychiatric adverse effects of unknown cause.</p>
<p>In contrast to LXR-623, the clinical trial of XL041 (BMS85297) reported on both activation of ABCA1 and lipogenic genes. As seen for LXR-623, treatment with XL041 increased ABCA1 expression in trial subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> XL041 demonstrated good pharmacokinetics, safety, and lipid profiles in mice and cynomolgus monkeys <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. However, in clinical trials, after multi-day dosing, elevated plasma and liver lipids and neutropenia were observed in healthy and statin-treated subjects. Notably co-administration of statins caused incomplete attenuation of lipid elevation. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> The peripheral side effects observed with XL041, included neutropenia and elevated TG and LDL levels, both of which were reversible. No serious adverse effects were reported.</p>
<p>Published data from Merck’s LXR program is limited. <italic>Compound 9</italic> (MK9) was studied in 12-month-old Tg2576 familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) mice dosed subcutaneously for 3 weeks at 50 mg/kg/day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup> Significant increases in ABCA1 and apoE protein levels in the brain were not accompanied by significant changes in plasma or liver TG, in contrast to mice treated with T0. In monkeys administered MK9 (20 mg/kg qd p.o.) for 2 weeks, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) a threefold increase in APOE and Aβ was observed: CSF Aβ is often associated with enhanced clearance from the brain. These changes were accompanied by no change in liver fat content relative to control, in contrast to T0.</p>
<p>AZ876, classified by Belorusova et al. as lipogenic in mice,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> showed dose-dependent elevation of plasma TG accompanied by a 91% reduction in atherosclerotic lesion area. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> Rescue of cardiac hypertrophy in mice using low dose AZ876 was not accompanied by increases in plasma TG. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>CL2-57 was the result of early optimization of a hit discovered from cell-based reporter screening for activation of ABCA1-luciferase in astrocytoma cells, counterscreening using a SREBP1c-luciferase reporter in HepG2 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> In an obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model, CL2-57 corrected T2D-associated readouts, attenuated diet-induced increases in plasma and hepatic TG levels and ameliorated other HFDassociated metabolomic changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> Further optimization guided by phenotypic screening resulted in CL3-3, a more potent LXR agonist and ABCA1 inducer. CL3-3 was tested in E3/4FAD mice that express one copy each of the ε-3 and ε-4 alleles of human APOE, mimicking the majority of AD patients. These mice also express five mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) and PSEN1 human transgenes linked to FAD. Treatment with CL3-3 increased ABCA1 expression, enhanced APOE lipidation and reversed multiple AD phenotypes, without increasing TG. This study is the first in a human <italic>APOE</italic>-expressing model with hallmark amyloid-β pathology ALX101 (Rovazolac), SR9238, GSK2033, XL652, and BE1218 are examples of the many reported LXR ligands in the biphenyl-3-methylsulfone class, which also includes XL041. Reported in a 2013 patent publication, ALX101 is listed as the subject of a 2018 clinical trial in moderate atopic dermatitis. XL652, an LXR agonist studied in the program that led to XL041, is described as an LXRβ-selective partial agonist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup> In mice XL652 administration caused increased ABCA1 and ABCG1 induction with elevated plasma triglycerides only at the highest dose (30 mg/kg qd), accompanied by induction of hepatic SREBP1c but not FAS.</p>
<p>The structurally related sulfones, BE1218, SR9238, SR9243, and GSK2033 have all been described as LXR inverse agonists. SR9238 was claimed amongst the first synthetic LXR inverse agonists to be discovered. SR9243 is systemically available; whereas, the metabolically labile SR9238, owing to the metabolism of the ester linker, is reported to show liver selectivity for suppression of lipogenic LXR gene products. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup> In obese mice on HFD, plasma TG was suppressed and in a mouse model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), SR9238 treatment significantly reduced hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. In cell-based models, the activity of GSK2033 was consistent with LXR inverse agonism; however, in a NASH mouse model, the expression of lipogenic genes, including FAS and SREBP1c, was <italic>increased</italic> rather than suppressed and no beneficial effects on hepatic steatosis were observed. Subsequently, GSK2033 was reported to activate PXR, FXR, and RXR, negating utility as an in vivo chemical probe.</p>
<p>IMB-808 is structurally distinct from most other LXR ligands. In cell-based assays, it was claimed to activate LXR with modest selectivity for the α-isoform and to be nonlipogenic in HepG2 cells, which is the rationale for inclusion of this compound in our study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup> The selection of other LXR ligands, introduced above, provides a diverse array of structures, selectivity and both lipogenic and nonlipogenic properties. Although most compounds discussed have demonstrated beneficial responses in preclinical models of human disease, the lack of a predictive algorithm for ligand design to avoid or circumvent unwanted lipogenesis has prevented progress in the clinic.</p>

<title>Agonists, antagonists and NR coregulator TR-FRET (CRT)</title>
<p>The ligand binding pocket of NRs can be considered as both orthosteric and allosteric, because it binds endogenous agonists and induces a conformational change that induces recruitment of coregulator proteins to helix-12 (H12) of the NR and hence regulates the transcriptional function of the NR complex at its cognate DNA response element. The labels applied to individual NR ligands (full agonist, partial agonist, antagonist, inverse agonist) can be ambiguous leading to misuse. Owing to the tissue and cell-specific output resulting from ligand binding, individual genes may be regulated in different directions.</p>
<p>In the case of estrogen receptor (ER) ligands, the term “pure antagonist” has been coined and is usually, but not universally, used to describe a ligand that competitively displaces estradiol and induces a conformational change incompatible with transcriptional activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup> In the case of agonists (ligands that induce a response in the same direction as the endogenous agonist), the term “biased agonist” is useful for NR ligands and is related directly to tissue selectivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup> Study of coregulator binding to the NR-LBD can potentially simplify the terminology used for ligand-dependent responses, which we will revisit below. However, first we used CRT to study cross-reactivity of LXR ligand binding to related NRs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>CRT analysis of NR cross-reactivity</title>
<p>Class II NRs include: the NR1 subfamily, LXR, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), retinoic acid receptor (RAR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR); and the NR2 subfamily retinoid X receptor (RXR). Heterodimer formation of RXR with NR1 family members is a key step in formation of transcriptional complexes. Most LXR DNA binding sites are shared with RXR; however, only a fraction of RXR binding sites are shared with LXR and genome-wide binding profiles are quite different across cell and tissue types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>Owing both to the permissive nature of the heterodimer complexes within the sterol NR family and to structural similarities between endogenous ligands and ligand binding pockets, LXR ligands may activate other NR complexes. Cross-reactivity of LXR agonists has been reported:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> T0 is claimed to be an FXR agonist;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> T0 and GW3965 are reported to be PXR agonists;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> and GSK2033 binds to FXR, PXR, CAR, RXR, and other NR LBDs in a cell-based assay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup> Therefore, all LXR ligands were examined in a Lanthascreen CRT assay measuring ligand-induced stabilization of the NR:coactivator complex and NR-specific ligand binding. All CRT screens of NR selectivity were performed with a terbium donor exciting a fluorescein-tagged coactivator as a measure of ligand binding and recruitment. Benchmarking used a known agonist for each NR.</p>
<p>NR-CRT assays were developed for RXRα, RXRβ, RARα, RARβ, FXR, PXR, and PPARδ, in addition to LXRα and LXRβ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Table S1</xref>). Assays for RXRα and RXRβ were optimized using the D22 coactivator peptide and the RXR ligands SR11237 and bexarotene as positive controls. Both benchmark RXR ligands were RXRα-selective full agonists with very similar potency and no response was observed for any of the tested LXR ligands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S1A</xref>).</p>
<p>FXR is critical for maintaining bile acid homeostasis that when disrupted leads to excessive accumulation of cholesterol and its actions are interleaved with those of LXR. FXR represses the expression of SREBP1c.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup> LXR promotes fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis and storage, whereas FXR activation leads to decreased liver and plasma triglyceride levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup> The CRT assay optimized for FXR used SRC2-2 as coactivator and obeticholic acid (OCA) as benchmark agonist, revealing no agonist activity by LXR ligands above baseline, despite description of T0 as a weak FXR agonist (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S1B</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>PPAR isoforms have been reported to modulate ABCA1 expression levels. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup> PPARg activity is closely associated with glucose metabolism, and PPARa and PPARd activity is associated with fatty acid metabolism.

<p>Of the three isoforms, RARβ is the most widely expressed acrosstissues: brain, intestine, liver, kidney, etc. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup> The RARα CRT was optimized with D22 coactivator peptide and RARβ with SRC2-2 coactivator peptide.

<p>PXR is a xenobiotic nuclear receptor, responsible for upregulating metabolic enzymes for detoxification of exogenous and endogenous compounds and is highly expressed in the liver, intestine, and kidneys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref></sup> The PXR LBD is larger than other sterol NRs and the hydrophobic ligand binding pocket reflects its function in accommodating a wide range of xenobiotics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref></sup> Drugs that bind and activate PXR bear a risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref></sup> The bisphosphonate, SR12813, was used as a benchmark PXR agonist; however, T0 proved to be a full agonist and more potent (EC<sub>50</sub> = 300 nM) than the benchmark (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S1E</xref>).</p>

<title>Activity and isoform selectivity of LXR ligands</title>
<p>The CRT selectivity assay incorporates GST-tagged LXR-LBD, anti-GST-terbium, biotin-SRC-1, and streptavidin-XL665. Notably, the 25 amino acid SRC-1 peptide is the only coactivator tested for LXR binding that has the fluorophore remote from the coactivator peptide. Binding of an agonist to LXR induces recruitment of coactivator SRC-1 (steroid receptor coactivator 1; also known as nuclear receptor coactivator 1, NCOA1). When excited at 340 nm the terbium will emit at 620 nm exciting XL665 and emitting a signal reflecting coregulator binding to LXR. The assay measures the EC<sub>50</sub> for coactivator recruitment, a measure of ligand binding affinity, and the strength of signal reflects maximal efficacy. For sterol receptors, endogenous ligands, including 24HC, generally induce efficacy lower than synthetic ligands; thus, for LXR binding, T0 was used as a suitable control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Perhaps surprisingly, considering the description of multiple LXR ligands as partial agonists, most agonists studied gave maximal response at the same level as T0, behaving as full agonists. The clear exception is the endogenous partial agonist, 24HC; although, both the synthetic steroid DMHCA and CL3-3 showed partial agonist activity at LXRα. Both SR9238 and GSK2033 antagonized the agonism of 24HC at LXRβ without effect on LXRα.</p>
<p>In contrast to efficacy, potency and selectivity were observed to vary widely. As expected, T0 was nonselective as were AZ876, DMHCA, and indeed 24HC. GSK3987 was weakly selective for LXRβ; whereas, most agonists displayed 10-100 fold selectivity for LXRβ over LXRα, with MK9 and BE1218 being the most selective LXRβ agonists. BE1218 was also one of the most potent LXRβ agonists; with the most potent being AZ876 (6 nM) and XL041 (10 nM). The most potent LXRα agonists were the pan-LXR agonists AZ876 (6 nM) and T0 (80 nM).</p>
<p>The ligand binding pockets of the two LXR isoforms differ by only one amino acid (LXRα-Val263 and LXRβ-Ile277). Interestingly, mutation of these residues to alanine (V263A and I277A) does not ablate isoform selectivity in reporter assays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup> Conformational cooperativity of LBD residues beyond these two amino acids leads to different conformations of Leu274 and Ala275 that generally favor ligand binding to LXRβ.

Apparent inverse agonist activity in cell-based assays can result from true inverse agonist recruitment of corepressors or from antagonist activity towards endogenous sterol LXR agonists. Although we use serum stripped media, antagonism of endogenous LXR agonists cannot be ruled out. As introduced above, in the literature, BE1218, SR9238, SR9243, and GSK2033 have been described as LXR inverse agonists; however, BE1218 acted as a full agonist in recruitment of SRC1 and a partial agonist of cellular ABCA1 induction.</p>

<p>Simplistically, activation of the lipogenic axis (SRE activation) might be expected to correlate with LXRα:SRC1 stabilization; however, this correlation was weaker than that observed between ABCA1 induction and LXRβ:SRC1 stabilization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). The correlation between SRE activation and ABCA1 induction was weak (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). The correlation analyses used potency measurements both for SRC1 recruitment and for activation of luciferase reporters, which does not incorporate a contribution from the different efficacy seen for partial agonists. On the basis of potency alone: (i) cellular ABCA1 induction can be dissociated from induction of lipogenic genes; and (ii) ABCA1 induction can be predicted by LXRβ recruitment of SRC1 measured by CRT. Data analysis to this point does not provide a framework for prediction of lipogenic potency or efficacy. Further, the lipogenic response in cell cultures is more complex and diverse than ABCA1 induction, which correlates with LXRβ agonism (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>

<title>Coactivator selectivity</title>
<p>The varied physiological functions of a particular NR are controlled by recruitment of specific coregulators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref></sup> Coactivator families include the p160 family (SRC-1 (NCoA-1), SRC-2 (GRIP1, TIF2, or NCoA-2), SRC-3 (p/CIP, RAC3, ACTR, AIB1, or TRAM-1)), PPAR<italic>γ</italic> coactivator 1 (PGC-1<italic>α</italic>, PGC-1<italic>β</italic>), and TRAP/DRIP complex. Thyroid hormone receptor-associated proteins (TRAPs) were first studied in the context of the thyroid hormone receptor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref></sup> A highly conserved LXXLLmotif in the p160 family of coactivators is necessary for association of coactivators to the ligand-bound receptor. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref></sup> Two subunits of the TRAP complex, TRAP220 and TRAP100, contain LXXLL domains.</p>
<p>Selective recruitment of coactivators to LXR may provide a rationale for putative ligand selectivity for nonlipogenic gene induction. The lack of recruitment to LXRβ of D22 and TRAP220 was proposed to underlie nonlipogenic actions of IMB-808. Kim et al. explored the mechanism of LXR-mediated transcription of metabolic genes with a focus on coactivator complexes that lead to the modulation of specific target gene expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> Two coactivators were identified as proteins that interact with LXRα in a direct and ligand-dependent manner: TRAP220 and TRAP80. Examination of activation by T0 and GW3965 indicated that TRAP220 stimulates promoters for SREBP1c and ABCA1, whereas TRAP80 was selectively lipogenic. Silencing TRAP80 in mice followed by treatment with GW3965 or T0 was reported to prevent hepatic steatosis and reduce hepatic TG levels; whereas, RCT-related genes and anti-inflammatory effects of the LXR ligands were unaffected. This observation provides a potential mechanism for selective repression of SREBP1c-mediated lipogenesis caused by LXR<italic>α</italic>.</p>
<p>CRT analysis of coactivator recruitment to LXR of PGC1α, SRC2-2, D22, and TRAP220 demonstrated that potency for LXR agonists was most highly correlated between SRC2-2/D22 and PGC1α/TRAP220 pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S5</xref>). Therefore, for clarity, only D22 and TRAP220 recruitment are shown for ligands other than T0 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Concentration-response curves for LXR agonists were normalized to maximal response for T0. Across the four coactivators studied, T0 was nonselective both for LXR isoform and for coactivator identity; whereas, most other agonists displayed both full and partial agonist profiles in contrast to our observations on SRC1 recruitment. Thus, across the four coactivators studied, most ligands showed LXRβ selectivity based on maximal efficacy, notably MK9, CL3-3, and LXR-623. Regarding LXR isoform selectivity, AZ876, does not show isoform selectivity for SRC1 recruitment but selectively recruits SRC2-2, D22, PGC1α and TRAP220 to LXRα. DMHCA is nonselective across all coactivators; whereas, all other LXR agonists are selective for LXRβ across all coactivators studied. GSK2033 and SR9238 are unable to induce an LXR conformation compatible with recruitment of any coactivator studied. Several ligands induced very minimal recruitment of coactivator TRAP220 to LXRα, including XL041, XL652, BE1218, CL2-57, and CL3-3. Most ligands were selective for D22 over TRAP220 recruitment, notably XL041 and XL652.</p>

<title>Corepressor stabilization and displacement</title>
<p>Support for the de-repression and canonical mechanisms of LXR activation comes from studies on selective knockout or dual knockout of LXR isoforms in mice and cells. As argued below, stabilization of corepressor binding to LXRα may bias towards nonlipogenic LXR agonist activity</p>
<p>Liver-specific knockout of LXRα attenuated the effect of T0 treatment on elevation of lipogenic genes and plasma TG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref></sup> Although T0-induced elevation of liver ABCA1 was also attenuated by LXRα<sup>-/-</sup>, these observations support the pursuit of LXRβ-selective agonists to avoid adverse effects in the liver. In LXRα<sup>-/-</sup> mouse livers, the basal expression of some genes (<italic>ABCA1</italic> and <italic>SREBF1</italic>) was unchanged; whereas, others (e.g. <italic>FAS</italic>) were significantly decreased and <italic>LXRβ</italic> was greatly increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> The elevation of <italic>ABCA1, SREBF1</italic>, and <italic>FAS</italic> induced by LXR agonists was attenuated in LXRα<sup>-/-</sup> relative to wild-type (WT). In the livers of dual LXRα<sup>-/-</sup>/LXRβ<sup>-/-</sup> mice, liver lipogenesis and TG levels were lower with normal or high-cholesterol diets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref></sup> In another study, increases in hepatic LXR target genes induced by T0 and GW3965 were attenuated in LXRα<sup>-/-</sup> versus WT mice; however, higher doses of LXR agonists significantly elevated <italic>ABCA1</italic> and <italic>SREBF1</italic> in both mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref></sup> The observation that agonist-induced <italic>ABCA1</italic> expression was amplified in the intestines was interpreted to reflect the tissue selectivity of LXR agonists and desirability of selecting against LXRα agonism in the liver.</p>
<p>Transcriptomic analysis of LXR isoform knockout adds complexity. In contrast to ubiquitous LXRβ expression, LXRα is localized in specific cells and tissues: e.g. liver and macrophages. Immortalized macrophages, LXR-null, or expressing either LXRβ or LXRα, were studied using GW3965 and/or GSK2033 as pharmacologic probes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref></sup> Three distinct transcriptional mechanisms were proposed, one of which being pharmacologically nonresponsive and repressed in LXR-null macrophages can be assumed less relevant to LXR ligand design. In the classical or canonical mechanism (Mode II), transcription is weakly active or inactive in LXR-null and is active in the presence of an LXR agonist that induces a conformational change leading to coactivator binding. In the de-repression mechanism (Mode I), LXR-null is active, basal activity is repressed and the LXR agonist induces a conformational change that displaces the corepressor in favor of coactivator binding. <italic>ABCA1</italic> and <italic>SREBF1</italic> are used as example of genes controlled by Mode I and Mode II mechanisms, respectively.</p>
<p>A similar transcriptomic approach to study of LXR-null mouse livers emphasized that knockout of LXR has significant effects on other nuclear receptors and transcription factors, notably PPARα.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">118</xref></sup> Perhaps surprisingly, the majority of genes differentially expressed in WT versus LXR-null liver were insensitive to treatment with T0 and GW3965. Genes downregulated in LXR-null and induced by agonists in WT livers included lipogenic genes <italic>SREBF1, SCD1, FAS</italic>, and <italic>LPCAT3</italic>. Although genes mediating cholesterol metabolism and efflux (e.g. <italic>ABCA1, APOA1</italic>) are induced by LXR agonists, these were generally unchanged in WT and LXR-null livers. Thus, in the liver, induction of <italic>ABCA1</italic> and <italic>SREBF1</italic> may be dominated by canonical and de-repression mechanisms, respectively.</p>
<p>Arguing that stabilization of corepressor binding to LXRα biases towards nonlipogenic activity, we used CRT to measure ligand-dependent, LXR:corepressor interactions. Nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) are large proteins (ca. 270 kDa) that share about 40% sequence identity. SMRT and NCoR are largely disordered platform proteins that act as a scaffold upon which the enzymatic machinery of the repression complex is built.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">119</xref></sup> In a transcriptionally repressed complex, a corepressor typically binds to the LBD.</p>
<p>The interaction motifs of coactivator and corepressor proteins compete for LBD binding. Binding of the coactivator interaction motif LXXLL is dependent on hydrophobic amino-acids in helix 12.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref></sup> The corepressor interaction motif (φxxφφ where φ is a hydrophobic amino-acid and x is any amino acid) uses additional flanking sequences, but contains a similar amphipathic core to the coactivator motif.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">121</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">123</xref></sup></p>
<p>NCOR2 and SMRT2 were observed to bind to LXR isoforms in the absence of ligand, with CRT analysis showing the expected displacement of corepressor (loss of signal) by LXR agonists (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). For some ligands, ligand stabilization of the corepressor-bound complex (gain of signal) was observed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref><bold>, S7</bold>). Titration with LXR agonists, GW3965, its methyl-derivative (RGX-104), and T0 caused displacement of NCOR2 from both LXR isoforms; whereas LXR-623 and DMHCA had little or no effect (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A,B</xref>). A similar pattern of ligand response was seen for binding of SMRT2 to LXR (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C,D</xref>). Across isoforms and corepressors, several ligands showed little or no ability to displace NCOR2 and SMRT2 corepressors from LXR: CL2-57, CL3-3, LXR-623, and the antagonist GSK2033 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs 7</xref><bold>, S7</bold>).</p>

<p>A subset of ligands elicited strong agonist responses (potency and efficacy for corepressor displacement) that were not strongly dependent on LXR isoform nor the identity of the corepressor: T0, RGX-104, GSK3987, and perhaps surprisingly, SR9238 that often displays the properties of an inverse agonist. AZ876 showed similar activity, with selectivity for corepressor displacement from LXRα (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), the same selectivity seen for coactivator recruitment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). MK9 and ALX101 elicited similar responses to the “strong agonists” in displacement of corepressors from LXRβ; however, these ligands were less effective or ineffective in displacement of corepressors from LXRα. BE1218 was less efficacious in general and was ineffective in corepressor displacement from LXRα. Thus, several LXR ligands only stabilize conformations of LXRα that allow corepressor binding.</p>
<p>A strong agonist is expected to potently destabilize corepressor binding to LXR. In this context, SR9238 has strong agonist properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S7Q</xref>), which is perhaps surprising, since it can act as an inverse agonist. In contrast to corepressor displacement, SR9238 was unable to recruit coactivators to LXRα and very weakly supported coactivator recruitment to LXRβ. Thus, SR9238 displays unique interactions with LXR, strongly displacing corepressors and with little effect on coactivator recruitment. SR9238 cannot stabilize a conformation of LXR that allows corepressor binding, nor one that stabilizes coactivator binding. The conformation stabilized by SR9238 also cannot be that of the aporeceptor, because the unliganded LXR apo-receptor binds corepressors.</p>
<p>Based on CRT analysis of coregulator binding, SR9238 would be predicted to act as an antagonist; therefore, it is useful to compare with GSK2033, universally described as an antagonist. GSK2033 stabilizes a conformation of LXR that is incompatible with coactivator binding and equally GSK2033 does not stabilize a conformation that disrupts corepressor binding to LXRα (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S7P</xref>). GSK2033 does selectively displace SMRT2 from LXRβ. Two interesting conclusions result from this CRT analysis: 1) GSK2033 is able selectively to displace corepressors from LXRβ; and 2) GSK2033 is expected to act as a pure antagonist of LXRα-mediated transcription. In contrast, strong corepressor destabilization by SR9238 resulting in de-repression of LXR, is expected to activate LXR-mediated transcription. CRT data clearly differentiates SR9238 from the antagonist GSK2033.</p>
<p>Several ligands were unable to displace corepressors from LXR and XL041 <underline>stabilized</underline> LXR complexes with corepressor bound, as shown by the concentration-dependent increase in the TR-FRET signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S7K</xref>). Similar behavior was seen for the structurally related XL652 in stabilization of SMRT2 corepressor binding to LXRα; although, XL652 did not perturb SMRT2 binding to LXRβ and weakly destabilized the NCOR2 complex with both LXR isoforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S7L</xref>). XL041 binding induced LXRα conformations that strongly stabilized the corepressor-bound complexes. The signal associated with corepressor binding to LXRβ was not increased to the same degree; furthermore, the signal associated with SMRT2 binding was increased to a higher maximal response than that for NCOR2 binding.</p>
<p>Corepressor binding to LXR gave a much more diverse set of liganddependent responses in CRT to those observed for coactivator binding, primarily, because unliganded LXR binds corepressors but not coactivators. Of the observations that stand out from the CRT corepressor binding analysis, the diverse response from the biphenyl sulfone ligands is perhaps the most surprising, with a spectrum of corepressor binding/stabilization to displacement/destabilization: XL041 &gt; XL652 &gt; GSK2033 &gt; BE1218 &gt; SR9238.</p>
<p>Simplistically, if expulsion of the corepressor from the LXRα complex is correlated with hepatic LXR activation and lipogenesis, AZ876, GSK3987, T0, RGX-104, and SR9238 would be predicted to be lipogenic. This mechanism cannot be dominant in HepG2 cells, because SR9238 acts as an inverse agonist at &lt; 3 µM concentration. Therefore, corepressor binding alone cannot be considered in the absence of coactivator recruitment.</p>

<title>Synchronous coregulator recruitment by multiplex, precision CRT</title>
<p>We established a multiplexed, precision CRT (pCRT) assay using a one donor/two-acceptor system allowing for simultaneous measurement of corepressor dissociation and coactivator recruitment. Terbium has multiple emission wavelengths therefore it is an ideal fluorescence donor. Utilizing two spectrally different acceptor fluorophores such as XL665 and fluorescein allows measurement of two signals in the same assay as the fluorophore acceptor emissions do not overlap. pCRT utilized as corepressor, NCoR2-fluorescein, and as coactivator, the same construct, biotin-SRC1, used to determine LXR isoform selectivity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The pCRT assay was optimized for a total volume of 12 µL incubating LXR (4 nM), anti-GST-Tb (0.4 nM), SA-XL665 (9.44 nM), SRC1-btn (200 nM) and NCoR2-FL (200 nM), measuring TR-FRET emission ratios at 520/490 nm and 665/615 nm. Coregulators were in excess and concentrations of assay components were kept constant while ligand concentration-response was examined.</p>
<p>It is clear from the pCRT curves that the varied response of corepressor NCoR2 to ligand binding seen in CRT (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) is “normalized” in the presence of coactivator SRC1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). For every ligand studied by pCRT, ligand binding induced a conformation of LXR compatible with coactivator recruitment and concomitant corepressor displacement. The synchronous exchange of corepressor by coactivator leads to pCRT binding curves in which the potency for ligand-induced binding of SRC1 binding is almost identical to that for ligand-induced displacement of NCOR2. For example: (1) LXR-623 does not displace NCOR2 from LXRα in the absence of SRC1; (2) DMHCA does not displace NCOR2 from LXRβ in the absence of SRC1; and (3) although GW3965 does displace NCOR2 from both LXR isoforms, the concentration-response for GW3965 shows a left-shift in the NCOR2 displacement curve of 100-fold (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). In contrast to NCOR2 response, the SRC1 binding curves show only small shifts in in the presence of NCOR2 from pCRT analysis (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). For LXRβ, the correlation between potency for SRC1 recruitment in monoplex and multiplexed CRT is good (data not shown).</p>

<p>Titration of the biphenyl sulfone ligands, XL041 and XL652, in the absence of SRC1 induced binding of NCOR2 to LXRα (for both ligands) and to LXRβ (XL041 only) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). From pCRT analysis, the presence of SRC1 causes ligand-induced displacement of NCOR2 from LXR. For LXRβ, in the presence of SRC1, the corepressor is fully displaced; whereas, the maximal signal for NCOR2-bound LXRα, is significantly higher than zero in the presence of saturating XL041 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) indicative of an equilibrium for the repressed XL041:NCOR2:LXRα and activated XL041:NCOR2:LXRα complexes.</p>
<p>CRT analysis of coactivator binding has often been used to determine LXR ligand potency, efficacy, and isoform selectivity. CRT analysis of corepressors is more rarely studied. Concentration-dependence of four LXR ligands (T0, GW3965, LN6500 and 22(<italic>R</italic>)-hydroxycho-lesterol) was studied by CRT for coactivator NCoA3 and separately for NCOR1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> Weak recruitment of NCOR1 to LXRα was reported for GW3965 (&gt; 1 µM). This study was supported by cellular two-hybrid reporter assays in HepG2 and THP1 cells. T0 and GW3965 were classed as full and partial agonists, respectively. In our study, GW3965 and its methylated derivative, RGX-104, behaved as full agonists in CRT, with the exception of coactivator (PGC1α, SRC2, D22, TRAP220) recruitment to LXRα (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs 6</xref><bold>, 6S</bold>).

<title>Correlation of CRT signatures with phenotype</title>
<p>With the knowledge that corepressors bind to the apo-receptor; whereas coactivator binding requires a ligand-induced conformational change, we can categorize all ligands using their CRT profiles: ligands induce 3 conformations with CoR (destabilizing D, stabilizing S, neutral N) and only 2 conformations with CoA (stabilizing S, neutral N) (Table 1). We categorized ligands based upon these CRT characteristics using labels compatible with CRT profiles: full agonist (FA), weak agonist (WA), partial agonist (PA), inverse agonist (IA), soft antagonist (SA), and hard antagonist (HA). The ligand category is not always identical for LXRα vs. LXRβ. Similarly, the phenotype associated with each classification is isoform dependent. Recruitment of CoA to LXRβ by FA, WA, and PA will activate transcription; whereas, lack of recruitment by SA, HA, and IA will antagonize transcription (Table 1). Stabilization of CoA and/or destabilization of CoR bound to LXRα is a derepression mechanism leading to activation/transcription for FA, WA, and IA; whereas partial activation is expected for PA.</p>
<p>To determine which LXR ligands fit with these theoretical CRT signatures, concentration-response curves were interpolated to measure normalized response at 1 µM ligand concentration and plotted as a heat map (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figs 9A</xref><bold>, S8</bold>). Selecting response at 1 µM ligand is pharmacologically relevant and takes account of potency and efficacy. As bench-mark ligand, the response to T0 is uniform, without LXR isoform selectivity and with strong induction of ABCA1 and activation of SRE in cell cultures. Across the other 13 ligands with agonist activity, all are LXRβ-selective, with the exception of AZ876 that is LXRα-selective (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S8</xref>).</p>

<p>The CRT signatures of the three agonist and three antagonist classifications were modelled in the same heat map using signatures defined in Table 1 and the measured responses to the real LXR ligands in our study. There are several ligands with weak agonist (WA) signatures and GSK3987 fits a full agonist (FA) profile. XL041 has the signature of a partial agonist (PA), which matches its cellular phenotype. GSK2033 and SR9238 match the CRT signatures of a hard antagonist (HA) and inverse agonist (IA), respectively. We hypothesized that the signature of an NLAI, which by definition induces ABCA1 but does not activate SRE, should reflect a CRT profile of LXRβ activation without activating LXRα: this leads to a theoretical NLAI profile, shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>, which is not an exact match for any theoretical or experimental LXR ligand.</p>
<p>To give these signatures and labels a more thermodynamic basis, we can take learnings from CRT and pCRT measurements: (i) CoA-bound LXR is of relatively high energy, since it is not observed in absence of ligand; (ii) apo-LXR exists in equilibrium with CoR bound LXR, since CoR-bound LXR is observed in absence of ligand; (iii) The ligand-bound CoA:LXR complex is lowest energy, because CoA binding leads to full or partial CoR displacement. The relative stabilization and relative energy associated with each complex therefore follows (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>). Thus, an inverse agonist (IA) CRT signature requires the IA to stabilize apo-LXR and a partial agonist (PA) stabilizes both coregulator-bound complexes.</p>

<title>Implications for discovery of nonlipogenic LXR ligands</title>
<p>As outlined in the Introduction, Belorusova et al., carried out multi-component analysis on an in-house chemical series of 9 LXR ligands, T0, GW3965, LXR-623, XL041, and AZ876, claiming identification of an “escape route from the adverse lipogenic effects of LXR ligands”. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> Although the study was limited by binary definitions of <italic>in vivo</italic> lipogenicity, the in-depth HDX-MS analysis led to inferences on ligand-induced conformational change that might be associated with lipogenesis. Not unexpectedly, given the complexity of the problem, simple principles for NLAI design were not revealed. It was concluded that selection of ligands with “modest potencies” in cell-based transcriptional assays would lead to reduced lipogenesis.</p>
<p>Correlation analysis driven by HDX-MS data inferred the importance of helix-12 (H12) in activating a lipogenic transcriptional program. H12 is the key structural element of Activation Function-2 (AF-2), often described as a ligand-dependent switch and providing a binding surface for coactivator recruitment in the agonist-induced conformation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>). There are no published crystal structures of corepressor-bound LXRα, with most PDB entries being liganded coactivator-bound LXRβ. To emphasize the conformational change in LXRα induced by agonist binding, we modelled SMRT2-bound apo-LXRα using Alphafold and superimposed the corepressed apo-structure with a SRC1-bound agonist co-crystal structure (PDB 3IPQ <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>). This illustration shows the CoR, in the absence of ligand, bound to a surface that in the presence of ligand is occupied by H12. A ligand-induced conformation that stabilizes CoR binding to LXR cannot result from direct displacement of H12 by ligand.</p>
<p>Helix-3 (H3) forms part of the coactivator binding surface and the ligand-binding pocket. H3 contributes residues that interact directly with ligands. Helix 4 (H4) interacts with H3 and other helices to form the hydrophobic core, stabilize coactivator-bound conformations, and indirectly to influence receptor dimerization through helix-9 (H9). In LXR, helix-5 (H5) interacts directly with ligands and supports a more flexible ligand-binding pocket than in many other NRs. HDX-MS analysis of liganded LXRα structures correlated stabilization of H3 and H5 with selective <italic>ABCA1</italic> induction. It was speculated that ligand interactions with H3 and H5 could induce a conformation leading to corepressor dissociation, which could lead to selectivity owing to the greater flexibility of H3 in LXRα. Conversely, ligands that stabilized H12, itself, were correlated with lipogenesis. Similarly, with PPARγ, direct stabilization of H12 is associated with full agonism; whereas, partial agonists do not directly stabilize H12, which leads to biased agonism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">124</xref></sup></p>
<p>As in our study, Belorusova et al noted that the properties of XL014, were differentiated other LXR ligands. The HDX-MS analysis showed XL014 to act as an antagonist: i.e. XL014 did not induce an agonist conformation of H12. XL041 is generally described as an LXRβ-selective partial agonist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">125</xref></sup> Our CRT analysis of coactivator binding (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs 6</xref><bold>, S6</bold>) reflects LXRβ-selective partial agonist activity, with the exception of SRC1 CRT data. In cell-based phenotypic assays, XL041 is a potent partial agonist with selectivity (at concentration ≤ 1 µM) for induction of ABCA1 over SRE activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Taken together with the XL041-induced stabilization of corepressor-bound LXR (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) the overall CRT signature of XL041 uniquely predicts partial agonist activity (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>
<p>XL041 stabilizes corepressor binding to LXRα (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>); although, in the presence of coactivator, SRC1, the corepressor is dissociated (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). In our study, the biphenyl sulfone class of ligands yielded diverse responses in cell-free and cell-based assays, suggesting that this chemotype can be manipulated to enhance isoform and coregulator selectivity. The CRT profile of XL652, a close homologue of XL041, includes corepressor stabilization for LXRα (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) and a response in HepG2 cells that shows little or no activation of SRE at submicromolar concentrations and more than 100-fold weaker potency for ABCA1 induction compared to XL041 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The phenotype of ALX101 is a full agonist towards ABCA1 induction and a partial agonist of SRE activation; whereas, BE1218 has a partial agonist phenotype in both cell-based assays. The partial agonist phenotype is compatible with a relative inability to destabilize the corepressor-bound LXRα complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S7</xref>).</p>
<p>GSK2033 and SR9238 are very close structural congeners of BE1218, yet the response in phenotypic assays is quite different, with BE1218 a partial agonist, SR9238 displaying an inverse agonist and GSK2033 a mixed antagonist/inverse agonist phenotype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs 3</xref>,<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In CRT, both GSK2033 and SR9238 displace SRC1 and 24HC from an activated LXRβ complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) but GSK2033 more closely resembles BE1218 in its weak effects on corepressor-bound LXRα (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S7</xref>). There is scope for further exploration of this chemotype using CRT/pCRT with a focus on interactions with the LXRα corepressor complex.</p>

<title>Limitations of the present study</title>
<p>Measurement of absolute affinity for coregulator binding to LXR by TR-FRET or other methods is complementary to the CRT approach used in this study, which measures relative potency and efficacy for ligand-induced coregulator binding. Absolute measurements require saturating ligand concentrations, which is problematic for weak LXR ligands, which by their nature are hydrophobic with limited aqueous solubility. Elegant studies measuring PPAR/coregulator binding free energy by fluorescence polarization have incorporated RXR heterodimers, full length NRs, and oligonucleotides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">124</xref></sup> These studies demonstrate that key aspects of ligand-induced coregulator binding are replicated by the reductionist system of NR-LBD with short coregulator peptides as used in the present work.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Partial agonists are often described as a desirable therapeutic modality with anticipated efficacy and improved safety; although, the rationale for this improved therapeutic window is often intuitive rather than quantitative. The traditional medicinal chemistry approach to optimization of small molecule therapeutics is to increase potency and selectivity against an off-target: the approach in LXR agonist design has invariably been LXRβ versus LXRα isoform selectivity. A nominated drug candidate will also maximize target exposure. XL041 ticks all the boxes as a potent, LXRβ-selective ligand with partial agonist response in many <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. In human volunteers, XL041 caused a non-linear, dose-dependent increase in blood ABCA1 and plasma TG and LDL-C, with maximal response reached at approximately 2.5 mg/kg p.o. At this dose, the drug concentration in plasma on Day 14 was C<sub>max</sub> ≈ 30 nM. Levels of TG and LDL-C returned to baseline after drug withdrawal; however, with T½ ≈ 13 hours and the high potency of XL041, target exposure would be expected to be persistent. Limiting target exposure and potency may be required to attenuate activation of lipogenesis even by partial agonists. The clinical observations on the biphenyl sulfone XL041 are compatible with <italic>in vitro</italic> data reported by others and in this present study.</p>
<p>Preclinical animal studies have shown that enhancing ABCA1 activity with an LXR agonist could be an effective therapeutic strategy in a wide range of human conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, retinal degeneration, and neurodegenerative diseases, including ADRD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">126</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">128</xref></sup> In preclinical proof-of-concept studies T0, RGX104 and GW3965 continue to be used; for example, GW3965 in a tauopathy model of pathologic glial cell activation associated with AD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> We have reported beneficial effects of CL3-3 in FAD mice expressing human <italic>APOE4</italic>, the major genetic risk factor for AD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">129</xref></sup> We observe an excellent correlation between cell-free stabilization of CoA:LXRβ complexes versus induction of ABCA1 in cells, supportive of the therapeutic focus on LXRβ selectivity. Hepatic lipogenesis as a side effect, caused by LXRα activation in the liver, cannot be tolerated in many chronic diseases. Hepatic lipogenesis, observed in the XL041 clinical trial, is not tolerable in a population prone to atherosclerosis, the disease target of XL041. The diverse responses of LXR ligands reflected in CoR:LXRα stabilization and SRE activation in HepG2 cells suggests that fine tuning of ligands with respect to LXRα binding is a route to attenuation of unwanted lipogenesis.</p>

<p>The study highlights development of a multiplex coregulator TR-FRET (CRT) assay that detects ligands with theoretical full agonist, partial agonist, antagonist, and inverse agonist signatures within the same chemical series. The findings are <bold>valuable</bold> and will have theoretical and practical implications in the subfield, with respect to guiding the design of non-lipogenic liver X receptor (LXR) agonists. The strength of the evidence is <bold>solid</bold>, whereby the methods, data, and analyses broadly support the claims with only minor weaknesses that can be dealt with through improvements in the data analysis and the discussion. This study will be of interest to experts working in the areas of pharmacology, medicinal chemistry, and drug discovery in Alzheimer's diseases and dementias.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This important study functionally profiled ligands targeting the LXR nuclear receptors using biochemical assays in order to classify ligands according to pharmacological functions. Overall, the evidence is solid, but nuances in the reconstituted biochemical assays and cellular studies and terminology of ligand pharmacology limit the potential impact of the study. This work will be of interest to scientists interested in nuclear receptor pharmacology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors rigorously tested their ligand set in CRTs for several nuclear receptors that could display ligand-dependent cross-talk with LXR cellular signaling and found that all compounds display LXR selectivity when used at ~1 µM.</p>
<p>(2) The authors tested the ligand set for selectivity against two LXR isoforms (alpha and beta). Most compounds were found to be LXRbeta-specific.</p>
<p>(3) The authors performed extensive LXR CRTs, performed correlation analysis to cellular transcription and gene expression, and classification profiling using heatmap analysis-seeking to use relatively easy-to-collect biochemical assays with purified ligand-binding domain (LBD) protein to explain the complex activity of full-length LXR-mediated transcription.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The descriptions of some observations lack detail, which limits understanding of some key concepts.</p>
<p>(2) The presence of endogenous NR ligands within cells may confound the correlation of ligand activity of cellular assays to biochemical assay data.</p>
<p>(3) The normalization of biochemical assay data could confound the classification of graded activity ligands.</p>
<p>(4) The presence of &gt;1 coregulator peptide in the biplex (n=2 peptides) CRT (pCRT) format will bias the LBD conformation towards the peptide-bound form with the highest binding affinity, which will impact potency and interpretation of TR-FRET data.</p>
<p>(5) Correlation graphical plots lack sufficient statistical testing.</p>
<p>(6) Some of the proposed ligand pharmacology nomenclature is not clear and deviates from classifications used currently in the field (e.g., hard and soft antagonist; weak vs. partial agonist, definition of an inverse agonist that is not the opposite function to an agonist).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript by Laham and co-workers, the authors profiled structurally diverse LXR ligands via a coregulator TR-FRET (CRT) assay for their ability to recruit coactivators and kick off corepressors, while identifying coregulator preference and LXR isoform selectivity.</p>
<p>The relative ligand potencies measured via CRT for the two LXR isoforms were correlated with ABCA1 induction or lipogenic activation of SRE, depending on cellular contexts (i.e, astrocytoma or hepatocarcinoma cells). While these correlations are interesting, there is some leeway to improve the quantitative presentation of these correlations. Finally, the CRT signatures were correlated with the structural stabilization of the LXR: coregulator complexes. In aggregate, this study curated a set of LXR ligands with disparate agonism signatures that may guide the design of future nonlipogenic LXR agonists with potential therapeutic applications for cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's, and type 2 diabetes, without inducing mechanisms that promote fat/lipid production.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study has many strengths, from curating an excellent LXR compound set to the thoughtful design of the CRT and cellular assays. The design of a multiplexed precision CRT (pCRT) assay that detects corepressor displacement as a function of ligand-induced coactivator recruitment is quite impressive, as it allows measurement of ligand potencies to displace corepressors in the presence of coactivators, which cannot be achieved in a regular CRT assay that looks at coactivator recruitment and corepressor dissociation in separate experiments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I did not identify any major weaknesses.</p>
