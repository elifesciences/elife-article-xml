<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Self-grooming is an innate, naturalistic behavior found in a wide variety of organisms. The control of rodent grooming has been shown to be mediated by the dorsolateral striatum through lesion studies and in-vivo extracellular recordings. Yet, it is unclear how populations of neurons in the striatum encode grooming. We recorded single-unit extracellular activity from populations of neurons in freely moving mice and developed a semi-automated approach to detect self-grooming events from 117 hours of simultaneous multi-camera video recordings of mouse behavior. We first characterized the grooming transition-aligned response profiles of striatal projection neuron and fast spiking interneuron single units. We identified striatal ensembles whose units were more strongly correlated during grooming than during the entire session. These ensembles display varied grooming responses, including transient changes around grooming transitions or sustained changes in activity throughout the duration of grooming. Neural trajectories computed from the identified ensembles retain the grooming related dynamics present in trajectories computed from all units in the session. These results elaborate striatal function in rodent self-grooming and demonstrate that striatal grooming-related activity is organized within functional ensembles, improving our understanding of how the striatum guides action selection in a naturalistic behavior.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Self-grooming is an evolutionarily conserved, ethologically relevant, and innate behavior. Self-grooming is found in arthropods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, birds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, and mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. In mammals, grooming serves to care for the outer body surface, for de-arousal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, thermoregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, and water economy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Rodent grooming is an innate behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, with mice showing primitive forms of facial grooming as early as postnatal day 1 (p1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. From p4-8, the kinematics of grooming movements become more tightly coordinated. After p9, mice start to perform movements similar to those performed by adults. Rat pups begin to exhibit functional face grooming at p6-8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, but do not perform long sequences of grooming until p14-21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, the time of development when many complex motor programs begin to emerge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The selection and initiation of actions is controlled by the striatum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The striatum has been shown to encode action space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and to flexibly combine behavioral motifs into actions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Cells within the striatum, predominantly consisting of striatal spiny projection neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, are organized into functional clusters of co-active units; this clustering is considered to be important for striatal network dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> and behavioral control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. The striatum has been implicated in the production of self-grooming behavior, and lesions of the striatum disrupt grooming bouts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Within the striatum, neurons of the dorsolateral striatum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> and nearby central striatal regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> display grooming-related activity. Yet, how populations or ensembles of neurons in the striatum—defined here as sets of neurons that are more likely than chance to be co-active—encode self-grooming remains unclear. Given the likely importance of ensemble activity in the striatum, elaborating whether grooming-associated neural activity maps onto striatal ensembles is significant, and it remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Here we recorded simultaneous activity of populations of neurons in the dorsolateral striatum of freely moving mice during spontaneous grooming using extracellular probes. Because grooming can be a relatively rare behavior, many hours of data must be acquired to capture an adequate sample of its neural correlates. To overcome this obstacle, we developed a semi-automated approach to detect grooming bouts from behavioral videos using 3D pose estimation and postural heuristics. We found striatal projection neurons (SPN) and fast spiking interneurons (FSI) with temporally diverse grooming-related activity. Furthermore, we identified striatal ensembles that encode core parameters of grooming bouts, including the transitions in and out of individual bouts, as well as bout duration.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Mice were placed in a transparent, triangular arena with video recorded from each side to capture spontaneous behavior (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, B</bold>). We identified mouse grooming bouts in a semi-automated 4-step process (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). First, mouse limb positions were tracked in 2D in each view using DeepLabCut and triangulated to 3D using Anipose (see Methods). The 3D limb positions were then used to isolate likely grooming times, using a set of postural heuristics including movement speed, whether the animal was rearing, and the hand-to-nose distance. These heuristics identified general windows during which grooming was likely to be occurring, but they did not capture the precise timing of the behavior. We therefore refined heuristic output using manual frame-by-frame annotation, to capture the precise start and stop times of grooming (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>). In 117 total hours of analyzed video, we observed 304.8 minutes of grooming behavior within 1,475 individual bouts of grooming; mice groomed for 4.1% of each session on average (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>, 4.1 ± 0.3%, 63 sessions from 6 mice). Grooming bouts were on average 12.4 seconds long (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>, 12.4 ± 0.4 seconds) and separated by 4.3 minutes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>, 4.3 ± 0.1 minutes).</p>

<p>To record striatal activity during mouse spontaneous grooming, we implanted 64-channel electrodes into the dorsolateral striatum of adult male and female mice (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-D</xref></bold>, N=6 mice). We classified well-isolated units as putative striatal spiny projection neurons (SPN) and putative fast spiking interneurons (FSI) on the basis of their firing rates and spike waveform, following established criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>.</sup> Units that did not fit the criteria for SPNs or FSIs were labelled as ‘other’ and excluded from further analyses. (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>, SPN: 88.2% 2,755 units, FSI: 3.2% 100 units, other: 8.6% 269 units).</p>

<p>To identify example individual units with grooming-related activity, we isolated units whose activity within a two-second window around the start or end of grooming was two standard deviations above mean activity during a grooming-free baseline period. All subsequent analyses were performed on the full dataset. Example SPNs and FSIs with grooming related activity are shown in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-E</xref></bold>. We observed units displaying diverse grooming-related responses, including increased activity at the start of grooming, end of grooming, and both start and end of grooming, as well as units that showed elevated activity for the duration of grooming, and units that showed reduced activity for the duration of grooming.</p>
<p>To characterize different grooming-associated responses in the recorded striatal units, we first performed principal components analysis (PCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> on the grooming transition-triggered-average activity of all recorded SPNs and FSIs. We performed PCA separately on SPN activity aligned to groom start, SPN activity aligned to groom end, FSI activity aligned to groom start, and FSI activity aligned to groom end. The first principal component (PC) from each group reflects units that undergo a step-like increase or decrease in their activity at the grooming transition (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B, F, G, K, L, P, Q</xref></bold>, SPNs aligned to groom start: 336 units with positive contributions to the first PC (denoted “&gt; 0”), 640 &lt; 0, SPNs aligned to groom end: 526 &gt; 0, 424 &lt; 0, FSIs aligned to groom start: 66 &gt; 0, 1 &lt; 0, FSIs aligned to groom end: 22 &gt; 0, 44 &lt; 0). The second PC from each group reflects units whose activity transiently peaks or decreases around the grooming transition (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, D, H, I, M, N, R, S</xref></bold>, SPNs aligned to groom start: 364 &gt; 0, 292 &lt; 0, SPNs aligned to groom end: 164 &gt; 0, 518 &lt; 0, FSIs aligned to groom start: 4 &gt; 0, 19 &lt; 0, FSIs aligned to groom end: 5 &gt; 0, 19 &lt; 0). Taken together, these results show that single unit SPNs and FSIs encode transitions into and out of an innate naturalistic behavior.</p>

<p>The event-triggered average responses of striatal neurons reveal several patterns of firing rate modulation aligned with the start or end of grooming. However, because this analysis relies on trial-averaging, it cannot be used to determine whether the striatum contains ensembles of neurons that are consistently co-active. To address this question, we looked for functional clusters, or ‘ensembles’ of co-active striatal neurons with grooming related activity. To achieve this, we first constructed a matrix containing the grooming activity of all units in a given session, where the activity of each unit plus 5 seconds before and after grooming was concatenated. This matrix is shown for an example session in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>; dendrogram-based sorting of recorded units makes evident the presence of synchronous activity in groups of units. Synchrony among units is also suggested by the block-diagonal structure of the correlation matrix for this example session (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). This synchrony is further suggested by comparison to a time-shuffled version of the data (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>)</bold> and its corresponding correlation matrix (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>—figure supplement 1B)</bold>.</p>

<p>To test for the presence of ensembles and to estimate the number of potential ensembles within each session, we used an eigenvalue-based statistical method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, where we identify dimensions of the neural covariance matrix that capture more variance than expected by chance and found each session to have three to ten ensembles (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>, 6.2 ± 0.3 ensembles, 33 sessions, see Methods for details). Next, using the meta-<italic>k</italic>-means clustering algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, we identified the ensembles present in each session. Meta-<italic>k</italic>-means is an extension of <italic>k</italic>-means where one performs N iterations of <italic>k</italic>-means, keeping track of how many times each pair of units gets clustered together. The proportion of times that each pair gets clustered together is used to assign intermediate clusters before a final merging step. We chose to use meta-<italic>k</italic>-means for two reasons. First, meta-<italic>k</italic>-means does not always result in cluster assignment for all units, which is preferable because our recording configuration only samples a small subset of neurons in striatum and we do not expect all recorded units to belong to an identified striatal ensemble. Second, meta-<italic>k</italic>-means allows for the final number of identified ensembles to be greater or less than the initial choice of <italic>k</italic>, which is preferable because we do not have <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of ensemble numbers present in each session.</p>
<p>We found that 80% of recorded SPNs (1,074 units) and 70% of recorded FSIs (41 units) were clustered into ensembles of two or more units <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>). The majority of clusters were composed of only SPNs, and FSIs were almost always assigned clusters together with SPNs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>— figure supplement 1D;</bold> 88% (214 clusters) SPN only, 1% (1 cluster) FSIs only, 11% (28 clusters) SPN and FSIs). Within our identified ensembles, units in the same ensemble tended to be spatially closer than units that are not within the same ensemble (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>)</bold>, consistent with striatal ensembles detected using imaging techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. During grooming, the pairwise correlation between units within the same cluster is higher than for the correlation between units not in the same cluster, whether those units are unclustered or belong to a different cluster (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></bold>). The distributions of pairwise correlations computed using data from the whole session are shown in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></bold>.

<p>Having demonstrated the existence of ensemble activity during grooming, we next asked whether ensemble activity was enriched during specific timepoints during grooming. A heatmap displaying the average grooming activity for all significant ensembles is shown in <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold> (112 ensembles, 4 mice, 33 sessions). To visualize the average grooming activity of ensembles across grooming bouts of varying duration, we first linearly time-warped ensemble activity during grooming. We found that ensemble peak activity is enriched around the transitions into and out of grooming (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>), but that the dynamics of grooming ensemble activation are diverse. For example, we found ensembles with higher activity during grooming, lower activity during grooming, and with peak activity at the start or end of grooming, with individual cluster examples of these patterns shown in <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 C-F</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>.

<p>To contrast the encoding of grooming-related activity in ensembles vs unclustered units, we used nonnegative matrix factorization to perform dimensionality reduction on the neural activity during grooming within a single session.

During most grooming bouts the population activity moves out along factor 1, then up along factor 2, and finally returns toward the origin along factor 3, corresponding to population encoding of grooming onset, maintenance, and termination. The neural trajectories computed from unclustered units do not retain the dynamics present in the trajectories from all units or the clustered ones (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref></bold>, 16 unclustered units; <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref></bold>, 49 clustered units).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we developed a semi-automated approach to identify grooming events in mouse behavioral videos. We recorded population activity in the dorsolateral striatum of freely moving mice and found SPNs and FSIs with activity that encodes the start and end of spontaneous grooming bouts. Previous studies reported changes in striatal single unit activity around the start and end of naturalistic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> and learned behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Our single unit data elaborate the changes in striatal unit activity around the transitions of a naturalistic behavior. Single unit responses were heterogenous and included units with changes in activity at the start or end of grooming, as well as units that were active or silenced throughout the duration of grooming. We identified striatal ensembles with units that were more correlated during grooming than during the entire session. These striatal ensembles encoded grooming start time, end time, and bout duration. Single session trajectories computed from ensemble activity retain most of the dynamics present in trajectories computed from all units in the session.</p>
<p>The distribution of pairwise distances between units within an ensemble is shifted towards smaller distances, compared to the distribution of distances for units that do not belong to the same ensemble. This is consistent with striatal ensembles detected using imaging techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> although our identified ensembles are less spatially compact than those previously reported. Notably, however, striatal 2-photon imaging approaches and microendoscopic imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicators yield a recording area that extends along the medial-lateral and anterior posterior axes (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., horizontally), whereas our four-shank electrophysiological recordings yield a recording field that extends along the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., vertically), potentially accounting for this difference in findings. Together, the ensemble distances recorded via both methods suggest the possibility that striatal ensembles are isotropically organized, which is well-aligned with studies of cortical and thalamic projection patterns to the striatum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While the ensembles we characterized were identified during grooming behavior, it is possible that they are not grooming-specific. One possibility for the functional organization of striatal ensembles is that ensemble membership is stable across different behaviors. Then, ensemble activation encodes some common movement motif or state that is present across multiple behavioral settings. However, the units within our identified striatal ensembles were more correlated during grooming than during the entire recording session. Our data therefore support an alternative to the stable membership hypothesis, wherein individual units can be members of multiple ensembles, such that when a given unit is active, the behavior the animal is performing can only be determined by looking at the population level. For example, a set of units might be members of a single ensemble that encodes the start of grooming, but each unit could also be part of different ensembles that encode aspects of other natural behaviors, such as eating or walking. This ‘mixed selectivity’ is broadly consistent with previously reported data on striatal activity patterns and cluster memberships that are not conserved across divergent behavioral motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Striatal FSIs are parvalbumin-containing GABAergic interneurons that make up approximately 1% of striatal neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. FSIs receive direct cortical input, form inhibitory synapses onto SPNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, and are interconnected amongst themselves via gap junctions on their dendrites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Previous studies found uncoordinated, idiosyncratic task-related changes in FSI activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, as well as changes in FSI activity that correlated with movement features like velocity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, with one study showing grooming-related activity in a small number of recorded putative FSIs<sup>43.</sup> We recorded units that match spike waveform features and firing rates of FSIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> and found them to have grooming related activity. These units displayed decreased or increased activity during grooming, as well as transient activity changes at the transitions into and out of grooming. Consistent with strong connectivity present between FSIs and SPNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>, a majority of FSIs (70%) were part of identified ensembles and almost all FSIs were part of ensembles together with SPNs.</p>
<p>Striatal control of movement is mediated via two parallel pathways: the direct and indirect pathway, composed of dSPNs and iSPNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Previous recordings of direct and indirect pathway striatal ensemble activity have found that d- and iSPNs exhibit a similar time course of behavior-related changes in their activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> and have similar ensemble organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, suggesting mixed pathway membership within ensembles. Indeed, simultaneous recording of direct and indirect pathway SPNs showed that striatal ensembles are composed of d- and iSPNs in equal proportions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. These prior data suggest that striatal ensembles encoding self-grooming might be composed of both d- and iSPNs, in similar proportions and with similar encoding of grooming, although this remains to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Within bouts of rodent self-grooming, animals perform highly stereotyped grooming sequences called syntactic grooming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. This sequence is comprised of four distinctive phases and found in a variety of species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. A large body of work has established a function for the striatum in the sequential ordering of syntactic grooming phases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. On a longer time scale, grooming is one of many behaviors an animal can perform at a given time. Since self-grooming, although broadly important, is not often an immediate concern, grooming is considered a low priority behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Thus, the control of grooming has been characterized by a disinhibition model, in which grooming takes place in the time left over by other higher priority behaviors when grooming would be inhibited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Previous studies have demonstrated a striatal role in behavioral sequencing on this longer time scale as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Thus, self-grooming represents an ethologically meaningful behavioral paradigm providing a path to study neural control of an innate, conserved behavior at multiple spatiotemporal scales.</p>

<title>Grooming identification</title>
<p>We identified mouse grooming bouts in behavioral videos using a semi-automated 4-step procedure (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>).

We calibrated our 3 cameras with a 3-minute video of a ChArUco board throughout the camera fields of view (125 FPS. Image size 1440 × 608 pixels). The ChArUco board was printed on paper and taped onto a stiff plastic board. The ChArUco pattern had 7×10 squares containing 4-bit markers and a dictionary size of 50 markers. Before triangulation, we applied a Viterbi filter to the 2D poses with F = 12 frames. The triangulation was performed via an optimization constrained on the distance between the two eyes and the distance between each eye and the snout. We chose scale_smooth = 5, scale_length = 2, and score_threshold = 0.3.</p>
<p>To isolate times when the mouse was likely grooming, we identified frames where the mouse was rearing, and its paws were near its head. To identify frames where the mouse was rearing, we set thresholds on the snout height and the distance between the midpoint of the eyes and the midpoint of the hindlimbs. To identify frames where the mouse’s paws were near its head, we set thresholds on the distance between the midpoint of the paws and the snout, the distance between the midpoint of the paws and the midpoint of the eyes, and height of the midpoint of the paws. Per-frame labels within 1.2 seconds were merged to form predictions over a window. Predicted grooming bouts less than 2 seconds long were discarded. Parameter values were evaluated by generating predictions for a set of videos and viewing the predictions aligned to the video in BENTO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Grooming bout start and stop times were manually refined by 4 trained annotators, with each annotator labeling a different subset of videos. Annotators used the predictions from the previous thresholding step to navigate the videos and score grooming behaviors. The videos were annotated in VLC media player<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup> using the Time v3.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup> and Speed controller<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup> extensions. To assess inter-annotator reliability, all annotators were also given the same 2-hour session to annotate. The average pairwise Jaccard index (or Intersection over Union) computed on the annotations was 0.76 ± 0.04.</p>

<title>Identification of units with grooming-related activity</title>
<p>To isolate units with grooming related activity, we first down sampled activity to 2 Hz, by summing spike counts within non-overlapping 500 ms bins. We defined units as having grooming-related activity if their average activity at the start or end of grooming was 2 standard deviations above their average activity during a 3 second-long, grooming-free baseline period. For activity aligned to groom start, we used the activity from 5 to 2 seconds before grooming start as the baseline and compared that to the activity from 1 second before until 1 second after the grooming start time. For activity aligned to groom end, the activity from 2 to 5 seconds after grooming was chosen as the baseline and was compared to the average activity from 1 second before until 1 second after groom end. These selection criteria were only used to identify neurons to serve as examples in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>; all subsequent analyses were performed on the full dataset.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4j">
<title>Characterization of trial-averaged grooming responses</title>
<p>We characterized the grooming responses exhibited by the recorded units by computing each unit’s event-triggered average response in a ± 5-second window relative to the start and (separately) end of grooming. Responses were down sampled to 4 Hz, by summing spike counts within non-overlapping 250 ms bins. To simplify interpretation, we restricted averaging to grooming bouts that were ‘well-isolated.’ Specifically, because we included the 5 seconds before and after each bout in this analysis, grooming bouts that started within 10 seconds of the end of the previous bout were not included in this analysis. An exception to this is instances with less than 3 seconds between the end of one grooming bout and the start of the next, in which case we merged these two annotations into a single bout.</p>
<p>To better visualize and interpret grooming-associated activity we next performed principal component analysis (PCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> on the set of event-triggered averages. Specifically, we performed PCA separately on SPN activity aligned to groom start, SPN activity aligned to groom end, FSI activity aligned to groom start, and FSI activity aligned to groom end. For each cell type and condition combination, we concatenated the associated units to form a units-by-time matrix, relative to groom start/stop. The response of each unit in this matrix was then Z-scored, after which PCA was used to extract the first two principal components.</p>
<p>To group units into ‘response types’ for visualization, we examined the weight (or ‘score’) for each unit’s contribution to the largest and second-largest principal component. Units for which the absolute value of this weight was greater for the first principal component than the second formed the “PC1” response group, while those with greater-magnitude weights for the second principal component formed the “PC2” response group. Finally, we sorted the units within each group according to their contribution to the first (PC1) or second (PC2) principal component of the dataset (weight <sup>*</sup> activity).</p>

<title>Grooming-associated striatal ensemble identification</title>
<p>To identify grooming-associated striatal ensembles within a given session, we took the neurons-by-time matrix of recorded spiking from the full two-hour recording session and excluded all frames that did not occur during grooming or within a 5-second window before or after grooming. Due to the low firing rate of SPNs, it was rare to find units that were co-active at high sampling rates. Therefore, to instead identify units that were frequently active at around the same time, we binned spike counts at a sampling rate of 0.667 Hz (bin size of 1.5 seconds). The spike counts for each unit were then normalized to between zero and one, and further smoothed by convolving with a Gaussian filter with a standard deviation of 3 seconds.</p>
<p>Using this smoothed and coarsened estimate of cell activity, we next applied meta-<italic>k</italic>-means<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> to identify sets of cells that were often co-active. We chose to use meta-<italic>k-</italic>means for clustering, because it does not force all units in a session to be assigned to a cluster, and it allows for the number of ensembles to be greater or less than the initial choice of <italic>k</italic>. Briefly, meta-<italic>k</italic>-means employs repeated runs of standard <italic>k</italic>-means clustering to identify groups of units that are consistently clustered together. As with standard <italic>k</italic>-means, meta-<italic>k</italic>-means requires the user specify an initial number of clusters <italic>k</italic>, which we set to be the square root of the number of units in the given session, as in Barbera et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. We then ran 1,000 repeats of the <italic>k</italic>-means clustering algorithm on the matrix of filtered grooming-related activity described above, with units as variables and time bins as observations. Cluster centroids for each repeat were initialized using the greedy <italic>k</italic>-means++ algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>. As in prior work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>, units that were assigned to the same cluster in &gt;80% of <italic>k</italic>-means runs were considered to be part of the same meta-<italic>k</italic>-means cluster.</p>
<p>When merging clusters as part of the meta-<italic>k</italic>-means algorithm, we used the silhouette score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup> to evaluate the outcome of a potential cluster merge. To ensure adequate sample size for downstream analyses, ensemble identification was restricted to sessions with at least 30 SPNs and FSIs.</p>

<sec id="s4l">
<title>Statistical analysis of striatal ensembles</title>
<p>To compute a statistical estimate on the number of ensembles present in each session we used an eigenvalue based statistical method from Peyrache at al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Briefly, if two neurons have correlated firing, then we expect to observe common fluctuations in their spiking activity during recording. This can be visualized by plotting the firing rates of the two neurons against each other, in the form of a direction in neural activity space along which observations tend to be distributed. Conversely, without any correlated firing, the variance in the dataset will be roughly equally distributed in all directions, and one would not expect to see structure when plotting the activity of two cells against each other. These relationships hold for any n-dimensional set of neurons, where structure emerges from correlated activity. The eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of a dataset represent the directions of maximally shared variance, thereby capturing the correlations present in the data. Each eigenvalue quantifies the variance of the data along the axis defined by its corresponding eigenvector. Thus, in a matrix of neurons-by-time, the eigenvalues of its covariance matrix capture the correlations among neurons (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., ensembles) and comparing the eigenvalues to those computed from the covariance matrix of a shuffled version of the data provides a measure of the number of ensembles present.</p>
<p>To apply this method, we first binned spike counts at the same sampling rate as for clustering (0.667 Hz, bin size of 1.5 seconds) and Z-scored the activity of each neuron. Next, we shuffled the time bins for each neuron independently, and computed the maximal eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of the shuffled data. We repeated this 5,000 times to form a null distribution and counted the number of eigenvalues from the covariance matrix of the actual data that were above the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile of this null distribution.</p>

<title>Time-normalized grooming-related activity</title>
<p>To compare ensemble average activity during grooming across grooming bouts of varying duration, we linearly temporally rescaled the activity of each unit during each grooming bout to a single fixed length. We chose the length for the interpolated values from the distribution of grooming bout durations from all clustered sessions. To avoid ‘blurring’ activity associated with the start and end of grooming bouts, the activity during the 5 seconds before and after each bout was not interpolated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4n">
<title>Bootstrap significance testing of grooming-related ensemble activity</title>
<p>To test for periods during grooming when the grooming ensemble average activity was significantly higher or lower than chance, we computed the mean, 2.5<sup>th</sup>, and 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentiles of the distribution of randomly sampled ensemble activity. To generate this distribution, we computed the population-average ensemble activity during 1,000 random duration windows of time sampled throughout the 2-hour recording session. Start times were sampled uniformly from 5 seconds into the recording session until 5 seconds before the end of the session. Window durations were sampled from the distribution of observed grooming bout durations across all sessions.</p>

<title>Neural trajectories</title>
<p>To visualize neural trajectories, neural activity during grooming was decomposed onto 3 components using non-negative matrix factorization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>. For the neural trajectories, we decomposed a matrix containing each unit’s activity during all grooming bouts within that session. For each unit, we concatenated its activity during all grooming bouts including the five seconds before and after each bout. For the ensemble trajectories, we averaged the activity of all units within each ensemble and concatenated each ensemble’s activity during all grooming bouts including 5 seconds before and after each bout. We initialized using Nonnegative Double Singular Value Decomposition with zeros filled with the average neural activity and minimized the Frobenius norm of the loss.</p>

<p>This study evaluated how naturalistic behaviors are encoded in the striatum by analyzing neural ensembles engaged during grooming behavior. The study shows that neural responses are highly heterogeneous during grooming, but ensembles were detected in which units were more correlated during grooming than during the entire session. This study presents an <bold>important</bold> contribution to the field by shedding light on how ensembles of neurons encode innate behavior. The results are <bold>convincing</bold>.</p>

<p>In &quot;Striatal ensemble activity in an innate behavior&quot;, Minkowicz et al. strive to characterize how the striatum, the primary input nucleus of the basal ganglia, represents grooming. Here, grooming is used as a paradigmatic habitual behavior. The pose dynamics of grooming are stereotyped: mice perform it spontaneously and prior work has shown that it is both represented and controlled by the striatum.</p>
<p>The manuscript presents a valuable contribution to the field by shedding light on how ensembles of neurons encode this innate behavior. Additionally, the use of supervised machine learning allowed the authors to collect and precisely align a large number of grooming repetitions, which enabled most of their downstream analysis.</p>
<p>I found the paper to be well-written and the conclusions are mostly well-supported. However, some of the data analysis was a bit opaque, and some more detail and reanalysis could substantially strengthen the authors' claims.</p>
<p>1. The authors identified grooming bouts using empirically defined thresholds and manual tweaking. Next, the boundaries of grooming were used for trial alignment and linear time warping. This is a completely sensible approach; however, in using only the boundaries of grooming episodes, the dynamics of grooming bouts are ignored. I am particularly concerned that pose dynamics of grooming bouts are most stereotyped at the boundaries (e.g. they always begin and end with specific paw movements). To play devil's advocate, if the striatum encodes pose dynamics and not boundaries and pose dynamics are noisy between the beginning and end of these bouts (either due to the dynamics of the behavior or how it was identified), then a &quot;boundary-like&quot; representation may emerge in the average. I strongly recommend re-running a subset of the analysis after accounting for variability in grooming dynamics. A simple thing to try would be to further cluster grooming bouts using 3D keypoint trajectories. Another would be to warp grooming bouts in a manner that accounts for keypoint trajectories (e.g. DTW or other recent time-warping variants).</p>
<p>2. The authors should consider if the correlation to grooming is due to (at least in part) a correlation with another aspect of movement, e.g. overall velocity, acceleration, height, or angular velocity. This should be straightforward to analyze with the current dataset. To start, I would simply take the velocity and acceleration of the mouse's centroid (head and body could be considered separately). Next, look at the correlation with DLS spiking. If a clear relationship emerges, then check to see how velocity (or another variable) maps onto grooming. It may be that DLS neurons appear to encode the boundaries of grooming when they (at least partially) encode other variables.</p>
<p>3. The ensemble analysis is potentially critical to our understanding of SPNs. Figure 4A suggests that ensembles encode grooming with a probabilistic code - ensembles appear to be engaged for a small number of grooming bouts in the session. First, a basic question is what is the probability a given ensemble is activated during grooming? Second, the more complex question is whether there is an explanation for why one ensemble is engaged for some trials and not others? Related to point 2, I wonder if another aspect of behavior - e.g. vigor, duration, or speed - determines this. I suggest some analysis to at least rule out some simple explanations.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Minkowicz et al., investigates the presence of neuronal ensembles in the striatum that may encode grooming (as a model of a naturalistic behavior). They implemented a semi-automated detection of grooming, and by recording populations of striatal cells they show that individual neurons in the striatum contain activity modulations around the start, end, or during grooming. Then using this activity they identify ensembles of cells in individual sessions/animals at the start, end or during grooming.</p>
<p>The behavioral tracking and recordings are remarkable, the manuscript is clearly written and the finding mostly sound with the proposed conclusions, providing original findings in the field. Nonetheless some points are raised that need further clarification</p>
<p>1. When claiming that the findings show encoding of transitions into or out of grooming (and duration of grooming) one could expect to see specific regressions between the neuronal activity (of individual cells or ensembles) and the parameters mentioned besides the analysis shown in figure 3 and 5.</p>
<p>
2. Was the detection of ensembles presented in figure 4 sensible to use less than 5 seconds before/after grooming. I am thinking that 5 seconds are times that could contain behaviors that may have their own ensembles. Why 5 seconds?</p>
<p>
3. According to Figure 2-figure supplement 1. The recordings were performed covering the lateral and in some cases the central part of the striatum. Shall it be specified along the text where the specific recordings come from?</p>
