<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that displays great variability in clinical phenotype. Many factors have been described to be correlated with its severity, and microbiota could play a key role in the infection, progression, and outcome of the disease. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with nasopharyngeal and gut dysbiosis and higher abundance of opportunistic pathogens. To identify new prognostic markers for the disease, a multicenter prospective observational cohort study was carried out in COVID-19 patients divided into three cohorts based on symptomatology: mild (n=24), moderate (n=51), and severe/critical (n=31). Faecal and nasopharyngeal samples were taken, and the microbiota was analyzed. Linear discriminant analysis identified <italic>M. salivarium</italic>, <italic>P. dentalis</italic>, and <italic>H. parainfluenzae</italic> as biomarkers of severe COVID-19 in nasopharyngeal microbiota, while <italic>P. bivia</italic> and <italic>P. timonensis</italic> were defined in faecal microbiota. Additionally, a connection between faecal and nasopharyngeal microbiota was identified, with a significant ratio between <italic>P. timonensis</italic> (faeces) and <italic>P. dentalis</italic> and <italic>M. salivarium</italic> (nasopharyngeal) abundances found in critically ill patients. This ratio could serve as a novel prognostic tool for identifying severe COVID-19 cases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The data reported in November 2023 revealed that over 700 million people have been infected with the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The appearance of mutations and variants of concern has caused several additional waves of infection and compromise the effectiveness of existing vaccines and antiviral drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown to cause long-term effects on human health, although the mechanisms are still poorly described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Even though most COVID-19 cases are mild, disease can be severe, resulting in hospitalisation, respiratory failure, or even death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Therefore, a remarkable feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the great variability in clinical phenotype among infected people. Many factors can correlate with COVID-19 disease severity, including age, gender, body mass index, previous comorbidities, immune responses, and genetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Of note, and unfortunately, the determinants of infection outcome and the pathogenic mechanisms are not completely understood yet.</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can also infect other organs since viral particles and nucleic acids have been found in different biological samples, like sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, faeces, blood, and urine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Thus, studies employing single-cell RNA sequencing have demonstrated that ACE2 is present in various organs and tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, where ACE2 receptors have been reported to be highly expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. This supports several lines of evidence suggesting a substantial involvement of the gastrointestinal tract in the pathogenesis of the disease, including the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and replicate in intestinal enterocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], or to increase expression of the viral entry receptor (ACE2 receptor) and several membrane-bound serine proteases (such as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and TMPRSS4) in intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition, reports have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection can disrupt nasopharyngeal and intestinal microbiota composition and promote dysbiosis, reducing diversity and increasing the presence of opportunistic pathogens, including <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> and <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], which can make patients more susceptible to secondary infections, rising morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Besides local changes in the respiratory tract, alterations in the distal gut microbiota have also been observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Previous studies have evidenced a relevant connection between the microbiome in the nasopharynx and the gut, and preliminary data have suggested a bidirectional interaction that could play a role in the development of the immune response both in healthy and pathological conditions, including SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. In this sense, dysbiosis has been associated not only with the severity of the disease but also with the recovery processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]; however, little is understood of the link with the establishment of different symptomatic profiles in this condition, and to date, few studies have focused on the association between COVID-19 severity and the nasopharyngeal and faecal microbiota, being examined simultaneously. Considering that the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 is compromised with the emergence of mutations and new variants of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], new therapeutic approaches and prognostic tools are still necessary. Therefore, the characterization of the nasopharyngeal and intestinal microbiome will allow to identify predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease, as well as possible therapeutic targets in the management of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<title>Study patients characteristics</title>
<p>A total of 106 patients who had laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the present study. Of note, none of these patients reported another viral infection at the time of enrolment. Based on the clinical spectrum criteria reported in the COVID-19 treatment guidelines, patients were categorised into 3 groups: mild (24 patients), moderate illness that needed hospitalisation in Respiratory Unit (51 patients), and severe symptomatology and admitted in the ICU (31 patients) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The age of the patients significantly increased with the severity of the symptoms. Patients included in the severe group were significantly older than those with mild or moderate symptoms (p &lt; 0.05; ANOVA). Patient inclusion was carried out evenly in terms of gender as 52 women and 54 men were recruited; nevertheless, a gender-related impact on the clinical course of these patients was observed since males were predominantly in the group of patients with severe symptoms when compared with the mild illness group (p &lt; 0.05; Fisher’s test). Regarding the symptomatology, mild patients showed symptoms of a mild respiratory infection, including fever, cough and headache. 33% of mild patients displayed dyspnoea and low oxygen saturation, 26% reported gastrointestinal complaints (including stomach ache, digestive discomfort and diarrhoea); and 4% reported high respiratory and heart rates. In contrast, moderate and severe patients showed higher frequencies of dyspnoea, low oxygen saturation and increased respiratory or heart rates (p &lt; 0.05; Fisher’s test). When the different comorbidities were considered, patients in the group with severe symptoms showed a higher percentage of cardiomyopathy compared to those from the mild or moderate cohorts (42% vs 3% and 6%, respectively; p &lt; 0.05; Fisher’s test). However, no significant differences were found in the prevalence of the other pathologies among groups. Regarding blood-based biomarkers, platelets (p &lt; 0.05; ANOVA), D-dimer, ferritin and C reactive protein (p &lt; 0.05; Kruskal-Wallis) correlated with the severity of the symptoms, being the severe group significantly different.</p>

<title>Bacterial composition differs between sample type and severity index in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients</title>
<p>Nasopharyngeal swabs and faeces were obtained from all the patients included in the study within seven days of symptom onset and used for characterization of the microbiota composition. In the nasopharyngeal microbiota, α-diversity was reduced in the moderate and severe groups compared to the mild group (p &lt; 0.05 and p = 0.07 respectively; ANOVA) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Conversely, when α-diversity was examined in stool samples, no significant modifications were observed among groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). On the other hand, ß-diversity analysis through the Bray-Curtis index revealed statistical differences between groups for both nasopharyngeal swabs and stools samples (p &lt; 0.001; PERMANOVA) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). As a result, microbiota is grouped in three separate clusters depending on the severity of the symptoms, which indicates that microbiota differences are based on changes in bacterial composition.</p>

<p>Similarly, the characterization of microbiota abundance composition revealed heterogeneity in the microbiota profile associated with severity and disease progression in these patients. Relative abundance levels for both phylum and genera were evaluated using the median abundance as a threshold. Specifically, genera with a median relative abundance greater than 0.5% were considered for detailed analysis.</p>
<p>At phylum level, in nasopharyngeal microbiota, the abundance of <italic>Bacillota</italic> was increased while the abundance of <italic>Bacteroidota</italic> and <italic>Actinobacteroidota</italic> was reduced in patients with severe symptomatology (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Conversely, the faecal microbiota of the three groups presented a more homogeneous distribution than the nasopharyngeal one, being the most abundant phyla <italic>Bacillota</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidota</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). However, patients with severe symptoms, thus with a worse prognosis, showed a lower abundance of <italic>Bacteroidota</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Exact values of relative abundance for different phyla are shown in supplementary file 1.</p>

<p>At genus level, the nasopharyngeal microbiome composition revealed that symptom severity was associated with a higher number of detected genera (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Of note, significant differences in genus abundance for each group of patients were found. Thus, mild patients presented a significantly higher abundance of <italic>Alistipes</italic>, <italic>Muribaculaceae</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> (p &lt; 0.05; Kruskal-Wallis), whereas the group with moderate symptoms showed a significant increase in <italic>Alcaligenes</italic>, <italic>Pseudorobacter</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (p &lt; 0.05; Kruskall-Wallis). Additionally, patients with more severe disease had significantly higher relative abundance of <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, <italic>Actinomyces</italic>, <italic>Anaerococcus</italic>, <italic>Atopobium</italic>, <italic>Campylobacter</italic>, <italic>Dolosigranulum, Enterobacter</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus</italic>, <italic>Finegoldia</italic>, <italic>Fusobacterium</italic>, <italic>Gemella</italic>, <italic>Haemophilus</italic>, <italic>Lawsonella</italic>, <italic>Leptotrichia</italic>, <italic>Megasphaera</italic>, <italic>Neisseria</italic>, <italic>Serratia</italic>, <italic>Rotia</italic> and <italic>Veillonella</italic> (p &lt; 0.05; Kruskal-Wallis). Unlike nasopharyngeal swabs, stool samples showed a reduction in the number of detected genera as symptom severity increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Precisely, mild patients showed more presence of <italic>Blautia, Muribaculaceae</italic> and different members of the <italic>Clostridia</italic> class (<italic>Clostridia</italic>, <italic>Coprococcus</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcus</italic>) than the other groups (p &lt; 0.05; Kruskal-Wallis). In moderate ill patients <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Barneseilla</italic>, <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>, <italic>Parabacteroides</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05; Kruskal-Wallis).

<title>Differences in bacteria composition could be used as biomarkers to predict disease severity and outcome in SARS-CoV-2 infection</title>
<p>We investigated whether some specific taxa could be associated with the severity of the symptoms. ASVs were evaluated to determine core taxa along with the specific bacteria of each group of patients and samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Core taxa were identified using a detection threshold of 0.1 and a prevalence threshold of 0.1. In nasopharyngeal swabs, Venn diagram revealed that the three cohorts shared 51 core taxa. 60 specific bacteria were identified in patients with mild symptoms while 32 were observed in patients with moderate symptoms and 8 in patients with severe symptoms. When stools were considered, the three cohorts shared 159 core taxa. 27 were specific of mild patients, another 33 of patients with moderate symptoms and 27 of the severe patients (For more details see supplementary file 4).</p>

<p>Besides, the linear discriminant analysis (LEfSe) was performed to identify differential microorganisms for each group of patients (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C,D</xref>). In nasopharyngeal samples from mild patients, <italic>Burkholderia sp.</italic>, <italic>Paraburkholderia sp.</italic> and <italic>Massilia sp.</italic> were determined; in moderate patients, <italic>Pseudomonas veronii</italic>, <italic>Stenotrophomonas rhizophila</italic> and <italic>Azotobacter chroococcum</italic>; and in severe patients, <italic>Mycoplasma salivarium</italic>, <italic>Prevotella dentalis</italic>, <italic>Leptotrichia</italic> and <italic>Haemophilus parainfluenzae</italic>. On the other hand, in stool samples, <italic>Bacteroides coprocola</italic>, <italic>Veillonella sp.</italic>, <italic>Ruminococcus bicirculans</italic> and <italic>Sutterella stercoricanis</italic> were identified as predictors of mild condition; <italic>Prevotella stercorea</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides cellulosilyficus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus salivarus</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides stercoris</italic> and <italic>Prevotella copri</italic> as predictors of moderate status; and <italic>Escherichia</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus durans</italic>, <italic>Alistipes onderdonkii</italic>, <italic>Prevotella timonensis</italic> and <italic>Prevotella bivia</italic> as markers of severe condition. Unlike the Venn diagram, the presence of a species in the LEfSe analysis does not imply its absence in the other groups, but rather indicates significant differences in abundance. Hence, detailed abundance of these bacteria can be found in supplementary files 5 and 6.</p>
<p>To further assess the role of these potential biomarkers in the prediction of COVID-19 severity, a correlation analysis was performed between these species and symptomatology. In summary, biomarkers identified in nasopharyngeal swabs in patients with severe condition, <italic>M. salivarium</italic> and <italic>Leptotrichia,</italic> showed a positive correlation with D dimer and cardiomyopathy, respectively (R &gt; 0.3). In addition, the other two biomarkers related to the highest severity, <italic>H. parainfluenzae</italic> and <italic>P. dentalis,</italic> also showed a positive association with CRP, D dimer and cardiomyopathy, even though it was not statistically significant (R = 0.2). More precisely, <italic>M. salivarium</italic> and <italic>Leptotrichia</italic> along with <italic>P. dentalis</italic> showed a significantly negative correlation towards lymphocytes count (p&lt;0.05; R&lt;-0.25) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In the case of stool samples, biomarkers for mild symptomatology (<italic>B. coprocola</italic>, <italic>R. bicirculans</italic> and <italic>S. stercoricanis</italic>) presented a negative correlation with CRP levels and respiratory rate (p&lt;0.05; R &lt; −0.25). In contrast, the severe biomarkers identified, presented important correlations towards dyspnoea, cardiomyopathy or respiratory rate. Concretely, <italic>P. bivia</italic> and <italic>P. timonensis</italic>, revealed a positive correlation with D dimer, ferritin levels and respiratory rate, as well as a negative correlation with lymphocyte count (R &gt; 0.6) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Additionally, these two species showed a significant positive correlation against CRP levels and a negative correlation towards lymphocyte count (p&lt;0.05).

<title>Identification of a novel microbiome-based COVID-19 prognosis approach</title>
<p>Considering the possible identified biomarkers and their relationship towards clinical variables, we proposed a new approach to predict disease severity in patients suffering SARS-CoV-2 infection by evaluating correlation among specific bacteria abundance from nasopharyngeal and stool samples The analysis revealed no important associations between nasopharyngeal and faecal microbiota in mild and moderate patients (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recent findings have evidenced the prominent role of the microbiome in several diseases, including those caused by viruses, proving that commensal microbiota could either enhance or hinder viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. A large body of evidence indicates that respiratory virus infections can induce a microbial imbalance in the airways, increasing the risk of secondary bacterial infections and worsening the prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Besides, alterations in the gut microbiota have also been noted during respiratory virus infections, likely influenced by the “gut-lung axis” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. In this regard, different studies have tried to establish relationships between microbiota composition and SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] but just a few have explored microbiota compositional variations among patients with different symptomatology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. However, only a few studies have explored the nasopharyngeal-faecal axis as a potential biomarker of severity in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Hence, the present study provides some biomarkers located in nasopharyngeal and gut microbiota that could help to predict COVID-19 severity.</p>
<p>In this context, 106 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this study and classified into 3 severity groups according to their symptoms. To ensure results were derived only from SARS-CoV-2 infection, included patients were not positive for other viral infections. Considering clinical parameters, the current study confirmed that age and gender are positively associated with more severe symptoms like dyspnoea, increased heart and respiratory rates together with lower oxygen saturation. Results that are in line with other COVID-19 studies conducted globally, which have shown that men and women are disproportionately affected. Data revealed that males suffered from more severe disease than females, including higher ICU admission rates, dyspnoea, increased heart rate, being all clinical signs for higher severity of the COVID-19 disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Regarding some biochemical parameters those groups of patients with moderate or severe symptoms showed significantly increased levels of D-dimer, ferritin and CRP, which are typically described as biomarkers for COVID-19 severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Interestingly, previous studies have reported that alterations in the gut microbiota composition in COVID-19 patients could be also associated with disease severity, measured with the elevated concentration of the blood markers described above. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. In this sense, we have confirmed these results in our study as specific bacteria from severe condition positively correlates with the levels of ferritin, CRP, D-dimer or lymphocytes. Consequently, the microbiota could be key in the clinical phenotype of COVID-19 patients, although its specific contribution to the progression of the infection and a poor prognosis needs to be better understood.</p>
<p>The results of alpha diversity revealed only substantial changes in richness in the nasopharyngeal microbiome associated with moderate and severe symptoms. Although most of the studies have proposed that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with lower microbial diversity in nasopharyngeal samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], others did not find differences in alpha diversity composition among groups with different symptomatology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. This could be explained by the diverse methods of sample collection, and also the SARS-CoV-2 variant and the treatment with antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>].</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the present study, beta diversity analysis showed that in both types of samples, every group of patients presented distinctly differentiated clusters. As previously reported, COVID-19 disease severity is more dependent on the presence or absence of certain bacteria rather than alterations in bacterial diversity and richness [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. This argument was supported by the characterization of bacterial microbiota composition at phyla and genera levels. In nasopharyngeal swabs, the abundance of <italic>Bacteroidota</italic> and <italic>Actinobacteriota</italic> was reduced compared to mild patients, which goes in accordance with previous reports where these bacteria have been previously linked to a better prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, since can exert beneficial effects by preventing respiratory diseases, including COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. Moreover, the abundance of <italic>Bacillota</italic> and <italic>Pesudomonadota</italic> was increased in patients with severe symptomatology, thus supporting previous studies in which higher counts of <italic>Bacillota</italic> (<italic>Staphylococcus</italic> sp. and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> sp.) and <italic>Pesudomonadota</italic> (<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp.) were associated with moderate and severe symptoms of COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>].</p>
<p>Regarding genera composition, <italic>Alistipes</italic> and <italic>Muribaculaceae</italic> were highly abundant in patients with mild symptoms. These bacteria have been well characterised in gut microbiota, but little is known about their presence in nasopharyngeal microbiota. Different experimental studies in mice have suggested their role in viral infections. Thus, <italic>Muribaculaceae</italic> was found in the lung microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice that were treated with a selective inhibitor of the main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. In the case of <italic>Alistipes,</italic> in a study conducted in children infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RVS), its abundance was reduced in the nasopharyngeal microbiota in comparison with non infected subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. Overall, these genera could be associated with a protective role against viral infection, and their higher presence in nasopharyngeal samples from mild COVID-19 patients could prevent the progression to severe disease. In contrast, the increased presence of other genera, such as <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>, <italic>Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus</italic> and <italic>Veillonella</italic>, was associated with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is supported by previous studies in which these genera were associated with both disease severity and systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. In addition, higher abundance of <italic>Enterococcus</italic> was observed in severe patients, thus confirming other studies in critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>].</p>
<p>On the contrary, findings at phylum level in stool samples did not reveal notable modifications among patient groups. However, in mild ill patients, different genera from <italic>Clostridia</italic> class (<italic>Clostridia</italic>, <italic>Coprococcus</italic>, <italic>Dorea</italic>, <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, <italic>Roseburia</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcus</italic>), and <italic>Barnesiella</italic> were identified as highly abundant. While the class <italic>Clostridia</italic> was associated with a reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients and in those who recovered from the infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>], <italic>Barnesiella</italic> prevents colonisation by antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as <italic>Enterococcus</italic>, which has been reported as a frequent cause of systemic infection in critically ill COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. Thus, the reduction of gut abundance of <italic>Barnesiella</italic> and <italic>Clostridia</italic> members could be associated with more severe symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the specific genera detected in the severe illness group, <italic>Lachnocostridum</italic>, <italic>Anaerococcus</italic> and <italic>Peptoniphilus</italic>, have been previously recognised as opportunistic pathogens, which could induce gut inflammation and contribute to a poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>].</p>
<p>Considering the variations observed in both nasopharyngeal and gut microbiota composition and their miscellaneous effects, the identification of specific bacteria could be used as a biomarker to predict COVID-19 severity. Accordingly, the present study has identified unique ASVs for the different severities of COVID-19. For nasopharyngeal samples, species belonging to the genus <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> (<italic>L. fermentum</italic> or <italic>L. reuteri</italic>) or <italic>Prevotella</italic> (<italic>P. pallens, P. ori</italic> and <italic>P. shahii</italic>) have been pinpointed. Interestingly, mild patients have also shown a higher content of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, which could also contribute to the host defence against viral infection at early stages, as reported in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. In the case of <italic>Prevotella</italic> sp., its role in COVID-19 infection has not been clearly elucidated, but previously published microbiome analysis has revealed that its abundance was higher in mild patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. Nevertheless others have suggested that it could be a biomarker of critical phenotype in COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. It is interesting to highlight that <italic>Anaerococcus prevotii</italic> was one of the species exclusively found in stools in mild patients. This microorganism has already been linked to lower inflammation in COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. Conversely, <italic>Coprobacillus cateniformis</italic> was only found in severe patients, and could be involved in the development of a worse condition in these patients through ACE2 upregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Even though these bacteria were found to be unique for each group, LEfSe was performed to obtain specific severity prognostic biomarkers depending on the abundance threshold. Therefore, for mild patients, <italic>Burkholderia</italic> and <italic>Paraburkholderia</italic> were identified in nasopharyngeal swabs and <italic>B. coprocola</italic> and <italic>R. bicirculans</italic> in stool samples. Although the information regarding the first two species in humans is limited, a few studies have reported their presence in the commensal human microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. Contrarily, <italic>B. coprocola</italic> and <italic>R. bicirculans</italic> have been found in both healthy and COVID-19 patients, being the abundance of <italic>R. bicirculans</italic> reduced in infected subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>].</p>
<p>Correspondingly, in patients with moderate symptoms, <italic>P. veronii</italic> was detected in nasopharyngeal samples whereas <italic>P. stercorea</italic>, <italic>B. cellulosilyficus</italic>, <italic>B. stercoris</italic> and <italic>P. copri</italic> were identified in stool samples. In general, these findings agree with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. <italic>Xu et al.</italic> found that infected patients showed higher abundance of <italic>B. cellulosilyficus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>], whereas <italic>B. stercoris</italic> and <italic>P. copri</italic> were associated with ACE2 upregulation and increased proinflammatory cytokine production, respectively, in COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>].</p>
<p>Likewise, in critically ill patients, the biomarkers detected for nasopharyngeal microbiota were <italic>M. salivarium</italic>, <italic>P. dentalis</italic>, <italic>Leptotrichia</italic> and <italic>H. parainfluenzae,</italic> while, in stool samples, <italic>Escherichia</italic> sp., <italic>E. durans</italic>, <italic>A. Onderdonkii, P. timonensis</italic> and <italic>P. bivia</italic> were the species recognised as biomarkers. Both <italic>P. bivia</italic> and <italic>P. timonensis</italic> have been defined as unique microorganisms in COVID-19 patients microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>], whilst a higher abundance of <italic>M. salivarium</italic>, <italic>H. parainfluenzae</italic> and <italic>E. durans</italic> were related to poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>]. When considering <italic>A. onderdonkii</italic>, it is a short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria that has been reported to be inversely associated with COVID-19 severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]; however, there are conflicting evidences regarding its pathogenicity that indicate that <italic>A. onderdonkii</italic> may have protective effects against some diseases, including COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Nonetheless, considering that <italic>Zuo T et al.</italic> employed a different methodology to analyse microbiota composition from stool samples, <italic>A. onderdonkii</italic> could be considered as a biomarker of severe condition in SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects.</p>
<p>Of note, the use of these bacteria as biomarkers of severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection is further supported by the fact that these species exhibited positive correlations with critical clinical variables mentioned above. Specifically, possible severe biomarkers from nasopharyngeal samples such as <italic>M. salivarium</italic>, <italic>H. parainfluenzae</italic> and <italic>P. dentalis</italic> showed a negative correlation towards lymphocytes count. This also happens for stool severe biomarkers <italic>P. bivia</italic> and <italic>P. timonensis.</italic> As it is well established that microbiota can modify blood cells count [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>], it would not be a surprise that these bacteria could promote COVID-19 severity by lowering lymphocyte count. In addition, <italic>P. bivia</italic> and <italic>P. timonensis</italic> showed positive correlation with ferritin, CRP and D-dimer levels, as well as cardiomyopathy and respiratory rates. Several studies have revealed both the relationship between CRP levels, gut microbiota and COVID-19 severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>], as well as the positive correlation of specific bacteria with D-dimer, CRP and the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>].</p>
<p>Finally, although the composition of the nasal and faecal microbiota in COVID-19 patients has been previously studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], the interaction between these microbiotas has not been extensively evaluated. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between specific bacteria from nasopharyngeal and stool samples, confirming a correlation between the abundances of species in these different sample types. Concretely, a strong positive correlation between <italic>P. timonensis</italic> (in stool samples) towards <italic>P. dentalis</italic> and <italic>M. salivarium</italic> (in nasopharyngeal samples) was found in severe patients. To maximise the potential use of these biomarkers, the ratio of the abundance of these species was also significantly increased within the highest severity of this condition. As a result, the ratio proposed in this study could be used as a novel predictor to identify critically ill COVID-19 patients as the ratio <italic>Bacillota</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> has been used as a marker of dysbiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>]. In this case, the ratio <italic>P. timonensis</italic>/<italic>P. dentalis</italic> and <italic>P. timonensis /M. Salivarium</italic> could be a prognostic tool for severe SARS-CoV-2, and its increase could be associated with a higher risk COVID-19 severity development.</p>

<title>Subject recruitment and sample collection</title>
<p>A multicenter prospective observational cohort study was carried out between September 2020 and July 2021. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited from the University Hospital San Cecilio, the University Hospital Virgen de las Nieves, and the Primary Care centres, Salvador Caballero and Las Gabias in Granada (Spain). These patients were Caucasian and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) performed on nasopharyngeal swabs collected by healthcare practitioners. No confounding factors such as other viral infections were present. Patients were classified in three groups based on severity profile following the described guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]; mild (n=24), moderate (n=51) and severe/critical (n=31). Mild illness includes individuals who have any of the various signs and symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, loss of taste and smell) but do not have shortness of breath, dyspnoea, or abnormal chest imaging. Moderate illness includes patients that show fever and respiratory symptoms with radiological findings of pneumonia. Severe/critical illness includes patients with any of the following criteria: respiratory distress (≥30 breaths/min), oxygen saturation ≤93% at rest, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) ≤300 mmHg, respiratory failure and requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, and with other organ failures that required intensive care unit (ICU) care.</p>
<p>Nasopharyngeal swabs and stools samples from patients were collected by healthcare staff in the moderate and severe/critical cohorts, while the patients of the mild cohort provided stools self-sampled at home. Stools and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected in collection tubes containing preservative media (OMNIgene®•GUT, DNAGENOTEK®, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) and stored at −80°C until processing.</p>

<title>Microbial DNA extraction, library preparation and next generation sequencing</title>
<p>For all faecal and nasopharyngeal samples, DNA was isolated according to the modified protocol reported by <italic>Rodríguez-Nogales et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] using Qiagen Allprep PowerFecal DNA kit (Qiagen, Germany). DNA was quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (12640ES60, Yeason Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) and total DNA was amplified by targeting variable regions V3-V4 of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene. Quality control of amplified products was achieved by running a high-throughput Invitrogen 96-well-E-gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). PCR products from the same samples were pooled in one plate and normalised with the high-throughput Invitrogen SequalPrep 96-well Plate kit. Pool samples were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq.</p>

<p>Paired end reads quality was checked with FastQC software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Trimming of adapters and filtering of low quality sequences was performed with Trimmomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Filtered reads were further processed with QIIME2 software (open access, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) by employing DADA2 software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] to carry out denoising steps to obtain amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). SILVA reference database (138 99% full length) was used for taxonomic assignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Microbiota results were further analyze with the help of different R packages. Alpha and beta diversity as well as relative abundance were appraised with the <italic>Phyloseq</italic> package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Beta diversity differences were obtained with a Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) included in the <italic>Vegan</italic> package (<italic>Eulerr</italic> along with <italic>microbiomeutilities</italic> package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] was utilised for constructing Venn diagrams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>].

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All data presented were analyzed and visualized using R software. For numerical clinical variables, normality and homoscedasticity were assessed using the shapiro.test and leveneTest functions from the <italic>stats</italic> and <italic>car</italic> package, respectively. Data were displayed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for normally distributed variables, whereas median and interquartile range (IQR) were used for variables with non-normal distributions.</p>
<p>Statistical differences were evaluated using ANOVA for parametric data or Kruskal-Wallis test for non-parametric data, both available in the <italic>stats</italic> package. When significant differences were identified, post-hoc group comparisons were conducted using Tukey’s method through the TukeyHSD function for ANOVA and Dunn’s test via the dunnTest function from the <italic>FSA</italic> package for Kruskal-Wallis.</p>
<p>Categorical variables were expressed as percentages, and statistical significance was determined using Fisher’s exact test with the fisher.test function from the <italic>stats</italic> package. Finally, for correlation analysis, Spearman’s correlation coefficient was employed for non-normally distributed variables, while Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used for normally distributed variables. The cor function from the <italic>stats</italic> package was used to calculate these coefficients, and the <italic>corrplot</italic> package was employed for visualization. Statistical significance was defined as a p-value of less than 0.05. To illustrate group differences, different letters (a, b or c) were used to denote statistically significant differences among groups.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This inter-individual variability between the COVID-19 patients could contribute to the different symptomatology observed. This study has identified a correlation between changes in the nasopharyngeal and stool microbiota with COVID-19 severity. A novel biomarker linked to severity of COVID-19 infection has been described based on changes in the abundance of bacterial species in nasopharyngeal and faecal samples. This knowledge can support the development of biomarkers to gauge disease severity and, also, the design of novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate adverse outcomes. Further investigations are imperative to explore how the association between nasopharyngeal and faecal microbiota can be modulated to uncover its role in enhancing immune health, preventing or treating SARS-CoV-2 infections, and fostering immunity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The research study under review investigated the relationship between gut and identified potential biomarkers derived from the nasopharyngeal and gut microbiota-based that could aid predicting COVID-19 severity. The study reported significant changes in the richness and Shannon diversity index in nasopharyngeal microbiome associated with severe symptoms.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study successfully identified differences in the microbiome diversity that could indicate or predict disease severity. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated a link between individual nasopharyngeal organisms and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The density of the nasopharyngeal organism was shown to be a potential predictors of severity of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>How the microbial composition of the human body is influenced by and influences disease progression is an important topic. For people with COVID-19, symptomatic progression and deterioration can be difficult to predict. This manuscript attempts to associate the nasal and fecal microbiomes of COVID-19 patients with the severity of disease symptoms, with the goal of identifying microbial markers that can predict disease outcomes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Analysis of microbiomes from two distinct anatomical locations and across three distinct patient groups is a substantial undertaking. How these microbiomes influence and are influenced by COVID-19 disease progression is an important question. In particular, the putative biomarker identified here could be of clinical value with additional research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The primary weaknesses of this analysis is the relatively low sample size for analyzing disease subsets and moderate correlation values observed for putative biomarkers. Regardless, this data can be used to inform future studies aiming to understand the contribution of multifactorial dysbiosis to COVID-19 disease progression.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p><bold>Public reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer 1</bold></p>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude to Reviewer 1 for providing a thorough summary of our work and highlighting its strengths. With regards to the weaknesses, we are committed to improve the manuscript by performing the necessary changes. First, we will specify the exact p-value in all cases.</p>
<p>Regarding the discussion section, we acknowledge the feedback regarding its potential confusion. In line with the reviewer's suggestion, we will reduce the literature review and highlight our findings.</p>
<p>Finally, for the preprint we did not include cofounders such as HIV infection and ethnicity as our study population did not exhibit viral infections and comprised only Hispanic individuals. We will make a more thorough description of the population of study and address these characteristics explicitly in both the methods section and the initial part of the results.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer 2</bold></p>
<p>We appreciate and thank reviewer 2 for the commentaries. Although it is true that several papers have described the role of microbiome in COVID-19 severity, we firmly believe that our current work stands out. There is not much information related to this association in Mediterranean countries, especially in the south of Spain. In addition, most of the studies only describe microbiota composition in stool or nasopharyngeal samples separately, without investigating any potential relationships between them as we do.</p>
<p>(1) We agree with the reviewer idea of a limited sample size. We faced the challenge of collecting the samples during the peak of COVID-19 pandemia. Thus, doctors and nurses were overwhelmed and not always available for carrying out patient recruitment following the inclusion criteria. Despite these constraints, we ensured that all included samples met our specified inclusion criteria and were from subjects with confirmed symptomatology.</p>
<p>In addition, our main goal was to identify whether severity of the disease could be assessed through microbiota composition. Therefore we did not include a healthy group. Despite not having a large N, our results should be reproducible as they are supported by statistical analysis.</p>
<p>(2) We thank reviewer commentary, and since our original sentence may have lacked clarity, we intend to modify it to ensure it conveys the intended meaning more effectively.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we remain confident in the significance of our findings. Not only have we found correlation between microbiota and COVID severity, but we have also described how specific bacteria from each condition is associated with key biochemical parameters of clinical COVID infection.</p>
<p>(3) We appreciate the feedback provided by the reviewer. In this case, we have performed 16S analysis due to its cost-effectiveness compared to metagenomic approaches. Furthermore, 16S analysis has undergone refinements that ensure comprehensive coverage and depth, along with standardized analysis protocols. Unlike 16S, metagenomic approaches lack software tools such as QIIME that facilitate standardization of analysis and, thus, reduce reproducibility of results.</p>
<p>(4) We sincerely appreciate this insightful suggestion. simply listing associations between both microbiomes and COVID-19 severity could not be enough, we intend to discuss how microbiota composition may be linked to the mechanisms underlying COVID-19 pathogenesis in our discussion.</p>
<p>(5) We are grateful for the constructive criticism and intend to rewrite our abstract to enhance clarity. Additionally, we will thoroughly review all figures and their descriptions to ensure accuracy and comprehensibility.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer 3</bold></p>
<p>We acknowledge the annotations made by reviewer 3 and are committed to addressing all identified weaknesses to enhance the quality of our work. Our idea is to modify the methods section and figures to make them easier to understand.</p>
<p>Specifically, in the case of Figure 1, we recognize an error in the description of the Bray-Curtis test. We appreciate the commentary and we will make the necessary changes. Moreover, there is another observation related to Figure 1 description. We are going to modify it in order to gain accuracy.</p>
<p>For figure 2 we are planning to add a supplementary table showing the abundance of detected genus. Nevermind, we will also update the manuscript text to provide clarification on how we obtained this result.</p>
<p>Regarding the clarification about &quot;1% abundance,&quot; we want to emphasize that we are referring to relative abundance, where 1 represents 100%. To avoid confusion, we will explicitly state this in both the methods section and figure descriptions. Besides, it is true that the statistical test employed for the analysis is not mentioned in the figure description and we recognize that the image may be difficult to interpret. Therefore, we will modify the text and a supplementary table displaying the abundance and p values is going to be added.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we agree with the reviewer's suggestion to investigate whether the bacteria identified as potential biomarkers for each condition are specific to their respective severity index or if there is a threshold. Thus, we will reanalyze the data and include a supplementary table with the abundance of each biomarker for each condition. We will also place greater emphasis on these results in our discussion.</p>
<p>Finally, in response to the reviewer's suggestion, we are going to go through the nasopharyngeal-fecal axis part in the discussion. It is well described that COVID-19 induces a dysbiosis in both microbiomes. Consequently, we understand that the ratio we have described could be an interesting tool for assessing COVID severity development as it considers alterations in both environments. However, we acknowledge that there may be room for improvement in clarifying the significance of this intriguing finding and its implications.</p>
