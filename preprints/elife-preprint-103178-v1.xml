<title>Abstract</title>
<p>By analyzing the single-cell RNA-Seq libraries, the roles of cartilage intermediate layer protein (CILP) and the cartilage intermediate zone in early osteoarthritis (OA) exercise therapy were explored. An early OA rat model was established via a 4-week anterior cruciate ligament transection. The effect of moderate exercise was confirmed using histology, the open-field test, and gait analysis. The response of the cartilage intermediate zone to mechanical stimulation was explored using multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemical staining. Radiomics was used to evaluate the relatively damaged and undamaged areas in the cartilage of patients with OA. CILP was OE and KD in early OA chondrocytes, and quantitative proteomics, yeast one-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation, Nrf2 and ubiquitination assays were used to investigate its mechanism. We found that moderate exercise upregulates CILP in the cartilage intermediate zone. CILP recovers the type II/I collagen, Sox9, and α-SMA expression ratios, and reduces Keap1-Nrf2 dimer stability, inhibiting Nrf2 ubiquitination and promoting Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Nrf2 nuclear translocation activates SLC7A11, HO-1, GPX4, and SOD-1 expression, decreases MDA content, and increases GSH content, inhibiting chondrocyte ferroptosis and promoting fibrocartilage hyalinization. In conclusion, the exercise-induced cartilage intermediate zone and CILP-Keap1-Nrf2 axis inhibit hyaline cartilage fibrosis and chondrocyte ferroptosis to alleviate early OA.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common chronic joint disease and affects approximately 530 million people worldwide.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] Early OA may be a reversible condition,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] and effective intervention has a profound impact on its prognosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] The World Health Organization recommends exercise therapy as the first-line treatment for early OA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] In our previous studies, we found that moderate-intensity exercise therapy for early knee OA provided a window of opportunity to slow the OA process.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] An in-depth study on exercise therapy can help develop precision medicine for treating early OA.</p>
<p>In our previous work, we found that cartilage and chondrocytes play important roles in maintaining the biomechanical function of the knee joint during exercise therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] Articular cartilage exhibits great heterogeneity and complex microarchitecture, comprising three anatomic zones: the superficial, intermediate, and deep zones,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] which endow the tissue with biphasic mechanical properties to withstand shearing forces and compressive loading.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] Chondrocytes in the intermediate zone were hypertrophic, slightly round in shape, and clustered together. Type II collagen fibers are randomly distributed to withstand pressure from different directions because this region is subjected to compressive and shear stresses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] Exercise-mediated mechanical stimuli are transmitted through the superficial zone to the intermediate zone, which plays the primary load-bearing and compression-resistance roles.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] As a mechanosensitive zone, the cartilage intermediate zone plays a key role in early OA exercise therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]</p>
<p>Using single-cell transcriptome profiling to determine differential gene expression within the early OA exercise therapy, we identified a highly expressed gene that encodes cartilage intermediate layer protein (CILP), which is expressed in the intermediate zone of articular cartilage and is linked to cartilage degenerative diseases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] In our preliminary experiments, we identified CILP as an important protein in OA treatment that affects the intermediate zone of the articular cartilage through mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1B, C</xref>). However, the specific underlying mechanism remains unclear.</p>
<p>In our pseudo-temporal analysis of the pathological process in OA cartilage, cartilage fibrosis was found to play an important role in early OA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1D, E, F, G</xref>). Hyaline cartilage is the most common type of cartilage and has excellent mechanical properties, mainly acting as a load-bearing structure and lubricating joint movement.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] In early OA, the articular cartilage surface is damaged, and fibrocartilage forms owing to the loss of thick collagen fibers and the formation of type I collagen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] The ability of fibrocartilage to bear weight and resist mechanical wear is far less than that of hyaline cartilage, and fibrocartilage in joints leads to the further progression of OA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] Given the anti-fibrosis effect of CILP on other diseases,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] it is necessary to investigate the in situ transformation of fibrocartilage into hyaline cartilage via exercise-induced CILP, namely the “hyalinization of fibrocartilage” as an important principle of cartilage repair in OA.</p>
<p>Chondrocyte death can also lead to the excessive secretion and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, resulting in hyaline cartilage fibrosis in early OA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] Ferroptosis is a programmed cell death driven by Fe<sup>2+-</sup>dependent lipid peroxidation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] Our previous study showed that ferroptosis is involved in the pathogenesis and development of OA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key regulator of antioxidant responses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] Under oxidative stress, Nrf2 is stabilized and initiates a multistep activation pathway, including nuclear translocation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] The Keap1-Nrf2 pathway is critical for chondrocyte ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2</xref>). It is necessary to investigate whether exercise-induced CILP affects chondrocyte ferroptosis and cartilage fibrosis via the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway.</p>
<p>In this study, we determined the therapeutic effects of moderate-intensity exercise on early OA. We investigated the role of the intermediate zone of articular cartilage in early OA exercise therapy. We also demonstrated the important role of exercise-induced CILP during the hyalinization of fibrocartilage. In vitro, we identified the molecular mechanism by which CILP inhibited Nrf2 ubiquitination and promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation through the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway, subsequently alleviating chondrocyte ferroptosis and promoting the hyalinization of fibrocartilage. This study highlights the potential of targeting the exercise induced CILP-Keap1-Nrf2 axis and the cartilage intermediate zone to mitigate cartilage degeneration and promote joint health.</p>

<title>CILP was upregulated in cartilage of OA-affected SD rats after exercise therapy</title>
<p>The synovium, cartilage, and subchondral bone were analyzed using single-cell transcriptome sequencing. The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1B</xref>) identified eight distinct cell clusters, including chondrocytes, fibroblasts, B cells, macrophages, and NK cells. However, this study primarily focused on the differential gene expression in chondrocytes. In the OAM group, 170 genes were downregulated, and 222 genes were upregulated compared with those in the OA group. The t-SNE projection and volcano plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1C</xref>) highlighted the top 9 differentially expressed genes between the OAM and OA groups. CILP expression was upregulated in the OAM group.</p>

<title>Hyaline cartilage fibrosis is pathological change of chondrocytes in early OA</title>
<p>To investigate the trajectory of chondrocytes in OA further, a pseudotemporal analysis was used to simulate the pathological process in OA chondrocytes. Starting from node 1, the chondrocytes showed phenotypic changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1D</xref>). We identified seven chondrocyte subtypes throughout the OA pathology, including Fc, Homc, Htc, and preFC. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1D, E</xref>, and <bold>F</bold>, the Fc subtype was highly expressed in the OA group, and the cluster was in the early stage of OA chondrocytes (node 1). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1G</xref>, we analyzed the gene expression of each chondrocyte subtype and found that the type I collagen content of the Fc subgroup increased, indicating cartilage fibrosis. Taken together, these results indicate that hyaline cartilage fibrosis is a pathological change in chondrocytes during the early stages of OA.</p>

<title>CILP is downregulated in damaged areas of articular cartilage in clinical patients</title>
<p>The damaged and relatively undamaged cartilaginous areas of patients with OA were divided using radiomics. Histological analyses of damaged and undamaged areas were performed in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The OARSI score was used to confirm that the undamaged area had more intact cartilage than the damaged area. Using western blotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) and immunohistochemistry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) to detect proteins in the cartilage undamaged (U) and damaged (D) regions, we found that the ratio of type II collagen to type I collagen and Sox9 expression in the U region was significantly higher than that in the D region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, E</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F and G</xref>, CILP was downregulated in the damaged areas of the cartilage in clinical patients.</p>

<title>Moderate-intensity treadmill exercise can increase expression of CILP in cartilage intermediate zone of SD rats and can restore imaging and histological characteristics and subjective and objective functions of knee joints in SD rats</title>
<p>We confirmed the occurrence of early OA in our rat model by histological evaluation. The OA group showed superficial zone edema and/or fibrillation (abrasion), focal superficial matrix condensation, or slight discontinuity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Histological analysis based on the OARSI scores showed that the OA group of each tibia or femoral joint were between 0–12 score, which indicated early OA, and the OAM group showed therapeutic effects on the tibiofemoral joints (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>

<p>Digital radiography revealed that the OAM group had a better articular surface and fewer osteophytes than the OA group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Using gross images, we observed surface roughening, fibrillation, and fissures, which are typical early OA pathological changes, in the OA group compared with the CG. However, the OAM group showed alleviated symptoms compared with those of the OA group. The macroscopic score was also alleviated in the OAM group compared to that in the OA group (<italic>P&lt;</italic> 0.001) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). We further evaluated the SD rats using H&amp;E and toluidine blue staining. We found that the OA group exhibited cartilage damage and hypocellularity compared to the CG group; OAM displayed a more complete and smoother cartilage surface compared to OA. IHC staining revealed that the optical density of type II/I collagen was higher in the CG and OAM groups than in the OA group. We further noticed that Sox9, GPX4, and CILP levels were higher in patients with OAM than in those with OA.</p>
<p>An open-field test was used to investigate the effect of moderate-intensity exercise on the subjective recovery of knee function (spontaneous activity) in SD rats. The total distance, average speed, central zone exploration times, and motion trail were recorded (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Compared with the CG group, the OA group showed significantly reduced pain thresholds and spontaneous activity. Compared with the OA group, OAM significantly increased the total distance traveled, average speed (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), and central zone exploration times (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>).</p>
<p>Gait analysis was performed to investigate the effect of moderate-intensity exercise on objective knee function recovery (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The regularity index and rat standing time of the left and right hind limbs were lower in the OA group than those in the CG, whereas OAM recovered these indices compared to the OA group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The OAM group also showed a smaller paw print position than that in the OA group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The results of the gait analysis showed that the rear limb coordination of the OAM group was greatly improved (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). In the western blot, OAM recovered the ratio of type II/I collagen, Sox9, and α-SMA expression and also increased anti-ferroptosis protein SLC7A11, HO-1, GPX4, and SOD-1 expression levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D, I</xref>).</p>
<p>IF was used to investigate the location of CILP in the cartilage zone, and we found that the intermediate zone had the highest CILP relative fluorescence intensity (P &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). In the IHC evaluation, the expression of CILP in the intermediate zone was highest in the CG, OA, and OAM groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). In addition, the intermediate zone of the OAM group showed the highest CILP expression, and the OA group showed the lowest.</p>

<title>Cartilage intermediate zone acts as a mechanical-stimulation-sensitive zone in exercise therapy</title>
<p>Using multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemical staining (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref>), we compared the differences between the zones (superficial, intermediate, and deep) and between the groups (CG, OA, and OAM) of each zone.

<p>During chondrocyte passage, the adherent morphology of the chondrocytes gradually changed from completely irregular polygons to slender spindle shapes.

<title>CILP competitively binds to Keap1 protein sites and reduces stability of Keap1-Nrf2 dimer, decreases Nrf2 ubiquitination, and promotes Nrf2 nuclear translocation</title>
<p>To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of CILP on chondrocytes, we performed a proteomic analysis of intracellular protein expression following CILP overexpression. Volcano plots showed the differentially expressed proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2A</xref>), selected according to the criteria of (log2 |fold-change| ≥ 1.2 and <italic>P&lt;</italic> 0.05). The Keap1 protein was enriched in the OE-CILP group compared to the G3 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2B</xref>). Subcellular localization showed that Keap1 was enriched in the cytoplasm of chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2C</xref>). Following quantitative proteomics, we utilized GO functional annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses to explore the potential signaling pathways interacting with Keap1. Based on the protein function cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2D</xref>), we found that CILP interacted with Keap1 and affected Nrf2, affecting ferroptosis and promoting early OA cartilage fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2E, F</xref>).</p>
<p>In our study, the potential binding sites for KEAP1 and CILP were identified using yeast one-hybrid assays. CILP promotes KEAP1/NRF2 dissociation by competing with Nrf2 for binding to the Arg483 site of KEAP1. Co-IP results showed a more positive interaction between CILP and Keap1 in the OE-CILP group than in the KD-CILP group. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, the Keap1 protein was detected in IP-CILP in the OE-CILP group, and no Keap1 protein was observed in the band of the IgG-binding protein. In addition, IB-CILPs were detected in the IP-Keap1 group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation results also showed that the interaction between Keap1 and Nrf2 was decreased in the OE-CILP group. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, Nrf2 protein was detected in the IP-Keap1 in the KD-CILP group, and less Nrf2 protein was observed in the band of the OE-CILP group binding protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, the trend of IB-Keap1 expression detected in the IP-Nrf2 group was similar to that described above (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>, Nrf2 ubiquitination decreased in the OE-CILP group, while Nrf2 ubiquitination increased in the KD group. In addition, OE-CILP accumulated NRF2 that had translocated to the nucleus. However, KD-CILP reversed this trend (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>).</p>

<title>CILP ameliorates chondrocyte ferroptosis through Keap1-Nrf2 pathway in vitro</title>
<p>Using western blotting, we found that the OE-CILP group increased the ratio of type II/I collagen, Sox9, and α-SMA expression and also increased the expression levels of anti-ferroptosis proteins SLC7A11, HO-1, GPX4, and SOD-1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, B</xref>). However, these therapeutic effects could be reversed by KD-01, especially KD-01 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C, D</xref>). Confocal microscopy revealed a decrease in intracellular ROS levels in the OE-CILP group. Flow cytometric analysis supported this result (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). There was also an increased mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>) and decreased intracellular Fe2+ levels in the OE-CILP group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>). In addition, TEM showed ferroptosis in the CILP-knockdown group, mainly characterized by smaller mitochondria, increased membrane density, and reduced mitochondrial cristae. OE-CILP ameliorated chondrocyte ferroptosis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study confirmed that moderate-intensity exercise has a therapeutic effect on early OA in terms of histology, animal behavior (open field test), and subjective and objective knee function (gait analysis), highlighting the positive role of the articular cartilage intermediate zone in response to mechanical stimulation in exercise therapy for early OA. We are the first to report that moderate-intensity exercise upregulates CILP in the articular cartilage intermediate zone to promote hyalinization of the fibrocartilage and alleviate early OA. We also observed that CILP competitively bound to Keap1 protein and reduced the stability of the Keap1-Nrf2 dimer, reducing the degree of Nrf2 ubiquitination and promoting Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Nrf2 nuclear translocation activates SLC7A11, HO-1, GPX4, and SOD-1 expression, decreases MDA content, and increases GSH content in chondrocytes, ultimately inhibiting chondrocyte ferroptosis. Finally, we conclude that the exercise-induced CILP-Keap1-Nrf2 axis mitigates early OA through fibrocartilage hyalinization and suppressing chondrocyte ferroptosis.</p>
<p>This study focused on early OA. The early symptoms of OA are relatively insidious but gradually worsen with disease progression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] Reduced patient compliance owing to pain leads to limited treatment strategies. Early OA is a reversible process that is less affected by pain, and personalized exercise prescriptions can be developed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] To establish the early OA model, we followed Pritzker et al. and Maier et al.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]who identified early OA with the OARSI score (0–12 each tibia or femoral side), matrix staining depletion within the upper third of the cartilage, and reduction of the cartilage thickness and collagen content. The 4-week ACLT was used to establish an early OA rat model, which followed the above criteria and showed a decrease in cartilage type II collagen and loss of cartilage aggrecan.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] Chondrocytes are vulnerable to dedifferentiation during in vitro passage, leading to fibrosis and the mechanical degradation of newly formed cartilage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] We used passaged chondrocytes that were dedifferentiated through cultivation, which was evident from the loss of proteoglycans, decreased COL-II deposition, and increased synthesis of COL-I compared to primary chondrocytes (G0).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] Chondrocytes shift from round to fibroblastic shape with increasing passage number. Several molecular differentiation markers have been identified. Among them, type II/type I collagen, aggrecan, and Sox9 levels decrease during the dedifferentiation process and are often used to assess chondrogenic loss (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Compared with primary chondrocytes, the ratio of type II/type I collagen decreased from 5.85 to 1.63 in Passage 3 chondrocytes (G3). By comparing the cell modeling using the inducer TGF-β1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] for joint fibrosis, we found that P3 cells were close to the mild cartilage fibrosis model induced by low concentration TGF-β1. The use of dedifferentiation induced by the passage of chondrocytes to mimic the fibrosis of early OA cartilage is also an innovative aspect of this study.</p>
<p>In our pseudo-temporal analysis of the pathological process in OA cartilage, disorders in the synthesis and catabolism of chondrocytes led to cartilage damage and degeneration. Hyaline chondrocytes begin to proliferate actively, transform, or dedifferentiate into cells with a fibroblast phenotype and form cell clusters in the cartilage lesion area to adapt to changes in the cartilage microenvironment. Fibrotic cartilage is characterized by dramatic changes in cell shape, metabolism, and cytoskeletal structure, resulting in the increased synthesis of type I collagen (collagen I), which impairs the biological function of cartilage tissue by forming fibrocartilage without mechanical capacity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] Decreased expression of type II collagen and increased expression of type I collagen are the main features of articular chondrocyte dedifferentiation and fibrosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] Moreover, chondrocyte death and the abnormal catabolism and metabolism of the cartilage matrix caused by ferroptosis can lead to cartilage defects and damage. During cartilage repair after injury, the appearance of fibrotic cartilage can further aggravate the symptoms of OA. In this study, we used a ferroptosis activator to interfere with the therapeutic effect of CILP and found that ferroptosis activation aggravated cartilage fibrosis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Combined with previous studies,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>] the joint study of chondrocyte ferroptosis and cartilage fibrosis after cartilage injury was the focus of the present study.</p>
<p>In this study, the cartilage was found to be heterogeneous and anisotropic, with three regions having different compositions and structural mechanical properties. Chondrocytes in the superficial zone were more likely to exhibit a fibrocartilage phenotype due to the higher amount of frictional type I collagen caused by frequent joint activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Chondrocytes in the superficial area were oblate and scattered on the cartilage surface. Type II collagen fibers are laterally distributed to withstand wear and stress (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>] Lubrication and painless sliding of the joint occur in the superficial zone, whereas the intermediate zone transfers the load applied in the superficial zone to the deep zone of the cartilage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] Collagen fibers in the deep zone are arranged perpendicularly to the articular surface (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] The intermediate zone accounts for approximately 40–60% of articular cartilage thickness; chondrocytes are rounded and medium in shape, and collagen fibers are arranged randomly and perpendicular to the articular surface. The main matrix components in the intermediate zone are type II collagen (Col2a1) and aggrecan (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] Moreover, the aggrecan content in the MZ reached the maximum level, and collagen type II was highly expressed and randomly distributed to withstand pressures from different directions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), as this region was subjected to compressive and shear stresses.</p>
<p>We established a moderate-intensity treadmill exercise protocol for exercise therapy for early OA, according to our previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>] We used histological analysis, an open field test, and gait analysis to confirm the therapeutic effect of moderate exercise on early OA in terms of physiological, psychological, subjective, and objective knee function recovery (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Single-cell transcriptome sequencing was performed on the entire knee joint after exercise, and it was found that exercise may affect early OA through CILP in the intermediate zone of the cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>). In the CILP localization experiment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>), we confirmed that CILP was mainly enriched in the intermediate zone and was upregulated by exercise. In the intermediate zone, the ratio of type II/I collagen to aggrecan also significantly increased (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). As a mechanical stress-sensitive zone, the intermediate zone receives mechanical stimulation signals from exercise therapy.</p>
<p>Using proteomic and bioinformatic analyses, we found that CILP affected hyaline cartilage fibrosis and chondrocyte ferroptosis via Keap1. In our study, the potential binding of Keap1 to CILP was identified using yeast one-hybrid assays (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). CILP promotes Keap1/Nrf2 dissociation by competing with Nrf2 to bind to Keap1, decreasing Nrf2 ubiquitination and accumulating Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus. Our current study indicated that the CILP-Keap1-Nrf2 antioxidative signaling pathway is involved in fibrocartilage hyalinization. Hyaline cartilage phenotypes, such as the ratios of type II collagen to type I collagen, Sox9, and α-SMA, were upregulated after CILP intervention. Oxidative stress and the antioxidant system are critical for fibrosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] We also demonstrated that Nrf2-mediated anti-ferroptotic activity depends on the induction of SLC7A11, GPX4, HO-1, and SOD1, which are currently recognized as central repressors of ferroptosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>] This alleviated ferroptosis in chondrocytes by reducing the accumulation of ROS and inhibiting iron overload and lipid peroxidation in the mitochondria (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Taken together, these results indicated that the CILP-Keap1-Nrf2 axis alleviated OA by inhibiting chondrocyte ferroptosis and cartilage fibrosis.</p>
<p>Our study has some limitations. First, the intermediate zone of cartilage as a mechanosensitive zone has not been studied in depth, and we did not extract cartilage in the intermediate zone separately from animal and patient cartilage for analysis. Second, histological and radiographic evaluations of early OA have not yet been clearly established. We used the OARSI scoring system and histological evaluation to eliminate bias as much as possible. Third, the association between hyaline cartilage fibrosis and ferroptosis in chondrocytes has only been preliminarily confirmed and will be further investigated in sequential studies.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, exercise alleviates ferroptosis in chondrocytes and promotes the hyalinization of fibrocartilage by mechanically stimulating the intermediate zone of the cartilage and regulating the CILP-Keap1-Nrf2 axis in this region. This study highlights the different roles of different cartilage subzones in the treatment of early OA using exercise and clarifies the mechanism by which CILP in the mechanosensitive zone (intermediate zone) hyalinizes fibrocartilage in early OA through intracellular signal transduction, which may provide a theoretical basis and reference for exercise therapy for OA.</p>

<title>Radiomics</title>
<p>An Avanto 3.0T MR Scanner (SIEMENS MAGNETON), was used to collect patients’ image with an 8-channel coil for the knee joint. Radiomics was used to predict and classify the cartilage damaged and undamaged areas in MRI images of OA patients. Following the protocol of the previous study, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>] we briefly stated the steps below. All pretreatment MRI images were acquired. Two experienced radiologists (7-year experience in bone and joint MRI reading) manually delineated the region of interest (ROI) using ITK-SNAP (version 3.8.0; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.itksnap.org/">http://www.itksnap.org/</ext-link>). The ROI cover the edge of articular cartilage on coronal T1WI and coronal fat-suppressed PDWI images to generate a three-dimensional ROI of articular cartilage. The feature extraction was performed using the Standardized Environment for Radiomics Analysis (SERA). [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>] All the features were normalized using Z-score normalization. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate the consistency of the extracted image features. Extractions of 623 features showed good reproducibilities (ICCs &gt;0.80). Using maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to reduce the dimensionality of the texture features in MRI. The rad-score was calculated according to the feature weight.</p>
<p>Then, two support vector machine (SVM) models were built using the selected radiomics features to classify the damaged and undamaged regions. Different kernel functions of SVM were tested to find the best performance kernel functions, including linear, radial basis function (RBF), cubic and sigmoid kernel functions. A five-fold cross-validation method was used to train and validate the model.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors examined the function of CLIP in exercise-mediate inhibition of osteoarthritis using an ACL transection rat model. The authors rely on rigorous experimental design and methods to demonstrate that CLIP is downregulated in osteoarthritic cartilage tissue and that CLIP expression can be rescued by moderate treadmill exercise. They further show that activation of Nrf2 signaling occurs through CLIP inhibition of Keap1-Nrf2. The results are novel as they suggest a new role for CLIP in OA pathogenesis. The following points need to be addressed in order to bring additional clarity to this work.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an interesting study that addresses an important global health issue. The significance is high and the work is novel and mechanistic.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A major concern is that a direct link between exercise and CLIP-mediated inhibition of ferroptosis via Keap1-Nrf2 pathway is not supported by the provided data. The ferroptosis studies were performed in vitro, whereas the effect of exercise was demonstrated in an OA animal model. Therefore, the data suggest a potential correlation between CLIP-Keap1-Nrf2 and exercise. This must be described as a limitation in the discussion section. Consequently, the title of the manuscript needs to better reflect the interpretation of these data.</p>
<p>Figure 1: Radiomics data are not described in the text. OARSI scoring of damaged and undamaged sections is not presented in the figure.</p>
<p>Figure 2: Data presentation is very dense in this figure. It is recommended that Figure 2 be split into two figures. Also, the histology and IHC images in Figure 2A are of poor resolution. These data do not sufficiently demonstrate early OA pathology. Clearer images to substantiate the authors' statement need to be provided.</p>
<p>Figure 3: The superficial zone appears to be misrepresented; it should include only the top 2-3 layers of flat chondrocyte cells.</p>
<p>Figure 4: This Figure should be listed as supplementary data. CTS is not spelled out in the legend. Also, a rationale for using low, medium, and high CTS needs to be provided.</p>
<p>Figure 5: Please describe positive and negative controls. Please elaborate on the findings of the yeast hybrid experiment in the results. Please expand KD-02 experimental condition in the legend and results.</p>
<p>Figure 6: Please move Figure S2 into the main Figures and describe the results in section 2.9 which describes ferroptosis.</p>
<p>In the results section, it is recommended that the authors describe all panels of the figures appropriately in sequential order. The authors are advised to provide publication-quality figures and, in some cases, to split figure panels into new figures as well as to ensure that the fonts and data are legible. Finally, the use of non-conventional abbreviations (such as G3 for passage-3 chondrocytes, CG for the control condition, and OE for overexpression) may confuse the readership, and describing each abbreviation when used for the first time is required.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Recent studies indicate a beneficial role for moderate-intensity exercise in early osteoarthritis (OA). This manuscript by Jia et al. investigates the role of cartilage intermediate layer protein (CILP) and moderate exercise in maintaining hyaline cartilage integrity following anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLt) in rats. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of OA and OA+ exercise knee joints from rats at 4 weeks post-ACLt revealed the upregulation of CILP and a higher Col2/Col1 ratio in OA knee chondrocytes from ACLt rats that exercised on a treadmill. CILP was downregulated in the damaged portions, compared to healthy regions of knee cartilage of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. In the rat ACLt model, CILP is downregulated in the OA cartilage but not in OA + exercise cartilage. Using CLIP1 over-expression and knockdown in passage 3 cultures of primary rat chondrocytes, the authors demonstrate that the loss of CILP is associated with higher ROS, lipid peroxidation, and iron content in chondrocytes whereas its overexpression is protective against these changes. CILP binds to Keap1, and its overexpression disrupts Keap1/Nrf2 interaction and attenuates Nrf2 ubiquitination. The authors conclude that exercise protects the articular cartilage intermediate zone and the associated upregulation of CILP facilitates Keap1-Nrf2 interaction to prevent chondrocyte ferroptosis and hyaline cartilage fibrosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is interesting, and the experiments are conducted well. The methodology is well-described. The data presented strongly support the downregulation of CILP in human OA cartilage and its potential role in regulating Keap1/Nrf2 interaction and chondrocyte ferroptosis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The data do not support a role for CILP in exercise-mediated inhibition of hyaline cartilage fibrosis in early OA. The reason for selecting CILP from the ScRNA-seq for further analysis is not clear. The manuscript is put together sloppily. The abstract, introduction, and results were written confusingly, and hard to follow. Some of the figures were confusing as well. Still, the study is interesting.</p>
