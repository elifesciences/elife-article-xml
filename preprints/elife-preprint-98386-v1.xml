<title>Abstract</title><p>Studies on Hippo pathway regulation of tumorigenesis largely center on YAP and TAZ, the transcriptional co-regulators of TEAD. Here, we present an oncogenic mechanism involving VGLL and TEAD fusions that is Hippo pathway-related but YAP/TAZ-independent. We characterize two recurrent fusions, VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2, recently identified in spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma. We demonstrate that, in contrast to VGLL2 and TEAD1, the fusion proteins are strong activators of TEAD-dependent transcription, and their function does not require YAP/TAZ. Furthermore, we identify that VGLL2 and TEAD1 fusions engage specific epigenetic regulation by recruiting histone acetyltransferase p300 to control TEAD-mediated transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes. We showed that small molecule p300 inhibition can suppress fusion proteins-induced oncogenic transformation both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Overall, our study reveals a molecular basis for VGLL involvement in cancer and provides a framework for targeting tumors carrying VGLL, TEAD, or NCOA translocations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hippo signaling, originally identified in Drosophila as an organ size control pathway, has emerged as a critical developmental pathway whose dysregulation contributes to the development and progression of a variety of human diseases including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zheng and Pan 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Calses et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kulkarni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Piccolo et al., 2023</xref>). In the mammalian Hippo pathway, activation of the core kinase cascade, which comprises the macrophage stimulating 1/2 (MST1/2) and large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2 (LATS1/2) kinases, leads to phosphorylation, cytosolic retention, and degradation of the key transcriptional coactivators, YAP and TAZ. Upon Hippo pathway inactivation, YAP and TAZ translocate into the nucleus and interact with the TEAD family of transcription factors, thereby inducing downstream gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zheng and Pan 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Totaro et al., 2018</xref>). Although the Hippo pathway has been implicated in human cancers, mutations or deletions of the pathway components, such as the MST1/2 or LATS1/2 kinases, are rarely detected in cancers. The focus on Hippo involvement in tumorigenesis has been on the transcriptional co-activators, YAP and TAZ, whose up-regulation or nuclear accumulation has been reported in various cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Piccolo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Thompson 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Franklin et al., 2023</xref>). In addition, recent studies identified YAP and TAZ fusion proteins as oncogenic drivers in several tumors, including epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, supratentorial ependymoma, porocarcinoma, epithelioid fibrosarcoma and NF2-wild type meningioma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Driskill et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Seavey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Merritt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Szulzewsky et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Szulzewsky et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Garcia et al., 2022</xref>), further highlighting the critical role of YAP/TAZ in tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>The mammalian VGLL family proteins (VGLL1-4) are expressed in various tissues, and it is thought that VGLL proteins carry out their cellular function via interaction with TEADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Faucheux et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pobbati et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Simon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yamaguchi 2020</xref>). However, in comparison to YAP and TAZ, little is known about their functional regulation. Among the VGLL proteins, VGLL4 and its Drosophila homolog Tgi have been demonstrated as the transcriptional repressors by competing with YAP/TAZ binding to TEAD through two TONDU (TDU) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Koontz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, the precise function of VGLL1-3 in both normal and tumor cells and how they influence Hippo/YAP signaling and affect TEAD transcriptional output remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>Several recent studies have identified the recurrent rearrangement of the VGLL2 and TEAD1 genes in a large subset of spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma (scRMS), a pediatric form of RMS that is distinct from embryonic RMS (ERMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alaggio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cyrta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Whittle et al., 2022</xref>). In these fusions, VGLL2 and TEAD1 participate as 5’partners in the recurrent translocations, and their 3’fusion partners often involve the NCOA2 gene on 8q13.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alaggio et al., 2016</xref>). Among these fusion proteins, the VGLL2-NCOA2 fusion has recently been shown to be able to drive tumor formation in zebrafish and allograft models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Watson et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we explored the molecular mechanism underlying the oncogenic transformation of VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion proteins. We revealed that, in comparison to VGLL2 and TEAD1, VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 are robust activators of TEAD-mediated transcription. We demonstrated that VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2-controlled transcriptional activation is YAP/TAZ-independent, and these fusion proteins specifically engage the CBP/p300 epigenetic factors that are critical for their oncogenic activation.</p>

<title>VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 induce TEAD-mediated transcriptional activation</title>
<p>In VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusions, VGLL2 and TEAD1 are 5’partners and maintain the key functional domains at the N-terminus. VGLL2 retains the TDU domain, while TEAD1 preserves its TEA DNA binding domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The 3’partners of the fusions are NCOA2, which retains its two C-terminal transcriptional activation domains (TAD) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To test the transcriptional activity of the fusion proteins, we utilized an 8xGIIC luciferase reporter that contains 8X TEAD DNA binding sites (TBS-Luc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>). When ectopically expressed in HEK293T cells, we found that, in comparison to the VGLL2, TEAD1, and NCOA2 proteins, the VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion proteins could significantly induce the transcriptional activation of the TBS-Luc reporter, and their activity was comparable to the activated forms of YAP and TAZ, YAP<sup>5SA</sup> and TAZ<sup>4SA</sup>, in which the LATS kinase phosphorylation sites are mutated rendering them constitutively active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Additionally, we showed that the ability of VGLL2-NCOA2 to induce TBS-Luc reporter activation requires both its N-terminal VGLL2 and C-terminal NCOA2 fusion parts (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>To further characterize the downstream transcription induced by VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2, we performed RNA-seq analysis in HEK293T cells overexpressing VGLL2-NCOA2, TEAD1-NCOA2, or YAP<sup>5SA</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>, Supplementary Table 1-3). We found that all three could robustly drive transcriptional programs in HEK293T cells, and VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2-induced transcription clustered together and appeared to be distinct from the YAP<sup>5SA</sup>-driven program (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). However, similar to activated YAP, VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion proteins also strongly induced the expression of <italic>bona fide</italic> TEAD downstream target genes, such as CTGF, CYR61, ANKRD1, and AMOTL2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). This was further confirmed by RT-qPCR analysis, which showed that the transcriptional levels of CTGF, CYR61, and ANKRD1 were significantly elevated in the cells expressing VGLL2-NCOA2, TEAD1-NCOA2, or YAP<sup>5SA</sup>, but not in those expressing VGLL2, TEAD1, and NCOA2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that unlike native VGLL2 and TEAD1, VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion proteins function as strong activators of TEAD-mediated transcription.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2-induced transcription does not require YAP and TAZ</title>
<p>Next, we set out to examine how the VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion proteins interact with YAP/TAZ and TEAD, the well-characterized transcriptional nexus in the Hippo pathway. We performed co-IP assays in HEK293T cells expressing VGLL2-NCOA2, YAP<sup>5SA</sup>, and TEAD1, and demonstrated that VGLL2-NCOA2 was strongly associated with TEAD1, but not YAP<sup>5SA</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, we showed that VGLL2-NCOA2 could bind to the endogenous TEAD proteins; however, we did not detect a strong interaction between VGLL2-NCOA2 and endogenous YAP and TAZ proteins in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, we compared the ability of TEAD1-NCOA2 and TEAD1 to interact with YAP and TAZ. Not surprisingly, TEAD1 was able to bind YAP/TAZ; however, the interaction between TEAD1-NCOA2 and endogenous YAP/TAZ was not detected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), which is consistent with the absence of the C-terminal YAP/TAZ binding domain in the TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion. Together, these co-IP assays revealed the lack of association between the VGLL2 and TEAD1 fusion proteins and YAP/TAZ, suggesting that the regulation of transcription by the fusion proteins is likely TEAD-dependent but YAP/TAZ-independent.</p>

<p>To examine the TEAD regulation in VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2-mediated transcription, we first utilized a small molecule TEAD inhibitor, CP1, that was recently developed to inhibit TEAD auto-palmitoylation, leading to protein instability and transcriptional inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sun et al., 2022</xref>). Upon treatment with the TEAD palmitoylation inhibitor CP1 in HEK293T cells transfected with YAP<sup>5SA</sup>, VGLL2-NCOA2, and TEAD1-NCOA2, we found that CP1 effectively inhibited YAP<sup>5SA</sup>- and VGLL2-NCOA2-induced transcriptional activation but had largely no effect on TEAD1-NCOA2-induced reporter activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The inability of CP1 to inhibit TEAD1-NCOA2 activity is likely because the TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion does not contain the auto-palmitoylation sites in the C-terminal YAP-binding domain of TEAD1. To further explore TEAD dependence, we generated a TEAD fusion dominant repressor, TEAD-ENR, which fuses its N-terminal TEA DNA-binding domain to a C-terminal Engrained repressor domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). When co-expressed with YAP<sup>5SA</sup>, VGLL2-NCOA2, and TEAD1-NCOA2 in HEK293T cells, TEAD1-ENR potently inhibited the transcriptional activation of all three proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). These results from both the TEAD inhibitor and transcriptional repressor suggest that downstream TEAD activity and TEAD DNA binding are critical for both fusion proteins.</p>
<p>To further examine the involvement of YAP and TAZ in VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 induced transcription, we used lentiviral-based shRNA to knock down the expression of YAP and TAZ in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). We showed that VGLL2-NCOA2 could bind to endogenous TEAD proteins at similar levels in both control and YAP/TAZ-knockdown HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), suggesting its association with TEAD does not require YAP/TAZ. Furthermore, we found that both VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 still robustly induced the transcription of the known TEAD target genes, including CTGF, ANKRD1, and CYR61, in HEK293T cells with YAP/TAZ knockdown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2-induced transcriptional activation requires TEAD DNA binding but is YAP/TAZ independent.</p>

<p>In our ATAC-seq assay, the analysis of differentially accessible chromatin sites annotated to the nearest genes showed significant enrichment of Hippo pathway-related genes in both VGLL2-NCOA2 and YAP<sup>5SA</sup>-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref>), suggesting that VGLL2-NCOA2 and YAP<sup>5SA</sup> likely drive open chromatin architecture in a shared set of genes. This is also consistent with our analysis of the genomic occupancy profiles of VGLL2-NCOA2 and YAP<sup>5SA</sup> defined by CUT&amp;RUN sequencing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-F</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3F</xref>). Annotation of CUT&amp;RUN peaks with respect to their nearest gene transcriptional start site (TSS) showed that both VGLL2-NCOA2 and YAP preferred to occupy distal genomic regions that are not in close proximity to the TSS (0-2kb) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). This is consistent with prior reports that YAP preferentially binds to distal enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zanconato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) and indicates that the VGLL2-NCOA2 fusion protein also regulate downstream gene transcription through active enhancers.</p>
<p>In addition, <italic>de novo</italic> motif analysis of our CUT&amp;RUN datasets revealed that the TEAD binding sequence was among the most enriched motifs in both VGLL2-NCOA2 and YAP<sup>5SA</sup> CUT&amp;RUN peaks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), consistent with our observation that TEAD DNA binding was essential for transcriptional activation induced by the fusion proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-F</xref>). Interestingly, the AP1 motif was also enriched in VGLL2-NCOA2 CUT&amp;RUN peaks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), highlighting its proposed roles in TEAD-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zanconato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, we compared the binding profiles of the <italic>bona fide</italic> downstream target genes of VGLL2-NCOA2 and YAP identified in our CUT&amp;RUN analysis, CTGF, ANKRD1, and CYR61, and showed that VGLL2-NCOA2 and YAP occupied the same genomic regions in the loci of the three genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Altogether, our analyses demonstrated that VGLL2-NCOA2 and YAP occupy a core set of genomic regions containing TEAD binding motif but control distinct transcriptional and chromatin landscapes in driving downstream gene transcription.</p>

<title>VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 engage p300 epigenetic regulators</title>
<p>In addition to their YAP/TAZ independence, the distinct nature of transcriptional and chromatin landscapes controlled by VGLL2-NCOA2 and YAP prompted us to hypothesize that the fusion proteins might utilize different sets of epigenetic/transcriptional regulators to modify chromatin and drive gene expression. To this end, we adopted a proximity-labeling proteomics approach called BioID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kim and Roux, 2016</xref>) to identify the potential binding partners of VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 and compared them to YAP and TAZ.</p>
<p>In our BioID proteomics screens, we tagged YAP<sup>5SA</sup>, TAZ<sup>4SA</sup>, VGLL2-NCOA2, and TEAD1-NCOA2 with BirA* (a promiscuous version of the biotin ligase BirA) and used them as baits to probe the proteomes associated with these proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, Supplementary Table 4). By intersecting the hits associated with YAP/TAZ or VGLL2-NCOA2/TEAD1-NCOA2, we found that TEAD proteins were among the few proteins associated with all four proteins, providing validation of our BioID datasets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Focusing on epigenetic and transcriptional regulators identified in the screens, we found that CBP and p300 were among the hits specifically associated with VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 in the BioID assays (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>The closely related histone acetyltransferases CBP and p300, commonly referred as CBP/p300, are known for their function to induce histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) at the promoter and enhancer regions, thereby activating gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ogryzko et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bannister and Kouzarides 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Waddell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hogg et al., 2021</xref>). More importantly, CBP/p300 has been reported to form a complex with the NCOA family proteins that plays critical role in regulation of nuclear receptors-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Waddell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yi et al., 2021</xref>). It is consistent with our proteomics data that the C-term NCOA part of VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusions interacted with CBP/p300 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, our motif enrichment analysis identified CREB motif as specifically enriched among VGLL2-NCOA2 CUT&amp;RUN peaks, but not in YAP<sup>5SA</sup> peaks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). CREB is a known transcription factor interacting with CBP/p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chrivia et al., 1993</xref>), further supporting the notion that VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion proteins might recruit CBP/p300. In addition, the activity of CBP/p300 has been implicated in several types of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Waddell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hogg et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we set out to further examine the interaction between CBP/p300 and the fusion proteins and how it may affect downstream transcriptional activation.</p>
<p>We performed the co-IP analysis in HEK293T cells overexpressing VGLL2-NCOA2, TEAD1-NCOA2, and YAP<sup>5SA</sup>, and demonstrated that VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2, but not YAP<sup>5SA</sup>, were strongly associated with endogenous p300 proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting the specific engagement of p300 by the fusion proteins. To further examine the potential functional regulation of fusion proteins-mediated transcription by CBP/p300, we carried out the CUT&amp;RUN sequencing analysis to map p300 genomic occupancy sites in control and VGLL2-NCOA2- or TEAD1-NCOA2-expressing HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-E</xref>). Pathway enrichment analysis of p300 binding peaks annotated by the nearest genes showed significant enrichment of Hippo pathway-related genes in both VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 expressing cells, but not in the control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion proteins recruit the CBP/p300 complex to a specific set of genes, likely including the TEAD-dependent downstream target genes. In keeping with this result, our <italic>de novo</italic> motif analysis also revealed that TEAD and AP1 binding sequences were among the top-ranking motifs identified in p300 occupied genomic sites specifically in VGLL2-NCOA2- and TEAD1-NCOA2-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Interestingly, we noticed that the CREB binding sequence was one of the top-ranking motifs identified in p300 peaks in both control and VGLL2-NCOA2/TEAD1-NCOA2-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), consistent with the notion that the CREB family transcription factors are the downstream binding partners of CBP/p300, further validating our CUT&amp;RUN datasets. Upon further examining the binding profiles of p300 in the loci of CTGF, ANKRD1, and CYR61, we showed that p300 bound to these loci in VGLL2-NCOA2/TEAD1-NCOA2-expressing cells, but not in control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). More importantly, p300 bound to the same genomic regions that were also occupied by VGLL2-NCOA2 identified in VGLL2-NCOA2 CUT&amp;RUN assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). As a control, we showed that p300 occupied the genomic sites within the CREB3 locus in cells with or without the expression of the fusion proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion proteins interact with CBP/p300, recruiting them to promote TEAD target gene expression.</p>

<title>p300 is required for VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2-induced tumorigenesis</title>
<p>To test whether VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2-mediated sarcomagenesis is CBP/p300 dependent, we utilized the C2C12 myoblast transformation models both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Prior report has demonstrated that VGLL2-NCOA2 can induce oncogenic transformation of C2C12 cells in cell culture and in allograft mouse tumor models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Watson et al., 2023</xref>). However, it is not known whether VGLL2-NCOA2 or TEAD1-NCOA2 can induce TEAD-mediated transcription and whether p300 is functionally relevant in these models.</p>
<p>We first demonstrated that the expression of both VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion proteins was able to robustly induce the transcription of the known Tead target genes, Ctgf, Ankrd1, and Cyr61, in C2C12 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>). By utilizing a potent p300 small molecule inhibitor, A485, which inhibits CBP/p300 activity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hogg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lasko et al., 2017</xref>), we showed that p300 inhibition by A485 treatment strongly inhibited transcriptional up-regulation of Ctgf, Cyr61, and Ankrd1 induced by the fusion proteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>). In contrast, A485 was not able to strongly block YAP<sup>5SA</sup>-induced Tead target gene expression in C2C12 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>), suggesting that CBP/p300 is required for VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2-dependent gene expression but is largely dispensable for YAP/TAZ-induced target gene transcription. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TEAD1-NCOA2 was also able to induce colony formation of C2C12 cells in soft agar (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). More importantly, A485 treatment markedly reduced the numbers and sizes of the soft agar colonies induced by TEAD1-NCOA2 and VGLL2-NCOA2, but not YAP<sup>5SA</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">F</xref>), which is consistent with the differential effect of p300 inhibition on downstream gene transcription induced by the fusion proteins or YAP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mis-regulation of YAP and TAZ, including protein upregulation, nuclear accumulation and fusion translocation, has emerged as a major mechanism underlying Hippo signaling involvement in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Piccolo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Thompson 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Franklin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Szulzewsky et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Garcia et al., 2022</xref>). In this work, our characterization of VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion proteins generated by recurrent rearrangement in scRMS provides a distinct mechanism of oncogenic transformation that is related to the Hippo pathway but independent of YAP/TAZ function.</p>
<p>Among the members of the VGLL family proteins, VGLL4 stands out as a <italic>bona fide</italic> transcriptional repressor for YAP/TAZ via its two TEAD-binding TDU domains. The other members of the family, VGLL1-3, contain a single TDU domain, and it is not fully understood whether and how they regulate YAP/TAZ-TEAD transcriptional output. Unlike YAP, TAZ and VGLL2-NCOA2 fusion, VGLL2 itself does not appear to be a strong activator of TEAD-mediated transcription even when overexpressed in cells. In both VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusions, the lack of NCOA2 N-terminal domains suggests that they are unlikely to be subject to downstream regulation by nuclear receptors, the canonical binding partners of the NCOA/SRC transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yi et al., 2021</xref>). Our previous work showed that the NCOA family proteins are associated with the YAP/TAZ-TEAD transcriptional machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2016</xref>); however, the presence of YAP/TAZ in the complex appears to be dominant in directing TEAD-mediated transcriptional activation in the normal context. Clearly, the C-terminal NCOA2 TADs render robust transcriptional activity in both VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusions, underlying their oncogenic activity that bypasses the requirement for YAP/TAZ.</p>
<p>Our data showed that VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusions converge on the TEAD family transcription factors or TEAD-mediated genomic occupancy, highlighting the central role of TEAD in Hippo-related tumorigenesis. The small molecule TEAD inhibitors are currently undergoing preclinical or clinical evaluation for cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pobbati et al., 2023</xref>). These inhibitors target TEAD auto-palmitoylation, an enzymatic-like activity carried out by the C-terminal YAP/TAZ binding domain of the TEAD proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pobbati et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Holden et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kaneda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hu et al., 2022</xref>). The lack of YAP/TAZ binding domain in TEAD1 fusion results in the inability of the TEAD palmitoylation inhibitor to suppress gene transcription, suggesting the potential limitation of TEAD palmitoylation inhibitors in tumors carrying TEAD rearrangements. In addition, current TEAD small molecule inhibitors are generally thought to allosterically affect the binding between YAP/TAZ and TEAD. How these inhibitors may affect TEAD interaction with VGLL or VGLL fusion proteins requires further investigation.</p>
<p>Our identification of CBP/p300 as specific epigenetic regulators for VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 proteins provides a molecular mechanism underlying their YAP/TAZ-independent regulation of transcription and tumorigenesis. In another recurrent VGLL2 rearrangement identified in scRMS, CITED2, the 3’ partner in the VGLL2-CITED2 fusion, is a known transcriptional regulator associated with CBP/p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alaggio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhattacharya et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bamforth et al., 2001</xref>). It is possible that the VGLL2-CITED2 fusion also mediates YAP/TAZ-independent TEAD-dependent transcriptional activation by engaging CBP/p300. Our data using small molecular CBP/p300 inhibitors both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> further support its critical role in VGLL and TEAD fusion protein-mediated oncogenic transformation. This finding may also provide a potential therapeutic strategy for scRMS characterized by these fusion proteins, as well as a range of other tumors carrying NCOA1/2/3 rearrangements, including uterine sarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Niu et al., 2023</xref>), mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tanaka et al., 2023</xref>), soft tissue angiofibroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Yamashita et al., 2023</xref>), ovarian sex cord tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Goebel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lu et al., 2023</xref>), leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Strehl et al., 2008</xref>), colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yu et al., 2016</xref>), and ependymoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tauziède-Espariat et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tomomasa et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<p>In this <bold>valuable</bold> study, Gue, Hue et al. describe how two poorly understood rhabdomyosarcoma fusion-oncogenes, VGLL2::NCOA2 and TEAD1::NCOA2, function at the genomic, transcriptional, and proteomic levels in multiple systems. They generated <bold>solid</bold> data that support that these fusion-oncogenes leverage TEAD transcriptional signatures, in a mechanism that is independent of YAP/TAZ, and that this activity potentially contributes to tumorigenesis. This work offers new mechanistic insights into oncogenic gene fusion events identified in cancer patients and reveals potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of rhabdomyosarcomas.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Guo, Hue et al. focused on understanding the epigenetic activity and functional dependencies for two different fusions found in infantile rhabdomyosarcoma, VGLL2::NCOA2, and TEAD1::NCOA2. They use a variety of models and methods; specifically, ectopic expression of the fusions in human 293T cells to perform RNAseq (both fusions), CUT&amp;RUN (VGLL2::NCOA2), and BioID mass spec (both fusions). These data identify that the VGLL2::NCOA2 fusion has peaks that are enriched for TEAD motifs. Further, CPB/p300 CUT&amp;RUN support an enrichment of binding sites and three TEAD targets in VGLL2::NCOA2 and TEAD1::NCOA2 expressing cells. They also functionally evaluated genetic and chemical dependencies (TEAD inhibition), and found this was only effective for the VGLL2::NCOA2 fusion, and not for TEAD1::NCOA2. Using complementary biochemical approaches they suggest (with other supporting data) that the fusions regulate TEAD transcriptional outputs via a YAP/TAZ independent mechanism. Further, they expand into a C2C12 myoblast model and show that TEAD1::NCOA2 is transforming in colony formation assays and in mouse allografts. This is consistent with previously published strategies using VGLL2::NCOA2. Importantly, they show that a CBP/p300 (a binding partner found in their BioID mass spec) small molecule inhibitor suppresses tumor formation using this mouse allograft model, that the tumors are less proliferative, and have a reduction in transcriptional of three TEAD target genes. Generally, the data is interesting and suggests new biology for these fusion-oncogenes. However, the choice of 293T for the majority of the transcriptional, epigenetic, and proteomic studies makes the findings difficult to interpret in the context of the human disease, and the rationale for the choice of an epithelial-like kidney cell line is not discussed. Further, details are missing from the figures, figure legends, and methods that make the data difficult to interpret, and should be added to improve the reader's understanding. Overall, the breadth of methods used in this study, and the comparison of the two fusion-oncogene's biology is of interest to the fusion-oncogene, pediatric sarcoma, and epigenetic therapeutic targeting fields.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Multiple experimental approaches were used to understand the biology of the fusion-oncogenes, including genomic, proteomic, chemical, and genetic inhibition. These approaches identify potential new mechanisms of convergent fusion-oncogene activity, around TEAD transcriptional targeting (that is YAP/TAZ independent) and reveal CBP/p300 as a functional dependency.</p>
<p>(2) Complementary models were used, including cell-based assays and mouse allograft models to show the dependency on CBP/P300.</p>
<p>(3) Co-IPs were clear and convincing and showed direct interaction of the fusion-oncogene with ectopic and endogenous TEAD1/pan-TEAD, but not YAP/TAZ.</p>
<p>(4) Potential to follow-up on additional targets/mechanisms of tumorigenesis. For example, in the BioID proteomics screen, a unique VGLL2::NCOA2 and TEAD::NCOA2 interactor is P53, which also is an enriched pathway in Figure 4C in the p300 CUT&amp;RUN peaks in the VGLL2::NCOA2 and TEAD1::NCOA2 expressing cells - is this indicative of the toxicity of the fusion-oncogenes or do you think this informs potential mechanisms for transformation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The rationale for performing genomics, transcriptional, and proteomics work in 293T cells is not discussed. Further, there are no functional readouts mentioned in the 293T cells with expression of the fusion-oncogenes. Did these cells have any phenotypes associated with fusion-oncogene expression (proliferation differences, morphological changes, colony formation capacity)? Further, how similar are the gene expression signatures from RNA-seq to rhabdomyosarcoma? This would help the reader interpret how similar these cell models are to human disease.</p>
<p>(2) TEAD1::NCOA2 fusion-oncogene model was not credentialed past H&amp;E, and expression of Desmin. Is the transcriptional signature in C2C12 or 293T similar to a rhabdomyosarcoma gene signature?</p>
<p>(3) For the fusion-oncogenes, did the HA, FLAG, or V5 tag impact fusion-oncogene activity? Was the tag on the 3' or 5' of the fusion? This was not discussed in the methods.</p>
<p>(4) Generally, the lack of details in the figures, figure legends, and methods make the data difficult to interpret. A few examples are below:</p>
<p>a. Individual data points are not shown for figure bar plots (how many technical or biological replicates are present and how many times was the experiment repeated?).</p>
<p>
b. What exons were included in the fusion-oncogenes from VGLL2 and NCOA2 or TEAD1 and NCOA2?</p>
<p>
c. For how long were the colony formation experiments performed? Two weeks?</p>
<p>
d. In Figure 2D, what concentration of CP1 was used and for how long?</p>
<p>
e. How was A485 resuspended for cell culture and mouse experiments, what is the percentage of DMSO?</p>
<p>
f. How many replicates were done for RNA-seq, CUT&amp;RUN, and ATACseq experiments?</p>

<p>In the manuscript entitled &quot;VGLL2 and TEAD1 fusion proteins drive YAP/TAZ-independent transcription and tumorigenesis by engaging p300&quot;, Gu et al. studied two Hippo pathway-related gene fusion events (i.e., VGLL2-NCOA2, TEAD1-NCOA2) in spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma (scRMS) and showed that their fusion proteins can activate Hippo downstream gene transcription independent of YAP/TAZ. Using the BioID-based mass spectrometry analysis, the authors revealed histone acetyltransferase CBP/p300 as specific binding proteins for VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion proteins. Pharmacologically targeting p300 inhibited the fusion proteins-induced Hippo downstream gene transcription and tumorigenic events.</p>
<p>Overall, this study provides mechanistic insights into the scRMS-associated gene fusions in tumorigenesis and reveals potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. The manuscript is well-written and easy to follow.</p>
<p>Here, several suggestions are made for the authors to improve their study.</p>
<p>Main points</p>
<p>(1) The authors majorly focused on the Hippo downstream gene transcription in this study, while a significant portion of genes regulated by the VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion proteins are non-Hippo downstream genes (Figure 3). The authors should investigate whether the altered Hippo pathway transcription is essential for VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2-induced cell transformation and tumorigenesis. Specifically, they should test if treatment with the TEAD inhibitor can reverse the cell transformation and tumorigenesis caused by VGLL2-NCOA2 but not TEAD1-NCOA2. In addition, it is important to examine whether YAP-5SA expression can rescue the inhibitory effects of A485 on VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2-induced colony formation and tumor growth. This will help clarify whether Hippo downstream gene transcription is important for the oncogenic activities of these two fusion proteins.</p>
<p>(2) Rationale for selecting CBP/p300 for functional studies needs to be provided. The BioID-MS experiment identified many interacting proteins for VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion proteins (Table S4). The authors should explain the scoring system used to identify the high-interacting proteins for VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion proteins. Was CEP/p300 the top candidates on the list? Providing this information will help justify the focus on CBP/p300 and validate their importance in this study.</p>
<p>(3) p300 was revealed as a key driver for the VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion proteins-induced transcriptome alteration and tumorigenesis. To strengthen the point, the authors should identify the p300 binding region on VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion proteins. Mutants with defects in p300 binding/recruitment should be generated and included as a control in the related q-PCR and tumorigenic studies. This work will help confirm the crucial role of p300 in mediating the oncogenic effects of these two fusion proteins.</p>
<p>(4) Another major issue is the overexpression system extensively used in this study. It is important to determine whether the VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion genes are also amplified in cancer. If not, the expression levels of the VGLL2-NCOA2 and TEAD1-NCOA2 fusion proteins should be adjusted to endogenous levels to assess their oncogenic effects on gene transcription and tumorigenesis. This approach would make the study more relevant to the pathological conditions observed in scRMS cancer patients.</p>
