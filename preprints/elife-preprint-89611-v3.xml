<title>Summary</title><p>Brain microvessels possess the unique properties of a blood-brain barrier (BBB), tightly regulating the passage of molecules from the blood to the brain neuropil and vice versa. In models of brain injury, BBB dysfunction and the associated leakage of serum albumin to the neuropil have been shown to induce pathological plasticity, neuronal hyper-excitability, and seizures. The effect of neuronal activity on BBB function and whether it plays a role in plasticity in the healthy brain remain unclear. Here we show that neuronal activity induces modulation of microvascular permeability in the healthy brain and that it has a role in local network reorganization. Combining simultaneous electrophysiological recording and vascular imaging with transcriptomic analysis in rats, and functional and BBB-mapping MRI in human subjects we show that prolonged stimulation of the limb induces a focal increase in BBB permeability in the corresponding somatosensory cortex that is associated with long-term synaptic plasticity. We further show that the increased microvascular permeability depends on neuronal activity and involves caveolae-mediated transcytosis and transforming growth factor beta signaling. Our results reveal a role of BBB modulation in cortical plasticity in the healthy brain, highlighting the importance of neurovascular interactions for sensory experience and learning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The intricate components comprising the blood-brain barrier (BBB) regulate the bi-directional transport of molecules between the brain and the circulatory system and maintain the extracellular environment needed for normal function of the neurovascular unit (NVU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chow and Gu, 2015</xref>). Dysfunction of the BBB is common in many neurological disorders and is associated with impaired cross-BBB influx and efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Obermeier et al., 2013</xref>). For example, seizures were shown to increase cross-BBB influx of serum albumin â in a process partially mediated by excessive release of neuronal glutamate and subsequent activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Vazana et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Emerging evidence suggests that cross-BBB influx/efflux may also change in response to physiological neuronal activity in the healthy brain: (1) whisker stimulation (1 hour, 2 Hz) was shown to increase BBB influx of insulin-like growth factor-I in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nishijima et al., 2010</xref>); (2) physiological neuronal activity was shown to regulate BBB efflux transport in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pulido et al., 2020</xref>); and (3) circadian rhythms were shown to alter BBB efflux in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pulido et al., 2020</xref>). However, the mechanisms and the role of these physiological changes in BBB properties are not known.</p>
<p>Here, we sought to test whether physiological BBB modulation may involve mechanisms previously linked to pathological BBB changes, e.g., transcytosis of serum albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ivens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Seiffert et al., 2004</xref>) and transforming growth factor Î² (TGF-Î²) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">David et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Heinemann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ivens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Weissberg et al., 2015</xref>). As TGF-Î² signaling has been linked to synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dahlmanns et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gradari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Patel and Weaver, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Weissberg et al., 2015</xref>), we also explored the hypothesis that physiological BBB modulation may be associated with neuroplasticity. Lastly, we sought to provide the first evidence for physiological BBB modulation in humans.</p>

<title>Stimulation increases BBB permeability</title>
<p>To test for changes in BBB permeability in response to stimulation we combined electrophysiological recordings with BBB imaging using intravital microscopy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, see timeline of stimuli in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). First, we localized vascular response to sensory stimulation using wide-field imaging of arterial diameter and monitoring change in total hemoglobin (HbT) signal during a 1 min stimulation of the limb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b-d</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bouchard et al., 2009</xref>). Fluorescent angiography before and immediately after 30 min of limb stimulation showed local extravasation of the tracer sodium fluorescein (NaFlu) around the responding blood vessels, indicative of BBB leakage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f-g</xref>). Histological analysis confirmed the presence of NaFlu in the extravascular space around small vessels in the somatosensory cortex, contralateral (and not ipsilateral) to the stimulated limb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1m-n</xref>). Next, we intravenously injected a separate cohort of rats with either the albumin-binding dye Evans blue (EB) or albumin conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Alexa488-Alb) without performing craniotomy. Brain extravasation of both dyes was found in the contralateral hemisphere, indicating the presence of serum albumin in the neuropil (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1h-k</xref>). ELISA performed in cortical tissue at different time points after stimulation confirmed a higher concentration of albumin in the stimulated sensorimotor cortex early after stimulation (30 min) compared to non-stimulated sham-controls, that declined 4- and 24-hours post-stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1l</xref>). As a positive control, brain tissues were also prepared from rats subjected to photothrombosis (PT)-induced ischemia (see methods). Albumin concentrations in the peri-ischemic cortex 24 hours following PT were significantly higher compared to sham and all time-points after stimulation (Figure S1d). These results suggest that the focal modulation of BBB permeability following stimulation is distinct from the extensive BBB dysfunction observed in injury models.</p>

<title>BBB permeability is associated with synaptic potentiation</title>
<p>To study changes in brain activity during repetitive stimulation of the limb, we measured somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) by averaging neuronal response to a 1 min test stimulation before and after the 30 min stimulation train (6 Hz, 2 mA). SEP amplitudes and area under the curve were increased in stimulated, but not in control cortices (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a-e</xref>). Potentiation lasted until the end of each experiment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>) and was therefore indicative of long-term potentiation (LTP).</p>

<p>To test whether stimulation-induced albumin extravasation has a role in LTP, we recorded local field potentials (LFP) before and after exposure of the cortex to 0.1 mM albumin (corresponding to 25% of serum concentration) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ivens et al., 2007</xref>). The relatively high concentration of albumin was chosen to account for factors that lower its effective tissue concentration, such as its low diffusion rate and its likelihood to encounter a degradation site or a cross-BBB efflux transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tao and Nicholson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhang and Pardridge, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Albumin application increased the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g,k</xref>). Neuronal response to the stimulation showed synaptic potentiation in the presence of albumin compared to that recorded under aCSF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2h-j</xref>), indicating that cortical exposure to serum albumin results in synaptic potentiation.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>BBB modulation is activity-dependent</title>
<p>To test the neurotransmission pathways involved in regulation of BBB permeability during stimulation we exposed the cortical window to selective antagonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). The AMPA/kainate receptor blocker CNQX prevented the stimulation-induced BBB modulation, whereas the NMDAR blocker AP5 did not (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b-c</xref>). CNQX also reversibly blocked synaptic activity and prevented the vascular response to neuronal activation, indicated by the absence of vasodilation (AKA âneurovascular couplingâ; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d-e</xref>, Figure S2a, S3a,c). These results indicate that stimulation-induced BBB modulation was mediated by neuronal activation. In contrast, AP5 did not affect baseline SEP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d-e</xref>), nor the vascular response (Figure S2a, S3b). Synaptic potentiation was blocked under both CNQX or AP5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d-e, g-h</xref>, Figure S2a), consistent with the crucial role of AMPA and NMDA receptors in synaptic plasticity. Next, we tested for molecular correlates of synaptic strength by comparing postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) expression levels in the cortex at different time points.

<title>BBB modulation and LTP involve TGF-Î² signaling</title>
<p>Under pathological conditions, synaptogenesis and pathological plasticity that follow BBB dysfunction are mediated by the activation of TGF-Î²R1 signaling in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Weissberg et al., 2015</xref>).

<title>Regulation of BBB transport and plasticity genes</title>
<p>To explore gene-expression changes related to our stimulation protocol, we conducted bulk RNA-sequencing transcriptome analysis of tissue dissected from the sensorimotor area of the cortex contralateral and ipsilateral to stimulated limb. Tissue harvested 1 and 24 h post-stimulation (30 min) showed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the contralateral (âstimulatedâ) compared to the ipsilateral (ânon-stimulatedâ) cortex (13.2% and 7.3% 24 and 1 h, respectively, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>, S4a). To assess the variability between paired samples of stimulated and non-stimulated cortex of each animal at two time points following stimulation (24 h vs 1 h) we used the JensenâShannon divergence metric (JSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sudmant et al., 2015</xref>). JSD calculations using normalized counts indicated that the RNA expression 24 h after stimulation was significantly different from that of rats 1 h after stimulation (Figure S4b). Gene Ontology (GO) pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs from stimulated rats indicated DEGs were primarily involved in synaptic plasticity processes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). A significantly higher number of DEGs related to synaptic plasticity was found in the contralateral cortex of stimulated rats compared to ipsilateral (p&lt;0.001, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). No significant differences were found in BBB or inflammation related genes between the hemispheres, suggesting that the stimulation protocol is not associated with the transcriptional change observed in BBB dysfunction under pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cacheaux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). In contrast, a larger amount of transporter genes such as solute carrier transporters (Slc) and ATP-binding cassette (ABCs) families were differentially expressed in the stimulated compared to the non-stimulated cortex (Figure S4c-d). Both DEG and enrichment analysis were consistent with activation of TGF-Î² signaling pathway (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>).

<title>Physiological BBB modulation in the human brain</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that prolonged physiological stimulation modulates BBB permeability in the rat and human cortex. In rats, we show that prolonged paw stimulation results in increased cross-BBB extravasation of both low- and high- molecular weight tracers. We also show that this extravasation is: (1) focal and localized to the cortical area corresponding to the stimulation; (2) mediated by AMPA neurotransmission, TGF-Î² signaling, and caveolae transcytosis; and (3) associated with synaptic potentiation and increased postsynaptic density. In humans, we present the first evidence for increased BBB permeability in response to prolonged limb activity. Together, our results suggest that stimulation-induced BBB modulation may play a role in synaptic potentiation.</p>
<p>Physiological changes in cross-BBB transport have been previously reported in response to whisker stimulation, circadian rhythms, and age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nishijima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pulido et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we examined whether the mechanisms involved in this process may include those identified in our studies of pathological BBB modulation. Previous studies from our group showed that brain injury is associated with albumin transcytosis, albumin binding to TGF-Î²R in astrocytes, and pathological TGF-Î²-mediated plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Salar et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we show that prolonged physiological sensory-motor activation is also associated with albumin extravasation (although at a significantly lower concentration than under pathological conditions, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1l</xref> and Figure S1d) and TGF-Î²R signaling. We further show that blocking caveolae-mediated albumin transcytosis or TGF-Î²R signaling inhibits stimulation-evoked increase in BBB permeability and synaptic potentiation (without affecting the physiological hemodynamic response). These results suggest that caveolae albumin transcytosis and TGF-Î² signaling are key mediators of activity-dependent BBB modulation and subsequent synaptic plasticity. These findings are supported by reports linking TGF-Î² signaling to: synaptic plasticity induced by environmental enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dahlmanns et al., 2022</xref>); enhanced spine and synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Patel and Weaver, 2021</xref>); and hippocampal neuroplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gradari et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, our finding of caveolae-mediated albumin transcytosis in pial arterioles is in line with previous studies showing: caveolae-dependent transcytosis of albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tecedor et al., 2013</xref>); caveolae abundance in arteriolar ECs and not capillary ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chow et al., 2020</xref>); and the contribution of caveolae transcytosis to neurovascular coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andreone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chow et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, in our experiments, caveolae inhibition prevented BBB modulation yet did not significantly affect neurovascular coupling, likely due to the contribution of other vasodilatory pathways such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, albumin is a known activator of TGF-Î² signaling, and TGF-Î² has a well-established role in neuroplasticity. Interestingly, emerging evidence suggests that TGF-Î² also increases cross-BBB transcytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Betterton et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kaplan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">McMillin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Schumacher et al., 2023</xref>). Hence, we propose the following two-part hypothesis for the TGF-Î²/BBB-mediated synaptic potentiation observed in our experiments: (1) prolonged stimulation triggers TGF-Î² signaling and increased caveolae-mediated transcytosis of albumin; and (2) extravasated albumin induces further TGF-Î² signaling, leading to synaptogenesis and additional cross-BBB transport â in a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop. Future research is needed to examine the validity of this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Our study also shows that physiological BBB modulation requires AMPAR glutamate signaling and not NMDA. This finding is consistent with studies showing the dominant role of AMPAR in electrophysiological and hemodynamic responses to somatosensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Graves et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gsell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, the well-established role of AMPAR in neuroplasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP), and experience-dependent sensory cortical plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Daw et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Feldman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Watt et al., 2004</xref>) further supports the plasticity-related role of activity-dependent BBB modulation.</p>
<p>Our gene analysis was designed to complement our in vivo and histological findings, by assessing the magnitude of change in DEGs. This analysis showed that: (1) the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulus has significantly more DEGs than the ipsilateral hemisphere; and (2) the DEGs were related to synaptic plasticity and TGF-Î² signaling. These findings strengthen the hypothesis raised by our experiments.</p>
<p>Our animal experiments show that a 30 min limb stimulation (at 6Hz and 2mA) increases cross-BBB influx, while a 1 min stimulation (of similar frequency and magnitude) does not. We argue that both types of stimulations fall within the physiological range because in rats, activity between 5-15 Hz represents physiological rhythmic whisker movement during environment exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">MÃ©gevand et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, our continuous electrophysiological recordings showed no signs of epileptiform or otherwise pathological activity and the recorded SEP levels were similar to those reported in previous LTP studies in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Eckert and Abraham, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">MÃ©gevand et al., 2009</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">McGregor et al., 2016</xref>). In humans, skill acquisition often involves motor training sessions that last â¥30 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bengtsson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Classen et al., 1998</xref>) and result in physiological plasticity of sensory and motor systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Classen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Draganski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sagi et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, the experimental task in our human study (30 minutes of repetitive squeezing of an elastic stress-ball) is likely to represent physiological learning task involving neuronal activation in primarily motor and sensory areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Halder et al., 2005</xref>). Future human and animal studies are needed to explore the BBB modulating effects of additional stimulation protocols â with varying durations, frequencies, and magnitudes. Such studies may also elucidate the temporal and ultrastructural characteristics that differentiate between physiological and pathological BBB modulation.</p>
<p>A key limitation of our animal experiments is the fact they were performed under anesthesia, due to the complex nature of the experimental setup (i.e., simultaneous cortical imaging and electrophysiological recordings). Anesthetic agents can potentially alter neuronal activity, SEPs, CBF, and vascular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aksenov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lindauer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Masamoto and Kanno, 2012</xref>). To minimize these effects, we used ketamine-xylazine anesthesia, which unlike other anesthetics, was shown to maintain robust BOLD and SEP responses to neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Franceschini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Shim et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, the antagonistic effect of ketamine on NMDA receptors might attenuate the magnitude of SEP potentiation recorded in our experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Anis et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Salt et al., 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Another limitation of our animal study is the potentially non-specific effect of mÎ²CD â an agent that disrupts caveola transport but may also lead to cholesterol depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Keller and Simons, 1998</xref>). To mitigate this issue, we used a very low mÎ²CD concentration (10Î¼M), orders of magnitude below the concentration reported to deplete cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Koudinov and Koudinova, 2001</xref>). Lastly, our animal study is limited by the inclusion of solely male rats. While our findings in humans did not point to sex-related differences in stimulation-evoked BBB modulation, larger animals and human studies are needed to examine this question.</p>
<p>To conclude, our study suggests that BBB modulation in response to physiological neuronal activity involves mechanisms previously identified in pathology-induced BBB changes (despite the significantly smaller increase in cross-BBB influx under physiological conditions). Our findings further suggest that physiological modulation of cross-BBB influx may play a role in synaptic plasticity, calling for future research into the dynamics of BBB function in health and disease.</p>

<p>This study included rat and human experiments.

The experimental paradigm involved a 30-min rat limb stimulation at a frequency comparable to rhythmic whisker activity during environment exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">MÃ©gevand et al., 2009</xref>). The effects of stimulation on BBB permeability were studied using in vivo and histopathological imaging.

A sub-set of experiments involved the application of blockers to test their effect on <underline>BBB permeability</underline> and synaptic plasticity.

<p>Adult Sprague Dawley male rats (300-350 g; Harlan Laboratories) were kept under a 12:12 h light and dark regimen and supplied with drinking water and food ad libitum. Surgical procedures were performed as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Prager et al., 2010</xref>). Rats were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of ketamine (100 mg/ml, 0.08 ml/100 g) and xylazine (20 mg/ml, 0.06 ml/100 g). The tail vein was cannulated, and animals were placed in a stereotactic frame under a SteREO Lumar V12 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). Body temperature was continuously monitored and kept stable at 37 Â± 0.5Â°C using a feedback-controlled heating pad (Physitemp). Heart rate, breath rate, and oxygen saturation levels were continuously monitored using MouseOx (STARR Life Sciences). A cranial section (4 mm caudal, 2 mm frontal, 5 mm lateral to bregma) was removed over the right sensorimotor cortex.

Before, during, and after electrical limb stimulation, full-resolution (2560 x 2160 px) images were obtained for regional localization of the hemodynamic response, followed by acquisition of localized (512 Ã 512 px) images of cortical surface vessels (2 frames/s, EMCCD camera, Neo DC-152Q-COO-FI; Andor Technology) under 525/50 band pass filter (38 HE, Zeiss). Images were analyzed offline using in-house MATLAB (MathWorks) scripts.</p>
<p>Fluorescent angiography and BBB permeability measurements and analyses were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Prager et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Vazana et al., 2016</xref>). The non-BBB permeable fluorescent dye sodium fluorescein (NaFlu) was injected intravenously (0.2 ml, 1 mg/ml). Images of cortical surface vessels were obtained before, during, and after tracer injection at 5 frames per second. Across all experiments, acquired images were the same size (512 Ã 512 pixel, â¼1x1 mm), centered above the responding arteriole. Images were analyzed offline using MATLAB as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Vazana et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, image registration and segmentation were performed to produce a binary image, separating blood vessels from extravascular regions. For each extravascular pixel, a time curve of signal intensity over time was constructed. To determine whether an extravascular pixel had tracer accumulation over time (due to BBB permeability), the pixelâs intensity curve was divided by that of the responding artery (i.e., the arterial input function, AIF, representing tracer input). This ratio was termed the BBB permeability index (PI), and extravascular pixels with PI &gt; 1 were identified as pixels with tracer accumulation due to BBB permeability.</p>

<title>Histology and immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Albumin extravasation was confirmed histologically in separate cohorts of rats that were anesthetized and stimulated without craniotomy surgery. Assessment of albumin extravasation was performed using a well-established approach that involves peripheral injection of either labeled-albumin (bovine serum albumin conjugated to Alexa Flour 488, Alexa488-Alb) or albumin-labeling dye (Evans blue, EB â a dye that binds to endogenous albumin and forms a fluorescent complex), followed by histological analysis of brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahishali and Kaya, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ivens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lapilover et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Obermeier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Veksler et al., 2020</xref>). Since extravasated albumin is taken up by astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ivens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Obermeier et al., 2013</xref>, and others), it can be visualized in the brain neuropil after brain removal and fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahishali and Kaya, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ivens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lapilover et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Veksler et al., 2020</xref>). Five rats were injected with Alexa488-Alb (1.7 mg/ml) and five with EB (2%, 20 mg/ml, n=5). The injections were administered via the tail vein. Following injection, rats were transcardially perfused with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were then removed, fixed overnight (4% PFA, 4Â°C), cryoprotected with sucrose gradient (10% followed by 20 and 30% sucrose in PBS) and frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound. Coronal sections (40-Î¼m thick) were obtained using a freezing microtome (Leica Biosystems) and imaged for dye extravasation using a fluorescence microscope (Axioskop 2; Zeiss) equipped with a CCD digital camera (AxioCam MRc 5; Zeiss).</p>
<p>For immunostaining, brain slices were incubated in blocking solution (5% donkey serum in 0.1% Triton X-100/tris-buffered saline (TBS)), then incubated in primary antibody, followed by secondary antibody. Finally, slices were mounted and stained for DAPI (DAPI-Fluoromount-G, Invitrogen) to label nuclei. Staining was performed against glial fibrillary acidic protein (mouse anti GFAPâCy3â¢, Sigma-Aldrich, C9205), Secondary antibody was anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo-Fisher, A21206).</p>

<title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for albumin extravasation</title>
<p>To assess the degree of albumin extravasation following stimulation, forty adult Sprague Dawley male rats (200-300g) were randomly divided into five groups. Rats were anesthetized (ketamine (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg)) and underwent either a 30 min stimulation, sham stimulation (electrodes placed without current delivery), or photothrombosis stroke (PT) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lippmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Schoknecht et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, Rose Bengal was administered intravenously (20 mg/kg) and a halogen light beam was directed for 15 min onto the intact exposed skull over the right somatosensory cortex. Then, rats were deeply anaesthetized and transcardially perfused with cold PBS, and brains were extracted at three time points following stimulation (immediately (real and sham), 4 and 24 h post stimulation) and 24 h post stroke. The ipsi- and contra lateral somatosensory cortices were dissected, weighed, and snap-frozen on dry ice. Fresh frozen samples were then homogenized in PBS + 1% Triton X-100 (v/v). Tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 13000 g for 10 min and supernatants were stored at â80Â°C until further analysis. Albumin levels were determined in diluted samples, using the Rat Albumin ELISA kit (Bethyl Laboratories, TX, USA) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.</p>

<title>Western Blotting</title>
<p>Brain tissues were collected from stimulated and control rats as described above. Protein lysates were separated using 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSâPAGE, Bio-Rad) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were washed with TBS + 0.1% Tween20 (TBST, 3 x 5 min), then blocked with 5% BSA in TBS for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4Â°C with primary antibodies, followed by 2 h incubation with secondary antibodies. Protein bands were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescent HRP substrate Crescendo Immobilon (Millipore). Analysis was performed in ImageJ, and band density levels were expressed as fold-changes to controls after normalization to Î²-actin and controls within the same blot. Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-PSD-95 (1:1500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA1-045), anti-Î²-actin (Loading control, 1:2000, Abcam, ab8226). Secondary antibodies were Goat anti-mouse (1:4000, Abcam, ab205719) and Goat anti-rabbit (1:4000, Abcam, ab97051).</p>

<title>RNA Sequencing &amp; Bioinformatics</title>
<p>Library preparation was performed by the QB3-Berkeley Functional Genomics Laboratory at UC Berkeley. mRNA selection was done with the oligo-dT beads. Both total RNA and oligo dT bead selected mRNA quality was assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Libraries were prepared using the KAPA RNA Hyper Prep kit (Roche KK8540). Truncated universal stub adapters were ligated to cDNA fragments, which were then extended via PCR using unique dual indexing primers into full length Illumina adapters. Library quality was checked on an AATI (now Agilent) Fragment Analyzer. Libraries were then transferred to the QB3-Berkeley Vincent J. Coates Genomics Sequencing Laboratory, also at UC Berkeley. Library molarity was measured via quantitative PCR with the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Roche KK4824) on a BioRad CFX Connect thermal cycler. Libraries were then pooled by molarity and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell for 2 x 150 cycles, targeting at least 25M reads per sample. Fastq files were generated and demultiplexed using Illumina bcl2fastq2 v2.20. No other processing, trimming, or filtering was conducted. RNA-seq reads were aligned using STAR v2.9.1a against UCSC rat genome rn6. Downstream analysis was performed using FastQC v0.11.9, MultiQC v1.11, and featureCounts. R studio was used for data analysis, R v4.0.2. with the packages tidyverse v1.3.1, IHW, DESeq2.

<title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
<p>MRI scans were performed in the imaging center at the Soroka Medical Center using a 3T Philips Ingenia MRI scanner. A high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical scan (3D gradient echo, TE/TR 3.7/8.2 ms, voxel size of 1 mm<sup>3</sup>, 256 x 256 acquisition matrix), followed by a T2-weighted scan (TE/TR = 90/3000 ms, voxel size 0.45 x 0.45 x 4 mm). Functional data were collected by using a gradient echo EPI, with voxel size of 3 x 3 x 3 mm, TE/TR = 35/2000 ms, 83 x 80 acquisition matrix, flip angle of 90Â°, and FOV 109 mm. For calculation of pre-contrast longitudinal relaxation times, variable flip angle method was used (3D T1w-FFE, TE/TR = 2/10 ms, acquisition matrix: 256 x 256, voxel size: 0.89 x 0.89 x 6 mm, flip angles: 5, 15, 20 and 25Â°). Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequence was then acquired (Axial, 3D T1w-FFE, TE/TR = 2/4 ms, acquisition matrix: 192 x 187 (reconstructed to 256 x 256), voxel size: 0.9 x 0.9 x 6 mm, flip angle: 20Â°, Ît = 10 s, temporal repetitions: 100, total scan length: 16.7 min). An intravenous bolus injection (0.1 mmol/kg, 0.5 M) of the gadolinium-based contrast agent gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem, Guerbet, France) was administered using an automatic injector after 5 dynamic scans at a rate of 1.5 ml/s.</p>

<title>fMRI Localizer Motor Task</title>
<p>fMRI was used to localize the brain area activated in response to the experimental motor task. During the fMRI scan, participants were asked to squeeze the stress-ball on cue (with green screen indicating Go and red screen indicating Stop) for a total of 5 experimental blocks. Task-related activation was evaluated for each cue, and voxels with statistically significant activation (t-statistic) were used to construct an âactivation mapâ. The statistical threshold for clusters was set at p&lt;0.05 and corrected for multiple comparisons using family-wise error (FWE) over the whole brain (uncorrected threshold p&lt;0.001) to minimize detection of false positives (type I error).</p>

<title>Preprocessing of functional data</title>
<p>fMRI data preprocessing was performed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping package (SPM12; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK) for MATLAB. The first ten functional images of each run series were discarded to allow stabilization of the magnet. Functional images were realigned and co-registered to the T1-weighted structural image, followed by segmentation and normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Spatial smoothing using Gaussian kernel (FWHM of 6 mm) was performed.</p>

<title>BBB permeability quantification</title>
<p>Analysis was performed as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Serlin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Veksler et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, preprocessing included image registration and normalization to MNI space using SPM12. BBB permeability was calculated using in-house MATLAB script. A linear fit was applied to the later stage of the scan and the slope of contrast agent concentration changes over time was calculated for each voxel. Positive slopes reflected contrast agent accumulation due to BBB modulation. To compensate for physiological (e.g., heart rate, blood flow) and technical (e.g., injection rate) variability, slopes were normalized to the slope of each subjectâs transverse sinus. Values were considered to reflect modulated BBB when exceeding the 95th percentile of the corresponding mean cumulative distribution function from healthy young controls. Voxels that reflect modulated BBB values were color-coded and superimposed on the anatomical scans to illustrate the kinetics, localization, and extent of BBB pathology.</p>

<p>This study builds upon previous work which demonstrated that brain injury results in the entry of a protein called albumin into the brain which then causes diverse effects. The present study shows that prolonged stimulation of a forelimb in a rat leads to albumin entry, and is associated with effects that suggest plasticity is enhanced in the stimulated side of the brain. The strength of evidence was <bold>convincing</bold> and results are <bold>important</bold> because they suggest a previously-considered pathological process may be relevant to the normal brain and have benefits.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study used prolonged stimulation of a limb to examine possible plasticity in somatosensory evoked potentials induced by the stimulation. They also studied the extent that the blood brain barrier (BBB) was opened by the prolonged stimulation and whether that played a role in the plasticity. They found that there was potentiation of the amplitude and area under the curve of the evoked potential after prolonged stimulation and this was long-lasting (&gt;5 hrs). They also implicated extravasation of serum albumin, caveolae-mediated transcytosis, and TGFb signalling, as well as neuronal activity and upregulation of PSD95. Transcriptomics was done and implicated plasticity related genes in the changes after prolonged stimulation, but not proteins associated with the BBB or inflammation. Next, they address the application to humans using a squeeze ball task. They imaged the brain and suggested that the hand activity led to an increased permeability of the vessels, suggesting modulation of the BBB.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the paper are the novelty of the idea that stimulation of the limb can induce cortical plasticity in a normal condition, and it involves the opening of the BBB with albumin entry. In addition, there are many datasets, both rat and human data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The explanation of why prolonged stimulation in the rat was considered relevant to normal conditions is still somewhat weak. The authors argue that the stimulation frequency they used is similar to rhythmic whisker movement. That is a good argument. However, the intensity they used, 2 mA is in the range they say can elicit a seizure if stimulation is 50 Hz. So that weakens the argument.</p>
<p>The authors made a lot of the requested changes but some questions were not addressed or the explanations were so brief that the confusion remained. Please go over the revisions again and make sure sentences are complete, jargon is explained, and arguments/justifications are clear. It will help the reader greatly.</p>
<p>The authors responded to the previous comments of Reviewer 2 regarding experimental design and variability of washout periods. It would be useful to incorporate the response into the paper so the readers know why the authors think the variability was not an important factor in the results.</p>
<p>Comments on the revised version:</p>
<p>The manuscript is improved.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the previous reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The goal of the current study was to evaluate the effect of neuronal activity on blood-brain barrier permeability in the healthy brain, and to determine whether changes in BBB dynamics play a role in cortical plasticity. The authors used a variety of well-validated approaches to first demonstrate that limb stimulation increases BBB permeability. Using in vivo-electrophysiology and pharmacological approaches, the authors demonstrate that albumin is sufficient to induce cortical potentiation and that BBB transporters are necessary for stimulus-induced potentiation. The authors include a transcriptional analysis and differential expression of genes associated with plasticity, TGF-beta signaling, and extracellular matrix were observed following stimulation. Overall, the results obtained in rodents are compelling and support the authors' conclusions that neuronal activity modulates the BBB in the healthy brain and that mechanisms downstream of BBB permeability changes play a role in stimulus-evoked plasticity. These findings were further supported with fMRI and BBB permeability measurements performed in healthy human subjects performing a simple sensorimotor task. There is literature to suggest that there are sex differences in BBB dysfunction in pathophysiological conditions and the authors have acknowledged the use of only males as a minor limitation of the study that should be addressed in the future. Future studies should also test whether the upregulation of OAT3 plays a role in cortical plasticity observed following stimulation. Overall, this study provides novel insights into how neurovascular coupling, BBB permeability, and plasticity interact in the healthy brain.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study builds upon previous work that demonstrated that brain injury results in leakage of albumin across the blood brain barrier, resulting in activation of TGF-beta in astrocytes. Consequently, this leads to decreased glutamate uptake, reduced buffering of extracellular potassium and hyperexcitability. This study asks whether such a process can play a physiological role in cortical plasticity. They first show that stimulation of a forelimb for 30 minutes in a rat results in leakage of the blood brain barrier and extravasation of albumin on the contralateral but not ipsilateral cortex. The authors propose that the leakage is dependent upon neuronal excitability and is associated with an enhancement of excitatory transmission. Inhibiting the transport of albumin or the activation of TGF-beta prevents the enhancement of excitatory transmission. In addition, gene expression associated with TGF-beta activation, synaptic plasticity and extracellular matrix are enhanced on the &quot;stimulated&quot; hemisphere. That this may translate to humans is demonstrated by a break down in the blood brain barrier following activation of brain areas through a motor task.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study is novel and the results are potentially important as they demonstrate an unexpected break down of the blood brain barrier with physiological activity and this may serve a physiological purpose, affecting synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p>The strengths of the study are:</p>
<p>(1) The use of an in vivo model with multiple methods to investigate the blood brain barrier response to a forelimb stimulation.</p>
<p>(2) The determination of a potential functional role for the observed leakage of the blood brain barrier from both a genetic and electrophysiological view point</p>
<p>(3) The demonstration that inhibiting different points in the putative pathway from activation of the cortex to transport of albumin and activation of the TGF-beta pathway, the effect on synaptic enhancement could be prevented.  (4) Preliminary experiments demonstrating a similar observation of activity dependent break down of the blood brain barrier in humans.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors adequately addressed most of my points. A few remain:</p>
<p>(1) Although the reviewers have addressed the possible effects of anaesthesia on neuro-vascular coupling. They have not mentioned or addressed the possible effects of ketamine (an NMDA receptor antagonist) on synaptic plasticity. Indeed, the low percentage of SEP increase following potentiation (10-20%) could perhaps be explained by partial block of NMDA receptors by ketamine.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and apologize for this oversight. This important issue is now addressed in the Discussion.</p>
<p>âNotably, the antagonistic effect of ketamine on NMDA receptors might attenuate the magnitude of SEP potentiation recorded in our experiments (Anis et al., 1983; Salt et al., 1988).â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The experimental paradigms remain unclear to me. Now, it appears that drugs are applied for 50 minutes and that the stimulation occurs during the &quot;washout period&quot;. The more conventional approach would be to have the drug application during the stimulation period to determine if the drugs occlude or enhance the effects of stimulation and then washout the drugs. The problem is that drugs variably washout at different rates depending upon their lipid solubility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the more conventional approach would have been to continue applying the drug throughout the experiment and that differential rates of washout may add variability to our experiments. However, despite this limitation, within each treatment group we found that the SEP response at 50 minutes (immediately after the drug application window) does not differ from SEP response at 80 minutes (after 30 minutes of stimulation and washout) [Figure 3H&amp;G]. This suggests that the drug effects were still present despite terminating drug application and performing potentiation-inducing stimulation. Moreover, our analysis showed that animals within each treatment group (except AP5) had similar SEP responses with little intra-group variability.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It is still not clear to what extent the experimenters and those doing the analysis were blinded to group. If one or both were blind to group, then please put this in the methods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. We revised the Methods section to clearly confirm that data was collected and analyzed blindly.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions are not compelling however because of a lack of explanation of methods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revised paper, we added a section titled âstudy designâ that presents an overview of the experimental approach.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The explanation of why prolonged stimulation in the rat was considered relevant to normal conditions should be as clear in the paper as it is in the rebuttal.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added a new paragraph to the Discussion section explaining this point as we did in the rebuttal:</p>
<p>âOur animal experiments show that a 30 min limb stimulation (at 6Hz and 2mA) increases cross-BBB influx, while a 1 min stimulation (of similar frequency and magnitude) does not. We believe that both types of stimulations fall within the physiological range because our continuous electrophysiological recordings showed no signs of epileptiform or otherwise pathological activity. Moreover, the recorded SEP levels were similar to those reported in previous physiological LTP studies in rats (Eckert &amp; Abraham, 2010; Han et al., 2015; MÃ©gevand et al., 2009) and humans (McGregor et al., 2016). In humans, skill acquisition often involves motor training sessions that last â¥30 minutes (Bengtsson et al., 2005; Classen et al., 1998) and result in physiological plasticity of sensory and motor systems (Classen et al., 1998; Draganski et al., 2004; Sagi et al., 2012). Hence, the experimental task in our human study (30 minutes of repetitive squeezing of an elastic stress-ball) is likely to represent physiological activity, with neuronal activation in primarily motor and sensory areas (Halder et al., 2005). Future human and animal studies are needed to explore the BBB modulating effects of additional stimulation protocols â with varying durations, frequencies, and magnitudes. Such studies may also elucidate the temporal and ultrastructural characteristics that differentiate between physiological and pathological BBB modulation. â</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript is improved but there are still suggestions that do not appear to have been addressed. More experiments are not involved in addressing these concerns but one wants the paper to be clarified in terms of what was done.</p>
<p>Figures. Please use arrows to point to the effect that the reader should see. Please note what the main point is.</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>Please add explanations, exact p values, and other revisions in the rebuttal to the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Rebuttal explanations were added to the paper and p values appear in figure legends.</p>

<p>Fig 1d shows a seizure-like event which the authors don't think is a seizure because it lacks a depolarization ship. This explanation is not convincing because a LFP would not necessarily show a depolarization ship. Another argument of a discussion of the event as a seizure is warranted. Note that expanding the trace might also show it is unlike a seizure. Regarding the idea that 6Hz 2 mA stimuli for 30 min are physiological, the authors make three arguments which are not clear. First, no epileptiform activity was found, but in Fig. 1 it looks like a seizure occurred. Second, memory and skill acquisition in humans open involve a similar training duration - but what about 6Hz 2 mA?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Rats are known to rhythmically move their whiskers at frequencies ranging between 5 and 15 Hz (MÃ©gevand et al., 2009). We agree that there is no clear way to justify the similarity between the experimental design in humans and rats. However, we believe that both paradigms (paw stimulation in rats and ball squeeze in humans) represent non-pathological input that we found to modulate barrier permeability. This argument was added to the discussion of the paper:</p>
<p>âWe believe that both types of stimulations fall within the physiological range because in rats, activity between 515 Hz represents physiological rhythmic whisker movement during environment exploration (MÃ©gevand et al., 2009).â</p>
<p>Seizures are typically induced in rats via direct tetanic stimulation of the brain (at 50 Hz and 0.3-2.5mA) or maximal electroshock test to the cornea (at 50 Hz and 150 mA) (Swinyard et al., 1952). We, therefore, assert that the activity we observe represents physiological responses and not seizures. This argument is beyond the scope of the current paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Please note a limitation is that the high level of serum albumin is unlikely to be physiological but may not have been as high in the animal because of the low diffusion rate and degradation (please add the refs in the rebuttal).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you, we added the following to the Results section:</p>
<p>âThe relatively high concentration of albumin was chosen to account for factors that lower its effective tissue concentration such as its low diffusion rate and its likelihood to encounter a degradation site or a cross-BBB efflux transporter (Tao &amp; Nicholson, 1996; Zhang &amp; Pardridge, 2001).â</p>

<p>m-n. Please mark areas of interest with arrows.  m. the top right two images are unclear. I suggest making them say ipsi inset and contra inset instead of using asterisks.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. We added the ipsi and contra labels to panels in m. The images in panel n represent a phenomenon with no particular region of interest, but rather peri-vascular tracer accumulation along the entire depicted blood vessel. We clarified that panel n represents a separate experiment than panel m: ân. In an animal injected with both EB and NaFlu post stimulation, fluorescence imaging shows extravascular accumulation of both tracers along a cortical small vessel in the stimulated hemisphere.â</p>

<p>(2) a. Middle. What are the vertical lines at the top? The rebuttal states that was explained in the revised legends but I don't see it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our apologies. We now included an explanation that âan excerpt of the stimulation trace is shown above the middle LFP traceâ.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>c and d are very different field potentials in shape and therefore hard to compare. The rebuttal addresses this but the explanation is not in the revised text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that there is variability in SEP responses between animals. We now added a statement acknowledging this in the methods section: âTo overcome potential variability in SEP morphology between animals (MÃ©gevand et al., 2009), each animalâs plasticity measures (max amplitude and AUC of post stimulation SEP) were compared to the same measures at baseline.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In d, it is not clear there is potentiation because the traces are not aligned.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All panels depicting SEP traces represent raw data with no alignment. The shift observed in panel d exemplifies why we compare post-stimulation parameters of max amplitude and area under curve to baseline in each animal.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>d. Why is there an oscillation superimposed on all traces except CNQX?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this is an interesting question. Future studies should determine the source of this SEP pattern.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) What does the line and the number 2 mean? How were data normalized? What was counted? What area of cortex?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The number 2 refers to the scale bar line, meaning a log fold change of 2 reflects the size of the scale bar line.</p>
<p>The plot shows the log fold change against the mean count of each gene in the contralateral somatosensory cortex between 1 and 24 hours after stimulation.</p>
<p>The x axis title was changed to âmean expressionâ and the legend was modified to:</p>
<p>âScatter plot of gene expression from RNA-seq in the contralateral somatosensory cortex 24 vs. 1 h after 30 min stimulation. The y axis represents the log fold change, and the x axis represents the mean expression levels (see methods, RNA Sequencing &amp; Bioinformatics). Blue dots indicate statistically significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by Wald Test (n=8 rats per group).â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>How were the pericytes, smooth muscle cells, ,etc. distinguished?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This was explained under Methods-&gt;RNA Sequencing &amp; Bioinformatics: âAnalysis of cell-specific and vascular zonation genes was performed as described (Vanlandewijck et al., 2018), using the database provided in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://betsholtzlab.org/VascularSingleCells/database.html">(http://betsholtzlab.org/VascularSingleCells/database.html)</ext-link>.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>What were the chi square statistics? If there were cells used instead of rats, please justify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. The legend was expanded to include the following:</p>
<p>âThe contralateral somatosensory cortex was found to have a significantly higher number of DEGs related to synaptic plasticity, than the ipsilateral side (***p&lt;0.001, Chi-square).â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) b. what do the icons mean?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the icons were confusing. We simplified this panel to just show when participants were asked to squeeze the ball (black icon). This explanation was added to the Figure legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Abbreviations?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Abbreviations of MRI protocols were added to the figure legend for clarity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In c-e what are the units of measure? Fold-change?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The units represent t-statistics values for each voxel. The label ât-statisticâ was added to the figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>What are the white Iines, + and - signs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The white lines point to voxels of highest activation (t-statistic). This was added to the legend.</p>
<p>And these are not +/- signs these are voxels with significant activation which only appear similar.</p>

<p>Supplemental Fig. 4.</p>
<p>Original question: If ipsilateral and contralateral showed many changes why do the authors think the effects were only contralateral?</p>
<p>The authors replied: Our gene analysis was designed to complement our in vivo and histological findings, by assessing the magnitude of change in differentially expressed genes (DEGs). This analysis showed that: (1) the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulus has significantly more DEGs than the ipsilateral hemisphere; and (2) the DEGs were related to synaptic plasticity and TGF-b signaling. These findings strengthen the hypothesis raised by our in vivo and histological experiments.</p>
<p>Could the authors clarify the answer to the question in the text?</p>

<p>Thank you. This section was added to the Discussion.</p>
