<title>Abstract</title><p>Somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are heavily implicated as important drivers of ageing and age-related diseases. Their pathological effect can be partially counteracted by increasing the absolute amount of wild-type mtDNA via moderately upregulating TFAM, a protein important for mtDNA packaging and expression. However, strong TFAM overexpression can also have detrimental effects as it results in hypercompaction of the mtDNA and subsequent impairment of mtDNA gene expression. In this study, we have experimentally addressed the propensity of moderate TFAM modulation to improve the premature ageing phenotypes of mtDNA mutator mice, carrying random mtDNA mutations. Surprisingly, we detect tissue-specific endogenous compensatory mechanisms acting in mtDNA mutator mice which largely affects the outcome of TFAM modulation. Accordingly, moderate overexpression of TFAM can have both negative and beneficial effects in different tissues of mtDNA mutator mice. We see a similar behavior for moderate TFAM reduction, which improves brown adipocyte tissue homeostasis, while other tissues are largely unaffected. Our findings highlight that regulation of copy number and gene expression of mtDNA is complex and cause tissue-specific effects that should be considered when modulating TFAM levels. Additionally, we suggest that TFAM is not the sole determinant of mtDNA copy number in situations where oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is compromised but other important players must be involved.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ageing in animals is widely believed to be caused by accumulation of multiple types of damage and, from an evolutionary point of view, there has been little selective pressure to maintain efficient repair and maintenance of tissues at a post-reproductive, old age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Although the decline of multiple pathways plays an important role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, the decrease of mitochondrial function is a prominent feature of ageing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. In particular, somatic mutagenesis of mtDNA is heavily associated with mammalian ageing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Notably, low levels of evenly distributed mtDNA mutations may not influence the ageing process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, but rather the spatially restricted accumulation of pathogenic mtDNA mutations to high levels by clonal expansion in individual cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In ageing humans, such accumulation of mtDNA mutations result in focal respiratory chain dysfunction in a subset of cells in various tissues, e.g., in the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and colonic crypts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. While it was long unclear whether mtDNA mutations are a mere consequence of the ageing process or contribute to cell loss and organ dysfunction, the causal role of somatic mtDNA mutations in ageing was established using genetic mouse models. In the mtDNA mutator mouse model, the expression of an exonuclease-deficient catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase (POLG<sup>D257A</sup>; genotype: <italic>Polg</italic><sup>mut/mut</sup>) leads to extensive accumulation of mtDNA mutations causing a variety of premature ageing symptoms that drastically shorten life span<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. However, it should be noted that the importance of mtDNA as a driver of ageing varies in metazoans and seems to not affect the life span in short-lived organisms. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> life span is not affected if mtDNA replication is abrogated by knockout of <italic>Polg</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, and in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> a massive accumulation of somatic mutations of mtDNA caused by the expression of an exonuclease-deficient version of POLG does not limit life span<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The somatic mtDNA mutations associated with mammalian ageing are mostly generated during the extensive mtDNA replication that occurs during embryogenesis and postnatal development and thereafter undergo somatic segregation during adult life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. It is possible that the limited number of cells and cell divisions in some metazoans, like <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, are insufficient to create the clonal expansion of mtDNA mutations and mosaic respiratory chain deficiency in the adult organism to limit life span. In contrast, somatic mtDNA mutations and mosaic respiratory chain deficiency seem to be ubiquitous findings in old mammals, including humans, and are experimentally linked to the ageing process through studies in the mtDNA mutator mouse strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Similar to ageing humans, most somatic mtDNA mutations in the mtDNA mutator mouse are formed during embryogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and clonal expansion of mutated mtDNA has been reported in some organs, e.g., heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and colonic crypts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Importantly, the mtDNA mutator mouse model not only clarified the direct link between mtDNA mutations and ageing phenotypes, but it is also a valuable tool to develop strategies to mitigate the ageing process. For example, increasing mitochondrial mass by overexpressing the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), an important regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, ameliorated the skeletal muscle and heart phenotype of the mtDNA mutator mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, PGC-1α is also involved in numerous other cellular processes and aberrant activation can be deleterious, emphasizing the need for alternative strategies to treat the natural ageing process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. A more direct approach to improving the phenotypes of the mtDNA mutator mouse is to increase the absolute amount of mtDNA molecules by upregulation of the total mtDNA copy number. While this does not affect the fraction of mutated mtDNA, the increase in the absolute number of wildtype mtDNA segments raises the likelihood that sufficient functional gene products can be made to enable sufficient OXPHOS function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Modulation of mtDNA copy number can be achieved by genetically altering the levels of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which packages mtDNA into nucleoids. Heterozygous knockout of <italic>Tfam</italic> in wild-type mice results in ∼50% decrease of mtDNA levels, whereas moderate overexpression of <italic>Tfam</italic> leads to ∼50% increase in mtDNA levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Importantly, moderate decrease or increase in TFAM levels mainly affects mtDNA copy number but does only mildly or not at all alter mtDNA gene expression, respiratory chain function or mitochondrial mass in mice without mtDNA mutations. Employing this strategy to increase mtDNA levels in the mtDNA mutator mouse revealed a rescuing effect on the early-onset male infertility phenotype at four months of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Similarly, a beneficial impact was also evident in the m.C5024T tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> mouse model where moderate overexpression of TFAM and the associated mtDNA increase improved the cardiomyopathy phenotype in aged mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Despite these largely positive outcomes of upregulating mtDNA copy number via moderate TFAM overexpression, care must be taken as strong overexpression of TFAM is known to lead to respiratory chain deficiency in skeletal muscle and shorten the life span in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. It is now clear that the TFAM-to-mtDNA ratio determines the compaction of the nucleoid, and <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments have established that a high degree of nucleoid compaction will shut off mtDNA expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we investigated whether mtDNA copy number modulation via moderate TFAM alteration impacts the ageing phenotypes in mtDNA mutator mice. Surprisingly, a moderate increase of TFAM levels did not translate to a proportional modulation of the mtDNA copy number, as previously observed in mice with wild-type mtDNA or in the tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> mouse model. Instead, the mtDNA mutator mouse shows a trend towards endogenous upregulation of mtDNA copy number in some tissues and experimental modulation of TFAM will be added to this increase to result in tissue-specific effects with varying TFAM-to-mtDNA ratios that impact mtDNA gene expression in different ways. In colon, TFAM overexpression reduced mtDNA gene expression, negatively affecting OXPHOS and leading to a marked increase in expression of <italic>Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2</italic> (<italic>Mthfd2)</italic>, a marker for mitochondrial dysfunction. In contrast, in brown adipose tissue (BAT), a decrease in TFAM levels normalized <italic>Uncoupling protein 1</italic> (<italic>Ucp1)</italic> expression. In summary, mtDNA copy number regulation is more complex than suggested by previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and the TFAM-to-mtDNA ratio seems to be finely tuned in a tissue-specific manner. Alterations of the ratio can have different outcomes in different tissues and attempts to increase TFAM levels to counteract pathologies caused by mitochondrial dysfunction must therefore be carefully evaluated.</p>

<title>Moderate alterations of TFAM levels only mildly affect pathology in aged mtDNA mutator mice</title>
<p>To experimentally test the impact of mtDNA copy number modulation on the premature ageing phenotypes of mtDNA mutator mice, we generated hemizygous Polg<sup>-/mut</sup> mice with moderately increased (<italic>Tfam</italic><sup>+/OE</sup>) or decreased (<italic>Tfam</italic><sup>+/-</sup>) TFAM levels. We first created heterozygous Polg knockout (<italic>Polg</italic><sup>+/-</sup>) females that also carry either an <italic>Tfam</italic><sup>+/OE</sup> or <italic>Tfam</italic><sup>+/-</sup> allele, and subsequently mated those females to heterozygous mtDNA mutator (<italic>Polg</italic><sup>+/mut</sup>) males (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>). Employing this mating scheme ensures that the resulting mice (<italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup>) carry a substantial load of <italic>de novo</italic> generated somatic mtDNA mutations and prevent that they inherit maternally transmitted mtDNA mutations from their mothers, which otherwise would aggravate the phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Therefore, in the studied <italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup> mice, all mtDNA mutations are generated <italic>de novo</italic> during embryonic and postnatal life. Both the “classical” mtDNA mutator mice (<italic>Polg</italic><sup>mut/mut</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and the mtDNA mutator mice generated in this study (<italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup>) develop profound premature ageing phenotypes at the age of 35 weeks. The mtDNA mutator mice (<italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup>) had a markedly reduced body weight at the age of 35 weeks and increasing TFAM levels (<italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup>; <italic>Tfam</italic><sup>+/OE</sup>) led to a statistically significant further, albeit slight, reduction of body weight (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In contrast, reduction of TFAM expression (<italic>Polg<sup>-/mut</sup>; Tfam<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) did not have any statistically significant effect on the reduced body weight of mtDNA mutator mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The organ-to-body weight ratios were largely unaffected by variations in TFAM expression, with the exception of testis. In testis, we observed a clear rescue effect in mtDNA mutator mice with increased TFAM levels (<italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup>; <italic>Tfam</italic><sup>+/OE</sup>) resulting in a testis to body weight ratio similar to wildtype mice, whereas reduced TFAM levels (<italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup>; <italic>Tfam</italic><sup>+/-</sup>) exacerbated the phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, B-D), consistent with our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. These results demonstrate that TFAM modulation does not grossly impact most ageing phenotypes of the mtDNA mutator mouse.</p>

<title>Tissue-specific effects on mtDNA copy number and TFAM-to-mtDNA ratios</title>
<p>The beneficial effect of moderate TFAM overexpression on the testis phenotype, and the absence of any rescue effect on the increased heart and spleen phenotype of <italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup>; <italic>Tfam</italic><sup>+/OE</sup> mice prompted us to perform further characterization of mtDNA expression in different tissues. To this end, we analyzed the relative mtDNA copy number by qPCR using three different probes, i.e., <italic>NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 1</italic> (<italic>mt-Nd1</italic>), <italic>ATP synthase subunit a</italic> (<italic>mt-Atp6</italic>) and <italic>Cytochrome b</italic> (<italic>mt-CytB</italic>). It should be noted that the mtDNA mutator mice carry linear deleted mtDNA molecules spanning the major arc of mtDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). These linear deletions are continuously formed replication intermediates and represent around 30% of the total mtDNA in all investigated tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. <italic>Mt-Nd1</italic> hybridizes to a genomic region corresponding to the minor arc of the mtDNA and is hence a good proxy for full-length mtDNA, whereas <italic>mt-Atp6</italic> and <italic>mt-CytB</italic> hybridize to genomic regions in the major arc of mtDNA and therefore are good indicators of total mtDNA levels, including deleted mtDNA molecules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The mtDNA mutator mice spontaneously upregulated the total mtDNA copy number in several tissues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B-F, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2A</xref>), similar to what has previously been shown for mice harboring a point mutation in the tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, increased TFAM levels did not cause any additional relative mtDNA copy number change in either liver or heart of <italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup>; <italic>Tfam</italic><sup>+/OE</sup> mice and only a very subtle difference in the colon (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-D</xref>). The qPCR results for the liver were independently confirmed by Southern blot analyses (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>, B and C). In contrast, increased TFAM levels caused an additional relative mtDNA copy number increase in brown adipose tissue and spleen of <italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup>; <italic>Tfam</italic><sup>+/OE</sup> mice compared to mtDNA mutator mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> E,F).</p>

<p>Changes in TFAM levels without a concomitant change in mtDNA levels are potentially problematic, because the TFAM-to-mtDNA ratio will be impacted to affect nucleoid compaction, which, in turn, impacts mtDNA expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.

<p>Taken together, these findings show that modulation of TFAM expression in the severely affected mtDNA mutator mouse has tissue-specific effects on TFAM-to-mtDNA ratios, which is well known to influence nucleoid compaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We therefore proceeded to investigate the pathophysiological effects of TFAM modulation in different organs of the mtDNA mutator mouse. We hypothesized that in tissues where TFAM overexpression increases the TFAM-to-mtDNA ratio, the mtDNA expression will be reduced and negatively impact tissue function. In contrast, we speculated that in tissues where elevated TFAM levels increase mtDNA copy number, the mitochondrial function would improve, in line with previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Moderate TFAM overexpression impairs mtDNA expression in the liver of mtDNA mutator mice</title>
<p>In the liver, TFAM overexpression resulted in a decrease of <italic>mt-Atp6</italic> and <italic>mt-Cytb</italic> transcript levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) as predicted by the increased TFAM-to-mtDNA ratio.

Of note, we did not only observe a reduction in levels of proteins encoded by the mtDNA, e.g., Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COX1) and Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 (COX2) of complex IV, but also of OXPHOS subunits encoded by the nuclear DNA, e.g., NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Subunit B8 (NDUFB8) of complex I. This is an expected secondary effect as mtDNA gene expression is necessary for the stability of nucleus-encoded OXPHOS complex subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. The levels of the ATP Synthase F1 Subunit Alpha (ATP5A) protein of complex V (ATP synthase) were largely unaffected, which goes well in line with previous reports showing that impaired mtDNA expression leads to the formation of a stable subcomplex containing the F1 subunit of complex V of the OXPHOS system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.

<p>We proceeded to measure the enzyme activities of individual OXPHOS complexes in liver mitochondria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The complex I and complex IV activities were reduced to about 50% in <italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup>; <italic>Tfam</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice in comparison with wild-type mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). However, we did not see any further alteration of the reduced enzyme activities induced by TFAM overexpression or reduced TFAM expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Interestingly, we detected a significant increase in complex II and complex II + complex III activity upon TFAM overexpression, which can partially be explained by the increased complex II protein levels we oberseved in <italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup>; <italic>Tfam</italic><sup>+/OE</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, B and C). The <italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup>; <italic>Tfam</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice had normal expression of <italic>Activating Transcription Factor 4</italic> (<italic>Atf4)</italic> and <italic>Activating Transcription Factor 5 (Atf5)</italic> in liver, whereas the expression of <italic>Mthfd2</italic> was markedly increased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). We have previously reported that increased <italic>Mthfd2</italic> expression is a sensitive marker of mitochondrial dysfunction and that <italic>Mthfd2</italic> expression increases as at OXPHOS dysfunction progresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. The finding of increased <italic>Mthfd2</italic> expression in <italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup>; <italic>Tfam</italic><sup>+/+</sup> liver is thus consistent with the observed OXPHOS dysfunction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, C and D). This was unaltered by TFAM overexpression.</p>
<p>We also observed an increase of Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21) levels in plasma of <italic>Polg<sup>-/mut</sup>; Tfam<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice pointing to a negative effect on energy homeostasis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Interestingly, the plasma levels of FGF21 were further increased in <italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup>; <italic>Tfam<sup>+/OE</sup></italic>mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). These findings are consistent with the proposed action of FGF21 as a starvation hormone and may reflect the progression of body weight loss in <italic>Polg<sup>-/mut</sup>; Tfam<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and additional body weight reduction in <italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup>; <italic>Tfam<sup>+/OE</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, moderate TFAM overexpression does not improve the liver phenotype of mtDNA mutator mice. On the contrary, elevating TFAM had a negative effect on mtDNA gene expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>), which could be linked to the increased TFAM-to-mtDNA ratio (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) causing tighter compaction of the mitochondrial nucleoid. The mtDNA mutator mouse has abundant point mutations in mtDNA that will affect tRNAs and rRNAs thus impairing mitochondrial translation, as well as abundant point mutations causing amino acid substitutions in the protein coding genes of mtDNA thus causing dysfunction or impaired stability of respiratory chain complexes. The impaired mtDNA gene expression caused by increased nucleoid compaction poses an additional burden on the already compromised OXPHOS dysfunction in mtDNA mutator mice. The marked additional increase in FGF21 levels in <italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup>; <italic>Tfam<sup>+/OE</sup></italic>mice indicates that TFAM overexpression has a negative impact on liver physiology in mtDNA mutator mice.</p>

<p>All in all, these results demonstrate that the mtDNA mutator hearts upregulate TFAM protein levels, likely as a compensatory mechanism. However, the increased TFAM levels do not lead to a concomitant increase in mtDNA levels, but instead result in an increased TFAM-to-mtDNA ratio and reduced steady-state levels of mitochondrial transcripts. TFAM overexpression does not further affect this endogenous compensatory response and causes no additional increase in mtDNA levels. Thus, neither moderate TFAM overexpression nor reduced TFAM expression affect the heart phenotype of mtDNA mutator mice.</p>

<p>Taken together, our data show that moderate TFAM overexpression in BAT causes an increase in mtDNA copy number without affecting mtDNA expression. While this could potentially lead to a beneficial effect on BAT, we did not observe any rescue effect when assessing transcript and protein levels of key factors important for BAT function. In contrast, reduced TFAM levels led to a considerable burst in mtDNA gene expression which surprisingly ameliorated the expression of markers for the thermogenic competence of BAT, hence likely positively affecting BAT function.</p>

This resembles the previously reported situation in testis and heart where moderate TFAM overexpression in young <italic>Polg</italic><sup>mut/mut</sup> mice or aged tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>-mutant mice, respectively, exerted a beneficial effect by increasing the absolute amount of mtDNA without affecting the mtDNA mutation load<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. To assess whether the increased mtDNA copy number in <italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup>; <italic>Tfam</italic><sup>+/OE</sup> mice led to amelioration of the premature ageing phenotype in the spleen, we measured the levels of several cytokines in plasma. The mtDNA mutator mice demonstrated elevated Interleukin 5 (IL-5) and C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2) cytokine levels in plasma and increased <italic>ll5</italic> transcript levels in spleen (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>).

The levels of a range of other cytokines in plasma did not change (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>). We determined the proportion of immune cell populations in spleen by using gene expression markers and found a significant reduction of all T helper cell lineage markers (<italic>T-Box Transcription Factor 21</italic> (<italic>Tbx21), GATA Binding Protein 3 (Gata3), RAR Related Orphan Receptor C (Rorc)</italic> and <italic>Forkhead Box P3</italic> (<italic>Foxp3)</italic>) in mtDNA mutator spleen.

<p>Finally, we subjected spleen samples to tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomic analysis to reveal any further beneficial or detrimental effects of TFAM modulation. In comparison with wild-type mice, the <italic>Polg</italic><sup>-/mut</sup>; <italic>Tfam</italic><sup>+/+</sup> spleen showed upregulation of proteins involved in heme biosynthesis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) defense pathways.

The latter is possibly due to altered ROS signaling which is an important player for reshuffling hematopoietic cell populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Increasing TFAM levels mitigated the induction of both of these pathways (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 4</xref>). The beneficial effect can potentially be attributed to an acute improvement of OXPHOS function due to the increased levels of wildtype mtDNA segments, to a long-term proliferative advantage and hence clonal expansion of cells harboring less mutated mtDNA molecules, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>To summarize, TFAM elevation evokes corresponding changes of mtDNA levels in the spleen, while mtDNA gene expression is unaffected.

<p>We demonstrate here that even moderate changes of TFAM levels can have drastically different outcomes on the premature ageing phenotypes of mtDNA mutator mice. Depending on the tissue, increase in TFAM levels can be detrimental or beneficial. Likewise, reducing TFAM levels also shows ambivalent effects. Whereas most tissues did not seem to be affected by reduced TFAM levels, BAT gene expression was reconstituted indicating normalized physiology. This highlights the complexity and tissue-specificity of the regulation mtDNA copy number and expression and warrants careful evaluation of the therapeutic potential of TFAM alterations in different disease settings.</p>
<p>Somatic mutations of mtDNA are important contributors to the ageing process and are found in various common age-associated diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, diabetes, and cardiac disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. They act by causing focal respiratory chain dysfunction, eventually compromising cell function and tissue homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Several elegant strategies have been developed to ameliorate the accompanying pathology. One strategy has focused on increasing mitochondrial mass by overexpressing PGC-1α and has been effective in improving the skeletal muscle and heart phenotypes of the mtDNA mutator mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, PGC-1α levels must be carefully titrated as it is involved in several other cellular processes and as aberrant activation of PGC-1α can be harmful<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Similarly, tampering with mitochondrial mass might be problematic given the diverse functional roles of mitochondria. Another promising and more direct strategy is to increase the mtDNA copy number, and thereby the absolute amount of wild-type mtDNA molecules, by raising TFAM levels. Notably, also TFAM modulation is not without risk because mtDNA copy number does follow TFAM levels only up until a certain point, which seems to be tissue specific. Increasing TFAM levels beyond this point does not result in a further rise in mtDNA copy number, but instead increases the TFAM-to-mtDNA ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The TFAM-to-mtDNA ratio determines nucleoid compaction, which, in turn, is crucial for mtDNA gene expression. Strong TFAM overexpression can therefore lead to impaired mtDNA expression and respiratory chain deficiency in a tissue-specific manner, and eventually shorten the life span of the mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, moderate TFAM overexpression by about 50% has been shown to be well tolerated in all mouse models investigated so far<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Indeed, this rational also demonstrated to be effective in rescuing the early-onset male infertility phenotype in mtDNA mutator mice of 4 months of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The TFAM increase resulted in doubling of the mtDNA copy number in mouse testis. While the total mtDNA mutation load was unaltered, the increased mtDNA levels thus led to a higher absolute number of mtDNA molecules carrying segments without mutations. Likewise, increasing the absolute number of wild-type mtDNA copies via moderately increasing TFAM expression in the m.C5024T tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> mouse model showed a beneficial effect on the cardiomyopathy phenotype in aged mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We did not observe ubiquitously beneficial effects when employing moderate TFAM overexpression to alleviate the premature ageing phenotypes of mtDNA mutator mice. On the one hand, TFAM elevation in spleen led to a concomitant increase of full-length mtDNA translating into improved spleen homoeostasis. On the other hand, increasing TFAM levels in liver did not result in higher mtDNA levels but instead caused impaired mtDNA expression. The tissue-specific responses in mtDNA mutator mice differs from what was seen in mice without mtDNA mutations or in mice carrying the heteroplasmic pathogenic m.C5024T tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> mutation as well as mice carrying a mtDNA deletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The response in mtDNA mutator mice resembles the tissue-specific effects seen in mice with very strong TFAM overexpression where the mtDNA levels follow TFAM levels only up to a certain point in a tissue-specific manner. The discrepancy in outcomes of moderate TFAM overexpression can potentially be explained b y the varying presence of compensatory mechanisms attributed to different levels of OXPHOS malfunction in the investigated mouse models. The m.C5024T tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> mouse model harbors a heteroplasmic maternally inherited pathogenic mtDNA mutation that at high levels causes a mitochondrial translational defect which mildly affects OXPHOS protein levels and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In contrast, the mtDNA mutator mouse continuously generates new mtDNA mutations every time an mtDNA molecule is replicated and it is therefore much more severely affected. The abundant mtDNA mutations in the mtDNA mutator mice affects the tRNAs and rRNAs needed for mitochondrial translation and cause abundant amino acid substitutions in the mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS subunits. The OXPHOS deficiency in the mtDNA mutator mice is thus caused by a combination of reduced synthesis mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS subunits and synthesis of mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS subunits with defective function, which will reduce both the levels and the function of the OXPHOS complexes. The more pronounced pathology in mtDNA mutator mice likely explains the activation of compensatory mechanisms consistent with the intrinsic upregulation of TFAM found in the heart. As such, TFAM is necessary but not sufficient to control mtDNA levels under pathological conditions on its own, but other licensing factors seem to be limiting. While TFAM seems to be the main protein coating mtDNA, the precise stoichiometry and positioning likely alters between different cellular states, providing access for other proteins such as the mitochondrial single-stranded DNA binding protein (mtSSB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Additionally, further licensing factors could, for example, include the abundance of other proteins involved in mtDNA replication and expression and goes in line with previous studies in cultured mammalian cells as well as budding yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Notably, the severity of the OXPHOS dysfunction largely differed between tissues and, accordingly, the endogenous compensatory mechanisms as well as the rescuing efficacy of TFAM modulation was tissue specific. The different vulnerability of a given tissue towards OXPHOS dysfunction caused by mtDNA mutations is likely dependent on its physiology, metabolism, proliferative character, absolute mtDNA levels, mtDNA turnover rates, the TFAM-to-mtDNA ratios and additional factors.</p>
<p>In summary, the mtDNA mutator mouse shows tissue-specific endogenous compensatory mechanisms in response to the continuous mutagenesis of mtDNA, including the upregulation of TFAM expression, elevated mtDNA copy number, as well as altered mtDNA gene expression. This likely limits the impact of genetic manipulation of TFAM expression and explains the variable tissue-specific consequences of altered TFAM expression on mtDNA copy number, mtDNA gene expression and tissue physiology. Importantly, this also clearly demonstrates that TFAM is not the only determinant of mtDNA levels under pathological conditions, but argues that other factors involved in mtDNA replication must play a limiting role. Identifying these additional molecular players holds the promise to more accurately intervene with the ageing process and counteract other pathological entities caused by mtDNA mutations including mitochondrial disorders, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and cardiac disorders.</p>

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> study that examines the role of TFAM, a protein that helps maintain mtDNA, in mtDNA mutator mice. With <bold>convincing</bold> evidence, the authors have demonstrated that TFAM's counteractive role in mtDNA mutator mice is tissue-specific. The study does a thorough job of assessing the impact of modulating TFAM levels in a polg mutator mouse model of aging. The authors have thoroughly addressed all the points raised during the first round of review.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Kremer et al. characterizes the tissue-specific responses to changes in TFAM levels and mtDNA copy number in prematurely aging mice (polg mutator model). The authors find that overexpression of TFAM can have beneficial or detrimental effects depending on the tissue type. For instance, increased TFAM levels increase mtDNA copy number in the spleen and improve spleen homeostasis but do not elevate mtDNA copy number in the liver and impair mtDNA expression. Similarly, the consequences of reduced TFAM expression are tissue-specific. Reduced TFAM levels improve brown adipocyte tissue function while other tissues are unaffected. The authors conclude that these tissue-specific responses to altered TFAM levels demonstrate that there are tissue-specific endogenous compensatory mechanisms in response to the continuous mutagenesis produced in the prematurely aging mice model, including upregulation of TFAM expression, elevated mtDNA copy number, and altered mtDNA gene expression. Thus, the impact of genetically manipulating global TFAM expression is limited and there must be other determinants of mtDNA copy number under pathological conditions beyond TFAM.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this is an interesting study. It does a good job of demonstrating that given the multi-functional role of TFAM, the outcome of manipulating its activity is complex.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No major weaknesses noted. The authors have adopted all our suggestions to improve the clarity of the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Kremer et al. investigates the impact of modulation of expression of TFAM, a key protein involved in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) packaging and expression, in mtDNA mutator mice, which carry random mtDNA mutations. While previous research suggested that increasing TFAM could counteract the pathological effects of mtDNA mutations, this study reveals that the effects of TFAM modulation are tissue-specific. These findings highlight the complexity of mtDNA copy number regulation and gene expression, emphasizing that TFAM alone is not the sole determinant of mtDNA levels in contexts where oxidative phosphorylation is impaired. Other factors likely play a significant role, underscoring the need for nuanced approaches when targeting TFAM for therapeutic interventions.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Kremer et al. characterizes the tissue-specific responses to changes in TFAM levels and mtDNA copy number in prematurely aging mice (polg mutator model). The authors find that overexpression of TFAM can have beneficial or detrimental effects depending on the tissue type. For instance, increased TFAM levels increase mtDNA copy number in the spleen and improve spleen homeostasis but do not elevate mtDNA copy number in the liver and impair mtDNA expression.</p>
<p>Similarly, the consequences of reduced TFAM expression are tissue-specific. Reduced TFAM levels improve brown adipocyte tissue function while other tissues are unaffected. The authors conclude that these tissue-specific responses to altered TFAM levels demonstrate that there are tissue-specific endogenous compensatory mechanisms in response to the continuous mutagenesis produced in the prematurely aging mice model, including upregulation of TFAM expression, elevated mtDNA copy number, and altered mtDNA gene expression. Thus, the impact of genetically manipulating global TFAM expression is limited and there must be other determinants of mtDNA copy number under pathological conditions beyond TFAM.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this is an interesting study. It does a good job of demonstrating that given the multi-functional role of TFAM, the outcome of manipulating its activity is complex.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No major weaknesses were noted. We have minor suggestions for improving the clarity of the manuscript that are detailed in the &quot;recommendations for the authors&quot; section.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions and addressed them as described in the &quot;recommendations for the authors&quot; section.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Kremer et al. investigates the impact of modulation of expression of TFAM, a key protein involved in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) packaging and expression, in mtDNA mutator mice, which carry random mtDNA mutations. While previous research suggested that increasing TFAM could counteract the pathological effects of mtDNA mutations, this study reveals that the effects of TFAM modulation are tissue-specific. These findings highlight the complexity of mtDNA copy number regulation and gene expression, emphasizing that TFAM alone is not the sole determinant of mtDNA levels in contexts where oxidative phosphorylation is impaired. Other factors likely play a significant role, underscoring the need for nuanced approaches when targeting TFAM for therapeutic interventions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data presented in the manuscript is of high quality and supports major conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The statistical methods used are not clearly described, and some marked nonsignificant results appear visually significant, which raises concerns about data analysis.</p>
<p>Data presentation requires improvement.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. We updated the text in the Materials and Methods section to state the statistical methods and improved the figures as described in detail in the &quot;recommendations for the authors&quot; section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p>(1) Please include testis data in Figure 2 given previous work by authors showing that elevated mtDNA copy number can improve testis function. It would be interesting to compare the changes in mtDNA copy number in testis to these other tissues.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We measured mtDNA copy number in testis using the CytB probe and added it as Supplementary figure 2 A.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The clarity of Table 1 could be improved. It is difficult to know whether the changes in the TFAM to mtDNA ratio are driven by changes in TFAM levels or mtDNA copy number. A suggestion is to include the TFAM and mtDNA values in parenthesis next to each listed ratio.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We updated Table 1 and included the values of the normalized TFAM and mtDNA levels in parentheses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors should consider showing TFAM western blot data in Figure 1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion but would like to keep the TFAM western blot data with the other western blot data for the respective tissue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The graphs for qPCR data (e.g. Figure 2) show mRNA or mtDNA levels relative to the control, which is always set to 1. Why, then, does the control group display error bars?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For the normalization of the data to the WT group, we first calculate the average of the values from all the samples of the WT group. We then divide all values from the samples of all groups, including the WT group, by that average value. By doing so, we set the average value of the WT group to 1 and express all values from all samples of all groups, including the WT group, relative to this average value. Differences between the samples of the WT group are hence retained and allow for error calculations and the display of error bars.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Page 3 second sentence to the last: overexpression of TFAM leads to...? Did the author mean mtDNA?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We updated the text to “Heterozygous knockout of <italic>Tfam</italic> in wild-type mice results in ~50% decrease of mtDNA levels, whereas moderate overexpression of <italic>Tfam</italic> leads to ~50% increase in mtDNA levels25,26”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The sentence &quot;In summary, mtDNA copy number regulation is more complex than previously assumed and the TFAM-to-mtDNA ratio seems to be finely tuned in a tissue-specific manner&quot; - not clear who assumed (references?) and based on what data, please rephrase.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We updated the text and it now reads “In summary, mtDNA copy number regulation is more complex than suggested by previous studies23–27 and the TFAM-to-mtDNA ratio seems to be finely tuned in a tissue-specific manner.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The significant increase in complex II activity under TFAM overexpression (Figure 3) warrants additional discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We updated the Results section and it now reads “We detected increased levels of the complex II subunit Succinate Dehydrogenase Complex Iron Sulfur Subunit B (SDHB). Complex II is exclusively nuclear encoded and a compensatory increase upon impaired mitochondrial gene expresson has been observed before32.</p>
<p>We proceeded to measure the enzyme activities of individual OXPHOS complexes in liver mitochondria (Fig. 3C). The complex I and complex IV activities were reduced to about 50% in <italic>Polg</italic>-/mut; <italic>Tfam</italic>+/+ mice in comparison with wild-type mice (Fig. 3C). However, we did not see any further alteration of the reduced enzyme activities induced by TFAM overexpression or reduced TFAM expression (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, we detected a significant increase in complex II and complex II + complex III activity upon TFAM overexpression, which can partially be explained by the increased complex II protein levels we oberseved in <italic>Polg</italic>-/mut; <italic>Tfam</italic>+/OE mice (Fig. 3, B and C).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The statistical methods used should be explicitly stated. Some results marked as non-significant appear visually significant, for example, mt-Cytb in Figure 2C, Supplementary Figure 2B).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We updated the text in the Materials and Methods section to state the statistical methods and it now reads “Statistical analysis and generation of graphs were performed with GraphPad Prism v9 software except for quantitative mass spectrometry data which was analyzed and plotted using R as described above. Statistical comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and post hoc analysis was conducted with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. Values of <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>(1) Replace numerical indications of significance with asterisks for consistency.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We replaced all numerical indications of significance with asterisks.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Abbreviations SKM and BAT are not defined.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We removed the mentioning of SKM (skeletal muscle) as the data from this tissue was not included. The Introduction reads “In contrast, in brown adipose tissue (BAT), a decrease in TFAM levels normalized <italic>Uncoupling protein 1</italic> (<italic>Ucp1)</italic> expression.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Use uniform scales across bar graphs in Figure 2 to improve clarity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We updated Figure 2 to have uniform scales.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Remove or increase the transparency of data points in Figure 1A to make group averages more discernible.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We removed the data points in Figure 1A.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Add a Y-axis title to Figure 1C.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added the Y-axis title “Heart / body weight” to Figure 1C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Size of the font used in some figures (4?) is not appropriate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We increased the font size for the figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) All figure legend titles need work. Insert &quot;expression&quot; after TFAM in the Figure 2 title, Change the title to &quot;Modulation of TFAM expression...&quot; in Figure 4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The figure legends now read as follows:</p>
<p>“Figure 2: Modulation of TFAM expression affects mtDNA copy number in a tissue-specific manner.”</p>
<p>“Figure 4: Alteration of TFAM expression does not affect the heart phenotype of mtDNA mutator mice.”</p>
