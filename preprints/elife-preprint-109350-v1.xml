<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genome instability plays a paradoxical and yet pivotal role in the evolutionary success of many unicellular pathogens. While genomic integrity is typically vital for cellular function, moderate levels of instability – either through intra-chromosomal copy number variations (CNV) or through dosage changes of whole chromosomes (aneuploidy) – can facilitate survival under environmental stress by quickly diversifying phenotypes in a cell population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. For instance, aneuploidy promotes survival to drug pressure and host immunity in <italic>Candida albicans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, and CNVs were linked to survival under nitrogen-limiting conditions in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Aneuploidy and/or CNVs are also commonly found in cancer and are linked to tumor progression and drug resistance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, these types of structural variation are also found in protist parasites such as <italic>Giardia intestinalis</italic>, <italic>Plasmodium spp.</italic>, <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, and <italic>Leishmania</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, representing potential adaptive mechanisms in clinically relevant organisms.</p>
<p>To fully understand the causes and impact of genome instability, as well as its adaptive role, methods with single-cell resolution are required, since bulk sequencing cannot resolve genomic heterogeneity, masking rare or transient variants that drive adaptation. While in recent years single-cell genomics has received increased attention, the main focus has been on transcription and chromatin accessibility, with single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNAseq) technologies lagging. Currently available options are often limited in throughput, as cells are usually manually processed in individual PCR plate wells, restricting the number of sequenced cells to the plate’s capacity. In single-cell RNA workflows, this limitation is often overcome using microfluidic compartmentalization, which encapsulates cells into nanoliter emulsion droplets, allowing bulk processing while preserving single-cell resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. However, the only commercial emulsion droplet-based solution for scDNAseq – the Chromium™ Single Cell CNV solution from 10x Genomics™ – was discontinued in 2020<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, with no replacement currently available to our knowledge. This gap highlights the urgent need for novel, high-throughput scDNAseq approaches.</p>
<p>Although emulsion droplet approaches can increase throughput and decrease per-cell costs, they face a major limitation: their impermeable nature requires all reagents for genome barcoding and amplification – the 2 major steps in scDNAseq – to be co-encapsulated with the cells, complicating the development and optimization of custom workflows. In this sense, semi-permeable capsules (SPCs) offer a promising alternative: unlike standard emulsion droplets, these capsules have a porous shell that is selectively permeable: large biomolecules (such as genomic DNA or whole organelles) are retained inside the capsule, while small molecules (e.g. enzymes, buffers, metabolites) can diffuse in and out<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. This property permits multi-step reactions to be performed in the pools of encapsulated cells by simply washing or exchanging the surrounding solution. Another major advantage of SPCs is their physical resistance, which allow the use of strong chemical agents for lysing bacterial and potentially fungal cell walls, as well as their application in techniques with extreme temperatures, such as sample preservation at −80 °C and enzymatic reactions requiring high temperatures (up to 100 °C). These features make SPCs a flexible solution to develop custom single-cell pipelines compared to emulsion droplets. It also allows the parallel isolation of up to 100.000 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, increasing throughput while reducing per-cell cost. In addition, SPC encapsulation can be achieved using relatively low-cost instruments. Importantly, SPC-based scDNAseq was originally developed for bacterial cells, with its applicability in eukaryotic systems still largely unexplored.</p>
<p>In this context, <italic>Leishmania</italic> – a protist parasite that cause leishmaniasis – represents an ideal system to test such a platform to study genome instability in eukaryotes, owing to its remarkable genomic plasticity and the central role that genome instability plays in its biology. First, while most eukaryotes maintain a euploid genome, i.e., with equal copies of each chromosome, <italic>Leishmania</italic> breaks this rule, as aneuploidy is not an exception but the genomic standard for these parasites. In its most basic form, aneuploidy is present as a characteristic polysomy of chromosome 31 contrasting with an otherwise fully disomic genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, high levels of chromosome instability lead to frequent dosage changes involving virtually any of the 36 chromosomes, making any <italic>Leishmania</italic> population a ‘mosaic’ of distinct aneuploid karyotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Aneuploidy patterns can shift in response to environmental stresses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and are directly reflected into RNA levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and partially at protein levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. In addition, <italic>Leishmania</italic> genome instability is also expressed in the form of frequent CNVs. Small segments of 20–70 kb can form extrachromosomal circular or linear amplicons carrying genes, including those encoding drug resistance factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Expansion of intra-chromosomal loci is also common. For instance, a common CNV found in chromosome 23 of some <italic>L. donovani</italic> strains was linked to resistance to antimonials in strains from Nepal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In addition, the occurrence of mixed infections – where multiple <italic>Leishmania</italic> strains or even species coexist in the same host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> – further highlight the need for genomic approaches that resolve parasite genotypes at single-cell resolution.</p>
<p>In a previous study our group established the first single-cell genomics study with <italic>Leishmania</italic>, using single parasites isolated in plates with fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. We could successfully sequence 47 parasites, of which 28 had their karyotypes determined. Moreover, we also demonstrated that the whole-genome amplification (WGA) method must be chosen based on the downstream analysis, with multiple displacement amplification (MDA) being more suited for nucleotide sequence information, and PicoPlex performing better for structural variations such as chromosome copy number assessment and CNVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Later, we described the application of the Chromium single-cell CNV solution (10X Genomics) as a high throughput, emulsion droplet-based approach that could reconstruct karyotypes in thousands of <italic>Leishmania</italic> cells, revealing potential paths towards karyotype diversification, but with no access to nucleotide variant detection due to shallow genomic coverage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here we developed a novel high throughput method tailored to detecting structural and nucleotide variants at single-cell level in eukaryotic parasites such as <italic>Leishmania</italic>. Our method is based on the SPC-based commercially available Single-Microbe DNA Barcoding solution (Atrandi Biosciences), which originally offers a workflow for SPC encapsulation, WGA and genome barcoding of bacterial cells. We compared the performance of the method with libraries previously made with the Chromium single-cell CNV, showing that the original SPC-based protocol successfully generates single-cell DNA libraries with <italic>Leishmania</italic>, but its uneven amplification prevents determination of structural variants. We solved this issue by using primary template-directed amplification (PTA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> as alternative WGA. This modification allowed us to fully reconstruct the karyotype of hundreds of <italic>L. donovani</italic> parasites and to detect distinct CNV patterns between cells. Moreover, the higher coverage seen in PTA unlocked the ability to simultaneously retrieve nucleotide sequence information from single-cells, which was not possible before. We demonstrate the ability of the method to distinguish parasite subpopulations of the same species, as well as small populations in the same strain, revealing minor genotypic variants among cells in clinical isolates, including variants in genes related to drug-resistance in small subpopulations of parasites. Together, our results represent a significant advancement in single-cell genomics for <italic>Leishmania</italic> and other eukaryotes, providing a scalable, high-resolution tool to dissect both structural and sequence-level variation, and to deepen our understanding of parasite heterogeneity, evolution, and adaptation.</p>

<title>Parasite Culture</title>
<p>In the present study, we refer to terms such as population, strain and clone, according to the nomenclature proposed for salivarian trypanosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Accordingly: (i) a population is a group of <italic>Leishmania</italic> cells present at a given time in a given environment (e.g., culture or host); (ii) a strain is a population derived by serial passage <italic>in vitro</italic> from a primary isolate (in this case, from clinical samples) without any implication of homogeneity but with some degree of characterization (here, bulk genome sequencing); (iii) a clone is a population of cells derived from a single individual presumably by binary fission. Here, two <italic>L. donovani</italic> strains isolated from visceral leishmaniasis patients were used, the BPK081/0 cl8 (MHOM/NP/02/BPK081/0) strain, which was isolated in Nepal, and HU3 (MHOM/ET/67), isolated in Ethiopia. Both strains were retained at the cryobank of the Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp and were maintained in HOMEM medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum at 26 °C with periodic passages done every 7 days in 1 in 50 dilutions for downstream experiments. The BPK081/0 cl8 strain was submitted to single-cell sequencing 7 passages after cloning, while HU3 had an unknown of passages (minimum of 15 passages).</p>

<title>Single-cell encapsulation into SPCs</title>
<p>Promastigotes from each strain were collected independently at late-stationary phase (day 7) by centrifugation at 1500 rcf for 5 minutes followed by 3 washes with PBS (magnesium and calcium-free) and passed through a 5 µm strainer to remove cell clumps. Then, cell concentration was adjusted to 10<sup>7</sup> parasites/ml in each strain, and both were combined at 50/50 ratio for downstream applications. The cell mixture was submitted to SPC encapsulation using the Flux device (Atrandi), following the Flux SPC Generator protocol (V6.3), with 6.3 µl of the cell suspension loaded, targeting a total of 15.000 encapsulated cells (corresponding to ∼5.000 sequenced cells). After encapsulation, SPCs were washed 3 times with 1 ml of Capsule Wash Buffer (CWB - Atrandi) and were stored at −80°C overnight. Afterwards, SPCs were thawed back to room temperature, washed 3 times with 1 ml of Wash Buffer (WB - Atrandi) and resuspended in 480 µl WB. The SPC suspension was subsequently divided into 6 samples with 80 µl each which were maintained on ice. Samples were named according to the WGA method applied: SPC-STD1-4 for the samples submitted to the standard WGA of the Single-Microbe Genome Barcoding Kit, and SPC-PTA1-2 for the samples submitted to PTA. A table summarizing the treatments that each sample was submitted to is provided in the results section (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Cell lysis</title>
<p>Of the samples described above, 5 were submitted to different variations of the lysis protocol described in the Single-Microbe DNA Barcoding user guide (Atrandi) version 4.1 (P/N: CKP-BARK1): sample SPC-STD1 was first fixed by slowly adding 900 µl of ice-cold methanol to the SPC suspension on ice, following by an incubation at −20 °C for 30 minutes, 3 washes with 1 ml WB, and a final resuspension in 80 µl of WB. For samples SPC-STD2-4 and SPC-PTA1-2, methanol fixation was skipped. Then, the 5 samples received 80 µl of 2X Lysis Buffer (0.8 M KOH, 20 mM EDTA, 200 mM DTT - Atrandi), with samples SPC-STD1, SPC-STD2, and SPC-PTA1 being incubated at 23 °C for 15 minutes, sample SPC-STD3 being incubated at 23 °C for 60 minutes, and sample SPC-STD4 being incubated at 99 °C for 15 minutes for lysis. After lysis, each sample was washed 3 times with 160 µl of Neutralization Buffer (NB - Atrandi) followed by 3 washes with WB, with final resuspension in 25 µl WB, with tubes being kept on ice afterwards.</p>
<p>For sample SPC-PTA2, the lysis protocol from the ResolveDNA kit (BioSkryb) was followed instead. In summary, SPCs were washed 3 times with 25 µl of Cell Buffer (CB – BioSkryb). Then, 25 µl of the MS mix (BioSkryb) were added, followed by an incubation at room temperature for 20 minutes at 1400 rpm in a thermomixer. Then, SPCs received 25 µl of SN1 reagent (BioSkryb) with another room temperature incubation for 1 minute at 1400 rpm followed the addition of 25 µl of the SDX reagent (BioSkryb) with a 10-minute incubation at room temperature without agitation. After lysis, SPCs were kept on ice until PTA. Since the components of the PTA lysis protocol could affect the downstream PTA, we also added the aforementioned lysis reagents from the PTA protocol to SPC-PTA1, skipping the incubation times.</p>

<title>Whole-genome amplification</title>
<p>Samples SPC-STD1-4 were submitted to the standard WGA method described in the Single-Microbe DNA Barcoding user guide (Atrandi). In summary, the 25 µl SPC suspensions were combined with 16,25 µl of nuclease-free water, 6.25 µl of 10X WGA Reaction Buffer (Atrandi), 6.25 µl of dNTP Mix (Atrandi), 3.125 µl Primer mix (Atrandi), 0.625 µl of 0.1 M DTT, 0.625 µl of 10% Pluronic F-68, 1.25 µl of WGA Enhancer (Atrandi), and 3.125 µl of WGA Polymerase (Atrandi) on ice. The WGA mixture was then submitted to an incubation at 45 °C for 15 minutes followed by 65 °C for 10 minutes in a thermocycler and were returned to ice.</p>
<p>For samples SPC-PTA1-2, the PTA protocol from the ResolveDNA kit version 1 (BioSkryb) was followed instead. In summary, a PTA master mix was prepared on ice by combining 85 µl of SB4 reagent, 17 µl of 1X SS2 reagent, 13,6 µl of SEZ1 reagent, and 20,4 µl of SEZ2 reagent (all from ResolveDNA kit). Then, 66,7 µl of the PTA master mix was added to the 100 µl of lysed SPCs of samples SPC-PTA1-2. These samples were then submitted to a 10-hour incubation at 30 °C followed by an inactivation at 65 °C for 3 minutes.</p>
<p>After WGA, all samples were washed 3 times with 200 µl of WB, with final resuspension done in 25 µl. DNA amplification was evaluated in all samples by staining 1 µl of SPCs with 5µM SYTO9 (ThermoFisher) and visualizing SPC positives in a fluorescence microscope. For samples SPC-STD1-4, amplified DNA was debranched by combining the 25 µl of SPC suspension with 17.5 µl of Nuclease-free water, 5 µl of 10X Debranching Buffer (Atrandi) and 2.5 µl of Debranching Enzyme (Atrandi) followed by an incubation at 37 °C for 1 hour at 1000 rpm agitation in a thermomixer. After debranching, SPCs were again washed 3 times with WB with final volume of 25 µl. The samples submitted to PTA SPC-PTA1-2 did not require debranching and were directly submitted to barcoding instead.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Barcoding of amplified genomes</title>
<p>Barcoding of amplified SPC-trapped DNA was done following the split-pool barcoding approach described in the Single-Microbe DNA Barcoding user guide (Atrandi) for all 6 samples. First, DNA end preparation was done to allow the subsequent ligation of barcodes to the amplified DNA molecules. This was done by adding 3.5 µl of End Prep Buffer (Atrandi), and 1.5 µl of End Prep Enzyme (Atrandi) to the 25 µl of SPC suspensions, followed by an incubation at 20 °C for 30 minutes and inactivation at 65 °C for 30 minutes. Each sample immediately received 25 µl of a ligation master mix (77 µl of nuclease-free water, 66 µl of 10X ligation buffer (Atrandi) and 22 µl of Ligation Enzyme (Atrandi) and was distributed along 4 wells (10 µl per well) of the first-round columns of the barcoding plate from the Single-Microbe DNA Barcoding kit (Atrandi). The well positions of each sample was recorded to be used as sample index later. Barcode ligation was carried out at 25 °C for 15 minutes and stopped with 40 µl of 1X Stop Buffer (SB - Atrandi) with a 5-minute incubation at room temperature. After that, SPCs from all wells were pooled in a single tube, washed 5 times with 1 ml WB (final volume of 150 µl), combined with 150 µl of a new ligation master mix, and redistributed along the 24 wells of the second-round columns in the barcoding plate (10 µl per well). Barcode ligation incubation and stop were done as described above. These steps were repeated 2 more times for a total of 4 barcoding rounds. Finally, the barcoded SPC pool was washed 5 times with SB and was stored at 4 °C with final volume of 200 µl.</p>

<title>Library preparation</title>
<p>The barcoded SPC pool was divided in 4 PCR tubes with ∼1.250 expected barcoded genomes each (50 µl per tube). Each tube received 2 µl of release reagent (Atrandi) and was incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes to disrupt the SPCs and free the barcoded DNA. The pooled DNA was purified with 0.8X AmPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and was eluted in 27 µl of nuclease-free water per tube. DNA fragmentation, adapter ligation and library amplification were done using the NEB Next Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs), with indexing primers UDI5-UDI8 from the Single Microbe DNA Barcoding Kit (Atrandi), and 12 PCR cycles. Final libraries were purified with 0.8X AMPure XP Beads. Of the 4 final libraries, 2 (∼ 2.500 expected cells) were sent for sequencing. Sequencing was done at NovoGene using a NextSeq (Illumina) in high output mode with 150 pair-end reads.</p>

<title>Cell demultiplexing and read mapping of SPC-scDNA libraries</title>
<p>Demultiplexing of the raw sequencing data into individual single-cell FASTǪ files was performed using custom Python scripts in a two-step procedure. Initially, the second read – containing four concatenated 8-nucleotide barcodes with structure [NNNNNNNN]AGAA[NNNNNNNN]ACTC[NNNNNNNN]AAGG[NNNNNNNN]T – was scanned for a perfect match against a list of expected barcode sequences of 8-nucleotide barcodes at the first, second, third, or fourth position. Barcodes were retained only if they perfectly matched the list. Barcodes observed at least 1,000 times were classified as dominant barcodes. The process of screening the second read was then repeated for the identified dominant barcodes, extending the dataset by permitting up to one mismatch per 8nt barcode with the whitelist barcodes. This resulted in paired FASTǪ files (R1 and R2) generated for each single cell.</p>
<p>These paired FASTǪ files were then aligned to the <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> BPK282 version 2 reference genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> using BWA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Alignments were filtered for a minimum mapping quality of 30, duplicates were removed using Picard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, and only properly paired reads were retained. The resulting BAM files served as input for the bamCoverage module of DeepTools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, which calculated average coverage over 20 kb windows normalized to counts per million reads. This was used to generate a count matrix of cells (columns) by bins (rows) dimension. Counts were then randomly subsampled to a total of 100.000 reads per cell to allow cross-sample comparisons. The count matrix was used for cell quality control and karyotyping.</p>

<title>Compensation of GC bias and mappability</title>
<p>Compensation of GC bias was done by fitting a generalized additive model with bin GC content as explanatory variable and the mean normalized read counts as response variable using the mgcv package in R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, after removal of outlier values for GC and count. The resulting model was used to predict expected counts for each bin based on their GC content, and a bin-specific correction factor was computed as the ratio between the median of the total predicted values to the predicted value for each bin. Raw counts were then adjusted by multiplying each bin’s counts across all cells by its respective correction factor. Negative values arising from the correction were set to zero. The corrected count matrix was then used in downstream analysis.</p>
<p>To determine bin mappability, i.e., the fraction of reads that are uniquely aligned to a given genomic bin, a paired-end artificial library of 150 bp reads was simulated with ART Illumina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> using a 400 bp insert size, 60 bp standard deviation, and 1x coverage. These reads were mapped back to the BPK282v2 reference genome with BWA-MEM, and the mappability of a bin was calculated as the fraction of reads mapping to it with MAPǪ &gt;30 over total mapped reads. Bins with mappability below 0.7 were considered non-mappable and excluded from downstream analyses for karyotyping and CNVs.</p>

<title>Data quality control</title>
<p>True cells were distinguished from background signal by ranking barcodes in descending order of total read count and plotting the log10-transformed read counts against log10-transformed barcode ranks. The inflection (“knee”) point of this curve, representing the transition from true cells to background, was identified by detecting the point of maximum perpendicular distance from a line connecting the curve’s endpoints. Barcodes to the left of the knee were retained as true cells.</p>
<p>For estimation of coverage evenness, two metrics were used: (i) the gini index, which was calculated for each cell using the gc-corrected and cell-normalized read counts per 20 kb bin with the function ‘gin’ from the ineq package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, and (ii), the median absolute pairwise difference (MAPD) which corresponds to the median absolute difference between the gc-corrected normalized counts of two consecutive bins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. For karyotyping, two additional parameters were used to detect noisy cells in the dataset. First, an intra-chromosomal coefficient of variance (ICCV) was determined by calculating the mean normalized standard deviation of chromosomes in a cell. This summarizes how ‘spread’ the read coverage is around the chromosomal means. To quantify replication-associated coverage variation and distinguish replicating (S-phase) cells from non-replicative (G1/G2) cells, we developed a second score named the Intra-Chromosomal Fluctuation (ICF) score. For each cell, and for each chromosome, locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) model is fitted to the coverage profile (read count per 20 kb bin as a function of genomic bin position). The fitted curve represents the smoothed intra-chromosomal coverage trend. Then, for each bin, we calculated the absolute distance between the LOESS fit and the mean coverage of the corresponding chromosome in that cell. This absolute deviation captures the extent of fluctuation around a flat (non-replicative) coverage profile. We computed the mean absolute deviation per chromosome, and for each cell, selected the five chromosomes with the highest deviations. The final ICF score for the cell is the mean of these five highest per-chromosome deviation values. High ICF values indicate structured, wave-like coverage profiles consistent with DNA replication activity, while low ICF values reflect flatter profiles characteristic of non-replicating cells.</p>

<p>Doublet detection was done as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. In summary, previously generated bulk whole genome sequencing data of strains HU3 and BPK081 was first used to determine strain specific variants.

<title>Single-cell karyotype estimation</title>
<p>Karyotype estimation was done as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. In summary, raw somies were determined by averaging the counts of each chromosome and multiplying them by the cell’s scale factor which tries to infer the baseline ploidy of the cell by approximating the normalized values to integers. For this, we iteratively test, for each cell, scale factors within the range of 1.8 to 5 and compute, for each scale factor, the mean absolute distance of the scaled values to the nearest integer. The scale factor that minimized this distance is selected as the optimal estimate of the cell’s ploidy. This method leverages the assumption that true somy values are integers, and that the optimal scale factor should result in values that are as close to integers as possible. Afterwards, raw somy values were converted to integers using Gaussian Mixture Models built at populational level for each chromosome using the mixtools package in R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, with one gaussian fitting each possible copy number state for that particular chromosome. The combined integer somy values of a cell defines its karyotype.</p>

<title>Copy number variations</title>
<p>Copy number variations were determined for two loci which differ between the two strains used in this study: a ∼4 kb locus in chr19 which is present in HU3 but absent in BPK081, and the M-locus, a ∼8 kb locus in chr36 which is present in BPK081 but absent in HU3. To estimate differences in the copy numbers, we generated a new count matrix with DeepTools as mentioned before, but this time with 100bp bins. Correction for GC bias and mappability was done as mentioned above. We then aggregated the corrected counts of the bins inside each locus and divided by the mean count of all other bins of the chromosome. This gave an estimated haploid copy number for the locus.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Two <italic>L. donovani</italic> strains, BPK081, and HU3, were chosen for this study based on the following criteria: (i) both strains have distinct genotypes, with HU3 displaying 122.495 small nucleotide variants compared to the reference BPK282v2, in contrast with BPK081 which has only 332 variants. This difference is useful to determine doublet rate as well as to assess the ability to distinguish different genotypes with our single-cell approach; (ii) BPK081 is a clonal strain, while HU3 is a not cloned and therefore potentially has a higher genomic diversity; (iii) both strains differ in (bulk) aneuploidy profiles, with BPK081 displaying aneuploidy only in chromosome 31, while HU3 presents several polysomic chromosomes, and lastly (iv), BPK081 has a known CNV in the form of an intra-chromosomal expansion in chromosome 36 in a region known as the M-locus which is absent in HU3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, while HU3 display in bulk a CNV in chromosome 29 which is not detected in the bulk data of BPK081. These differences were used to estimate the method’s ability to distinguish CNVs. Moreover, we have already generated high throughput single-cell DNA data for BPK081/0 cl8 in a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> using the Chromium single-cell CNV solution from 10X Genomics (referred here as 10X-scDNA), which is considered here as the gold standard technique. Although done on different cultures – which were originated from the same cryo-preserved sample (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) – we could compare the single-cell karyotypes determined in the present study against those reported with the 10X-scDNA solution. In addition, here we also performed 10X-scDNA with HU3 as an additional comparison.</p>

<title>SPC-based scDNAseq</title>
<p>After validating the lysis and PTA protocols in bulk samples (see supplementary text, supplementary figures 1 and 2, and supplementary tables 1 and 2), we then tested their implementation in single-cell sequencing. For that, a 50/50 BPK081/HU3 mixture was submitted to SPC encapsulation, with trapped cells being visualized with SYTO5 staining. As expected, most SPCs appeared empty, while the few that contained parasites displayed only a single organism (supplementary figure 3A). No SPC containing multiplets were found by microscopy inspection. Noteworthy, this also confirmed that cells remained alive after encapsulation (supplementary video 1). The generated SPCs were then divided in 6 samples so different lysis conditions as well as the use of PTA as alternative WGA method could be tested. A summary of the different conditions and general statistics of each sample is provided in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. After lysis and WGA, SPCs were stained again with SYTO5 to detect amplified DNA (supplementary figure 3B). Strong SYTO5 staining were seen in all samples except for sample SPC-STD4, which had no detectable signal, indicating WGA failure. Moreover, in sample SPC-STD1, although positive SPCs were entirely populated by amplified DNA, fixed parasites were still visible on some of them (supplementary Figure 3C), indicating partial lysis.</p>
<p>After confirmation of successful WGA, SPCs were pooled, barcoded and sequenced. Sequencing output was first assessed by read counts per sample (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Standard WGA samples showed a unimodal distribution around ∼170,000 reads per cell, except sample SPC-STD4, which peaked at ∼17,000 reads, consistent with its observed WGA failure. In contrast, PTA samples displayed bimodal/multimodal distributions, with peaks between 2,000–17,000 and a major peak at 600,000–900,000 reads, suggesting stronger DNA amplification.</p>
<p>To separate true cells from background signal, we applied a barcode rank approach. All samples exhibited a characteristic sharp drop-off in read counts, indicating a clear inflection point that distinguishes cell-associated barcodes from background (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The PTA samples contained the cells with highest sequencing depth, with thresholds at 656,209 reads (SPC-PTA1) and 448,715 reads (SPC-PTA2). Thresholds for the standard WGA samples were lower (109,851; 114,650; and 180,703 reads in samples SPC-STD1-3) and lowest in sample SPC-STD4 (11,413 reads), which also had the fewest SPCs flagged as true cells (70 SPCs). PTA samples had more total detectable SPCs, but a similar number of true cells (160 and 253 in SPC-PTA1 and SPC-PTA2) compared to standard WGA (135, 206, and 166 in SPC-PTA1-3 respectively) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Only true cells were retained for downstream analysis. We then assessed the presence of doublets by quantifying HU3-specific variants in each SPC, using a curated set of HU3-specific SNPs identified from bulk genomic sequencing. Classification was based on the proportion of detected SNPs matching this HU3-specific set. SPCs with &gt;90% HU3-specific SNPs were classified as HU3, whereas SPCs with &lt;5% were assigned to BPK081. Cells with in-between values were considered doublets. Successful WGA samples showed only 1–6 doublets, while most SPCs in sample SPC-STD4 contained a mixture of BPK081 and HU3 reads (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that amplicons originated from mixed free-floating DNA. Because of the clear failure in WGA and the lack of single-cell signal, sample #SPC-STD4 was excluded from downstream analysis.</p>
<p>Nucleotide coverage was also higher in PTA samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). On average, ∼71% (SPC-PTA1) and ∼67% (SPC-PTA2) of the genome was covered by ≥1 read (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>), with ∼33% and ∼18% being covered by ≥5 reads respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Samples SPC-STD1-3 showed 35–39% coverage at ≥1 read and 2.4–3.5% at ≥5 reads. After equalizing each sample to 100,000 reads per cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>), PTA still performed best, with ∼32% of the genome being mapped at least once, while in the standard WGA this value was ∼27–29%. In addition, no conclusive difference was seen regarding the different lysis conditions. These results indicate that PTA achieves deeper and broader genome coverage than standard WGA.</p>

<title>Evaluation of coverage evenness</title>
<p>Detecting structural variants such as CNVs and aneuploidy is a key application of scDNA-seq and requires uniform genome coverage to ensure that read counts reflect true copy number changes. To evaluate the suitability of our method, we compared coverage uniformity in our dataset with that of two libraries generated using the Chromium Single-Cell CNV solution (10X-scDNAseq), considered the gold standard for this application. After normalizing each sample to 100.000 reads per cell and correcting for GC bias, a Lorenz curve was made to evaluate global read distribution, indicating that the PTA samples had a similar profile compared to the 10X-scDNA libraries, while samples SPC-STD1-3 showed a skewer distribution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). This also reflected in lower gini coefficients compared to SPC-STD1-3 sample<sup>s∽</sup>x ( SPC-PTA1 = 0.245 an<sup>d∽</sup>x SPC-PTA2 = 0.234, <italic>versus</italic>x∽SPC-STD1 = 0.321,x∽SPC-STD2 = 0.315,x∽SPC-STD3 = 0.319,x∽10X-BPK081 = 0.226, an<sup>d∽</sup>x 10X-HU3 = 0.217) as well as lower MAPD scoresx ( SPC-PTA1 = 0.508 andx∽SPC-PTA2 = 0.489, <italic>versus</italic>x∽SPC-STD1 = 0.634,x∽SPC-STD2 = 0.636,x∽SPC-STD3 = 0.629<sup>,∽</sup>x 10X-BPK081 = 0.429, an<sup>d∽</sup>x 10X-HU3 = 0.401), achieving values comparable to the 10XscDNA libraries (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-C</xref>). To estimate within-chromosome coverage dispersions, we introduced two complementary scores: (i) The intra-chromosomal coefficient of variance (ICCV) which reflects how spread the reads are in each chromosome, and (ii) the intra-chromosomal fluctuation (ICF) score, which is used to identify local intra-chromosomal biases which might skew the somy estimation, as, e.g., in cells under S-phase. The PTA samples displayed the lowest ICCV value<sup>s∽</sup>x ( SPC-PTA1 = 0.220 an<sup>d∽</sup>x SP<sup>C∽∽</sup>,824.0=2DTS-CPS,344.0=1DTS-CPS-PTA2 = 0.203 <italic>versu<sup>s</sup></italic><sup>∽</sup>x x x SPC-STD3 ∽= 0.433,x 10X-BPK081 = 0.317, an<sup>d∽</sup>x 10X-HU3 = 0.294), and similar ICF scores compared to the 10X-scDNA libraries, while samples SPC-STD1-3 had consistently the highest scores for both metric<sup>s∽</sup>x ( SPC-PTA1 = 0.150 an<sup>d∽</sup>x SPC-PTA2 = 0.145 <italic>versus</italic>x∽SPC-STD1 = 0.291,x∽SPC-STD2 = 0.276,x∽SPC-STD3 = 0.284,x∽10X-BPK081 = 0.163, andx∽10X-HU3 = 0.172) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-E</xref>). Importantly, no clear distinction was observed regarding lysis conditions. The improved uniformity in PTA was also noticeable when visualizing the normalized read coverage across all genomic bins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F-H</xref>). In the standard WGA samples, coverage profiles were considerably noisier, with uneven coverage across cells that obscured clear aneuploidy patterns (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). In contrast, the PTA samples exhibited much smoother profiles, with well-defined aneuploidy regions that closely resembled the high-quality profiles obtained with the 10X-scDNAseq reference (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Together, these analyses demonstrate that PTA improved coverage uniformity, achieving performance comparable to the 10X-scDNAseq gold standard.</p>

<title>Single-cell Karyotyping</title>
<p>To define the impact of the improved coverage uniformity on chromosome copy number estimation, we first checked the distribution of raw somy values obtained in each approach. In the standard WGA dataset, we observe a more continuous distribution, with a substantial number of values falling between integers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), likely due to the greater noise seen in this data. Conversely, PTA produces a markedly discrete distribution, with sharp peaks centered on integer values (e.g., 2, 3, and 4), and relatively few intermediate values (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Since chromosome copy numbers are inherently integers, PTA’s output aligns more closely with biological expectations. This pattern indicates that PTA provides more accurate and reliable estimates of chromosomal copy numbers at the single-cell level. This also reflected into less cells being scaled to ploidies higher than 2, as noisy coverage seen in standard WGA distorted depth ratios and consequently led to incorrect scale factors. Cells scaled to ploidies higher than 2 in PTA could represent true polyploid cells which can spontaneously arise in culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, as well as cells at S/G2 phase.</p>

<p>Then, we compared the karyotype profiles of the SPC datasets with the 10XscDNA libraries of each respective strain. The karyotype profiles obtained from PTA samples were largely consistent with those generated by 10X-scDNA, whereas standard WGA samples showed poorer reproducibility. For the BPK081 strain, the dominant profile where only chromosome 31 was aneuploid was the most frequent in all samples, representing ∼60% of cells in PTA samples, in close agreement with the ∼80% reported in the 10X-scDNA dataset (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The highly aneuploid karyotypes 2 and 3 seen in 10X-scDNA were also detected in PTA samples 5 and 6, but not in samples SPC-STD1–3, likely due to underestimation of the chromosome 1 trisomy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-D</xref>). Importantly, the SPC-scDNA and 10X-scDNA datasets originated from different cultures derived from the same cryopreserved population, so some variation in karyotype content was expected, especially given the instability of the BPK081 dominant karyotype in culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Accordingly, an even more similar pattern was observed for the HU3 strain: PTA reproduced the same dominant karyotypes identified with 10X-scDNA with a remarkable similarity in proportions between them, while standard WGA produced divergent and inconsistent profiles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E–F</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrate that PTA-based amplification preserves karyotypic structure with high fidelity, enabling more accurate reconstruction of chromosome copy number profiles than the standard WGA.</p>

<title>Detection of small structural variants</title>
<p>To test whether we could detect smaller structural variants, we took advantage of the existence two different CNVs which are unique to each strain – a ∼8kb CNV (M-locus) in chromosome 36 unique to BPK081, and a ∼4kb CNV in chromosome 29 characteristic of the HU3 strain. For this analysis, we increased the resolution to 100 bp bins, using the chromosome-normalized mean read count of the bins inside the CNV as an estimation of haploid copy numbers. In the PTA samples, all BPK081 cells displayed a clear and consistent increase in coverage depth at the M-locus compared to HU3, in contrast to the standard WGA samples where only a fraction of BPK081 cells had a detectable amplification of the M-locus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Likewise, the CNV in chromosome 29 was consistently detected in all HU3 cells from PTA samples, with no BPK081 cell displaying them, while with standard WGA only a fraction of HU3 cells had a detectable amplification (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The distribution of estimated haploid copy numbers of both CNVs shows sharp, well-defined peaks at expected integer copy numbers for the SPC-PTA samples, with all BPK081 cells showing amplification at the M-locus and all HU3 cells showing amplification at chromosome 29 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). By contrast, the standard WGA samples (SPC-STD1–3) exhibited broad and noisy distributions, with many intermediate values and amplifications detected only in a subset of cells. Interestingly, in PTA samples, minor peaks at alternative integer values were observed for both loci, which could indicate the presence of subpopulations with distinct CNV states. Together, these results confirm that PTA retains better small structural information, enabling consistent detection and copy number estimation of specific small CNVs.</p>

<title>Nucleotide sequence variants</title>
<p>To investigate the applicability of our method in detecting heterogeneity at nucleotide sequence level, we first assessed its ability to distinguish the two <italic>L. donovani</italic> strains in a <italic>de novo</italic> way, i.e., without prior bulk sequencing data. This would mimic the scenario of samples with mixed infections. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on nucleotide variants showed a clear distinction between cells from HU3 and BPK081 strains in all samples (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), indicating that both the standard WGA and PTA methods are good enough to separate parasite populations of the same species.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we investigated if we could detect low-frequency nucleotide polymorphisms at particular loci of interest with single-cell resolution. We performed a global search for variants in all datasets and observed a greater proportion of confidently called sites in the PTA samples, where variants were resolved in ∼80-90% of the cells on average, compared to standard WGA (∼60 %) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).This is also noticeable when visualizing the estimated allele frequencies for each variant loci (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Because of the high prevalence of missing values in the standard WGA samples, we moved forward only with the PTA samples.</p>
<p>As proof-of-concept, we examined genes known to contribute to reduced susceptibility to leishmanicidal drugs to investigate potential presence of heteroresistance in the parasite population. We found a relative homogeneous genotype in BPK081, with few cells displaying heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in some of the analyzed genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), which is in accordance with the fact that this strain is a clone with relative few passages (7 since cloning). Conversely, HU3 cells displayed more diversity in these same loci, with small subset of cells displaying homozygous SNPs in genes related to resistance to antimony, miltefosine, and amphotericin B. This highlight the presence of spontaneous variants with potential clinical relevance which would likely have been missed by bulk sequencing.</p>
<p>Lastly, we used the nucleotide information to infer the short-term evolutionary relationship between cells along propagation in culture. The resulting tree revealed a compact structure with limited branch lengths and a maximum divergence of fewer than 70 nucleotide variants between cells in the BPK081 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). This restricted diversity indicates that the clonal strain retained a largely homogeneous genetic composition, with only minor sequence changes detectable across individual cells, in accordance with the fact that BPK081 is a clone with limited expansion time in culture. In contrast, the HU3 strain, which was never clonally derived and has been maintained for at least 15 passages (but likely many more passages), displayed higher heterogeneity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). The tree spanned over 30,000 nucleotide variants, with long branches and multiple subclades emerging within the population. A magnified view of the terminal region of the tree further highlights the presence of distinct subgroups differing by a few hundreds of variants, likely arising during ongoing diversification in culture.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we developed and validated a high-throughput single-cell genomic approach using <italic>Leishmania</italic> as a model eukaryote. Using SPCs for high throughput cell encapsulation and PTA for WGA, we could simultaneously resolve karyotypes, detect intra-chromosomal CNVs, uncover low-frequency genotypes, and explore population structure. These findings represent a significant advance in dissecting genome instability and adaptation in eukaryotic pathogens at single-cell resolution.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Improved Whole-Genome Amplification with PTA vs Standard WGA</title>
<p><italic>Leishmania</italic> display a highly segmented genome: its small size of 33 Mb is divided among 36 chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. This characteristic makes scDNAseq particularly challenging given that WGA methods are usually validated in mammal cells, with nuclear genomes about 100 times larger than <italic>Leishmania</italic>. Thus, to obtain sufficient amounts of material for sequencing, <italic>Leishmania</italic> DNA must be amplified orders of magnitude more compared to a mammalian counterpart, increasing the risk of artefactual biases. Our single-cell genome analysis of <italic>Leishmania</italic> applied primary template-directed amplification (PTA) to overcome the biases associated with other WGA methods such as MDA. PTA was developed as a modification of MDA by introducing the use of exonuclease-resistant terminator nucleotides which limit amplicon length and prevent reamplification of daughter molecules, changing the amplification kinetics from exponential to quasi-linear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. This dramatically reduces allelic dropout and amplification bias, thereby preserving the true allelic and structural representation of the single-cell genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Notably, this method has never been tested in organisms with small genomes such as <italic>Leishmania</italic>. Here, we demonstrated that <italic>Leishmania</italic> genomes amplified with PTA yielded consistent coverage across chromosomes and between replicates, outperforming the standard WGA – which is based on MDA – in all metrics. When benchmarking against an established 10X Genomics single-cell CNV dataset, the PTA-based workflow reached comparable coverage evenness and recapitulated expected karyotypes more in accordance with the expected distributions, whereas the standard WGA introduced major artifactual karyotypes not seen in the reference data. Altogether, our results demonstrate that PTA’s uniform amplification preserves genomic structure far more faithfully, enabling more accurate reconstruction of chromosome copy number and sequence variants even from single cells with such a small genome.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>SPCs as a viable tool for high throughput implementation of PTA</title>
<p>Although PTA offers good performance in WGA fidelity, its application has been limited to low throughput workflows, using cells isolated in plates which are manually processed for WGA in individual reactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Here we applied SPCs as an alternative solution for cell encapsulation in order to increase throughput. By applying this strategy to <italic>Leishmania</italic>, we could sequence a total of 399 cells (from samples SPC-PTA1-2) while using the equivalent of 17 PTA reactions (17 cells) with cells isolated in plates, reducing the cost per cell by more than 20 fold. This could be reduced even further by encapsulating more cells, as SCPs can encapsulate up to 100.000 cells (targeting a total of ∼ 30.000 sequenced cells). Moreover, the split and pool barcoding strategy can also be exploited as a sample multiplexing system as was done here, by allocating cells of different samples in specific pre-defined wells in the first barcoding round, reducing costs even further when dealing with multiple samples.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>High-Resolution Karyotyping and CNV Detection</title>
<p>With the combination of SPCs and PTA, we achieved high-resolution single-cell karyotyping of <italic>Leishmania</italic> that surpasses prior methods. Each parasite’s complete karyotype could be determined, and we could even resolve CNVs as subtle as a few kilobases. For example, in a mixed population of two <italic>Leishmania</italic> strains, our method could distinguish two known CNVs – spanning 4 kb to 8 kb in size – which were unique to each strain. Detecting such fine-scale CNVs at the single-cell level is a notable advance. Traditional single-cell CNV platforms like 10x Chromium yield copy number profiles at sparser resolution – on the order of ∼2 Mb for mammalian cells, and at least ∼200 kb for <italic>Leishmania</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> – and typically require pooling signals across multiple cells to detect smaller events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. In contrast, the high depth and uniformity of our PTA-amplified genomes enable detection of gene-level amplifications or deletions within individual cells. This could be particularly relevant in the context of genomic surveillance of drug resistance markers such as the amplification of the H-locus and M-locus, two CNVs found in some <italic>L. donovani</italic> strains which were linked to antimony resistance in the Indian Subcontinent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Moreover, CNVs have been linked to drug resistance in other pathogenic protists, such as <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, where CNVs affecting the plasmepsin genes are linked to resistance to piperaquine resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, highlighting the potential relevance of the method in other organisms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Heterogeneity of nucleotide sequence</title>
<p>A further complication in <italic>Leishmania</italic> biology is the possible occurrence of mixed infections and within-host diversity. Field studies have shown that individual hosts (human or animal) can harbor multiple <italic>Leishmania</italic> genotypes or even different species simultaneously, with a potential impact on clinical outcome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Mixed-genotype infections are likely under-detected by routine diagnostics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, and confounds bulk genomic analyses. This was evident when cultured parasites showed genomic signatures distinct from their clinical counterparts, likely due to the expansion of initially undetectable genotypes in culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. This complexity makes it challenging to link genotype to phenotype and to study evolutionary dynamics, especially for traits like drug resistance or virulence where minor variants can be clinically relevant.</p>
<p>Here we demonstrated the feasibility of distinguishing genotypically different cells by using artificial mixtures between two <italic>L. donovani</italic> strains. Cells were clearly separated without any prior knowledge between the genotypes composing the cell mixture. This highlights the applicability of this method to resolve genotypic diversity in parasite populations and might be applied to field samples in the future, e.g., to detect circulating low-frequency genotypes and to resolve mixed infection cases, with potential to transform molecular epidemiology. While sequencing single cells directly from host tissues may currently not be feasible, this method could readily be applied to fresh isolates (after only one or two passages) to detect circulating low-frequency genotypes and to monitor resistance-associated variants. As a proof-of-concept, we looked specifically for nucleotide polymorphisms in known drug resistance-associated genes in our dataset. We revealed high heterogeneity in SNPs in a few subsets of genes in the HU3 strain, which constitutes so far undetected/hidden levels of genomic heterogeneity, potentially already present in the parasite infecting the human host. Such within-population variability in drug resistance markers might represent hallmarks of heteroresistance, where genetically distinct subpopulations coexist with differing levels of drug susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Indeed, experimental selection of miltefosine resistance revealed that parasite adaptation to the drug was driven mainly by pre-existing mutations in a miltefosine transporter gene which were undetected in bulk genome sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Lastly, we also used the nucleotide information to infer the evolutionary relationship between cells of the two strains, showing that the clonal strain BPK081, maintained for only seven passages since cloning, exhibited minimal divergence among individual cells, while a higher diversity was observed in HU3. The ability to reconstruct phylogenetic trees at the single-cell level provides a powerful tool to study cellular evolution in both experimental and natural populations. For instance, using genetically introduced cellular barcoding, our group could track the clonal adaptation to two leishmanicidal drugs <italic>in vitro</italic>, revealing polyclonal origins for the genetic alterations associated with adaptation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Similar information could be gathered with scDNAseq without the need for genetic engineering. More broadly, single-cell phylogenies have proven instrumental in understanding tumor evolution and drug resistance in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. By resolving genetic lineages at cellular resolution, our method opens opportunities to monitor how eukaryotic cells diversify under selective pressures, whether in protozoan pathogens, model systems, or human disease.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our high-throughput single-cell genome sequencing method provides an unprecedented view of <italic>Leishmania</italic> genome variation at cellular resolution, confirming previous observations of mosaic aneuploidy as well as revealing novel insights on the extend of CNVs and nucleotide sequence diversity within parasite populations. By accurately capturing structural variations alongside sequence polymorphisms, this approach offers a promising tool to link genetic variation to phenotypic outcomes (such as drug resistance or virulence) in protozoan parasites. More broadly, the SPC-PTA workflow has the potential applicability to other pathogens and cell systems that exhibit genome instability (e.g. <italic>Candida</italic> spp. with aneuploidy, cancer cell subclones, etc.), suggesting a wide impact in fields ranging from microbiology to oncology. In summary, the SPC–PTA workflow fills a critical gap in our experimental arsenal to reveal the interplay between genome instability and the hidden diversity that underlies parasite adaptation, drug resistance, and survival in changing environments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Negreira et al. present an application of a novel single-cell genomics approach to investigate the genetic heterogeneity of Leishmania parasites. Leishmania, while also representing a major global disease with hundreds of thousands of cases annually, serves as a model to test the rigor of the sequencing strategy. Its complex karyotypic nature necessitates a method that is capable of resolving natural variation to better understand genome dynamics. Importantly, an earlier single-cell genomics platform (10x Chromium) is no longer available, and new methods need to be evaluated to fill in this gap.</p>
<p>The study was designed to evaluate whether a capsule-based cell capture method combined with primary template-directed amplification (PTA) could maintain levels of genomic heterogeneity represented in an equal mixture of two Leishmania strains. This was a high bar, given the relatively small protozoan genome and prior studies that showed limitations of single-cell genomics, especially for gene-level copy number changes. Overall, the study found that semi-permeable capsules (SPC) are an effective way to isolate high-quality single cells. Additionally, short reads from amplified genomes effectively maintained the relative levels of variation in the two strains on the chromosome, gene copy, and individual base level. Thus, this method will be useful to evaluate adaptive strategies of Leishmania. Many researchers will also refer to these studies to set up SPC collection and PTA methods for their organism of choice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The use of SPC and PTA in a non-bacterial organism is novel. The study displays the utility of these methods to isolate and amplify single genomes to a level that can be sequenced, despite being a motile organism with a GC-rich genome.</p>
<p>(2) The authors clearly outlined their optimization strategy and provided numerous quality-control metrics that inspire confidence in the success of achieving even chromosomal coverage relative to ploidy.</p>
<p>(3) The use of two distinct Leishmania strains with known clonal status provided strong evidence that PTA-based amplification could reflect genome differences and displayed the utility of the method for studies of rare genotypes.</p>
<p>(4) Evaluating the SPCs pre- and post-amplification with microscopy is a practical and robust way of determining the success of SPC formation and PTA.</p>
<p>(5) The authors show that the PTA-based approach easily resolved major genotypic ploidy in agreement with a prior 10x Chromium-based study. The new method had improved resolution of drug resistance genotypes in the form of both copy-number variations and single-nucleotide polymorphisms.</p>
<p>(6) In general, the authors are very thorough in describing the methods, including those used to optimize PTA lysis and amplification steps (fresh vs frozen cells, naked DNA vs sorted cells, etc). This demonstrates a depth of knowledge about the procedure and leaves few unanswered questions.</p>
<p>(7) The custom, multifaceted, computational assessment of coverage evenness is a major strength of the study and demonstrates that the authors acknowledge potential computational factors that could impact the analysis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The rationale behind some experimental/analysis choices is not well-described. For example, the rationale behind methanol fixation and heat-lysis is unclear. Additionally, the choice of various methods to assess &quot;evenness&quot; is not justified (e.g. why are multiple methods needed? What is the strength of each method?). Also, there is no justification for using 100k reads for subsampling. Finally, what exactly constitutes a &quot;confidently-called SNP&quot;?</p>
<p>(2) In the methods, the STD protocol lists a 15-minute amplification at 45C whereas the PTA protocol involves 10h at 37C. This is a dramatic difference in incubation time and should be addressed when comparing results from the two methods. It is not really a fair comparison when you look at coverage levels; of course, a 10-hour incubation is going to yield more reads than a 15-minute incubation.</p>
<p>(3) There is a lack of quantitative evaluations of the SPCs. e.g. How many capsules were evaluated to assess doublets? How many capsules were detected as Syto5 positive in a successful vs an unsuccessful experiment?</p>
<p>(4) The authors do not address some of the amplification results obtained under various conditions. For example, why did temperature-based lysis of STD4 lead to amplification failure? Also, what is the reason for fewer &quot;true&quot; cells (higher background) in the PTA samples compared to the STD samples? Is this related to issues with barcoding or, alternatively, substandard amplification as indicated by lower read amounts in some capsules (knee plots in Figure 1C)?</p>
<p>(5) The paper presents limited biological relevance. Without this, the paper describes an improvement in genome amplification methods and some proof-of-concept analyses. Using a 1:1 mixture of parasites with different genotypes, the authors display the utility of the method to resolve genetic diversity, but they don't seek to understand the limits of detecting this diversity. For some, the authors do not comment on the mixed karyotypes from the HU3 cells (Figure 3F) other than to state that this line was not clonal. For CNVs, the two loci evaluated were detected at relatively high copy number (according to Figure 4C, they are between 4 and 20 copies). Thus, the sensitivity of CNV detection from this data remains unclear; can this approach detect lower-level CNVs like duplications, or minor CNVs that do not show up in every cell?</p>
<p>(6) The authors state that Leishmania can carry extrachromosomal copies of important genes. There is no discussion about how the presence of these molecules would affect the amplification steps and CNV detection. For example, the phi29 enzyme is very processive with circular molecules; does its presence lead to overamplification and overrepresentation in the data? Is this evident in the current study? This information would be useful for organisms that carry this type of genetic element.</p>
<p>(7) The manuscript is missing a comparison with other similar studies in the field. For example, how does this coverage level compare to those achieved for other genomes? Can this method achieve amplification levels needed to assess larger genomes? Has there been any evaluation of base composition effects since Leishmania is a GC-rich genome?</p>
<p>(8) Cost is mentioned as a benefit of the SPC platform, and savings are achieved when working in a plate format, but no details are included on how this was evaluated.</p>
<p>(9) The Zenodo link for custom scripts does not exist, and code cannot be evaluated.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Negreira et al. propose a new scDNAseq method, using semi-permeable capsules (SPCs) and primary template-directed amplification (PTA). The authors optimize several metrics to improve their predictions, such as determining GC bias, Intra-Chromosomal fluctuation (ICF -metric to differentiate replicative and non-replicative cells) and Intra-chromosomal coefficient of variation (ICCV - chromosome read distribution). The coverage evenness was evaluated using the fini index and the median absolute pairwise difference between the counts of two consecutive bins. They validate the proposed method using two Leishmania donovani strains isolated from different countries, BPK081 (low genomic variability) and HU3 (high genomic variability). Then, they showed that the method outperforms WGA and has similar accuracy to the discontinued 10X-scDNA (10X Genomics), further improving on short CNV identification. The authors also show that the method can identify somy variations, insertions/deletions and SNP variations across cells. This is a timely and very relevant work that has a wide applicability in copy number variation assessment using single-cell data.</p>
<p>I really appreciate this work. My congratulations to the authors. All my comments below only aim to improve an already solid manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) Data availability: Although the authors provide a Zenodo link, the data is restricted. I also could not access the GitHub link in the Zenodo website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/gabrielnegreira/2025_scDNA_paper">https://github.com/gabrielnegreira/2025_scDNA_paper</ext-link>. The authors should make these files available.</p>
<p>(2) 2-SPC-PTA and SPC-STD cell count comparison: The authors have consistently proven that the SPC-PTA method was superior to SPC-STD. However, there are a few points that should be clarified regarding the SPC-PTA results. Is there an explanation for the lower proportion of SPC to true cells success in SPC-STD, which reflects the bimodal distribution for the reads per cell in SPC-PTA2 and a three-to-multimodal distribution in SPC-PTA1 in Figure 1B? Also, in Table 1, does the number of reads reflect the number of reads in all sequenced SPCs or only in the true cells? If it is in the SPCs, I suggest that the authors add a new column in the table with the &quot;Number of reads in true cells&quot; to account for this discrepancy.</p>
<p>(3) The authors should evaluate the results with a higher coverage for SCP-PTA. I understand that the authors subsampled the total read to 100,000 to allow cross-sample comparisons, especially between SPC-STD and SPC-PTA. However, as they concluded that the SPC-PTA was far superior, and the samples SPC-PTA1 and SPC-PTA2 had an &quot;elbow&quot; of 650,493 and 448,041, respectively, it might be interesting to revisit some of the estimations using only SPC-PTA samples and a higher coverage cutoff, as 400,000.</p>
<p>(4) Doublet detection: I suggest that the authors be a little more careful with their definition of doublets. The doublet detection was based on diagnostic SNPs from the two strains, BPK081 and HU3, which identify doublets between two very different and well-characterised strains. However, this method will probably not identify strain-specific doublets. This is of minor importance for cloned and stable strains with few passages, as BPK081, but might be more relevant in more heterogeneous strains, as HU3. Strain-specific doublets might also be relevant in other scenarios, as multiclonal infections with different populations from the same strain in the same geographic area. One positive point is that the &quot;between strain doublet count&quot; was low, so probably the within-strain doublet count should be low too. The manuscript would benefit from a discussion on this regard.</p>
<p>(5) Nucleotide sequence variants and phylogeny: I believe that a more careful description of the phylogenetic analysis and some limitations of the sequence variant identification would benefit the manuscript.</p>
<p>(5.1) As described in the methods, the authors intentionally selected two fairly different Leishmania donovani strains, HU3 and BPK081, and confirmed that the sequent variant methodology can separate cells from each strain. It is a solid proof of concept. However, most of the multiclonal infections in natural scenarios would be caused by parasite populations that diverge by fewer SNPs, and will be significantly harder to detect. Hence, I suggest that a short discussion about this is important.</p>
<p>(5.2) The authors should expand on the description of the phylogenetic tree. In the HU3 on Figure 5F left panel, most of the variation is observed in ~8 cells, which goes from position 0 to position ~28.000.</p>
<p>Most of the other cells are in very short branches, from ~29.000 to 30.4000 (5F right panel). Assuming that this representation is a phylogram, as the branches are short, these cells diverge by approximately 100-2000 SNPs. It is unexpected (but not impossible) that such ~8 divergent cells be maintained uniquely (or in very low counts) in the culture, unless this is a multiclonal infection. I would carefully investigate these cells. They might be doublets or have more missing data than other cells. I would also suggest that a quick discussion about this should be added to the manuscript.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. Indeed, single-cell DNA sequencing has successfully revealed cell-to-cell variability in replication timing and fork progression in mammalian cells[1,2] and we believe that the SPC-PTA workflow could be used in similar studies in Leishmania to complement bulk-based observations[3,4]. Regarding nucleotide information, it is indeed of high relevance to detect minor circulating variants with potential virulence impact and/or effect on drug resistance which could be missed by bulk sequencing. This includes the ability to detect co-occurring variants with potential epistatic effects. These topics will be further developed in the revised version. Finally, we will explicitly discuss how this methodology can be applied beyond Leishmania, to investigate genome plasticity, adaptation, and evolutionary processes in other organisms.</p>

Thus, this method will be useful to evaluate adaptive strategies of Leishmania. Many researchers will also refer to these studies to set up SPC collection and PTA methods for their organism of choice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The use of SPC and PTA in a non-bacterial organism is novel. The study displays the utility of these methods to isolate and amplify single genomes to a level that can be sequenced, despite being a motile organism with a GC-rich genome.</p>
<p>(2) The authors clearly outlined their optimization strategy and provided numerous quality-control metrics that inspire confidence in the success of achieving even chromosomal coverage relative to ploidy.</p>
<p>(3) The use of two distinct Leishmania strains with known clonal status provided strong evidence that PTA-based amplification could reflect genome differences and displayed the utility of the method for studies of rare genotypes.</p>
<p>(4) Evaluating the SPCs pre- and post-amplification with microscopy is a practical and robust way of determining the success of SPC formation and PTA.</p>
<p>(5) The authors show that the PTA-based approach easily resolved major genotypic ploidy in agreement with a prior 10x Chromium-based study. The new method had improved resolution of drug resistance genotypes in the form of both copy-number variations and single-nucleotide polymorphisms.</p>
<p>(6) In general, the authors are very thorough in describing the methods, including those used to optimize PTA lysis and amplification steps (fresh vs frozen cells, naked DNA vs sorted cells, etc). This demonstrates a depth of knowledge about the procedure and leaves few unanswered questions.</p>
<p>(7) The custom, multifaceted, computational assessment of coverage evenness is a major strength of the study and demonstrates that the authors acknowledge potential computational factors that could impact the analysis.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The rationale behind some experimental/analysis choices is not well-described. For example, the rationale behind methanol fixation and heat-lysis is unclear. Additionally, the choice of various methods to assess &quot;evenness&quot; is not justified (e.g. why are multiple methods needed? What is the strength of each method?). Also, there is no justification for using 100k reads for subsampling. Finally, what exactly constitutes a &quot;confidently-called SNP&quot;?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The methanol fixation prior to lysis is part of the original protocol described in the Single-Microbe Genome Barcoding Kit manual and was meant to facilitate lysis and DNA denaturation in bacterial cells (for which the kit was originally developed). However, in our preliminary tests with bulk samples – described in the supplementary material – we noticed a strong negative effect on lysis efficiency/DNA recovery when parasites were fixed with methanol. Thus, we decided to test the effect of skipping this step in the single-cell DNA workflow. We kept the SPC_STD1 sample to have a safe control where the full workflow described in the kit manual was followed.</p>
<p>As we were unsure if the standard lysis (25 °C for 15 minutes) would work efficiently for Leishmania, we included the heat-lysis (99 °C for 15 minutes) as well as the longer incubation lysis (25 °C for 1h). These modifications were listed as validated alternatives in the kit's manual.</p>
<p>The 100k reads threshold was chosen based on the number of reads found in the 'true cell' with the lowest read count.</p>
<p>Regarding variant calling, a variant was considered confidently called if it was covered, at single-cell level, by at least one deduplicated read with Phred quality above Q30 and mapping quality (MAPQ) also above 30.</p>
<p>In the revised version, we will include these explanations and improve the explanation of the metrics used to estimate coverage quality.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In the methods, the STD protocol lists a 15-minute amplification at 45C whereas the PTA protocol involves 10h at 37C. This is a dramatic difference in incubation time and should be addressed when comparing results from the two methods. It is not really a fair comparison when you look at coverage levels; of course, a 10-hour incubation is going to yield more reads than a 15-minute incubation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the longer incubation period of PTA might explain the higher read count seen in the PTA samples, although the differences in amplification kinetics (linear in PTA, exponential in STD) and potential differences in amplification saturation points make it difficult to compare them. For instance, an updated version of PTA (ResolveDNA V2) uses a lower amplification time (2.5 h) and achieves similar amplification levels compared to the 10h incubation time, suggesting PTA amplification saturates well before the 10h time. In any case, all quality check metrics were done with the cells subsampled to 100 k reads to mitigate the effect of read count differences on the data quality.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) There is a lack of quantitative evaluations of the SPCs. e.g. How many capsules were evaluated to assess doublets? How many capsules were detected as Syto5 positive in a successful vs an unsuccessful experiment?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer but during experimental execution SPCs were only assessed qualitatively via microscopy following the Single-cell microbe DNA barcoding kit manual. No quantitative analysis was done and therefore we do not have this data. Regarding doublet, this was done in silico based on the detection of SPCs containing mixed genomes from the two strains used in the study as described in the Materials and Methods. As pointed by another reviewer, this only allow the detection of inter-strain doublets. In the revised version, we explain this and add an estimation of total doublets based on the inter-strain doublet rate.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors do not address some of the amplification results obtained under various conditions. For example, why did temperature-based lysis of STD4 lead to amplification failure? Also, what is the reason for fewer &quot;true&quot; cells (higher background) in the PTA samples compared to the STD samples? Is this related to issues with barcoding or, alternatively, substandard amplification as indicated by lower read amounts in some capsules (knee plots in Figure 1C)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>After exchange with the technical support team of the SPC generator kit, it was clarified that the heat lysis done in STD4 should have had a shorter incubation time (10 minutes instead of 15 minutes). We suspect that the longer incubation time, combined with the higher temperature and the harsh lysis condition with 0.8M KOH might have damaged SPCs and therefore DNA might have leaked out of them before WGA. In the microscopy images, SPCs in STD4 show a swollen aspect not seen in the other samples. In the revised version we will explain this more clearly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The paper presents limited biological relevance. Without this, the paper describes an improvement in genome amplification methods and some proof-of-concept analyses. Using a 1:1 mixture of parasites with different genotypes, the authors display the utility of the method to resolve genetic diversity, but they don't seek to understand the limits of detecting this diversity. For some, the authors do not comment on the mixed karyotypes from the HU3 cells (Figure 3F) other than to state that this line was not clonal. For CNVs, the two loci evaluated were detected at relatively high copy number (according to Figure 4C, they are between 4 and 20 copies). Thus, the sensitivity of CNV detection from this data remains unclear; can this approach detect lower-level CNVs like duplications, or minor CNVs that do not show up in every cell?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described above we will include more discussion on potential biological relevance of the method in the revised version of the manuscript. In the revised version we will attempt to use dedicated bioinformatic tools to discover de novo CNVs, as per the suggestion of other reviewers. This might also allow us to determine the detection limit of the methodology for CNVs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The authors state that Leishmania can carry extrachromosomal copies of important genes. There is no discussion about how the presence of these molecules would affect the amplification steps and CNV detection. For example, the phi29 enzyme is very processive with circular molecules; does its presence lead to overamplification and overrepresentation in the data? Is this evident in the current study? This information would be useful for organisms that carry this type of genetic element.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe our data, which uses short-read sequences, does not allow to differentiate between intra-chromosomal CNVs and linear or circular episomal CNVs, so we cannot define if circular CNVs are over-amplified. Of note, we have previously demonstrated that the M-locus CNV in chromosome 36 is intrachromosomal, not circular (episomal)[5].</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The manuscript is missing a comparison with other similar studies in the field. For example, how does this coverage level compare to those achieved for other genomes? Can this method achieve amplification levels needed to assess larger genomes? Has there been any evaluation of base composition effects since Leishmania is a GC-rich genome?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe the SPC-PTA workflow can be applied to organisms with larger genomes as PTA was developed specifically for mammalian cells[6], and also because, in our hands, it outperformed the 10X scDNA solution, which was developed for mammals.</p>
<p>We believe direct comparison with other studies regarding coverage levels is elusive because other steps in the workflow apart from the WGA, such as the library preparation (PCR-based in our case), as well as genome features like GC content, size, and presence of repetitive regions, can also affect coverage levels and evenness. One strength of our approach was the use a single sample (the 50/50 mix between two L. donovani strain) for all conditions, thus removing potential parasite-specific biases. In addition, the application of a multiplexing system during barcoding allowed us to combine all samples prior to library preparation, thus removing potential differences introduced by this step.</p>
<p>Regarding the effect of GC-content, we did notice a positive bias in all samples in regions with higher GC content, which had to be corrected in silico. This was the opposite to a negative bias observed in previous study[7] likely due to differences in WGA and/or library preparation. In the revised version, we will include a supplementary figure showing the GC bias.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Cost is mentioned as a benefit of the SPC platform, and savings are achieved when working in a plate format, but no details are included on how this was evaluated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revised version we will provide precise cost estimates and the rationale for the estimation.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Negreira et al. propose a new scDNAseq method, using semi-permeable capsules (SPCs) and primary template-directed amplification (PTA). The authors optimize several metrics to improve their predictions, such as determining GC bias, Intra-Chromosomal fluctuation (ICF -metric to differentiate replicative and non-replicative cells) and Intra-chromosomal coefficient of variation (ICCV - chromosome read distribution). The coverage evenness was evaluated using the fini index and the median absolute pairwise difference between the counts of two consecutive bins. They validate the proposed method using two Leishmania donovani strains isolated from different countries, BPK081 (low genomic variability) and HU3 (high genomic variability). Then, they showed that the method outperforms WGA and has similar accuracy to the discontinued 10X-scDNA (10X Genomics), further improving on short CNV identification. The authors also show that the method can identify somy variations, insertions/deletions and SNP variations across cells. This is a timely and very relevant work that has a wide applicability in copy number variation assessment using single-cell data.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>I really appreciate this work. My congratulations to the authors. All my comments below only aim to improve an already solid manuscript.</p>

<p>(1) Data availability: Although the authors provide a Zenodo link, the data is restricted.

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) 2-SPC-PTA and SPC-STD cell count comparison: The authors have consistently proven that the SPC-PTA method was superior to SPC-STD. However, there are a few points that should be clarified regarding the SPC-PTA results. Is there an explanation for the lower proportion of SPC to true cells success in SPC-STD, which reflects the bimodal distribution for the reads per cell in SPC-PTA2 and a three-to-multimodal distribution in SPC-PTA1 in Figure 1B? Also, in Table 1, does the number of reads reflect the number of reads in all sequenced SPCs or only in the true cells? If it is in the SPCs, I suggest that the authors add a new column in the table with the &quot;Number of reads in true cells&quot; to account for this discrepancy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reason for the higher presence of 'background' SPCs in the PTA samples is not clear, but we hypothesize that it could be due to PTA favoring amplification of small, free floating DNA molecules that might have been trapped in cell-free SPCs, as PTA works with shorter amplicons. Also, the longer incubation time seen in PTA (10 h) might have allowed enhanced amplification of low quantities of free-floating DNA to detectable levels. Regarding Table 1, indeed it only show the total number of reads per sample. In the revised version we will include the suggested column to Table 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors should evaluate the results with a higher coverage for SCP-PTA. I understand that the authors subsampled the total read to 100,000 to allow cross-sample comparisons, especially between SPC-STD and SPC-PTA. However, as they concluded that the SPC-PTA was far superior, and the samples SPC-PTA1 and SPC-PTA2 had an &quot;elbow&quot; of 650,493 and 448,041, respectively, it might be interesting to revisit some of the estimations using only SPC-PTA samples and a higher coverage cutoff, as 400,000.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe the 100.000 cutoff is already high for aneuploidy analysis as we have successfully reconstructed parasite karyotype with 20.000 reads per cell8, so a higher cutoff will likely not improve it. For CNV analysis, in the revised version, we will try to identify de novo CNVs using dedicated bioinformatic tools as per other reviewer suggestions. There, we will also test if a higher CNV detection sensitivity is achieved using the suggested 400,000 reads cutoff for the PTA samples.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Doublet detection: I suggest that the authors be a little more careful with their definition of doublets. The doublet detection was based on diagnostic SNPs from the two strains, BPK081 and HU3, which identify doublets between two very different and well-characterised strains. However, this method will probably not identify strain-specific doublets. This is of minor importance for cloned and stable strains with few passages, as BPK081, but might be more relevant in more heterogeneous strains, as HU3. Strain-specific doublets might also be relevant in other scenarios, as multiclonal infections with different populations from the same strain in the same geographic area. One positive point is that the &quot;between strain doublet count&quot; was low, so probably the within-strain doublet count should be low too. The manuscript would benefit from a discussion on this regard.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with the reviewer. We will make it clear in the revised version that we quantify inter-strain doublets only, and we will also provide an estimation of total doublets based on the inter-strain doublet rate.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Nucleotide sequence variants and phylogeny: I believe that a more careful description of the phylogenetic analysis and some limitations of the sequence variant identification would benefit the manuscript.</p>
<p>(5.1) As described in the methods, the authors intentionally selected two fairly different Leishmania donovani strains, HU3 and BPK081, and confirmed that the sequent variant methodology can separate cells from each strain. It is a solid proof of concept. However, most of the multiclonal infections in natural scenarios would be caused by parasite populations that diverge by fewer SNPs, and will be significantly harder to detect. Hence, I suggest that a short discussion about this is important.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will add a short discussion clarifying the limitations, while noting that our data demonstrate the ability of the approach to resolve very closely related cells, as illustrated by the fine-scale genetic differences observed within the clonal BPK081 population and by the detection of rare variants at targeted loci. We will also emphasize that the sensitivity to detect closely related genotypes depends on sequencing depth and the genomic regions considered.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5.2) The authors should expand on the description of the phylogenetic tree. In the HU3 on Figure 5F left panel, most of the variation is observed in ~8 cells, which goes from position 0 to position ~28.000. Most of the other cells are in very short branches, from ~29.000 to 30.4000 (5F right panel). Assuming that this representation is a phylogram, as the branches are short, these cells diverge by approximately 100-2000 SNPs. It is unexpected (but not impossible) that such ~8 divergent cells be maintained uniquely (or in very low counts) in the culture, unless this is a multiclonal infection. I would carefully investigate these cells. They might be doublets or have more missing data than other cells. I would also suggest that a quick discussion about this should be added to the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revised version we will improve the description of the phylogenetic analysis. We will also investigate deeper the 8 mentioned cells to define if they have confounding factors that might have led to their discrepancy. The possibility of multiclonal infection in HU3 is not excluded as this strain was not cloned after isolation.</p>
