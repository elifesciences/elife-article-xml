<title>Abstract</title><p>Accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) in liver fibrosis is associated with changes in protein abundance and composition depending upon etiology of the underlying liver disease. Current efforts to unravel etiology- specific mechanisms and pharmacological targets rely on several models of experimental fibrosis. Here, we characterize and compare dynamics of hepatic proteome remodeling during fibrosis development and spontaneous healing in experimental models of hepatotoxic (CCl<sub>4</sub> intoxication) and cholestatic (3,5- diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) feeding) injury. Using detergent-based tissue extraction and mass spectrometry, we identified compartment-specific changes in the liver proteome with detailed attention to ECM composition and changes in protein solubility. Our analysis yielded unique time-resolved CCl<sub>4</sub> and DDC signatures underscoring restricted healing with higher carcinogenic potential upon cholestasis. Correlation of protein abundance profiles with fibrous deposits revealed extracellular chaperone clusterin with implicated role in fibrosis resolution. Dynamics of clusterin expression was validated in the context of human liver fibrosis. Atomic force microscopy of fibrotic livers complemented proteomics with profiles of disease-associated changes in local liver tissue mechanics. This study determined compartment-specific proteomic landscapes of liver fibrosis and delineated etiology-specific ECM components, providing thus a foundation for future antifibrotic therapies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Liver fibrosis and subsequent cirrhosis, two leading causes of liver disease-related deaths worldwide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> develop as a result of chronic liver injury of multiple etiologies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Fibrosis is characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins forming fibrous scar tissue. In the liver, such pathological matrix is deposited by activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and/or portal fibroblasts (PFs) in response to the inflammatory reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Recent multi-omics studies have framed fibrosis as a dynamic multicellular process associated with the remodeling of gene expression landscapes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> and profound changes in liver protein abundance as well as composition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hepatocellular injury alters parenchymal mechanical properties,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> thus further facilitating activation of resident HSCs and PFs and their differentiation into myofibroblasts depositing collagen-rich ECM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Accumulation of abnormal ECM further promotes ECM-depositing myofibroblasts and fosters progressive whole-organ stiffening as a result of ongoing fibrogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> Thus, ECM-associated changes are increasingly perceived as causative, rather than consequential, and multiple efforts have focused on the identification of extracellular niche components that drive the pathogenesis of fibrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ECM is a complex network of hundreds of proteins acting as a three-dimensional scaffold, supporting cells mechanically and functioning as a reservoir for secreted factors (e.g., growth factors and cytokines).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> This so-called “matrisome” consists of “core matrisome” (the structural components of the ECM; i.e., collagens, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans) and “matrix-associated matrisome” (the ECM-interacting proteins).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Transitions of extracellular factors between the insoluble matrisome and the soluble pools modulate their signaling capabilities and bioavailability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> As fibrous ECM assemblies determine also tissue mechanics, matrisome constituents provide matrix-embedded cells with spatially distinct biochemical and biomechanical context.</p>
<p>In terms of etiology, chronic liver injury is inflicted either by hepatotoxic or cholestatic insult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> In recent decades, several corresponding animal models of liver fibrosis have been established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> Despite several translational limitations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> these experimental models mimic fundamental aspects of human liver fibrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> For instance, iterative carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) intoxication causes hepatocellular damage, HSC activation, and development of pericentral liver fibrosis that evolves into severe bridging fibrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> In contrast, 3,5- diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) feeding induces obstructive cholestasis, characterized by expansion of PFs and consecutive periportal fibrosis with typical portal–portal septa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> As both human and animal studies have shown that liver fibrosis can be ameliorated by either targeting progression or promoting resolution,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> experimental models have become instrumental for identifying factors and mechanisms central to blocking fibrosis progression and promoting the reversal of advanced fibrosis.</p>
<p>In this comparative study, we employed CCl<sub>4</sub>- and DDC-based mouse models to describe proteomic changes during liver injury, fibrosis development, and repair while focusing on matrisome remodeling and associated alterations in tissue biomechanics. Our in-depth analysis of MS data obtained from total liver lysates and ECM-enriched insoluble fractions defines compartment- and time-resolved proteomic signatures in toxin- versus cholestasis-induced fibrosis and healing and delineates disease-specific matrisome.</p>

<title>Proteomic analysis outlines the gradual fibrosis development and partial healing in both CCl<sub>4</sub>- and DDC- induced liver injury</title>
<p>To compare time-resolved, compartment-specific proteomes of CCl<sub>4</sub>- and DDC-induced models of liver fibrosis, total liver lysates (Total) together with two protein fractions obtained by one-step detergent extraction (ECM-enriched insoluble fraction (E-fraction) and soluble fraction (S-fraction)) were prepared for MS analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The gradual fibrogenesis was assessed at two time points (T1 and T2) corresponding to mild fibrosis with partially bridging septa (T1, 3 weeks for CCl<sub>4</sub> and 2 weeks for DDC treatment) and advanced fibrosis (T2, 6 weeks for CCl<sub>4</sub> and 4 weeks for DDC). To characterize the dynamics of spontaneous fibrosis resolution, we allowed the mice 5 (T3) or 10 days (T4) to recover. Both models developed typical progressive liver damage with fibrotic scarring followed by partial healing upon insult withdrawal as demonstrated by plasma levels of liver injury markers and the extent of collagen-rich deposits in liver sections (Figure S1).</p>

<p>Using the two models, we quantified 4,737 proteins approximately evenly distributed across all time points and fractions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,C</xref>, Supporting Results). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed clear temporal separation of CCl<sub>4</sub>- and DDC-derived samples in both Total and E-fraction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of total lysate proteins together with annotation enrichment of the observed clusters further demonstrated substantial differences in the dynamic regulation of protein expression between the two models (Figure S2). This was evidenced by differential Total MS protein intensity temporal profiles of matrisome-enriched cluster constituents, such as vitronectin, galectin 8, fibrillin 1, or a putative portal myofibroblast marker collagen α-1(XV) chain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Moreover, distinct galectin 8 and vitronectin expression profiles obtained for CCl<sub>4</sub> and DDC E-fractions revealed complex changes in protein association with the insoluble proteome. Taken together, our MS data allow for time-resolved identification of proteins differentially expressed during fibrosis progression and resolution in etiologically distinct models of liver fibrosis. Moreover, this approach enables analysis of complex changes in the solubility of the identified proteins and their transition between liver compartments.</p>

</fig>
<p>Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), we predicted upstream transcriptional regulators and growth factors together with corresponding downstream biological signaling pathways differentially associated with identified protein groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and S3A). Abundance changes in known targets indicated the activity of key regulators involved in fibrogenesis (TGFβ1 and angiotensinogen), hypoxia response (HIF1A), and inhibition of factors mediating hepatocyte function (HNF4α and HNF1α) or involved in HSC inactivation (PPARGC1A) in both fibrotic models (Figure S3A). Interestingly, the pro-proliferative mTOR pathway showed signaling attenuation in the course of CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment but upregulation in the case of DDC treatment, suggesting hyperplastic potential of the DDC model (Figure S3A). Consistently, analysis of the DDC signature revealed inhibition of tumor suppressor gene <italic>Rb1</italic> with simultaneous activation of potential oncogenic regulators KDM5A, MRTFA, MYC, and YAP, thus underscoring increased carcinogenic risk (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and S3B). By contrast, the CCl<sub>4</sub> signature indicated activation of EGF and VEGFα with simultaneous downregulation of the HNF4α (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). This supports previous reports on the importance of these factors during hepatotoxic injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> While dynamic changes of regulatory networks and signaling pathways correlated well with fibrosis progression in both models, ineffective downregulation of profibrotic signaling in the DDC-induced model suggested a limited capacity of the liver to heal from cholestatic injury (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and S3B).</p>
<p>Next, we analyzed CCl<sub>4</sub> and DDC Total proteomes using unsupervised hierarchical clustering and functional annotation term enrichment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref>). This allowed the separation of proteins with similar temporal abundance profiles while simultaneously revealing clusters comprising matrisome-annotated proteins (see Materials and Methods). In the CCl<sub>4</sub> proteome, three matrisome-annotated clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>; clusters I, II, and III) containing 755 proteins showed a variable degree of time-dependent abundance decline over the course of healing. By contrast, two large matrisome-annotated clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>; clusters I and II) with 799 constituents showed almost no decline in abundance over the recovery period in the DDC model. Our data reflect the reversibility of CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced fibrogenesis and restricted healing with higher carcinogenic risk in the DDC model.</p>

<p>To further dissect disease-specific processes associated with matrisome-enriched clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref>), we followed the functional annotation of proteins using a comprehensive annotation matrix compiled from GO terms, UniProtKB keywords, and the MatrisomeDB matrisome database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> This revealed that 303 proteins shared by CCl<sub>4</sub> and DDC Total proteomes were annotated not only with matrisome-related keywords but also as “Cell adhesion”, “Fibrinogen complex”, “Platelet aggregation”, and “Intermediate filaments”, thus indicating engagement in cellular interaction with ECM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Consistently, top canonical IPA pathways included “Signaling by Rho family GTPases”, “Integrin signaling” and “Actin cytoskeleton signaling” (Figure S3C). As anticipated, 452 proteins uniquely identified in CCl<sub>4</sub> matrisome-enriched clusters were also associated with inflammatory response, a well-described feature of this model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> A group of 496 proteins exclusive for DDC was found to associate with “Basement membrane” and “Cell substrate junction” reflecting an increased abundance of BM components synthesized during the development of periductal fibrosis (e.g., laminins, α- chains of collagens IV, VI, and XVIII; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>In a group of 60 matrisome proteins significantly changing in both Total CCl<sub>4</sub> and DDC proteomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) there were mainly core matrisome proteins, such as collagens (e.g., α-chains of collagens I and V) and ECM glycoproteins (e.g., fibronectin, EMILIN1, and vitronectin). In contrast to previous reports,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> we found collagen VI, a protein regulating ECM contractility,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> upregulated during fibrogenesis in both models (Figure S4). In addition, we identified several matrisome-associated proteins (e.g., NGLY1, PLOD3, S100A4, MUG2, SERPINA7, SERPINF1, and P4HA1) not previously reported in liver fibrosis as uniquely induced in the CCl<sub>4</sub> model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> Among these, ECM glycoprotein lactadherin (MFGE8), has been shown to reduce liver fibrosis in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> In contrast, BM matrisome proteins, such as laminins, collagens IV and XVIII, and perlecan (HSPG2) were exclusively upregulated in the DDC proteome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and S4).</p>

<p>Rapid increase in HSC and activated PF signatures paralleled the activation and proliferation of ECM-depositing myofibroblasts in both fibrotic models (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). However, faster upregulation of activated PFs in DDC confirms their predominant role in cholestatic fibrosis. Temporal abundance profiles of Kupffer cell, macrophage, monocyte, and B-cell signature proteins illustrate faster recovery from inflammation with healing in the CCl<sub>4</sub> than in DDC model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C,D</xref> and S5A). These findings, together with matrisome- enriched protein cluster analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), emphasized the role of the inflammation component in the context of fibrosis and underscored the model-specific involvement of PFs in cholestatic fibrosis.</p>
<p>Cellular interactions with the changing microenvironment are mediated by integrins, a heterogeneous family of cell adhesion receptors. Thus, temporal changes in cell type-specific integrin subsets reflect the alterations in fibrotic injury-induced cell populations with the potential to predict the fibrogenicity of the ongoing disease. Our profiling revealed increased expression of integrin β1 (Figure S5B), the most abundant collagen receptor, which has been reported (together with integrins α1 and α5) to correlate with the stages of human liver fibrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Given its cell type-specific expression prevalence, this finding likely corresponds to the expansion of HSCs, simultaneously with induced integrin β1 expression on LSECs and injured hepatocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> A rapid immune response is documented by extensive upregulation of main leukocyte integrin subunits β2 and αM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E</xref> and S5B). Their differential expression kinetics between the models correlate well with cell type-specific signatures (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C,D</xref> and S5A). Unexpectedly, fibronectin receptor integrin α5 (typically expressed on HSCs, PFs, and LSECs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> was detected in Total DDC proteome only (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Inasmuch as a boosted expression of integrin α5 has been reported in liver tumors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> this finding further supports the tumorigenic potential of biliary fibrosis.</p>
<p>Strong induction of TGFβ-activating integrin αv in both CCl<sub>4</sub> and DDC Total proteomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) reflected its central role in fibrogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> Strikingly, in E-fraction, integrin αv was found to increase only in the CCl<sub>4</sub> model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting its close association with ECM specifically during hepatotoxic injury. Subsequent IF analysis showed localization of antibodies to αv mostly to periportal hepatocytes and with little signal found in central hepatocytes of control livers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). During CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced injury, αv staining was enhanced at the periphery of pericentral hepatocytes adjacent to the collagen-rich scars, reflecting ongoing liver periportalization with the injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> The zonal distribution of αv was partially restored with fibrosis regression. In DDC-driven cholestasis, antibodies to αv stained strongly reactive biliary epithelial cells (BECs), the main drivers of fibrogenesis in biliary fibrosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, our analysis reveals stage-specific induction of integrin αv on the surface of pericentral hepatocytes that has been unrecognized to date and suggests its potential as a marker of reactive cholangiocytes in cholestasis.</p>

<title>Analysis of solubility profile dynamics of liver proteome reveals extracellular matrix protein-1 among matrisome proteins induced by fibrogenesis</title>
<p>As ECM remodeling during fibrogenesis entails also changes in the solubility of its constituents and associated proteins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> we next set out to identify proteins that become increasingly insoluble with fibrosis progression. We found 1,273 (CCl<sub>4</sub>) and 762 (DDC) differentially expressed proteins, defined by at least 3-fold higher expression in E- than in S-fraction (see Materials and Methods). Hierarchical clustering of their MS intensity ratios clearly reflected changes in protein solubility profiles in the course of disease progression (Figure S6A,B). Proteins grouped into three (CCl<sub>4</sub>, 406 proteins) and two (DDC, 63 proteins) ECM-enriched clusters exhibited increasing insolubility during fibrogenesis. Matrisome proteins found in both fibrotic models were mainly collagens and ECM glycoproteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, we identified 93 (CCl<sub>4</sub>) and 16 (DDC) proteins not present in control samples but induced by treatment (Figure S6C, Supporting Results). Abundance of most of these proteins in E-fraction decreased with healing in the CCl<sub>4</sub> but not in the DDC model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting model-specific incorporation of matrisome-associated proteins into insoluble ECM.</p>

<p>Among proteins upregulated with disease onset in E-fractions of both fibrotic models was extracellular matrix protein-1 (ECM1; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C</xref> and S6C). Subsequent IF analysis confirmed weak ECM1 staining (corresponding to low expression levels) in control livers, which was confined mostly to Kupffer cells and the apical membrane of BECs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5E</xref> and S6B). Increased ECM1 abundance during fibrogenesis was paralleled by its increasing localization within the infiltrating inflammatory cells and activated Kupffer cells. In addition, ECM1 heavily decorated apical membranes of BECs forming reactive ductuli in DDC-treated livers, corresponding thus to higher MS intensity of ECM1 during the development of biliary fibrosis. Induction of ECM1 expression in the inflammatory cells at the sites of primary injury in the CCl<sub>4</sub> model and in reactive ductuli in the DDC model strongly indicates its involvement in fibrogenesis and healing. Although a previous study had identified ECM1 expression to be hepatocyte-specific,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> our data suggest that its role might be more complex than anticipated.</p>

<p>In the Total CCl<sub>4</sub> proteome, proteins positively correlating with fibrogenesis included matrisome proteins (e.g., angiotensinogen, fibrinogen α,β, γ-chain, fibrinogen-like protein 1, and fibronectin). The IPA analysis linked these to the inflammation and pathways associated with ECM-cell interactions, such as “Actin cytoskeleton signaling” and “Integrin signaling” (Figure S7A). Proteins with negative correlation were mostly enzymes involved in hepatocyte metabolism, such as alpha-enolase (ENO1), an enzyme shown to participate as plasminogen receptor in ECM degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> Analogously to Total proteome, proteins of CCl<sub>4</sub> E-fraction positively correlating with fibrosis area were linked to fibrogenesis (Figure S7B). Displaying negative correlation was a group of 41 proteins consisting mainly of enzymes associated with amino acid metabolism, necrosis, and apoptosis (Figure S7A,B). In addition, three core matrisome proteins – decorin, MFAP2, and collagen α-1 (I) – also were identified. As shown for collagen α-1 (I), their MS intensity temporal profiles indicated their upregulation in E-fraction while their overall abundance decreased with healing (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), likely corresponding to the increased association of these matrisome proteins with degraded insoluble ECM.</p>
<p>Among proteins positively correlating with fibrotic scar development and resolution in both Total and insoluble proteomes was clusterin, a glycoprotein implicated in several diseases (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> As clusterin imparts extracellular chaperone function not previously linked to fibrosis, we next investigated clusterin’s localization by IF microscopy (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). In untreated livers, clusterin was detected in BECs and partially in hepatocytes. Upon CCl<sub>4</sub> intoxication, IF staining revealed its prominent expression by damaged hepatocytes.

In DDC- treated livers, clusterin was found mostly in BECs forming reactive ductuli and hepatocytes, with minimal changes upon healing (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Moreover, extracellular clusterin deposition in close proximity of collagen fibers was further demonstrated in fibrotic and cirrhotic human livers of various etiologies at different stages of fibrosis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6F</xref> and S8). The gradual increase in clusterin expression with the progression of fibrosis against the background of chronic hepatitis C (METAVIR score F1-F4) further emphasized its role in the development of liver fibrotic diseases.</p>

<p>As variations in ECM composition and content also substantially affect the biomechanics of liver tissue, we decided to examine correlation between our proteomic results and mapping of dynamic changes in the biomechanical properties of CCl<sub>4</sub>-treated livers. We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) combined with polarized microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> to precisely locate and probe the following compartments: 1) regions of collagen-rich scar tissue in close vicinity of the central vein, 2) injured hepatocyte regions next to the collagen scar, and 3) regions of hepatocytes on the interface between injured and not visibly damaged hepatocytes (so-called interface hepatocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). In parallel, we also measured stiffness of corresponding regions in nontreated control liver sections (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>Our AFM analysis revealed no substantial topological variations across defined compartments in control livers, with median Young’s moduli ranging between 1.2 and 1.6 kPa (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, Table S1). Fibrogenic response triggered progressive tissue stiffening apparent in all analyzed compartments (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D–F</xref>, Table S1), with collagen-rich regions the stiffest at maximal fibrosis (∼4.4 kPa at T2; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). Unexpectedly, interface regions exhibited initial softening (T1; median ∼0.8 kPa vs. 1.2 kPa in control livers), which was followed by increase in stiffness up to ∼2.0 kPa (T2). With healing (T4), all compartments demonstrated clear decrease in stiffness (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D–F</xref>), although this was only marginal in the regions corresponding to injured hepatocytes. Significant softening of collagen-rich scar tissue during healing indicated partial resolution of scar-associated ECM while it associated with the incorporation of several core matrisome proteins (e.g., COL1A1 and FBN1) into the scar tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we comprehensively characterized and compared dynamic proteomic landscapes of liver fibrosis development and repair in two mouse models based either on repetitive CCl<sub>4</sub> intoxication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> or DDC feeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> These models are widely used to reliably mimic either hepatotoxic (CCl<sub>4</sub>) or cholestatic (DDC) liver injuries leading to fibrosis in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> Previous attempts to grasp the complexity of etiology-specific fibrotic proteomes with a focus on diseased ECM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> were limited due to origins of the analyzed material (mostly decellularized samples) and yielded only fragmented insight into the time course of the disease. To fill this research gap, we employed detergent-based tissue extraction and analyzed both Total and insoluble fraction proteomes at multiple time points of disease progression and spontaneous healing. This approach allowed us to 1) compare time-resolved, compartment-specific proteomes of CCl<sub>4</sub> and DDC models, 2) define etiology- specific elements of fibrogenesis, and 3) detect even low-abundance matrisome and matrisome-interacting proteins in the ECM-enriched insoluble fraction samples. Further, our detailed AFM-based profiling of CCl<sub>4</sub>- treated livers enabled us to relate our proteomic data to disease-associated changes in the local mechanics of liver tissue.</p>
<p>We and others have demonstrated that the nature of liver injury determines the set of components assembled in diseased ECM,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> which thus reflects unique features of the injury. For instance, the initial decline in abundance of hepatocyte- and activated BEC-expressed COL18A1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and its consecutive increase thereafter in the hepatotoxic CCl<sub>4</sub> model corresponds to hepatocyte death followed by expansion of both COL18A1- expressing cell types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> By contrast, extensive COL18A1 expression in DDC-induced cholestasis was already apparent in the early fibrotic deposits due to a massive ductular reaction. A prominent group of BM-associated proteins uniquely identified in the cholestatic model can be attributed to activated BECs in proliferating bile ducts. Some of them (e.g., COL18A1, COL4A2, COL6A2, and HSPG2) are among the 14-gene signature potently predicting human patient cirrhosis progression and survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> Other DDC matrisome constituents (e.g., COL3A1, elastin, and LAMC1) have been recently linked to the deterioration of hepatocyte functions in connection with ECM stiffening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> Notably, elastin is present in liver biopsies from patients with advanced fibrosis and adverse clinical outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> and is associated with the irreversibility of liver fibrosis. Further, the increased incorporation of crosslinking protein LOXL1 and TGFβ1-related protein LTBP4 into DDC-specific ECM underscores its resemblance to human cirrhotic liver ECM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> Hence, our findings indicate that cholestasis- driven ECM deposits contain numerous proteins detected in more advanced stages of liver disease favoring hepatocarcinogenesis with a compromised ability to heal. Moreover, identified cholestasis-induced unique signaling pathways were analogous to those recently identified in a subtype of mouse cancer models mimicking human cholangiocarcinoma-like hepatocellular cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our observations are concordant with recently published studies (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) revealing that in the fibrotic liver resident and nonresident cell types wire into dynamic intercellular hubs with shifting cell populations, reflecting and shaping the disease course in an etiology-specific manner. Many of the feedback mechanisms between the cells and ECM regulating fibrosis are mediated by members of the integrin family. In agreement with previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> we observed in both models significant upregulation of all detected integrin subunits during fibrosis progression. Strong induction of integrin αM expression in cholestatic but not hepatotoxic injury documents the role of leukocyte-specific integrin αMβ2 in the modulation of biliary fibrosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> suggesting that the integrin αM might thus serve as a possible selective target for treatment of cholestatic liver disease. Further, a prominent transition of TGFβ1-activating integrin αv toward insoluble ECM exclusively upon hepatotoxic injury was accompanied by its localization to injured pericentral hepatocytes near collagen-rich scars and αSMA-positive HSCs. This finding, together with a measured increase in the stiffness of injured hepatocytes, implies an active role of integrin αv in the targeted activation of TGFβ1 in the local microenvironment during centrilobular fibrosis. Indeed, integrin αv located on hepatocytes in the vicinity of biliary fibrotic septa has been suggested to indicate hepatocyte biliary transformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> Here, we propose that compartment-specific induction of αv expression on the surface of scar-associated hepatocytes could be a general mechanism to promote fibrosis progression.</p>
<p>In contrast to the cholestatic DDC model, hepatotoxic injury in the CCl<sub>4</sub> model showed a substantial ability to heal 10 days after challenge withdrawal. Such healing capacity allowed us to correlate the dynamics in CCl<sub>4</sub> proteomes with the changes in fibrotic deposits not only during fibrosis progression but also in resolution. Among proteins correlating with scar tissue formation in both Total and insoluble proteomes, we identified a small molecular chaperone clusterin. Clusterin is believed to be associated with elastin fibers in cholestasis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> and recently it was linked to the attenuation of mouse hepatic fibrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> Here, we localized clusterin exclusively to injured, pathologically stiffer hepatocytes. Interestingly, the clusterin promoter comprises binding motifs for mechanosensitive transcription factors such as Fos and AP-1/Jun.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> This suggests that local clusterin induction can reflect the dynamic changes of microenvironmental mechanical cues. Most intriguingly, we also found clusterin to associate with collagen-rich ECM deposits in the course of mouse fibrosis regression and with pathological human matrix of various etiologies. As clusterin overexpression associates with increased activity of ECM-degrading matrix metalloproteinases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> we hypothesize that clusterin accumulation facilitates the remodeling and resolution of scar tissue. Although the specific molecular function of clusterin in fibrotic tissue repair processes remains to be determined, our results strongly suggest clusterin to be an attractive antifibrotic target.</p>
<p>Liver cell and tissue mechanics play a pivotal role in the processes that initiate and resolve fibrotic injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Initial disruption of mechanical homeostasis prompts cytoskeletal remodeling that alters cell- generated forces and cellular biomechanics. Here, such a shift to a higher stiffness regime is illustrated by prominent changes in cytoskeleton-related signatures (actin and intermediate filaments) and signatures of mechanosensitive transcription regulators (e.g., MRTF) accompanied by a significant stiffening of parenchymal compartments devoid of apparent collagen deposits. This indicates substantial cell-driven changes in the biomechanical properties of tissue microenvironment. An unexpected decrease in the stiffness of interface hepatocytes with the initial fibrotic changes revealed by our AFM analysis suggests that the initial softening of interface hepatocytes upon injury counterbalances the stiffening of the injured hepatocytes and/or fibrous scar tissue regions. As the interface hepatocytes have been shown to undergo a phenotypic shift in response to the injury,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> it will now be interesting to determine whether altered mechanical properties serve as the cue leading to the genetic fetal reprogramming or if this initial softening is due to the expression of fetal markers. Together, our AFM and proteomic data underscore the role of local tissue stiffening in fibrotic response and postulate involvement of tissue softening during resolution not only in the collagen scar tissue but also in regenerating parenchyma.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Jirouskova and colleagues in their study have carried out an in-depth proteomic characterization of the dynamics of the liver fibrotic response and the resulting resolution in two distinct models of liver injury: CCl4-induced model of hepatotoxicity and pericentral/bridging liver fibrosis and the DDC feeding model of obstructive cholestasis and periportal fibrosis. They focussed on both the insoluble extracellular matrix (ECM) components as well as the soluble secreted factors produced by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and/or portal fibroblasts (PFs). They identified compartment- and time-resolved proteomic signatures in the two models with disease-specific factors or matrisomes. Their study also identified phenotypic differences between the models such as that while the CCl4-induced model induced profound hepatotoxicity followed by resolution, the DDC model induced more lasting liver damage and proteomic changes that resembled advanced human liver fibrosis favouring hepatocarcinogenesis.</p>
<p>Overall, this comprehensive and very well-conducted study is rigorous and well-planned. The conclusions are supported by compelling studies and analyses. One caveat is the lack of mechanistic experiments to prove causality, but this can be carried out in follow-up studies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) A major strength of the study is that the experiments are rigorous and very well conducted. For instance, the authors utilized two models of liver fibrosis to study different aspects of the pathology - hepatotoxicity vs cholestasis. In addition, 4 time points for each model were investigated - 2 for fibrosis development and 2 for fibrosis resolution. They have taken 3 components for proteomic analyses - total lysates, insoluble ECM components as well as the soluble secreted factors. Thus, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the fibrosis and resolution process in these models.</p>
<p>(2) Another great strength of the study is that the methodology utilized was able to dissect unique pathways relevant to each model as well as common targets. For example, the authors identified known pathways such as mTOR signalling to be differentially regulated in the CCl4 vs DDC model. mTOR signalling was increased in the DDC model which is associated with hyperproliferation. Thus showing that the approach taken is specific enough to distinguish between the two similar (both induce fibrosis) but distinct mechanisms (hepatotoxicity vs cholestasis) is a strong point of the study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors themselves propose in their Introduction that the &quot;ECM-associated changes are increasingly perceived as causative, rather than consequential&quot;; however, they have not conducted mechanistic (gain of function/loss of function) studies either in vitro or in vivo from any of their identified targets to truly prove causality. This remains one of the limitations of this study. Thus, future studies should investigate this point in detail. For instance, it would have been intriguing to dissect if knocking out specific genes involved in one specific model or genes common to both would yield distinct phenotypic outcomes.</p>
<p>(2) The majority of the conclusions are derived primarily from the proteomic analyses. Although well conducted, it would strengthen the study to corroborate some of the major findings by other means such as IHC/IF with the corresponding quantifications and not only representative images.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors suggest that ECM abundance and composition change depending on the aetiology of liver fibrosis. To understand this they have investigated the proteome in two models of animal fibrosis and resolution. They suggest their findings could provide a foundation for future anti-fibrotic therapies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The animal models used are widely studied models of liver fibrosis from both parenchymal and biliary damage aspects. Both would allow analysis of resolution. The CCl4 model in particular fully reverts to a 'healthy' liver following cessation of the insult. I am less clear whether/how quickly the ductal plugs clear in DDC models and thus this may not provide the response they are looking for in terms of reversibility. I believe there have been several extensive studies using a transcriptomics approach in assessing genes and cells involved in the CCl4 model of resolution. Even more mutliomic models of general fibrosis progression in many of the mouse models of fibrosis. However, the proteomic approach they have used is robust and they have made some attempts to integrate with cell-type specific signatures from previously published data.</p>
<p>Although there is minimal data, hepatocyte elasticity is a very interesting part of their study. Additional data and focussed attention on the mechanisms underpinning this would be very insightful.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As it currently stands, the data, whilst extensive, is primarily focussed on the proteomic data which is fairly descriptive and I am not clear on the additional insight gained in their approach that is not already detailed from the extensive transcriptomic studies. The manuscript overall would benefit from some mechanistic functional insight to provide new additional modes of action relevant to fibrosis progression. Whilst there is some human data presented it is a minimal analysis without quantification that would imply relevance to disease state.</p>
<p>Although studying disease progression in animals is a fundamental aspect of understanding the full physiological response of fibrotic disease, without more human insight makes any analysis difficult to fulfil their suggestion that these targets identified will be of use to treat human disease.</p>
<p>Some of the terminology is incorrect while discussing these models of injury used and care should be taken. For example - both models are toxin-induced and I do not think these data have any support that the DDC model has a higher carcinogenic risk. An investigation into the tumour-induced risk would require significant additional models. These types of statements are incorrect and not supported by this study.</p>
