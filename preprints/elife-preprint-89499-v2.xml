<title>Abstract</title><p>The circadian clock enables anticipation of the day/night cycle in animals ranging from cnidarians to mammals. Circadian rhythms are generated through a transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL or pacemaker) with CLOCK as a conserved positive factor in animals. However, the functional evolutionary origin and mechanism of action of CLOCK in basal animals are unknown. In the cnidarian <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>, pacemaker genes transcription including <italic>NvClk</italic> (the <italic>Clock</italic> ortholog) appears arrhythmic under constant light conditions, questioning the role of NvCLK. Utilizing CRISPR/Cas9, we generated a <italic>NvClk</italic> allele mutant (<italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>), revealing circadian behavior loss in constant light conditions (LL and DD) while a 24-hour rhythm was maintained under light-dark condition (LD). Transcriptomics showed distinct rhythmic genes in wild-type (WT) genes in LD compared to DD. The LD <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><italic><sup>-/-</sup></italic> showed comparable numbers of rhythmic genes, whereas they were greatly reduced in DD. Furthermore, the LD <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><italic><sup>-/-</sup></italic> showed alterations of temporal pacemaker genes expression, affecting their potential interactions. Additionally, differential expression of non-rhythmic genes associated with cell division and neuronal differentiation was observed. These findings suggest that while the light-responsive pathway can partially compensate for circadian clock disruption, the <italic>Clock</italic> gene has evolved in cnidarians to maintain 24-hour rhythmic physiology and behavior in constant conditions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Throughout the history of life on Earth, organisms have had to adapt to a constantly changing environment, including the ∼24-hour daily rhythm of light/dark, driving the development of endogenous biological clocks. The circadian clock, which is entrained by external stimuli such as light, enables the organism to anticipate the onset of the light and dark phases and synchronize its physiology and behavior in harmony with the environment. This, in turn, enhances the organism’s fitness and survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. From single-celled organisms to metazoans, circadian clocks have evolved multiple times, highlighting their importance to living organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Despite the fundamental role circadian clocks play in regulating the rhythmicity of living organisms, their evolutionary origin and intricate molecular mechanisms remain ambiguous in early diverging animal lineages, such as cnidaria.</p>
<p>Rhythmic phenomena, including calcification, reproduction, and diel behavior patterns, have been examined in cnidarian species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. While some of these patterns were found to be directly triggered by environmental stimuli, such as light, others persist in the absence of external cues, suggesting the presence of an internally generated and self-sustaining circadian clock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. At the molecular level, cnidarians possess homologs of putative core pacemaker genes found in bilaterians<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Several studies have shown that most of these genes display diel expression patterns under light/dark cycles. However, in contrast to most animals, their oscillation generally ceases without the presence of light cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Thus, how the core pacemaker genes orchestrate rhythmic gene expression and circadian behaviors in cnidarians remains unclear.</p>
<p>One of the most studied cnidarian species in the field of chronobiology is the estuarine sea anemone, <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>. Few studies have shown that in diel lighting, the locomotor behavior of <italic>Nematostella</italic> has a ∼24-h rhythm that is maintained under constant conditions suggesting it is regulated by an endogenous circadian clock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In accordance, the <italic>Nematostella</italic> genome codes for conserved core pacemaker genes such as <italic>NvClk</italic>, <italic>NvCycle</italic>, and the cryptochromes <italic>NvCry1a</italic> and <italic>NvCry1b</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. The proposed circadian clock model in <italic>Nematostella</italic> is composed of the positive transcription factors (bHLH-PAS family), NvCLK and NvCYCLE, that heterodimerize and upregulate light-dependent cryptochrome genes in the feedback loop, and NvPAR-bZIPs in the feed-forward loop, which repress the transcription of the positive elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. More recently, the NvCLK-interacting pacemaker, NvCIPC was predicted to act as an additional repressor of the NvCLK:NvCYCLE dimer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, in contrast to the free-running oscillation demonstrated for <italic>Nematostella</italic> behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, transcriptional expression profiles of most candidate genes implicated in the pacemaker do not retain their oscillation period in the absence of light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing system to establish a <italic>NvClk</italic> mutant (<italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup>) <italic>Nematostella</italic>. By combining behavioral monitoring and transcriptomic analysis, we aimed to elucidate the role of <italic>NvClk</italic> in regulating rhythmic locomotor activity and gene expression under varying light conditions. Our study revealed a robust light response pathway capable of compensation and a conserved function of CLOCK as a timekeeper in the absence of a light cue.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>Nematostella</italic></title>
<p>To investigate the function of <italic>NvClk</italic> in Nematostella, we employed the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate mutants. Based on existing knowledge from mouse and Drosophila models, we hypothesized that NvCLK:NvCYCLE dimer binds to the DNA motif CACGTG within the promoter of rhythmic target genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Guide RNA (gRNA) was synthesized to target a region between the two PAS domains of the <italic>NvClk</italic> coding sequence (CDS). This gRNA, along with the Cas9 endonuclease, was microinjected into zygotes (Methods). Subsequently, F0 animals were outcrossed with wild type (WT), and the F1 progeny were raised to adulthood. Genotyping of F1 polyps identified 10 different mutated alleles, with six displaying a frame-shift mutation, including one with a 20 bp insertion (<italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>), resulting in a premature stop codon (<xref rid="fige1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). The predicted 203 amino acid truncated protein lacked 459 amino acids, including one co-factor dimerization PAS domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref rid="fige1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). To obtain homozygous <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> polyps, we crossed heterozygous <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> F1 animals. Genotyping of F2 polyps confirmed the expected 25% frequency of <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> mutants. Subsequently, we intercrossed <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> animals to obtain F3 <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> polyps for use in subsequent experiments aimed at assessing the role of <italic>NvClk</italic> in regulating behavioral and genetic rhythms.</p>

<title><italic>NvClk</italic> is necessary to maintain circadian behavior in constant conditions</title>
<p>To assess the impact of the <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> mutation on circadian rhythm, we monitored locomotor behavior of WT and <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> polyps under different light conditions (Supp. Table 1). Both the WT and <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> populations exhibited a 24-hour periodicity in 12:12 hour Light-Dark (LD) cycles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,e</xref>), with 15 out of 21 WT animals displaying 24-hour rhythmicity compared to only 9 out of 20 <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Supp. Table 2). The average acrophase for WT polyps (13.3 hours) was significantly lower than for <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> polyps (17.3 hours) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>We then investigated locomotor behavior under continuous conditions, namely continuous dark (DD) or continuous light (LL). WT polyps exhibited a 22-hour rhythmic behavior under both constant light conditions, with 17 out of 25 WT polyps displaying a 24-hour rhythm under DD and 7 out of 25 under LL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g-l</xref>). In contrast, few <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> polyps displayed rhythmic behavior under constant conditions (1 out of 24 in DD and 1 out of 26 in LL) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, we observed an intermediate phenotype in the locomotor behavior of heterozygous polyps for the <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> allele in DD (<xref rid="fige1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1c-f</xref>).</p>
<p>To further explore the 24-hour rhythm of <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> polyps under LD, we tracked locomotor activity under a 6-hour light: 6-hour dark (LD 6:6) cycle after a regular diel 72-hour entrainment under 12:12 LD. While WT polyps maintained a marginally significant periodicity of 22 hours, <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> polyps displayed a 12-hour rhythm at the population level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1m-o</xref>). Specifically, we identified an important difference of 12- hour rhythmic individual polyps between WT and <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> groups (1 out of 25 WT polyps vs. 13 out of 26 <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> polyps) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Notably, entrainment with LD 6:6 did not lead to a 12-hour rhythm in DD for both WT and <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> polyps (Extended Data Fig. 1g-i).</p>

<title>Conserved behavioral CLOCK function through animal evolution</title>
<p>Our study provides valuable insights into the evolution of circadian clocks by characterizing the effects of the first <italic>Clock</italic> mutation in a cnidarian, the sea-anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>. Through our behavioral assays, we have shown that <italic>NvClk</italic> is essential for maintaining rhythmic locomotor activity in the absence of an entraining light cue. Although the rhythmicity of the <italic>NvClk<sup>1</sup></italic><sup>+/-</sup> heterozygote polyps was affected in DD, our results could not discriminate a dominant-negative from a full loss of function to identify the nature of this mutation (Extended Data Fig. 1g-i). Studies in various model organisms further support the importance of CLOCK in regulating circadian locomotion. For instance, homozygous <italic>DmClk</italic><sup>-/-</sup> flies exhibit a loss of circadian locomotion in constant darkness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, while the <italic>DnClk1a</italic> zebrafish mutant displayed a shortened period under the same conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Interestingly, <italic>MmClock<sup>-/</sup></italic><sup>-</sup> mice maintain robust circadian locomotion in constant darkness, suggesting potential functional redundancy among mammalian clock genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Overall, these findings support a conserved role of CLOCK in preserving circadian behavioral rhythms in absence of light cues across the distant <italic>Nematostella</italic>, flies, zebrafish, and mice.</p>
<p>Moreover, the conservation of a 24-hour locomotion rhythm in LD of the <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> polyps with a different mean acrophase, revealed a light-response pathway independent of the circadian circuit, consistent with observations in other animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> polyps exposed to a 12:12h LD cycle exhibited a 24-hour period, whereas those exposed to a 6:6h LD cycle displayed a 12-hour period. Notably, nearly no WT polyps exhibited a 12-hour rhythm under this condition, suggesting that the circadian clock overrides the light-response pathway (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). While some of the circadian factors can directly sense the light such as CRY proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, 29 putative <italic>NvOpsin</italic> have been identified in the genome which could be involved in the light-response pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Behavioral tracking of <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> polyps exposed to different wavelength could help to identify candidates for further functional studies of the light-response pathway.</p>

<title>Transcriptional rhythmicity plasticity downstream <italic>NvClk</italic></title>
<p>At the transcriptomic level, previous studies in <italic>Nematostella</italic> have shown large changes in the transcriptional profile of many genes after a single day of constant darkness, including the candidate pacemaker genes that were found arrhythmic, despite sustain circadian locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Consistent with previous transcriptomic analysis in cnidarian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, most of rhythmic genes identified in LD were different from those identified in DD in the WT polyps. Notably, they displayed higher mean acrophase and larger mean amplitude in DD suggesting a differential regulation in response to light conditions, which has not been investigated in previous cnidarian studies. Additionally, an overlap between our LD rhythmic genes and Leach et al. dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> suggests the robustness of pacemaker rhythmic transcription in LD conditions compared to downstream rhythmic genes (Extended data <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Overall, these observations suggest a potential plasticity of the pacemaker in selecting specific genes depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Similar to the rhythmic behavior of <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> polyps under LD conditions, the identification of 24-hour rhythmic genes suggests potential compensation by the light-response pathway. However, most of rhythmic genes in the <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> compared to WT polyps in LD conditions are different. This suggests the light-response pathway may not fully reproduce the normal circadian pattern observed in WT polyps and would require further investigation to understand their recruitment and function. Furthermore, the identification of a reduced number of rhythmic genes in DD <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> polyps revealed the importance of <italic>NvClk</italic> in maintaining molecular rhythm in absence of light. However, the persistence of these rhythmic genes raises questions regarding their origin. They could be the result of the mutation itself, a compensatory mechanism or false positives resulting from our analysis. The study by Ray <italic>et al.,</italic> which report controversial findings regarding RNA rhythmicity in the <italic>Bmal1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse cells (<italic>NvCycle</italic> orthologous in <italic>Nematostella</italic>) is an interesting case of rhythmicity analysis to consider<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Our attempt to identify rhythmic genes faced challenges, particularly in the choice of statistical parameters. Initially, using stringent criteria like BHQ for the JTK method or p.adj with RAIN resulted in a very limited number of genes for analysis (Supp. Table 3). Consequently, we opted for a balanced approach combining both algorithms with a p&lt;0.01 threshold. We made a compromise to identify rhythmic genes with greater confidence, but we are aware that the methodological choices are critical for the results.</p>
<p>The clustering analysis revealed that rhythmic genes can be categorized by expression pattern similarity. This approach defined “temporal gene clusters” as group of seven/eight genes in average in the WT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). Their discovery poses a fundamental question: How a group of genes are co-regulated in times and space (cell types) by the pacemaker? Their recruitment is disrupted in the DD <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> polyps suggesting an essential function of <italic>NvClk</italic> in absence of light. The combination of published scAtlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and multiplexed FISH techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> will be essential to further investigate the biological regulation and function of these temporal gene clusters.</p>

<title><italic>NvClk</italic> temporally organize pacemaker genes expression to drive rhythmic genes recruitment</title>
<p>Our study reveals that <italic>NvClk</italic> plays a key role in regulating the temporal transcription of pacemaker candidate genes (Fig.4a). Our analysis identified two clusters of pacemaker genes: One containing <italic>NvClk</italic>, and a second one containing a potential <italic>NvClk</italic> inhibitor (<italic>NvCipc</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. The alteration of clusters composition with a weaker anticorrelation in LD <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><sup>-/-</sup> polyps might generate a desynchronization of the pacemaker factors availability. Indeed, regulation of rhythmic transcription involved a complex protein-protein-DNA timing interaction. Furthermore, we did not identify any circadian E-boxes enrichment in rhythmic genes between conditions, except for the candidate pacemaker genes. Altogether, this supports the function of <italic>NvClk</italic> in orchestrating the timing interaction of pacemaker factors to select downstream rhythmic genes, indicating a more complex regulatory landscape at play.</p>
<p>However, one significant unanswered question in our study is the reason for the arrhythmic transcription of putative pacemaker genes in DD. We hypothesize that using whole animals for sampling material might mask oscillating gene expression signals, especially if signals are present in a small number of cells or if tissues exhibit rhythmic gene expression in different phases. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge a limitation in our interpretation, common in chronobiology: the use of RNA oscillation as a proxy for protein oscillation and function. The development of tools to study the pacemaker factors at the protein level in <italic>Nematostella</italic> will leverage this limitation in the field.</p>

<title><italic>NvClk</italic> regulates processes involved in cell proliferation and the neural system in absence of light</title>
<p>Our study of <italic>NvClk</italic> suggests coordination of cellular processes, especially in the absence of light. The results of our rhythmic transcriptomic analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) raised questions regarding indirect effects, and the non-rhythmic function of <italic>NvClk</italic>. We performed a differential gene expression analysis on the total transcriptome for each light condition. Under LD conditions, <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><italic><sup>-/-</sup></italic>polyps exhibited significant changes in gene expression but no GO term enrichment was found (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>, Supp. Table 5) revealing multiple altered processes we cannot yet identified. In contrast, under DD conditions, <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><italic><sup>-/-</sup></italic> polyps displayed more pronounced alterations, with more DEGs and enriched GO-terms for down-regulated genes related to mitosis, microtubule organization, and ciliary/flagellar motility, while the up-regulated genes showed enrichment in processes such as the modulation of other organism’s processes, axonal guidance, and sensory perception (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, Supp. Table 5). These results imply that <italic>NvClk</italic> has non-circadian functions that are dependent on light availability. This is particularly noteworthy considering the expression of core pacemaker genes, which are known to be arrhythmic during larvae stages, potentially involved in developmental processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, this study provides novel insights into circadian regulation in <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> and sheds light on the evolutionary origin of circadian time maintenance. Our findings indicate that CLOCK function is conserved from Cnidaria to mammals to maintain rhythmicity in absence of light cues. Furthermore, it revealed a light-response pathway able to compensate at both behavioral and molecular level using light cues. This circadian clock mutant opens new avenues for investigating cell-type-specific mechanisms of the circadian clock that drive the molecular and phenotypical oscillations of cnidarians. By further exploring the circadian clock mechanisms in cnidarians, we can gain deeper insights into the evolutionary origins of this critical aspect of biology, enhancing our understanding of how organisms have evolved to keep track of time and adapt to their environment.</p>

<p><italic>Nematostella</italic> were grown in 12g.L sea salt water at 17°C, and fed with Artemia <italic>salina nauplii</italic> three times a week. Spawning of gametes and fertilization was performed according to a published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. In brief, temperature was raised to 25 °C for 9 h and the animals were exposed to strong white light. Three hours after the induction, oocytes were mixed with sperm to allow fertilization.</p>

To ensure specificity of the gRNA, the selected target site sequence (GGTCCTCTCGTGGACTCTAC) was BLASTed against <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> genome (using JGI expected E value threshold of 0.1 to adjust for short sequences: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Nemve1/Nemve1.home.html">http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Nemve1/Nemve1.home.html</ext-link>).

<title>CRISPR/Cas9 mediated mutagenesis screening</title>
<p>To evaluate genome editing efficiency and mosaicism in F0 animals, genomic DNA flanking the guide sequence was amplified and Sanger sequenced. PCR was performed using two strategies. For the first, PCR reactions were performed using individual injected <italic>Nematostella</italic> (7-days post-fertilization), directly pipetted into a 25- μl PCR reaction containing a 2x concentration of PCR MasterMix (Tiangen) and 10 pmol of each PCR primer. For the second, genomic DNA was extracted from tissue sampling from live adult animals, after relaxation in 7% MgClphy<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich), using NucleoSpin Tissue DNA purification kit (MACHERY-NAGEL). Subsequent PCR reactions were performed as above using 50-ng of genomic DNA. The primers used for these reactions (listed below) were designed to amplify a ∼750bp region around the targeted <italic>NvClk</italic> genomic locus. Mosaicism was determined if sequenced PCR products showed overlapping peaks in their chromatograms. The second strategy, which takes advantage of the ability of <italic>Nematostella</italic> to fully regenerate within a few days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, is the one we refer to in the text hereafter. The injected individuals determined mosaic mutants were raised as F0 founders to sexual maturity and outcrossed with wild-type animals. The progeny of these crosses was raised and individually genotyped as described above. To determine inheritable mutations, sequences were further analyzed using the Tracking of Indels by DEcomposition web-tool (TIDE). TIDE quantifies editing efficiency and identifies the predominant types of DNA insertions and deletions (indel) mutation composition from a heterogeneous PCR product compared to a wild-type sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Different heterozygous mutants were raised to sexual maturity and outcrossed with wild-type animals. The resulting F2 progenies were then raised to sexual maturity and genotyped before spawning for F3. Heterozygous mutants from each F2 progeny were intercrossed to obtain 25% homozygous F3 mutants. All animals used in this study are derived from heterozygous F2 mutants intercrosses, harboring the mutant allele <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.

<title>Determination of <italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> F3 mutant genotypes</title>
<p>Genomic DNA was extracted as described above and used for following PCR and electrophoresis-based genotyping. PCR primers (listed below) encompassing the <italic>NvClk</italic> targeted site were used to produce PCR products of approximately 100 bp. The PCR products were then loaded and migrated by electrophoresis on a 3% Tris-borate- EDTA (TBE) agarose gel supplemented with GelStar Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Lonza) for approximately one hour. The genotype of each F3 animal was determined by visualizing differences in migration speed of the PCR products caused by the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. The homozygous mutant animal (<italic>NvClk</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup><italic><sup>−/−</sup></italic>) produces only the larger ∼120 bp amplicon while the wild-type animal (<italic>NvClk<sup>1+/+</sup></italic>) produces only the lower ∼100 bp amplicon. Animals heterozygous for the deletion (<italic>NvClk<sup>1+/−</sup></italic>) produce both the larger mutant and the smaller wild-type amplicons. PCR genotyping was confirmed by subsequent DNA sequencing of selected F3 animals.</p>

<title>Behavioral assays</title>
<p>Locomotor activity of individual <italic>Nematostella</italic> were monitored using a lab-made setup equipped with an IP Infra-Red camera (Dahua Technology, Hangzhou, China), a white neon illumination (Aquastar t8, Sylvania Lightning Solution,) and constantly illuminated with low-intensity infrared (850nm) LED light. The camera output 1h mp4 movie files which were AVI converted then stitched. The data collection and analysis were carried out by EthoVision XT8 video tracking software (Noldus information technology, Wageningen, Netherlands). Animals were isolated in wells of six-well plates, each of which was manually defined as a tracking ‘arena’ in the EthoVision software. Center- point detection with gray scaling (detection range of 25–77, contour erosion of 1-pixel, high pixel smoothing) was used to monitor movements, which were calculated according to the change in position of the average center pixel each second.</p>
<p>Illumination was provided with an intensity of 17 PPFD (+/−2) and did not significantly affect the experimental temperature (20 °C). The illumination cycles were 12: 12 h Light-Dark, 6: 6h Light-Dark or continuous light (LL). Parameters were optimized to ensure that organisms were detected throughout the entire observation period.</p>

The oscillation frequencies of the average population were evaluated based on the average values of each experiment using Fourier analysis-based software LSP with a p&lt;0.01. For individual analysis we used the online platform Discorythm, combining different algorithms including Cosinor, JTK and LSP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>.

<p>All polyps were isolated in wells of six-well plates. Then, they were subjected to the 12: 12h LD cycle with 17 PPFD (+/−2) light intensity during 72 hours for entrainment in an incubator with a stable temperature at 18°C. Subsequently, the polyps were divided into 2 experimental subgroups: 12: 12h LD and Continuous Dark or DD. Sampling began at 7 am (ZT0) and was performed at 4-hour intervals over 24 hours. At each time point, three or four individual polyps were sampled from each experimental group, immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and transferred to − 80°C for storage.</p>

<title>RNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from all sampled polyps (n = 96) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Purified RNA samples were analyzed using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to assess RNA quantity and 2200 TapeStation (Agilent) to assess RNA quality (RNA integrity number, &gt;8.5). From each of the 96 samples (4 biological replicates in LD and 3 in DD, with the highest-quality extracts × 4 experimental subgroups × 7 time points, 1.5 μg of RNA was sent for library preparation (INCPM mRNAseq protocol) and sequencing at the Weizmann Institute Sequencing Unit, Israel. The libraries were sequenced using the bulk MARS-seq protocol (Jaitin et al. Science, 2014, Keren-Shaul et al., Nature Protocols,2019) on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000, resulting in an average of 17 million single-end reads of 113 bases per sample.</p>

<title>Rhythmicity analysis</title>
<p>Rhythmicity in transcript expression was assessed using the RAIN (ref-23) and metac ycle (Wu et al., 2016) packages in R. The RAIN and JTK algorithms from metacycle w ere run separately for each Nematostella genotype in both light conditions (LD and D D), treating them as individual datasets. All replicates (n=3) for each time point within a dataset were analyzed as regular time series to identify transcripts exhibiting daily o scillations. Specifically, we focused on transcripts with a precise 24-hour period, exclu ding those with a range (e.g., 10 to 14 or 20 to 28 hours). To improve the accuracy of identifying true rhythmic genes, only transcripts with a P value &lt; 0.01 in both RAIN an d JTK analyses were deemed confidently cycling transcripts. Genes identified as sign ificant cycling genes were subsequently utilized as input for the DPGP_cluster progra m (McDowell et al., 2018), which clusters genes based on their expression trajectories. Gene clusters comprising 10 or more genes underwent testing for GO term enrichm ent. Heatmaps were generated using the heatmap package (v4.5.5) in R.

For HCR on <italic>Nematostella</italic> juvenile, several alterations were made to a previously described protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Briefly, polyps were plucked and fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. Polyps were washed 3× in 1× PBS and then dehydrated and permeabilized with 2×5 min washes in 100% methanol. The samples were stored at –20°C overnight. To rehydrate the samples, a series of graded MeOH/PBST washes were used for 5 min each: 75% MeOH:25% 1× PBST, 50% MeOH:50% 1× PBST, 25% MeOH:75% 1× PBST, and finally 2× washes in 100% 1× PBST. To further permeabilize the polyps, samples were incubated in 10 μg/ml Proteinase K diluted in 1× PBST for 10 min. Samples were quickly washed 3× in 1× PBST, and then post-fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min. After post-fixation, samples underwent 3×5 min washes with 1× 2xSSC+0.1% Triton. From now, the following solutions (Pre-hybridization, hybridization and probe wash buffers) were lab-made from the cnidarian-adapted hybridization buffer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Samples were then pre-hybridized with pre-hybridization buffer at 37°C for 30 min. After pre-hybridization, samples were incubated with 2 pmol of the probe set diluted in hybridization buffer for 16 hr at 37°C. To remove the probe mixture solution, samples were washed 2× for 30 min each with probe wash buffer at 37°C. Samples were washed 2× for 5 min with 5× SSC +0.1% Triton and then treated with probe amplification buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were washed into hairpin amplification buffer containing snap cooled amplifier hairpins and were incubated at room temperature, protected from light, overnight. Samples were then washed with successive 3× 5xSSC +0.1% Triton washes: 2× washes for 15min. Nuclear staining was performed using DAPI 1:1000 in PBST during 1h.

<p>In this revised manuscript Aguillon and collaborators convincingly demonstrating that CLK is required for free-running behavioral rhythms under constant conditions in the Cnidarian Nematostella. The results also convincingly show that CLK impacts rhythmic gene expression in this organism. This original work thus demonstrate that CLK was recruited very early during animal evolution in the circadian clock mechanism to optimize behavior and gene expression with the time-of-day. The manuscript could still benefit from some improvements so that it is more accessible for a wide readership.</p>

<p>The study provides potentially fundamental insight into the function and evolution of daily rhythms. The authors investigate the function of the putative core circadian clock gene Clock in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis. While it parts still incomplete, the evidence suggests that, in contrast to mice and fruit flies, Clock in this species is important for daily rhythms under constant conditions, but not under a rhythmic light/dark cycle, suggesting that the major role of the circadian oscillator in this species could be a stabilizing function under non-rhythmic environmental conditions.</p>

<p>In this nice study, the authors set out to investigate the role of the canonical circadian gene Clock in the rhythmic biology of the basal metazoan Nematostella vectensis, a sea anemone, which might illuminate the evolution of the Clock gene functionality. To achieve their aims the team generated a Clock knockout mutant line (Clock-/- ) by CRISPR/Cas9 gene deletion and subsequent crossing. They then compared wild-type (WT) with Clock-/- animals for locomotor activity and transcriptomic changes over time in constant darkness (DD) and under light/dark cycles to establish these phenotypes under circadian control and those driven by light cycles. In addition, they used Hybridization Chain Reaction-In situ Hybridization (HCR-ISH) to demonstrate the spatial expression of Clock and a putative circadian clocl-controlled gene Myh7 in whole-mounted juvenile anemones.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that under LD both WT and Clock-/- animals were behaviourally rhythmic but under DD the mutants lost this rhythmicity, indicating that Clock is necessary for endogenous rhythms in activity. With altered LD regimes (LD6:6) they show also that Clock is light-dependent. RNAseq comparisons of rhythmic gene expression in WT and Clock-/- animals suggest that clock KO has a profound effect on the rhythmic genome, with very little overlap in rhythmic transcripts between the two phenotypes; of the rhythmic genes in both LD and DD in WT animals (220- termed clock-controlled genes, CCGS) 85% were not rhythmic in Clock-/- animals in either light condition. In silico gene ontology (GO) analysis of CCGS reflected process associated with circadian control. Correspondingly, those genes rhythmic in KO animals under DD (here termed neoCCGs) were not rhythmic in WT, lacked upstream E-box motifs associated with circadian regulation, and did not display any GO enrichment terms. 'Core' circadian genes (as identified in previous literature) in WT and Clock-/- animals were only rhythmic under entrainment (LD) conditions whilst Clock-/- displayed altered expression profiles under LD compared to WT. Comparing CCGs with previous studies of cycling genes in Nematostellar, the authors selected a gene from 16 rhythmic transcripts. One of these, Myh7 was detectable by both RNAseq and HCR-ISH and considered a marker of the circadian clock by the authors.</p>
<p>The authors claim that the study reveals insights into the evolutionary origin of circadian timing; Clock is conserved across distant groups of organisms, having a function as a positive regulator of the transcriptional translational feedback loop at the heart of daily timing, but is not a central element of the core feedback loop circadian system in this basal species. Their behavioural and transcriptomic data largely support the claims that Clock is necessary for endogenous daily activity but that the putative molecular circadian system is not self-sustained under constant darkness (this was known already for WT animals)- rather it is responsive to light cycles with altered dynamics in Clock-/- specimens in some core genes under LD. In the main, I think the authors achieved their aims and the manuscript is a solid piece of important work. The Clock-/- animal is a useful resource for examining time-keeping in a basal metazoan.</p>
<p>The work described builds on other transcriptomic-based works on cnidaria, including Nematostellar, and does probe into the molecular underpinnings with a loss-of-function in a gene known to be core in other circadian systems. The field of chronobiology will benefit from the evolutionary aspect of this work and the fact that it highlights the necessity to study a range of non-model species to get a fuller picture of timing systems to better appreciate the development and diversity of clocks.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The generation of a line of Clock mutant Nematostellar is a very useful tool for the chronobiological community and coupled with a growing suite of tools in this species will be an asset. The experiments seem mostly well conceived and executed (NB see 'weaknesses'). The problem tackled is an interesting one and should be an important contribution to the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I think the claims about shedding light on the evolutionary origin of circadian time maintenance are a little bold. I agree that the data do point to an alternative role for Clock in this animal in light responsiveness, but this doesn't illuminate the evolution of time-keeping more broadly in my view. In addition, these are transcriptomic data and so should be caveated- they only demonstrate the expression of genes and not physiology beyond that. The time-course analysis is weakened by its low resolution, particularly for the RAIN algorithm when 4-hour intervals constrain the analysis. I accept that only 24h rhythms were selected in the analysis from this but, it might be that detail was lost - I think a preferred option would be 2 or 3-hour resolution or 2 full 24h cycles of analysis.</p>
<p>The authors discount the possibility of the observed 12h rhythmicity in Clock-/- animals by exposing them to LD6:6 cycles before free-running them in DD. I suggest that LD cycles are not a particularly robust way to entrain tidal animals as far as we know. Recent papers show inundation/mechanical agitation are more reliable cues (Kwiatkowski ER, et al. Curr Biol. 2023, 2;33(10):1867-1882.e5. doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2023.03.015; Zhang L., et al Curr Biol. 2013, 23;19, 1863-1873 doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.08.038.) and might be more effective in revealing endogenous 12h rhythms in the absence of 24h cues.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  We removed the suggestion that we used 6:6h LD to perform tidal entrainment. We generated this ultradian light condition to address the 24h rhythmicity observed in the NvClk1-/- in 12:12h LD.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript addresses an important question: what is the role of the gene Clock in the control of circadian rhythms in a very primitive group of animals: Cnidaria. Clock has been found to be essential for circadian rhythms in several animals, but its function outside of Bilaterian animals is unknown. The authors successfully generated a severe loss-of-function mutant in Nematostella. This is an important achievement that should help in understanding the early evolution of circadian clocks. Unfortunately, this study currently suffers from several important weaknesses. In particular, the authors do not present their work in a clear fashion, neither for a general audience nor for more expert readers, and there is a lack of attention to detail. There are also important methodological issues that weaken the study, and I have questions about the robustness of the data and their analysis. I am hoping that the authors will be able to address my concerns, as this work should prove important for the chronobiology field and beyond. I have highlighted below the most important issues, but the manuscript needs editing throughout to be accessible to a broad audience, and referencing could be improved.</p>
<p>Major issues:</p>
<p>(1) Why do the authors make the claim in the abstract that CLOCK function is conserved with other animals when their data suggest that it is not essential for circadian rhythms? dCLK is strictly required in Drosophila for circadian rhythms. In mammals, there are two paralogs, CLOCK and NPAS2, but without them, there are no circadian rhythms either. Note also that the recent claim of BMAL1-independent rhythms in mammals by Ray et al., quoted in the discussion to support the idea that rhythms can be observed in the absence of the positive elements of the circadian core clock, had to be corrected substantially, and its main conclusions have been disputed by both Abruzzi et al. and Ness-Cohn et al. This should be mentioned.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  According to our Behavioral and Transcriptomic data, CLOCK function is conserved in constant light condition. In LD context, the rhythmicity is maintained probably by the light-response pathway in Nematostella. We modified our rhythmic transcriptomic analysis and considered the context of the contested results by Ray et al., and discussed it in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The discussion of CIPC on line 222 is hard to follow as well. How does mRNA rhythm inform the function of CIPC, and why would it function as a &quot;dampening factor&quot;? Given that it is &quot;the only core clock member included in the Clock-dependent CCGs,&quot; (220) more discussion seems warranted. Discussing work done on this protein in mammals and flies might provide more insight.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  The initial sentence was unclear. Furthermore, since we restricted our rhythmic analysis to genes only found rhythmic with a p&lt;0.01 with RAIN combined with JTK, NvCipc was no longer defined as rhythmic in free running.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The behavioral arrhythmicity seen with their Clock mutation is really interesting. However, what is shown is only an averaged behavior trace and a single periodogram for the entire population. This leaves open the possibility that individual animals are poorly synchronized with each other, rather than arrhythmic. I also note that in DD there seem to be some residual rhythms, though they do not reach significance. Thus, it is also possible that at least some individual animals retain weak rhythms. The authors should analyze behavioral rhythms in individual animals to determine whether behavioral rhythmicity is really lost. This is important for the solidity of their main conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Fig. 1 has been modified. We have separated the data for WT and NvClk1-/- animals to provide clarity on the average behavior pattern for each genotype. While the LSP analysis on the population average informs us about the synchronization of the population, it is true that it does not provide insight into individual rhythmicity. To address this, we analyzed individuals in all conditions using the Discorhythm website (Carlucci et al., 2019).</p>
<p>In the revised figure, we have included a comparison plot of the acrophase of 24-hour rhythmic animals between genotypes using Cosinor analysis, which is most suitable for acrophase detection. This plot indicates the number of animals detected as significantly rhythmic, providing direct visual input to the reader regarding individual rhythmicity. Additionally, we have added Table 1, which contains the Cosinor period analysis (24 and 12 hours) of individuals for all genotypes and conditions, further enhancing the clarity of our findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) There is no mention in the results section of the behavior of heterozygotes. Based on supplement figure 2A, there is a clear reduction in amplitude in the heterozygous animals. Perhaps this might be because there is only half a dose of Clock, but perhaps this could be because of a dominant-negative activity of the truncated protein. There is no direct functional evidence to support the claim that the mutant allele is nonfunctional, so it is important to discuss carefully studies in other species that would support this claim, and the heterozygous behavior since it raises the possibility that the mutant allele acts as a dominant negative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  Extended Data Fig.1 modified. We show NvClk1+/- normalized locomotion over time in DD of the population, comparison of individual normalized behavior amplitude, LSP of the average population and individual acrophase of only rhythmic 24h individuals. Indeed, we cannot discriminate Dominant-negative from non-functional allele.</p>

<p>(5) I do not understand what the bar graphs in Figure 2E and 3B represent - what does the y-axis label refer to?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  Not relevant to the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6a) I note that RAIN was used, with a p&lt;0.05 cut-off. I believe RAIN is quite generous in calling genes rhythmic, and the p-value cut-off is also quite high. What happens if the stringency is increased, for example with a p&lt;0.01.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We acknowledge your concern regarding the stringency of our statistical analysis. To address this, we opted to combine both RAIN and JTK methods and applied a more stringent p-value cut-off of p&lt;0.01.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6b) It would be worth choosing a few genes called rhythmic in different conditions (mutant or wild-type. LD or DD), and using qPCR to validate the RNAseq results. For example, in Figure 3D, Myh7 RNAseq data are shown, and they do not look convincing. I am surprised this would be called a circadian rhythm. In wild-type, the curve seems arrhythmic to me, with three peaks, and a rather large difference between the first and second ZT0 time point. In the Clock mutants, rhythms seem to have a 12hr period, so they should not be called rhythmic according to the material and methods, which says that only ca 24hr period mRNA rhythms were considered rhythmic. Also, the result section does not say anything about Myh7 rhythms. What do they tell us? Why were they presented at all?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Regarding the suggestion for independent verification of our RNAseq results, we agree that such validation would enhance the robustness of our findings. To address this, we chose to overlap our identified rhythmic genes under WT LD conditions with those from another transcriptomic study that shared similarities in experimental design. Notably, the majority of overlapping rhythmic genes between the studies are candidate pacemaker genes. We believe that this replication of biologically significant rhythmic genes strengthens the validity and reliability of our results (see Extended Data Fig. 2).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have decided to remove the NvMhc-st (mistakenly named Myh7, only rhythmic in WT DD in the new analysis) as it does not contribute substantively to the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The authors should explain better why only the genes that are both rhythmic in LD and DD are considered to be clock-controlled genes (CCGs). In theory, any gene rhythmic in DD could be a CCG. However, Leach and Reitzel actually found that most genes in DD1 do not cycle the next day (DD2)? This suggests that most &quot;rhythmic&quot; genes might show a transient change in expression due to prolonged obscurity and/or the stress induced by the absence of a light-dark cycle, rather than being clock controlled. Is this why the authors saw genes rhythmic under both LD and DD as actual CCGs? I would suggest verifying that in DD the phase of the oscillation for each CCG is similar to that in LD. If a gene is just responding to obscurity, it might show an elevated expression at the end of the dark period of LD, and then a high level in the first hours of DD. Such an expression pattern would be very unlikely to be controlled by the circadian clock.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: As we modified our transcriptomic analysis, we do no longer analyze LD+DD rhythmic genes, but any genes rhythmic (RAIN and JTK p&lt;0.01) in each condition. As such we end up with four list of genes corresponding to each experimental conditions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Since there are still rhythms in LD in Clock mutants, I wonder whether there is a paralog that could be taking Clock's place, similar to NPAS2 in mammals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  see response to (1) &gt; The only NPAS2 orthologous identified in Nematostella NPAS3 showed marginally significance (p=0.013) with RAIN in LD WT suggesting a regulation similar to the candidate pacemaker genes. As such we included within our candidate pacemaker genes list.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) I do not follow the point the authors try to make in lines 268-272. The absence of anticipatory behavior in Drosophila Clk mutants results from disruption of the circadian molecular clock, due to the loss of Clk's circadian function. Which light-dependent function of Clock are the authors referring to, then? Also, following this, it should be kept in mind that clock mutant mice have a weakened oscillator. The effect on entrainment is secondary to the weakening of the oscillator, rather than a direct effect on the light input pathway (weaker oscillators have increased response to environmental inputs). The authors thus need to more clearly explain why they think there is a conservation of circadian and photic clock function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Following the changes in our statistical analysis we reframed the discussion and address directly the circadian and the photic clock function (we call it light-response pathway in the manuscript)</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p>We suggest the following improvements:</p>
<p>(1) Please undertake a serious effort to make this work more accessible to non-marine chronobiologists. This includes better explanations, and schemes of the animal when images of staining are shown (e.g. Fig.1b) which include the labeling of relevant morphological structures mentioned in the text (like &quot;tentacle endodermis and mesenteries&quot; (line 132)). Similar issues for mentioned life cycle stages like &quot;late planula stage&quot; (line 133), &quot;bisected physa&quot; (line 149).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Fig. 1b, we outlined the animal shaped and added 2 arrows to locate the tentacle endodermis and mesenteries. We replaced the term late planula stage, by larvae. And we rephrased bisected physa by tissue sampling.</p>

<p>The provided Supplementary tables are not well annotated. Several of them need guess-work about what is shown. For instance, for Supplementary Table 1, the Ns are unclear, which in total can go up to almost 200 per condition-genotype, but only about 30 animals for each were tested. Thus, where do the high totals in the LSP table come from? What do the numbers of each periodicity mean? Initially one might assume it was the number of animals that showed a periodogram peak at a given periodicity, but it seems that cannot be. Maybe it counted any period bin over statistical significance? Please clarify with better descriptions and labels.</p>

<p>Albeit not essential, it would be more reader-friendly to also add a summary table with average period and SD, power and SD, and percentage rhythmicity to the main figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Table 1 is added: it contains individual count of rhythmic animals (24h and 12h) with Cosinor. However, using Discorhythm we had to ask for a specific Period. Thus, we can only provide animal count significant for a given period value. And not an estimation of their own period.</p>

<p>(2) Some of the terminology is quite confusing, in particular the double meaning of the word &quot;clock&quot; (i.e the pacemaker and the transcription factor). This is not a specific problem to this manuscript, but it would be helpful for the readability to try to improve this.</p>
<p>Could the gene/transcript/protein be spelled: clk and Clk?</p>
<p>Alternatively, for clarity- how about talking about &quot;core pacemaker genes,&quot; &quot;CLOCK-dependent rhythmic genes&quot; and &quot;CLOCK-independent rhythmic genes&quot;?</p>

<p>(3) The dismissal of the 12h rhythmicity in Clock-/- animals is not really convincing and should be reconsidered. LD6:6 cycles (before free-running animals in DD) is likely a not particularly robust way to entrain tidal animals. Recent papers show inundation/mechanical agitation are more reliable cues (Kwiatkowski ER, et al. Curr Biol. 2023, 2;33(10):1867-1882.e5. doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2023.03.015; Zhang L., et al Curr Biol. 2013, 23;19, 1863-1873 doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.08.038.) and might be more effective in revealing endogenous 12h rhythms in the absence of 24h cues.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We removed the proposition of using 6:6hLD as Tidal entrainment. Instead, the LD 6:6 experiment reveals the direct light-dependency of the NvClk1-/- mutant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) There are significant questions raised on the validity of BMAL1-independent rhythms in mammals as suggested by the Ray et al study. See DOI: 10.1126/science.abe9230 and DOI: 10.1126/science.abf0922</p>
<p>These technical comments should also be taken into account and the discussion adjusted accordingly to better reflect the ongoing discussions in the chronobiology field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We modified our rhythmic analysis. As we cannot use BHQ or adjusted p-value which resulted in very genes, we defined 24h-rhythmic genes if p&lt;0.01 with two different algorithms (RAIN and JTK). We propose this compromise to reduce the risk of false-positive.
Furthermore, we discussed our methodology in the light of the significant questions raised by these papers you cited. We thank the reviewer for this important point.</p>

<p>(5) The HCR stainings for clk are not very convincing. Normally, HCR should have more dots. In principle, the logic of HCR is such that it detects individual mRNA molecules in the cell. Thus, having only one strong dot/cell like in Fig.1b doesn't make much sense.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We were the first surprised by this single dot signal. We are experienced users of HCRv.3 across different species. We decided to remove the close-up (for further investigations) but to keep the full animal signal. According to our approach it is a convincing signal. However, the doty nature of the signal itself it is not easy to make it highly visible at full scale animal on the picture. We did our best to show the mRNA signal visible without altering the pattern.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, the controls for the HCR in situ hybridization are unclear. In the methods, there are two Clock probes described (B3 &amp; B5) and two control probes (B1 &amp; B3), however, in the negative control image, a combination of one Clock (B1) and one control (B3) probes is used and is unclear what &quot;redundant detection&quot; means in the legend of figure S2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Considering the nature of the signal (single of few dots), we decided to use two probes with 2 different fluorophores. A noise is by nature random. Our hypothesis was: only overlapping fluorescent dots are true signal of NvClk mRNA.</p>
<p>For Control probes we used two zebrafish probes labelling hypothalamic peptides.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Based on the experience with non-Drosophila, non-mouse animal model systems the reviewers assume that non-sense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is not strongly initiated upon Crispr-induced premature STOP-codons. If this assumption is correct it would be worth to mention it. Alternatively, it would be worth testing if Nematostella induces NMD, as this would be a great control for the HCR and the mutation itself.
At which ZT was the HCR done?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We performed the HCR at ZT10 when NvClk is described to be at peak. It is now indicated in the Fig. 1b. The RNAseq detected a higher quantity of NvClk1 mRNA in the NvClk1-/- (see Fig. 4a). mRNA quantity regulation involves transcription, stabilization, and degradation. At this stage, we cannot identify which specific step is affected.</p>

<p>(6) Please provide the individual trace data for the behavioral analyses either as supplementary files or as a link to an openly accessible database like DRYAD (see also comment 7 in the public review of reviewer 2). Maybe this is what is shown in Supplementary Table 1, but it is really not clear what is actually shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Fig.1 is updated. Table 1 is added. Supplementary Table 1 contains individual normalized locomotor data of each polyps for each genotypes and light conditions. Supplementary Table 2 contains the cosinor individual rhythmic behavior analysis based on the Supplementary Table 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) It is not really clear if the mutation is a true loss-of-function or could also be dominant negative. While this is raised in the discussion, it should be more carefully considered. The reason why a dominant negative would be unlikely is unclear. More specifically also see comment 8) in the public review of reviewer 2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Indeed, the results cannot tell us if it is a true loss of function, a dominant negative or non-functional allele. We addressed it in the first part of the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The pretty small overlap of rhythmic transcripts in LD and DD could reflect the true biology of a more core clock driven-process under constant conditions and a more light-driven process under LD. But still- wouldn't one expect that similar processes should be rhythmic? If not, why not?</p>
<p>It would certainly add strength to the data if for one or two transcripts these results were independently verified by qPCR from an independent sampling. This could even be done for just two time points with the most extreme differences.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We appreciate the reviewer's comments and concerns regarding the overlap of rhythmic transcripts in different conditions. In response to the reviewer's query, we revised our interpretation of the transcriptomic data, acknowledging the limited overlap between light and genotype conditions in our study. This prompted us to reconsider the underlying biological processes driving rhythmic gene expression under constant conditions versus light-dark cycles.</p>
<p>Regarding the suggestion for independent verification of our RNAseq results, we agree that such validation would enhance the robustness of our findings. To address this, we chose to overlap our identified rhythmic genes under WT LD conditions with those from another transcriptomic study that shared similarities in experimental design. Notably, the majority of overlapping rhythmic genes between the studies are candidate pacemaker genes. We believe that this replication of biologically significant rhythmic genes strengthens the validity and reliability of our results (see Extended Data Fig. 2).</p>

<p>(9) Expression of myh7 : Checking for co-expression should be pretty straightforward by HCR. This is what this type of staining technique is really good for. Please do clk and myh7 co-staining if you want to claim co-expression. Otherwise don't make such a claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We agree that checking for co-expression should be straightforward by HCR. However, due to time constraints during the revision period, we are unable to conduct the double in-situ experiment. Additionally, upon careful consideration, we recognize that including myhc-st (mistakenly named myh7) staining and co-expression analysis would not significantly contribute to the main conclusions of our study.

<p>Also, it would be easier for the reader, if the measurements of light intensity are provided in photons, because this is what the light receptors ultimately measure.</p>

<list-item><p>Fig.2E- please add the consensus sequence used for circadian E-box vs. E-box to the figure.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: In the revised manuscript Fig.4c, we show which E-box motifs we extracted for our promoter analysis. We as well changed our analysis and did no longer use HOMER, but we directly extracted promoter sequences and looked for canonical Ebox CANNTG and Circadian Ebox CACGTG and generate a Circadian Ebox enrichment output per gene promoter.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) There has been some discussion about the evolutionary statement as stated by the authors. It appears that depending on the background of the reader, this can be misunderstood. We thus suggest to more clearly point out where the author thinks there is evolutionary conservation (a function for clk in the circadian oscillator under constant light or dark conditions) versus where there is no apparent evolutionary conservation (the situation under light-dark conditions).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: In the revised manuscript we proposed a conserved function of NvCLK in constant darkness, and a light-response pathway compensating in LD conditions in the mutant.</p>

<p>Please also consider the major comments 8 and 9 of the common review from reviewer 2.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The hybridization chain-reaction ISH is OK but, I'm not sure I understand the control condition-this should be clarified. I would also welcome the use of Clock-/- animals in HCR as another, more direct level of control. In addition, the authors state that the Myh7 probes hybridise in anatomical regions resembling those for Clock (Fig 3e). It would be better to duplex these two probe sets with different fluors for a better representation of the relative spatial distributions of each transcript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We agree that checking for co-expression should be straightforward by HCR. However, due to time constraints during the revision period, we are unable to conduct the double in-situ experiment. Additionally, upon careful consideration, we recognize that including myhc-st (mistakenly named myh7) staining and co-expression analysis would not significantly contribute to the main conclusions of our study. Therefore, we have decided to remove this analysis from the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>We clarified in the methods the control probes design.</p>

<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>Figure legends do not all convey sufficient detail. For instance, Figure 1c needs a better explanation. Figure 3e- are these images both WT? Fig 3f doesn't exist and other figure text references do not align with figures and need an overhaul.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  All errors have been fixed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major issues:</p>
<p>(1) The authors need to introduce their model system better for a broad audience. What are the tissues/cells that express Clock at a higher level? What is their function, does this provide a potential explanation for their specific Clock expression, and how CLOCK might regulate behavior? Terms such as &quot;tentacle endodermis and mesenteries&quot; (line 132), &quot;late planula stage&quot; (line 133), &quot;bisected physa&quot; (line 149) would need some explanation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We modified term such as planula to larvae, and bisected physa to tissue samples.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Some of the terminology used is quite confusing, because of the double-meaning of the word &quot;clock&quot; (i.e the pacemaker and the transcription factor). The authors use terms such as &quot;clock-controlled genes&quot;, &quot;core clock genes&quot;, &quot;CLOCK-dependent clock-controlled genes&quot;, &quot;neo-clock-controlled genes&quot;. Is there any way to help the reader? Here are several suggestions: &quot;core pacemaker genes,&quot; &quot;CLOCK-dependent rhythmic genes&quot; and &quot;CLOCK-independent rhythmic genes&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: all the terminology has been clarified, see previous comments</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Also in the abstract, there is mention of &quot;hierarchal light- and Clock-signaling&quot; (52-3) - is this related to the statement on line 219 that light is epistatic to Clock? I do not quite understand what epistatic would mean here. Who is upstream of whom? LD modifies rhythmicity in Clock mutant animals, but Clock mutations also impact rhythmicity in LD. Also, as epistasis is defined as the effect of gene interactions on phenotypes - what is the secondary gene impacting the phenotype of the Clock mutants? I am not sure the term epistatic is appropriate in the present context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Indeed, Epistatic is a genetic term which might be unclear in this context. We removed it.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The control for the in situ hybridization is unclear. In the methods, there are two Clock probes described (B3 &amp; B5) and two control probes (B1 &amp; B3), however, in the negative control image, a combination of one Clock (B1) and one control (B3) probe is used, I am not sure what &quot;redundant detection&quot; means in the legend of figure S2. Also, the sequences of each Clock probe should be provided. It might be worth testing the Clock mutant the authors generated. Clock mRNA could be reduced due to non-sense, mediated RNA decay, since the mutation causes a premature stop codon. This would be a great additional control for the in situ hybridization. Even better would be if, by chance, the probes target the mutated sequence. The signal should then be completely lost.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: HCR is a tilling probe. Which means the target transcript is covered by dozens of successive DNA sequence “primer-like” which allow the HCRv.3 technology. We cannot design a mutant probe specific with this technology.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) I have concerns with rhythmic-expression calls, particularly as there is so little overlap between LD and DD, and that a completely different set of rhythmic genes is observed in Clock mutant and wild-type animals. I am not an expert in whole-genome expression studies, so I hope one of my colleague reviewers can weigh in.</p>
<p>When describing rhythmicity analysis in the Methods, it states that Benjamini-Hochberg corrections were applied to account for multiple comparisons. However, the false discovery rate for each analysis should be included (see Hughes et al.,: &quot;Guidelines for Genome-Scale Analysis of Biological Rhythms,&quot; 2017).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: As explained before we cannot used Benjamini-Hochberg corrections as only few genes (mostly oscillator gene pass the threshold). As such we combined two different algorithms (RAIN and JTK) with a p&lt;0.01 to detect confidently rhythmic genes while reducing the risk of false-positives.</p>

<p><bold>Minor issues:</bold></p>
<p>(1) Environmental inputs are not &quot;circadian&quot;, as written in the title.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Title modified</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In the abstract, the description of the Clock mutant behavioral phenotypes is hard to follow, with no mention of whether or not Clock mutant animals are behaviorally rhythmic or arrhythmic in constant conditions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: corrected</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Abstract: A 6/6 h LD cycle is not a compressed tidal cycle as written in the abstract. Light is not an input to tidal rhythms.</p>

<p>Response: corrected</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Line 101: timeout is not a core clock gene in animals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: we removed it from the candidate pacemaker genes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) What is the evidence for the role of PAR-Zip proteins in the Nematostella clock? The reference provided does not mention those.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: There is no functional data in Nematostella yet to support their role within the pacemaker. However based on their rhythmicity in LD and protein conservation, we included them within the candidate pacemaker genes list. The refences have been corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Line 125. should refer to Fig 1C when describing the Clock protein.</p>

<p>Response: corrected</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Line 143-4. based on the figure, the region targeted by gRNA was not &quot;close to the 5' end&quot; as stated, it is closer to the middle of the gene sequence as shown in Figure 1C. A more accurate description would be a region in between the PAS domains.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Indeed we modified the figure and the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Line 150. The mutant allele is described as Clock1 initially, then for the rest of the paper as Clock-. SInce it is not clear that the allele is a null (see major comment #8), Clock1 should be used throughout the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: the allele is named NvClk1 in the revised manuscript</p>

<p>(10) Figure legend for 2E and 3B. &quot;The 1000bp upstream ATG&quot; is unclear. I guess it means that 1000bp upstream of the putative initiation codon was used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Right, and in the revised version we analyzed 5kb upstream the putative ATG.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) Line 164. The authors write &quot;We discovered...&quot; , but wasn't it already known that these animals are behaviorally rhythmic?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Fixed</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) It would be worth mentioning in the results section the reduced amplitude of rhythms in LL compared to DD (in WT and seemingly also in Clock mutants).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Indeed, we observed a significant reduction in the mean amplitude in the NvClk1-/- in DD and LL compared WT and NvClk1-/- in LD, DD and LL. However, as rhythmicity is lost by virtually all mutants in LL and DD we do not think these results add to the current interpretation of the gene function.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) Please correct the figure numbers in the main text, there are several mistakes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Done</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(14) Line 196, most genes in the quoted study did not cycle on day 2, so whether they are truly clock controlled is questionable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  We agree, identifying free-running cycling genes in cnidarian remains a challenge to overcome. One of the limitations of this study was to detect rhythmic genes in LD which conserved rhythmicity in DD. However, considering different transcriptomic studies (cited in the discussion) it seems that in the cnidaria phyla rhythmic genes in LD are not necessarily the one we identified rhythmic in DD.</p>

<p>(17) &quot;Clock regulates genetic pathways&quot; sounds quite odd. Do you mean it regulates preferentially specific genetic (or maybe better, molecular) pathways?</p>

<p>(18) Figure 4 and legend: Dashed lines indicating threshold are missing. Do the black and red dots represent WT and Clock-/-, as indicated in the legend, or up/down, as indicated in the figures?</p>
