<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Layer (L)1, beside receiving massive cortico-cortical, commissural and associational projections, is the termination zone of tufted dendrites of pyramidal neurons and the area of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike initiation. However, its synaptic organization in humans is not known. Quantitative 3D-models of synaptic boutons (SBs) in L1 of the human temporal lobe neocortex were generated from non-epileptic neocortical biopsy tissue using transmission electron microscopy, 3D-volume reconstructions and TEM tomography. Particularly, the size of active zones (AZs) and the readily releasable, recycling and resting pool of synaptic vesicles (SVs) were quantified.</p>
<p>The majority of SBs contained numerous mitochondria comprising ∼7% of the total volume of SBs, had a large macular, non-perforated AZs (∼0.20 µm<sup>2</sup>) and were predominantly located on dendritic spines. SBs had a total pool of ∼3500 SVs, a comparably large readily releasable (∼4 SVs), recycling (∼470 SVs) and resting (∼2900 SVs) pool. Astrocytic coverage of SBs suggests both synaptic cross talk or removal of spilled glutamate by astrocytic processes at synaptic complexes.</p>
<p>The structural composition of SBs in L1 may underlie the function of L1 networks that mediate, integrate and synchronize contextual and cross-modal information, enabling flexible and state-dependent processing of feedforward sensory inputs from other layers of the cortical column.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The mammalian neocortex is the most complex part of the brain comprising over 75% of the gray matter. One fundamental feature established during development is the formation of distinct layers with different networks of neurons, and its organization into vertically oriented slabs, so-called cortical columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Marin-Padilla 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">1998</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Rockland and DeFelipe 2018</xref>). This organization is established in an ‘inside layers first-outside layers last’ fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Luskin and Shatz 1985a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">b</xref>; reviewed by Cooper et al. 2008). The exception, beside layer (L)6 is L1 generated first originating from the marginal zone (Marin Padilla 1998; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bystron et al. 2008</xref>). Ongoing cortico- and synaptogenesis finally lead to the formation of the adult cortical network with its unique structural and functional properties (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lübke and Feldmeyer 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Rockland and DeFelipe 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Remarkably, L1 is highly conserved across cortical areas and higher mammalian species, but its importance was long underestimated. However, L1 is now considered as the predominant input layer for top-down information, relayed by a rich, dense network of cortico-cortical, cortico-thalamic, commissural and associational long-range axonal projections. In humans, and thus different to experimental animals, both L1 excitatory Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anstötz et al. 2014</xref>) and a quite heterogeneous population of inhibitory neurons (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jiang et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boldog et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Obermayer et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kwon et al. 2019</xref>; reviewed by Huang et al. 2024) providing signals to the terminal tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons of the underlying cortical layers. Thus, L1 is a central locus of neocortical associations controlled by distinct types of inhibition and feedforward excitation (Schumann et al. 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hartung and Letzkus 2021</xref>, reviewed by Schumann et al. 2021).</p>
<p>The temporal lobe neocortex (TLN) is situated on the basolateral aspect of the cerebral hemispheres primarily observed in higher primates, including humans. Notably, in human, the TLN encompasses approximately 20% of the entire cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kiernan 2012</xref>). It is recognized as a highly specialized associative neocortex, characterized by its homotypic granular six-layered organization (von <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Economo and Koskinas 1925</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Palomero-Gallagher and Zilles 2019</xref>). The human TLN plays a crucial role in various cognitive functions, including auditory, visual, vestibular, linguistic, and olfactory processing. Additionally, it is intricately connected to diverse sensory and multimodal associational brain regions, such as the limbic system, amygdala, and various subcortical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Insausti 2013</xref>). Lastly, the human TLN serves as the epicenter and onset site for temporal lobe epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allone et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Tai et al. 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the most important discoveries in neuroscience, beside the definition of the neuron by Cajal’s neuronal doctrine (1911), was the introduction of the term ‘Synapse’, more than 100 years ago. Since then these structures have been investigated from different viewpoints including structural, functional, molecular and computational studies summarized in meanwhile thousands of original publications, reviews and numerous textbooks. Yet, the quantitative geometry of the most prevalent synapse in the brain, the cortical synapse, has remained largely unexplored structurally, in both experimental animals (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Rollenhagen et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bopp et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hsu et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Prume et al. 2020</xref>) and, even more so, in the context of the human brain (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dominguez-Alvaro et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cano-Astorga et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>; Shapson-Coe et al. 2024). This could be partially attributed to the availability of human brain tissue samples. Nevertheless, detailed and quantitative descriptions of synaptic complexes in L1 of the human brain are to date non-existing.</p>
<p>Here, an investigation into the synaptic organization of L1 in the human TLN was undertaken using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 3D-volume reconstruction to generate quantitative 3D-models of synaptic boutons (SBs) and by TEM tomography. The ultimate objective of this comprehensive project is to elucidate the synaptic organization, layer by layer, of the cortical column in humans.</p>
<p>Such meticulous quantitative structural analyses of SBs and their corresponding target structures are indispensable for comprehending, elucidating, and establishing connections between the structural and functional properties of the diverse signal cascades underlying synaptic transmission, efficacy, strength, and plasticity. Consequently, these efforts contribute significantly to understanding the computational properties of brain networks, with the organization of the cortical column emerging as a pivotal component thereof.</p>

<p>L1 in the adult mammalian neocortex represent a relatively cell sparse layer that in humans can be subdivided into two sublaminae, L1a and L1b as revealed in semithin sections (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and Golgi-preparations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, C, F, G</xref>) and at the EM level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H, I</xref>).

<p>Hence, L1a can be described as a sublamina with a predominant proportion of astrocytic and microglial processes, although it also harbors numerous other structural elements such as terminal tuft dendrites and synaptic complexes. These complexes consist of a SB juxtaposed with either a dendritic shaft or spine (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) directly beneath or interwoven among the fine astrocytic processes within L1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Lipofuscin granules, indicative of aging, were frequently noted in astrocytes, reactive microglia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) and L1 neurons, although their abundance, size, and morphology varied considerably.</p>
<p>Remarkably, and in contrast to rodents a persistent subpopulation of excitatory CR-cells were found in humans identifiable by the horizontal bipolar orientation of both dendrites and axons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-H</xref>). The majority were located directly underneath the pial surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, G) or intermingled with a heterogeneous population of GABAergic interneurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>In the human TLN, GABAergic interneurons constitute the predominant class of neurons in L1, exhibiting significant structural and functional heterogeneity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, E; see also Jiang et al, 2014, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Verhoog et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boldog et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Obermayer et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kwon et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Schuman et al. 2019</xref>, reviewed by Huang et al. 2024) which were found throughout both sublaminae and were sometimes organized in clusters of 3-6 neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Beside CR-cells and GABAergic interneurons, also degenerating neurons, identifiable by their shrunken and dark appearance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, I) were found in both sublaminae although their numbers varied substantially between brain tissue samples.</p>
<p>L1b is primarily dominated by dendritic and synaptic profiles. due to a massive increase in synaptic complexes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1H</xref>, 2B). Furthermore, L1b is infiltrated by apical dendrites of L2, L3 and L5 pyramidal neurons which are interspersed with smaller dendritic segments representing apical oblique dendrites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1I</xref>, 2B). The majority of synaptic complexes in L1 were axo-spinous (∼80%, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> B, D, E), the remainder were axo-dendritic some of which but not all were regarded as putative GABAergic terminals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Silver et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>L1b can be separated from L2 by the sudden increase of neuronal cell bodies and thick apical dendrites originating at the upper pole of the somata of pyramidal neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref>, 2B). At the L1b and L2 transition more and more apical and apical oblique dendrites of different caliber were observable.</p>

<title>Synaptic organization of L1 in the human TLN</title>
<p>The primary objective of this study was to investigate the synaptic organization of excitatory SBs in L1 in the human TLN, focusing on synaptic parameters that represent possible morphological correlates of synaptic transmission, efficacy, strength and plasticity. The quantitative analysis was separated for both sublaminae to look for possible sublaminar-specific differences. Beside the overall geometry of SBs and the number and size of mitochondria, in particular the size of the PreAZ and PSD constituting the AZ, the morphological equivalent to a functional neurotransmitter release site and the organization of the three functionally defined pools of SVs, namely the readily releasable (RRP), the recycling (RP) and resting pool, were quantified.</p>
<p>To achieve this, a total of 361 SBs was completely reconstructed out of four patients in six series containing 100-150 ultrathin sections/series. A total of 190 SBs and 184 AZs (L1a) and 171 SBs and 165 AZs (L1b) using non-affected neocortical access tissue (see Material and Methods; Source Data 02) were completely 3D-reconstructed and quantified using fine-scale TEM, digital TEM images and subsequent 3D-volume reconstructions.</p>
<p>Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic complexes in L1a und L1b were formed by either presynaptic <italic>en passant</italic> or endterminal boutons with their prospective postsynaptic target structures dendritic shafts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> C, D, 3A-C) or spines of different caliber and type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref>, D, E, 3A-C). In both sublaminae, SBs were predominantly found on dendritic spines (∼81%; L1a) and ∼79% (L1b), the remainder were located on dendritic shafts. The majority of SBs on spines were located on mushroom spines (L1a: ∼83%, L1b: ∼73%), a smaller fraction on stubby spines (L1a: ∼11%, L1b: ∼9%) or on thin elongated spines;(L1a: 6%, L1b: ∼22%; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), the remainder were not classifiable.</p>
<p>Since our focus was on excitatory SBs, inhibitory terminals were not further analyzed in detail. Inhibitory SBs were distinguished from excitatory SBs by their smaller SVs which also has a more spherical appearance and the smaller sized PreAZ and the lack of a prominent PSD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Infrequently, GABAergic and glutamatergic terminals were found on the same dendrite (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, D) or spine (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Wittner et al. 2001</xref>) but rare by ∼2-3%. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kwon et al. 2019</xref>). In turn, also not all SBs located on dendritic shafts were GABAergic (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Silver et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The ratio between excitatory vs. inhibitory SBs was between 10-15% although with layer-specific differences. Our findings are in good agreement with recent publications by Shapson-Coe et al. (2024) and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cano-Astorga et al. (2023</xref>, 2024) which also estimated the number of inhibitory SBs in different layers of the temporal lobe neocortex by10-15%. However, no significant differences were found in the content of inhibitory SBs between the two sublaminae L1a and L1b.</p>
<p>Some SBs in both sublaminae were seen to establish either two or three SBs on the same spine, spines of other origin or dendritic shafts. Remarkably, ∼90% of spines in L1a and L1b contained a spine apparatus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), a specialized form of the endoplasmic reticulum, structures that increase spine motility and may also stabilize the synaptic complex during signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Deller et al. 2003</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Knott and Holtmaat 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in numerous SBs, so-called dense-core vesicles (DCVs) were distributed throughout the presynaptic terminal intermingled with the population of SVs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, C, E).</p>

<p>Remarkably, beside synaptic complexes, also ‘special connections’ in L1 of the human TLN were observed. This encompassed so-called dendro-dendritic synapses and fine astrocytic processes that receive synaptic input from SBs and in turn, provide synaptic output to either dendritic shafts or spines (not shown, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>).</p>

<p>Synaptic density measurements serve as a valuable tool for quantitatively characterizing the synaptic organization of a specific cortical layer, assessing the connectivity rate, and identifying potential inter-individual differences among patients within the human TLN.</p>
<p>The average density of synaptic complexes in L1 was comparatively high with a value of 5.26*10<sup>8</sup> ± 8.44*10<sup>7</sup>, 5.52*10<sup>8</sup> ± 1.25*10<sup>8</sup> synapses/mm<sup>3</sup> in L1a and 5.01*10<sup>8</sup> ± 1.40*10<sup>7</sup> synapses/mm<sup>3</sup> in L1b, ranging from 4.08*10<sup>8</sup> to 6.31*10<sup>8</sup> (L1a) and from 4.87*10<sup>8</sup> to 5.15*10<sup>8</sup> (L1b), respectively (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplemental Table 1</xref>; Source Data 01). Strikingly, a huge inter-individual variability was found, although with no significant difference between L1a and L1b.</p>

<p>Mitochondria play a pivotal role in synaptic transmission and plasticity (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dallerac et al. 2018</xref>; see also Discussion). In L1 SBs either no (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref>, 3A, E) or several mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>, 3C, D; range 0 to 8) of different shape and size were observed. When present mitochondria had a volume of 0.04 ± 0.02 µm<sup>3</sup> in L1a and 0.05 ± 0.01 µm<sup>3</sup> in L1b, respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 02). Mitochondria contributed with ∼7% (L1) to the total bouton volume of SBs, similar to values in L6 (∼6%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>), but with a ∼1.5-fold lower percentage as those in L5 (∼12%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>) and L4 (∼13%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Yakoubi et al. 2019b</xref>).</p>
<p>A good correlation between the volume of the SBs and that of mitochondria was found for L1a (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.7528; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) and for L1b (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.5992; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).

<title>Structural composition of AZs in L1a and L1b excitatory SBs in the human TLN</title>
<p>The number, size, and shape of the AZ, composed of the PreAZ and PSD, is one key structural determinant in synaptic transmission and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Südhof 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Matz et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Holderith et al. 2012</xref>) as it represents the docking area of SVs (PreAZs) and the receiving area of neurotransmitter quanta at the PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Südhof 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority (∼98%) of SBs in L1a and L1b had only a single (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C-E</xref>, 3A-C, E) at most two or three AZs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Beside very large, spanning the entire pre- and postsynaptic apposition zone, also smaller AZs covering only a fraction of the pre- and postsynaptic apposition zone were found. The majority of AZs (∼75%) were of the macular, non-perforated type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C-E</xref>, 3A-D), the remainder showed either a perforation in the PreAZ, PSD or both (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>On average, PreAZs were 0.18 ± 0.08 µm<sup>2</sup> in surface area in L1a and 0.22 ± 0.04 µm<sup>2</sup> in L1b with only a slight variability between both sublaminae. The surface area of PSDs was quite similar to that of PreAZs 0.21 ± 0.01 µm<sup>2</sup> and was in L1a and 0.22 ± 0.05 µm<sup>2</sup> in L1b, respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 02, sheet 01). Thus, the similar size of the PreAZ and PSD showed a nearly perfect overlap at the pre- and postsynaptic apposition zone. L1 AZs did not show a large variability in size as indicated by the low SD, CV, and variance (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, our analysis revealed only a weak correlation between the surface area of SBs and that of PreAZs for L1a and L1b SBs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). These findings imply that the size of SBs and PreAZs is independently regulated from each other.</p>
<p>Measurements of the size of the synaptic cleft were performed on random EM images taken from the series using OpenCAR or online directly at the TEM using ImageSP (Fa. Tröndle, Moorenweis, Germany). Only synaptic clefts cut perpendicular to the PreAZ and PSD were included in the sample. The distance between the outer edge of the PreAZ and PSD was measured at the two lateral edges and separately at the central region of the synaptic cleft; the two values of the lateral edges were averaged for each cleft measurement. Finally, a mean ± SD was calculated for both the lateral and central region over all synaptic clefts analyzed per patient.</p>
<p>The size of the synaptic cleft (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 02, sheet 03) is an important measure at AZs since its size (diameter) critically determines the temporal and spatial neurotransmitter concentration. The synaptic cleft size were slight, but non-significantly different between the two sublaminae and similar to findings in L4, L5 and L6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">b</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Organization of the pools of SVs in L1a and L1b excitatory SBs of the human TLN</title>
<p>SVs are the other key structure in neurotransmitter storage and release, hence they play a fundamental role in synaptic transmission and in the modulation of short- and long-term synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Südhof 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">2012</xref>). Three different pools of SVs are functionally defined: the RRP, the RP, and the resting pool. Synaptic efficacy, strength, mode, and probability of release (<italic>Pr</italic>) are regulated by these pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Schikorski and Stevens 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Silver et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Rizzoli and Betz 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Saviane and Silver 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Schikorski 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Watanabe et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Neher 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Vaden et al. 2019</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Rizzoli and Betz 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Denker and Rizzoli 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chamberland and Toth 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>In general, SVs were distributed throughout the entire terminal in ∼95% of the population of SBs investigated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, 3), the remainder showed a more cluster-like distribution. Two different types of vesicles were found: (1) Small clear SVs with an average diameter of 25.03 ± 5.27 nm (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 02, sheet 01) and (2) DCVs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, C, E; Source Data 02, sheet 01) with an average diameter of 57.97 ± 6.45 nm with no significant difference between both sublaminae. DCVs were intermingled with the population of SVs throughout the entire SB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, C, E).</p>
<p>DCVs play an important role in endo- and exocytosis, the build-up of PreAZs by releasing Piccolo and Bassoon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Schoch and Gundelfinger 2006</xref>; Murkherjee et al. 2010), or in clustering SVs at the PreAZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Watanabe et al. 2014</xref>, Murkherjee et al. 2010). In addition, various co-transmitters, such as neuropeptides, ATP, noradrenalin, and dynorphin were identified in large DCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ghijsen and Leenders 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The distribution pattern of SVs made it impossible to morphologically distinguish between the three functionally defined pools of SVs, except for the so-called ‘docked’ and fused vesicles primed to the PreAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Rizzoli and Betz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Neher 2015</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Rizzoli and Betz 2005</xref>; Chamberland and Toth 2015).</p>
<p>Thus, a perimeter analysis (a modified Sholl-analysis) was used to determine the exact location of each SV from the PreAZ in individual terminals (for criteria to define SV pools see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Rizzoli and Betz 2005</xref>). The RRP was defined as a distance (perimeter p) from ≤10 nm and ≤20 nm from the PreAZ. This criteria for the RRP was chosen because both values are less than an SV diameter and hence may represent the RRP from which SVs could be easily and rapidly recruited. The RP maintains release during moderate stimulation and was estimated close (p60-p200 nm) to the PreAZ. All SVs further than 200 nm from the PreAZ were regarded to constitute the resting pool which acts as a deposit of SVs only used by intense and/or repetitive stimulation.</p>
<p>On average, the total pool of SVs was 2958.62 ± 1940.51 in L1a vs. 3903.32 ± 1852.23 in L1b with an average of 3430.97 ± 1773.77 for L1 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 02). Remarkably, the total pool in L1b was significantly larger (p ≤ 0.01) by ∼1.3-fold when compared to L1a. A huge variability in total pool size exists in both sublaminae (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, E) ranging from 758 to 6542 in L1a and 1507 to 15060 in L1b as indicated by the SD, IQR and variance (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). SVs contributed with ∼5% (0.03 µm<sup>3</sup>) in L1a and ∼4% (0.02 µm<sup>3</sup>) in L1b to the total volume of SBs. However, no significant difference between both sublaminae was observed (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 02).</p>
<p>Interestingly, no correlation between the volume of SBs vs. the total pool size was found for L1a (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.2490), but a good correlation for L1b (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.5700). Furthermore, no correlation was found between the PreAZ vs. the total pool size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; Source Data 02).</p>
<p>The average number of SVs in the putative RRP/PreAZ for L1was 3.60 ± 4.24 SVs at p10 nm (L1a: 5.90 ± 5.05 SVs and L1b: 1.29 ± 1.87 SVs) with a significant difference (p ≤ 0.01) by ∼4.5-fold between the two sublaminae (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 02). The putative RRP/PreAZ at the p20 nm criterion was on average 19.05 ±17.23 SVs (L1a: 25.04 ± 21.09 SVs and L1b: 13.07 ± 13.87 SVs) and thus nearly 2-fold larger for L1a. Interestingly, both RRPs in L1a and L1b were characterized by a comparably low variability as indicated by the SD, CV, and variance (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) that may point to sublaminae-specific differences in <italic>Pr</italic>, synaptic efficacy, strength and paired-pulse behavior at individual SBs.</p>
<p>No correlation between the RRP at both the p10 nm and p20 nm criterion and the surface area of PreAZs was found for both sublaminae. (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, E).</p>
<p>The RP/PreAZ at the 60-200 nm perimeter criterion was 390.12 ± 286.89 SVs in L1a and 535.88 ± 321.16 in L1b with no significant difference for both sublaminae (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 02, sheet 01). It should be noted however, that the variability of the RP is relatively large in both sublaminae as indicated by the SD, median, IQR and variance (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Again, no correlation was observed between the SVs in the p60-200 nm RP and the surface area of the PreAZs (L1a, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) and for L1b (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>; Source Data 02, sheet 01), respectively.</p>
<p>The resting pool of SVs contained on average 2515.02 ± 1588.99 SVs in L1a and 3277.97 ± 1480.96 SVs in L1b with a significant difference between the two sublaminae (p ≤ 0.01, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Source Data 02, sheet 01). The number of SVs in the resting pool in L1b was about 1.3-fold larger when compared to L1a. Again, also the resting pool showed a large variability for both sublaminae as indicated by the SD, CV, IQR and variance (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>No correlation was observed between the SVs in the p200 nm and p500 nm resting pool and the surface area of the PreAZs in L1a and L1b (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, H; Source Data 02, sheet 01).</p>

<title>TEM tomography of L1 excitatory SBs in the human TLN</title>

This finding strongly supports multivesicular release of ‘docked’ SVs in L1a and L1b SBs in line with findings in L4, L5 and L6 SBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>; see also <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-F</xref>).</p>
<p>On average, 3.71 ± 1.38 ‘docked’ SVs (L1a) and 3.42 ± 1.34 ‘docked SVs’ (L1b) were found at individual PreAZs with similar values for both sublaminae. Furthermore, no significant difference was found for ‘docked’ SVs between shaft vs. spine synapses in L1. Strikingly, the number of ‘docked’ SVs at L1a PreAZs was ∼2-fold smaller but nearly 3-fold larger in L1b when compared to the results of our quantitative perimeter analysis for the p10 nm criterion and were also significantly different (p &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p>The number of ‘docked’ SVs showed a relatively low variability as indicated by the SD, CV, variance, and skewness, but were different from the values estimated with the p10 nm perimeter analysis. There seems to be a tendency that larger PreAZs contained more ‘docked’ SVs providing a larger ‘docking’ area allowing the recruitment of more SVs.</p>
<p>In summary, a notable disparity difference was observed between values obtained for L1 using the p10 nm criterion of the perimeter- and the EM tomography analysis. Additionally, the RRP in L1 and L6 was ∼2-4-times smaller when compared to values in L4 and L5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>) pointing towards a layer-specific regulation of the RRP. Moreover, the results suggest that not only ‘docked’ SVs but also those very close to the PreAZ should be considered to belong to the RRP.</p>

<title>Astrocytic coverage of L1 SBs in the human TLN</title>
<p>Astrocytes, by directly interacting with synaptic complexes thus forming the ‘tripartite’ synapse play a pivotal role in the induction, maintenance and termination of synaptic transmission by controlling the spatial and temporal concentration of neurotransmitter quanta in the synaptic cleft (reviewed by Dellerac et al. 2018). Astrocytic profiles were identified by their irregular stellate shape, relatively clear cytoplasm, numerous glycogen granules and bundles of intermediate filaments (for criteria see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Peters et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Ventura and Harris 1999</xref>; see also <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, B). Astrocytes and their fine processes formed a relatively dense (in L4, L5), but a comparably loose network within the neuropil in L1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-C</xref>; Source Data 04, sheet 01) by contributing with ∼20% to the total human TLN volume, with the highest degree in coverage in L4 but similar to findings in L6 of the human TLN (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>; Source Data 04, sheet 01).</p>

<p>In general, the majority (∼70% both in spine and shaft synapses; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, Source Data 04, sheet 02) of synaptic complexes in L1 were without astrocytic coverage close to the AZ or only partially ensheated (∼20% both in spine and shaft synapses) by fine astrocytic processes. In only a small fraction (∼10%) of both spine and shaft synapses fine astrocytic processes were observed to form the ‘tripartite’ synapse that physically isolate synaptic complexes from the surrounding neuropil. The findings in L1 are in contrast to L4 were a higher number of ‘tripartite’synaptic complexes (spines: ∼50%; shafts: ∼20%) was found. Around 25% AZs on dendritic spines and ∼ 60% on dendritic shafts were partially covered with a huge inter-individual difference. The remainder were not covered. No significant differences were found between spine and shaft synapses (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, Source Data 04, sheet 02).</p>
<p>Hence, it is most likely that the partial coverage or complete absence of fine astrocytic processes at the majority of synaptic complexes in L1 of the human TLN may contribute to different ‘behaviors’ of synaptic complexes in synaptic transmission and in the modulation of short-term plasticity, for example in the removal of ‘spilled’ horizontally diffusing neurotransmitter quanta favoring synaptic crosstalk (for more detail see Discussion).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated the synaptic organization of L1 in the human TLN. The quantitative 3D-models analyzed showed beside similarities significant layer-specific differences in those structural and synaptic parameters, in particular in the size of the AZ and the total pool of SVs, the RRP, RP and resting pool when compared with other already investigated layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>). The low degree of astrocytic coverage of L1 SBs suggests that glutamate spillover and as a consequence synaptic cross talk may occur at the majority of synaptic complexes in L1</p>

<title>Synaptic density measurements</title>
<p>Synaptic density measurements are a useful tool to describe the synaptic organization of a particular area, nuclei and even layers in different brain regions, but also the degree of connectivity underlying the computational properties of a given brain area or in a given brain network. Meanwhile numerous studies in various animal species and brain regions have performed such an analysis but data for a density of synaptic complexes in humans are still rare (but see Marco and DeFelipe 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Tang et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">DeFelipe et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alonso-Nanclares et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blazquez-Llorca et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Finnema et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cano-Astorga et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Strikingly, a huge layer-specific difference in the mean density of synaptic contacts was found in the human TLN (see also <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). In L1, the overall density was 5.26*10<sup>8</sup> ± 8.44*10<sup>7</sup> synaptic complexes/mm<sup>3</sup> although a great variability was observed as indicated by the SD consistent with findings in the other layers of the human TLN L4 (2.37*10<sup>6</sup> ± 2.19*10<sup>6</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Yakoubi et al. 2019b</xref>); L5 (3.89 *10<sup>8</sup> ± 9.12*10<sup>8</sup>; Yakoubi R., PhD Thesis 2023) and L6 (4.98*10<sup>7</sup> ± 1.85*10<sup>7</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>) and existing data published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alonso-Nanclares et al. 2008</xref>: 9.13 ± 0.63*10<sup>8</sup> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Tang et al. 2001</xref>: 164*10<sup>12</sup>. The density values for L1 and L5 are in the same order of magnitude but differ substantially from L4 and L6 by one or two orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>In summary, the highest synaptic density was observed in L1, indicating a heightened level of connectivity and synaptic interaction. This suggests that L1 facilitates rapid information processing due to its robust synaptic activity.</p>

<p>The majority of SBs in L1 of the human TLN had a single at most three AZs that could be of the non-perforated macular or perforated type comparable with results for other layers in the human TLN (L4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Yakoubi et al. 2019b</xref>, L5: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, L6: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>) but by ∼1.5-fold larger than in rodent and non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Marrone et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Rollenhagen et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bopp et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hsu et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The surface area of AZs in L1 SBs of the human TLN was on average ∼0.20 μm<sup>2</sup>. This is in good agreement with data obtained for AZs in L3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cano-Astorga et al. 2021</xref>), L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Yakoubi et al. 2019b</xref>), L5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>), L6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>) and in L3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cano-Astorga et al. 2023</xref>) of the human temporal and cingulate neocortex.

<title>Size of the three pools of SVs</title>
<p>Besides the size of the PreAZ, the pool of rapidly releasable SVs also critically determines <italic>Pr</italic> and thus synaptic efficacy, strength and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Rosenmund and Stevens 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Schikorski and Stevens 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Rizzoli and Betz 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Schikorski 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Watanabe et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Vaden et al. 2019</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Rizzoli and Betz 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Neher 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chamberland and Toth 2016</xref>). It is still rather unclear whether functionally heterogeneous SV pools are structurally identifiable and thus support diverse forms of synaptic transmission und would also play a pivotal role in long- and short-term plasticity. Synaptic transmission can be modulated in various ways depending on the availability of SVs and on their recycling rates. Hence, the size of both the RRP and RP critically determines synaptic efficacy, strength and plasticity. These parameters are controlled at the PreAZ but vary substantially across various CNS synapses (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Rizzoli and Betz 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Neher 2015</xref>). The contribution of the RRP size to synaptic dynamics and the mechanisms by which such control is achieved at individual SBs remains largely unknown.</p>
<p>L1 SBs had a total pool size of ∼3500 SVs/AZ, the largest total pool size when compared with other layers of the human TLN by ∼2-fold (L4, ∼1800 SVs) by ∼2.6-fold (L5, ∼1350 SVs) and by ∼3-fold (L6, ∼1150 SVs), respectively. Remarkably, the total pool sizes in the human TLN were significantly larger by more than 6-fold (∼550 SVs/AZ), and ∼4.7-fold (∼750 SVs/AZ;) than those in L4 and L5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">b</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Rollenhagen et al. 2018</xref>) in rats. The largest total pool size in L1 may point to a pivotal role in the rapid replenishment after depletion by high-frequency stimulation and the transfer of SVs into the RRP and RP from the total pool in L1 SBs.</p>
<p>The putative RRP at L1 PreAZs was on average ∼4 SVs/AZ for the p10 nm RRP and similar to that in L5 (∼5 SVs/AZ), but significantly smaller by ∼5.3-fold to that of L4 (∼20 SVs/AZ) and by ∼3.5-fold when compared to L6 in the human TLN. Also, huge differences were observed in the p20 nm RRP which at L1 PreAZs was ∼20 SVs, ∼40 SVs in L4, ∼15 SVs in L5 and ∼30 SVs in L6, respectively. It has to be noted that a layer-specific difference in both the p10 nm and p20 nm RRP exists although a huge variability was observed as indicated by the SD, IQR, and variance. Hence, at L1 PreAZs the overall RRP, taken the p10 nm and p20 nm criterion (both together are less than a vesicle diameter) was constituted by ∼25 SVs rapidly available SVs that may partially contribute to the efficacy, strength and reliability of synaptic transmission, but also in the modulation of short-term synaptic plasticity in L1.</p>
<p>The size of the putative RP/PreAZ was ∼470 SVs in human L1 SBs and thus ∼3-fold larger to that in L6 SBs, ∼1.3-fold larger than in L4, and ∼2.4-fold larger than in L5 SBs of the human TLN. In the rodent neocortex the RP/PreAZ comprised ∼130 (L4; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Rollenhagen et al. 2015</xref>) and ∼200 SVs (L5; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Rollenhagen et al. 2018</xref>). The comparably largest size of the RP in L1 when compared with values for the other cortical layers in the human TLN and that found for L4 and L5 in rodents may also point to a rapid availability of SVs from the RP after the replenishment of the RRP during high-frequency stimulation. If the refilling rates were activity dependent, the large size of the RP at L1 PreAZs could explain some forms of short-term synaptic plasticity, e.g. a substantial increase in synaptic strength during frequency facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation at these SBs.</p>
<p>Finally, the resting pool of SVs at L1 PreAZs in the human TLN is also comparably large (∼3000 SVs) and again the largest when compared with other layers in the human TLN (L4 and L5: ∼1250 SVs; L6: ∼900 SVs). The size of the resting pool may guarantee to rapidly replenish the RRP and RP after repetitive high-frequency stimulation via active transfer of SVs with the help of mitochondria associated with the pool of SVs (this study, see also Zhu and Fuster 1996; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Verstreken et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Smith et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>The notable disparities in AZ and SV pool sizes among individual SBs may contribute to rapid alterations in the computational properties of single neurons or networks. Consequently, these variations in AZ and SV pool sizes at L1 SBs may critically influence the behavior of SBs during so-called Up-and-Down states as described for other SBs of the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Zhou and Fuster 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Sanchez-Vives and McCormick 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Sakata and Harris 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Testa-Silva et al. 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>Importance of presynaptic mitochondria in synaptic transmission</title>
<p>Mitochondria in the cortical layers of the human TLN were organized in clusters associated with the pool of SVs (this study, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>).

<p>Mitochondria play a role in the recruitment and mobilization of SVs from the RP and resting pool and in the priming and docking process of SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Verstreken et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Perkins et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Smith et al. 2016</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dallerac et al. 2018</xref>).

<title>Astrocytic coverage of L1 SBS in the human TLN</title>
<p>It is widely recognized that astrocytes play a crucial role in the formation of the ‘tripartite’ synapse, which is a common characteristic of cortical synapses. Astrocytes serve as both a physical barrier to glutamate diffusion and as mediate neurotransmitter uptake via transporters, thereby regulating the spatial and temporal concentration of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Oliet et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Min and Nevian 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Pannasch et al. 2014</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dallerac et al. 2018</xref>). In addition, they modulate synaptic transmission by activating pre- and postsynaptic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Haydon and Carmignoto 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Le Meur et al. 2012</xref>). Moreover, it was found that the control of timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) at neocortical synapses is critically influenced by astrocytes by increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling during the induction of t-LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Min and Nevian 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Remarkably, significant layer-specific differences exist in the astrocytic coverage of synaptic complexes in the human TLN. Whereas in L4 and L5 ∼60-80% of the total volumetric fraction was occupied by astrocytic processes and most of AZs in L4 were tightly ensheathed by fine astrocytic processes, in L1 and L6 the volumetric fraction of astrocytic processes was only ∼20% with a loose and incomplete coverage of AZs in L1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). As a consequence, the lack or only incomplete astrocytic coverage of synaptic complexes in L1 can only partially act as a physical barrier to neurotransmitter diffusion. In addition, beside a vertical also its horizontal diffusion of glutamate at the synaptic cleft is possible. Hence, two possible scenarios for the role of astrocytes are present at L1 synaptic complexes. First, as shown for only a small part (10%) of synaptic complexes in L1 the ‘tripartite’ synapse is realized at both sides of the synaptic cleft (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). This would allow the selective uptake of horizontally diffusing glutamate via glutamate transporters located in the fine astrocytic processes. This prevents ‘glutamate spillover’, and thus allow a vertically directed neurotransmitter diffusion and docking to postsynaptic receptors at the PSD.</p>
<p>The remaining larger part of synaptic complexes in L1 either lack a coverage by fine astrocytic processes at AZs or are only partially ensheathed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Here ‘glutamate spillover’ of horizontally diffusing neurotransmitter quanta is most likely and thus synaptic crosstalk between neighboring synaptic complexes at AZs in neighboring spines on terminal tuft dendrites because spine density in L1 is high. This may cause a switch from asynchronous to synchronous release from neighboring synaptic complexes upon repetitive low- and high-frequency stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">von Gersdorff and Borst 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, two distinct structural scenarios were identified regarding the role of astrocytes in L1, However, it is still rather unknown which of the two scenarios contribute more efficiently to synaptic transmission and plasticity in L1.</p>

<title>The role of L1 in the information processing of the cortical column</title>
<p>The computational properties of the neocortex depend upon its ability to integrate the information provided by the sensory organs (bottom-up information) with internally generated signals such as expectations or attentional signals (top-down information). This integration occurs at apical tuft dendrites of L2/3 and L5 pyramidal neurons in L1. Importantly, L1 is the predominant input layer for top-down information, relayed by a rich, dense network of cortico-cortical, commissural and associational long-range axonal projections and L1 excitatory and inhibitory neurons providing signals to the terminal tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons (reviewed by Schumann et al. 2021). Thus, L1 is a central locus of neocortical associations controlled by distinct types of excitation and inhibition in humans (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hartung and Letzkus 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>From L4, as the first station of intracortical information processing thalamocortical signals are transferred via intracolumnar projecting axonal collaterals via L2, L3 to L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Feldmeyer et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lübke et al. 2000</xref>) representing a convergent input layer for thalamocortical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Rodriguez-Moreno et al. 2018</xref>) and cortico-cortical synaptic inputs.

<p>SBs in L1 contact both the persistent subpopulation of CR-cells, various GABAergic interneurons and terminal tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>) proving feed-forward excitation to their putative partners in L1. CR-cells exhibit long-range excitation that preferentially and heavily contact terminal tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons within and across cortical columns via long horizontal axonal collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anstötz et al. 2014</xref>). As shown in rodent neocortex, GABAergic interneurons are synaptically coupled with CR-cells providing feed-forward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anstötz et al. 2014</xref>) thus controlling the output of CR-cells.</p>

<p>In general, GABAergic inhibition plays a critical role in shaping neuronal activity in the neocortex. However, most inhibitory synapses in the neocortex are formed onto pyramidal cell dendrites suggesting they may focally regulate cellular activity (Kwon et al. 2018). Somatostatin-expressing interneurons in L1 exert compartmentalized control over postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals mediated by a subset of GABAergic synapses that directly target spine heads. GABAergic inhibition thus participates in localized control of dendritic electrical and biochemical signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boldog et al. 2018</xref>). Furthermore, another study has shown that a surprisingly large fraction (33.4 ± 9.3%) of terminals formed symmetrical synaptic junctions onto a subset of cortical spines that were mostly co-innervated by an asymmetrical terminal. The double-innervated spines selectively received thalamocortical afferents expressing VGLUT2 but were not innervated by intracortical synaptic contacts expressing VGLUT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kubota et al. 2007</xref>). These results demonstrate that inhibitory inputs to pyramidal cell spines may preferentially reduce thalamocortical rather than intracortical synaptic transmission and are therefore positioned to selectively gate extracortical information.</p>
<p>Another subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons in L1 exhibit a highly specialized form of recurrent inhibition that link cortical L1 to L3 interneurons and L5 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jiang et al. 2013</xref>). L1 single-bouquet cells preferentially form inhibitory connections on L2/3 interneurons that inhibit the entire dendritic-somato-axonal axis of L5 pyramidal neurons located within the same column. In contrast, L1 neurogliaform cells frequently form inhibitory and electric connections with L2/3 interneurons. These L1-L3 interneurons inhibit the distal apical dendrite of &gt; 60% of L5 pyramidal neurons across multiple columns. Functionally, the single bouquet cell to L2/3 interneurons to L5 pyramidal neuronal circuits disinhibit, and neurogliaform cells to L2/3 interneuron to L5 pyramidal neuronal circuits inhibit the initiation of dendritic complex spikes in L5 pyramidal neurons. As dendritic complex spikes can serve coincidence detection, these cortical interneuronal circuits may be essential for salience selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jiang et al. 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, L1 receive GABAergic input from Martinotti cells located in L2/3 and L5, axo-axonic Chandelier cells in L2/3 and VIP-expressing interneurons in L2 all of which have a very prominent axonal plexus in L1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Silberberg and Markram 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Obermayer et al. 2018</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hartung and Letzkus 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Schuman et al. 2021</xref>; reviewed by Huang et al. 2024).</p>
<p>In summary, these GABAergic interneuron populations provide inhibition and disinhibition to pyramidal terminal tuft dendrites by either shunting or promoting the generation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Na<sup>+</sup>-spikes by temporal and spatial coincidence detection. Thus, the circuitry of L1, including the persistent subpopulation of excitatory CR-cells; is an important and fundamental ‘integrator’ of the neocortex sampling bottom-up information within or even across cortical columns, but also act as a ‘filter’ or ‘discriminator’ but also as an ‘amplifier’ in the information processing of the neocortex.</p>
<p>Hence, L1 of the neocortex can be regarded as a complex and intricate layer of the brain serving different functions, for example to gate inputs, convey expectations and context as well as mediate states of consciousness, attention, cross-modal interactions, sensory perception, and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bastos et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Heeger 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Zagha 2020</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gilbert and Li 2013</xref>). There is evidence that L1 processing, particularly Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the distal apical dendrite, is important for sensory perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Xu et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent studies have revealed that L1 plays a crucial role in top-down attentional processes, aiding in directing attention, based on our goals and intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hartung and Letzkus 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Schuman et al. 2021</xref>). Additionally, L1 is implicated in the formation and consolidation of long-term memories with disruptions in L1 function associated with memory deficits. Furthermore, L1 contributes to brain plasticity, which involves the brain’s ability to change and adapt in response to experience, including the process by which synapses alter in strength and number (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hartung and Letzkus 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Schuman et al. 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, L1 of the neocortex is a complex and fascinating layer of the brain that is involved in a wide range of cognitive processes and brain plasticity. Since this is relayed by a network of SBs in L1, their composition and connections play a pivotal role, in columnar information processing.</p>

<title>Fixation and tissue processing for TEM</title>
<p>Tissue samples from the human TLN were after their removal prepared and embedded for conventional TEM and EM tomography analysis. All neocortical access tissues were obtained from patients (1 male and 3 female, 24-65 years in age, see <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplemental Table 2</xref>) suffering from drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. The pre-surgical work-up comprised at least high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging together with long-term video-electro-encephalography (EEG)-monitoring. In all cases, the circumscribed epileptic focus was in the hippocampus proper, but not in the neocortical access regions of the TL.</p>
<p>During epilepsy surgery, blocks of both non-affected, non-epileptic and epileptic neocortical access tissue samples (see <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplemental Table 2</xref>) were resected to control the seizures for histological inspection by neuropathologists. The non-affected non-epileptic neocortical access tissue samples was always taken far from the epileptic focus and may thus be regarded as non-epileptic as also demonstrated by other structural and functional studies using the same experimental approach (Alonso-Nanclares 2008; Navarette et al. 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mohan et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Molnár et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Seeman et al. 2018</xref>; reviewed by Mansfelder et al. 2019). So-called ‘post mortem’ tissue was not used in this study since the ultrastructural quality (preservation) of such material is not suitable enough for fine-scale high-resolution EM, due to severe distortions of relevant structural features, e.g. fragmentation and lysis of membranes of SBs, PreAZs, PSDs and SVs that are required for the generation of quantitative 3D-models of SBs and their target structures (Lübke, personal observation). However, under certain conditions also ‘post mortem’ tissue samples can be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dominguez-Alvaro et al. 2019</xref>, 2921; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cano-Astorga et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">2023</xref>).</p>

<p>Other recent studies using the same experimental approach neglected and thus discarded the effect of the pharmacological treatments and disease condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alonso-Nanclares et al. 2008</xref>; Testa Silva et al. 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mohan et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Molnár et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Seeman et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dominguez-Alvaro et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>For the study of L1 in the human TLN, blocks of neocortical access tissue were sampled from the temporo-lateral or temporo-basal regions of the inferior temporal gyrus and the gyrus medialis. Immediately after their removal during epilepsy surgery, biopsy samples of the TLN were immersion-fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde diluted in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4) for 24-72 hrs at 4°C. The fixative was replaced by fresh fixative after 2 hrs and changed twice during the subsequent fixation period. Prior to vibratome sectioning, brain tissue samples were thoroughly rinsed in ice-cold PB and afterwards embedded in 5% Agar-Agar (Sigma, Munich, Germany) diluted in PB.</p>
<p>Neocortical tissue blocks were cut in the coronal plane through the TLN with a Vibratome VT 1000S (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) into 150-200 µm thick sections, collected in ice-cold PB, and washed again several times in PB. Afterwards they were transferred to 0.5-1% PB-sucrose buffered Osmium tetroxide (OsO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mOsm, pH 7.4; Sigma, Munich, Germany) for 60-90 min. After visual inspection to check for the quality of post-fixation, sections were thoroughly washed several times in PB and left overnight at 4°C in PB. The next day they were dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol starting at 20%, 30%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% to absolute ethanol (15 min for each step and absolute ethanol, 30 min twice), followed by a brief incubation in propylene oxide (2 min twice; Fluka, Neu-Ulm, Germany). Sections were then transferred into a mixture of propylene oxide and Durcupan<sup>TM</sup> resin (2:1, 1:1 for 1h each; Fluka, Neu-Ulm, Germany) and stored overnight in pure resin. The next day, sections were flat embedded on coated glass slides in fresh Durcupan<sup>TM</sup>, coverslipped with Acla<sup>TM</sup> foils and polymerized at 60°C for 2 days.</p>

<title>Semi- and ultrathin sectioning</title>
<p>After light microscopic (LM) inspection, a tissue block containing the region of interest (ROI) was glued on a pre-polymerized block and trimmed down. Semithin sections were cut with a Leica UltracutS ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria), with a Histo-Diamond knife (Fa. Diatome, Nidau, Switzerland). Afterwards they were briefly stained with methylene-blue (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany) to identify the cortical layers, particularly L1 and underlying L2, examined and documented using a motorized Olympus BX61 microscope equipped with the Olympus CellSense analysis hard- and software (Olympus GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). All images were stored in a database until further use.</p>
<p>After further trimming of the block to its final size, serial ultrathin sections (50 ± 5 nm thickness; silver to silver gray interference contrast) were cut with a Leica UltracutS ultramicrotome through the determined ROI of L1a and L1b, respectively. Ultrathin sections in serial sequence were collected on pioloform-coated slot copper grids (Plano, Wetzlar, Germany). Prior to EM examination, sections were stained with 5% aqueous uranyl acetate or Uranyless (Science Services, Munich, Germany) for 15–20 min and lead citrate for 3–5 min according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Reynolds (1963)</xref> to enhance the contrast of biological membranes at the EM level. In each series of ultrathin sections, two or three ROIs throughout L1a or L1b were chosen, and photographed at a final EM magnification of 8000x with a Zeiss Libra 120 (Fa. Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a Proscan 2K digital camera (Fa. Tröndle, Moorenweis, Germany) using the ImageSP software and its panorama function (Fa. Tröndle, Moorenweis, Germany). In addition, interesting details of synaptic structures in L1a and L1b were taken at various EM magnifications.</p>

<title>3D-volume reconstructions and quantitative analysis of SBs</title>
<p>EM panorama images composing each series were imported, stacked, and aligned in the reconstruction software OpenCAR (Contour Alignment Reconstruction; for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Sätzler et al. 2002</xref>). The main goal of this study was to quantify several structural and synaptic parameters representing structural correlates of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Excitatory SBs were characterized by large round SVs and prominent PreAZs and PSDs in contrast to putative GABAergic terminals that have smaller, more oval-shaped SVs, and a thin or no PSDs.</p>
<p>The following structural parameters were analyzed: (1) surface area and volume of SBs; (2) volume of mitochondria; (3) surface area of PreAZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dufour et al. 2016</xref>) and PSDs; two apposed membrane specializations separated by the synaptic cleft; (4) number and diameter of clear SVs and dense-core vesicles (DCVs); and (5) distance of individual SVs from the PreAZ for the structural definition of the RRP, RP, and resting pool. 3D-volume reconstructions were generated by drawing contour lines on the structures of interest in each panorama image within a series of images until a given structure was completed. Presynaptic SBs, their mitochondria as well as their postsynaptic target structures were outlined on the outer edge of their membranes, using closed contour lines throughout the entire stack within a series. A SB was considered completely captured, when it was possible to follow the axon in both directions through the entire series (<italic>en passant</italic> SBs) or the enlargement of the axon leading to an endterminal SB. The beginning of a synaptic terminal was defined by the typical widening of the axon and the abrupt occurrence of a pool of SVs.</p>
<p>The PreAZs and PSDs were regarded as complete when their perimeters were entirely reconstructed in a series of ultrathin sections. The surface areas of the PreAZ and PSD were computed separately by first generating a 3D surface model of the SB. The PreAZ was then measured by extracting this area from the reconstructed presynaptic bouton membrane that was covered by this membrane specialization. Hence, the length (L) of the PreAZ (L PreAZ) and the surface area (SA) of the PreAZ (SA PreAZ) is already known.</p>
<p>The size of the PSD opposing the PreAZ was estimated under the following assumptions: (1) both membrane specializations, PreAZ and PSD run parallel to each other at the pre- and postsynaptic apposition zone; (2) for both membrane specializations a contour line was drawn determining their actual length (L PreAZ and L PSD). Hence, the surface area of the PSD (SA PSD) is estimated by the following equation:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="599047v3_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>which is the perimeter ratio between the outlines of the PSD to that of the synaptic contact.</p>
<p>The synaptic cleft width was measured because of its importance for the transient temporal and spatial increase of the glutamate concentration, reversible binding of glutamate to appropriate glutamate receptors and eventual up-take and diffusion of glutamate out of the synaptic cleft. To a large extent, these processes are governed by the geometry of this structure and the shape and size of the PreAZs and PSDs.</p>
<p>All SVs were marked throughout each SB, their diameters were individually measured and their distances to the PreAZ were automatically detected using an algorithm implemented in OpenCAR (minimal distance between each SV membrane to the contour line of the PreAZ) throughout the SB in every single image of the series. Large DCVs were only counted in the image where they appeared largest. To avoid double counts, only clear ring-like structures were counted as SVs. However, SVs might be missed in densely packed regions, because ring-like traces may partly overlap. This effect may counteract any double counts. Based on the small extent and the partially counteracting nature of this effect, the numbers of small clear vesicles reported in this study remained uncorrected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In this work, aldehyde fixation was used that is thought to induce tissue shrinkage thereby biasing structural quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Eyre et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Korogod et al. 2015</xref>). A direct comparison of structural parameters obtained from either aldehyde or cryo-fixed and substituted tissue samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Korogod et al. 2015</xref>), showed differences in cortical thickness (∼16% larger in cryo-fixed material), in the volume of extracellular space (∼6-fold larger in cryo-fixed material), a slight increase in glial volume and overall density of synaptic contacts (∼14% in cryo-fixed material), but no significant differences in neuronal structures such as axons, dendrites and SV diameter.</p>
<p>In the structural and synaptic parameters as estimated here, no significant difference was found for SB size and other synaptic subelements such as mitochondria, active zones (AZs) and SVs when compared with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Zhao et al. 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">b</xref>). Therefore, no corrections for shrinkage were applied and we are thus convinced that the synaptic parameters reported here are accurate and can be directly used for detailed computational models. In addition, large-scale preservation for ultrastructural analysis will therefore continue to rely on chemical fixation approaches, due to the limited preservation of the ultrastructure in cryo-fixed material as stated in Korogod and co-workers (2015).</p>

Care was taken to distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic contacts, as well as the postsynaptic target structures (dendritic shafts or spines).

<p>In addition, in consecutive sections spanning the complete AZ, the astrocytic coverage was evaluated under the following criteria: fine astrocytic processes were observed on 1) both sides of the AZ reaching as far as the synaptic cleft, 2) only one side of the AZ was covered by fine astrocytic processes and 3) AZs without astrocytic processes (Source Data 04, sheet 02). Values obtained for L1 either for SBs terminating on dendritic spines (n = 254) or shafts (n = 92) were compared to L4 (spines = 93; shafts = 41). Layer 4 was chosen because the volumetric analysis showed the highest portion of astrocytic processes in this layer compared to all other cortical layers. All values are given as percentages.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The mean value ± standard deviation (SD), the median with the interquartile range (IQR), the coefficient of variation (CV), skewness, variance, and the coefficient of correlation (R<sup>2</sup>) were given for each structural parameter analyzed. The p-value was considered significant only if p &lt; 0.05. Box- and Violin plots (Plotly 4.0.0 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chart-studio.plotly.com">https://chart-studio.plotly.com</ext-link>) were generated to investigate inter-individual differences for each patient and structural parameter (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Source Data 02).</p>
<p>To test for significant differences, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H-test with a subsequent Mann-Whitney u-test analysis was performed, using PAST 4.02 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hammer et al. 2001</xref>). Correlation graphs between several structural parameters were then generated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>-values were interpreted as follows: 0, no linear correlation; 0-0.5, weak linear correlation; 0.5-0.8, good linear correlation; and 0.8-1.0, strong linear correlation. Furthermore, a freely available Fisher’s <italic>r</italic>-to-<italic>z</italic>-transformation calculator (Fisher’s z) was used to test for differences in <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> between L1a and L1b (p-value &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p>Parts of the data acquisition were carried out in the context of a PhD Thesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Sadeghi Dastjerdi A., 2024</xref>).Values obtained in the present study for L1 were compared partially to those obtained for L2, L3 (Girwert Ch., PhD Thesis in preparation), L4, L5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Yakoubi et al. 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">b</xref>; Yakoubi R., PhD Thesis 2023) and L6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Schmuhl-Giesen et al. 2022</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The Authors investigated the anatomical features of the excitatory synaptic boutons in layer 1 of the human temporal neocortex. They examined the size of the synapse, the macular or the perforated appearance and the size of the synaptic active zone, the number and volume of the mitochondria, the number of the synaptic and the dense core vesicles, also differentiating between the readily releasable, the recycling and the resting pool of synaptic vesicles. The coverage of the synapse by astrocytic processes was also assessed, and all the above parameters were compared to other layers of the human temporal neocortex. The Authors conclude that the subcellular morphology of the layer 1 synapses is suitable for the functions of the neocortical layer, i.e. the synaptic integration within the cortical column. The low glial coverage of the synapses might allow the glutamate spillover from the synapses enhancing synpatic crosstalk within this cortical layer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of this paper are the abundant and very precious data about the fine structure of the human neocortical layer 1. Quantitative electron microscopy data (especially that derived from the human brain) are very valuable, since this is a highly time- and energy consuming work. The techniques used to obtain the data, as well as the analyses and the statistics performed by the Authors are all solid, strengthen this manuscript, and mainly support the conclusions drawn in the discussion.</p>
<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>The corrected version of the article titled „Ultrastructural sublaminar specific diversity of excitatory synaptic boutons in layer 1 of the adult human temporal lobe neocortex&quot; has been improved thanks to the comments and suggestions of the reviewers. The Authors implemented several of my comments and suggestions. However, many of them were not completed. It is understandable that the Authors did not start a whole new series of experiment investigating inhibitory synapses (as it was a misunderstanding affecting 2 reviewers from the three). But the English text is still very hard to understand and has many mistakes, although I suggested to extensively review the use of English. Furthermore, my suggestion about avoiding many abbreviations in the abstract, analyse and discuss more the perforated synapses, the figure presentation (Figure 3) and including data about the astrocytic coverage in the Results section were not implemented. My questions about the number of docked vesicles and p10 vesicles, as well as about the different categories of the vesicle pools have not been answered neither. Many other minor comments and suggestions were answered, corrected and implemented, but I think it could have been improved more if the Authors take into account all of the reviewers' suggestions, not only some of them. I still have several main and minor concerns, with a few new ones as well I did not realized earlier, but still think it is important.</p>
<p>Main concerns:</p>
<p>(1) Epileptic patients:</p>
<p>
As all patients were epileptic, it is not correct to state in the abstract that non-epileptic tissue was investigated. Even if the seizure onset zone was not in the region investigated, seizures usually invade the temporal lobe in TLE. If you can prove that no spiking activity occured in the sample you investigated and the seizures did not invade that region, then you can write that it is presumably non-epileptic. I would suggest to write „L1 of the human temporal lobe neocortical biopsy tissue&quot;. See also Methods lines 608-612. Write only „non-epileptic&quot; or „non-affected&quot; if you verified it with EcoG. If this was the case, please write a few sentences about it in the Methods.</p>
<p>(2) About the inhibitory/excitatory synapses.</p>
<p>
Since our focus was on excitatory synaptic boutons as already stated in the title we have not analyzed inhibitory SBs.</p>
<p>
Now, I do understand that only excitatory synapses were investigated. Although it was written in the title, I did not realized, since all over the manuscript the Authors were writing synapses, and were distinguishing between inhibitory and excitatory syanpses in the text and showing numerous excitatory and inhibitory synapses on Figure 2 and discussing inhibitory interneurons in the Discussion as well. Maybe this was the reason why two reviewers out of the three (including myself) thought you investigated both types of synapses but did not differentiated between them. So, please, emphasize in the Abstract (line 40), Introduction (for ex. line 92-97) and the Discussion (line 369) that only excitatory synaptic boutons were investigated.</p>
<p>
As this paper investigated only excitatory synaptic boutons, I think it is irrelevant to write such a long section in the Discussion about inhibitory interneurons and their functions in the L1 of the human temporal lobe neocortex. Same applies to the schematic drawing of the possible wiring of L1 (Figure 7). As no inhibitory interneurons were examined, neither the connection of the different excitatory cells, only the morphology of single synaptic boutons without any reference on their origin, I think this figure does not illustrate the work done in this paper. This could be a figure of a review paper about the human L1, but is is inappropriate in this study.</p>
<p>(3) Perforated synapses</p>
<p>
&quot;the findings of the Geinismann group suggesting that perforated synapses are more efficient than non-perforated ones is nowadays very controversially discussed&quot;</p>
<p>
I did not ask the Authors to say that perforated synapses are more efficient. However, based on the literature (for ex. Harris et al, 1992; Carlin and Siekievitz, 1982; Nieto-Sampedro et al., 1982) the presence of perforated synapses is indeed a good sign of synapse division/formation - which in turn might be coupled to synaptic plasticity (Geinisman et al, 1993), increased synaptic activity (Vrensen and Cardozo, 1981), LTP (Geinisman et al, 1991, Harris et al, 2003), pathological axonal sprouting (Frotscher et al, 2006), etc. I think it is worth mentioning this at least in the Discussion.</p>
<p>(4) Question about the vesicle pools</p>
<p>
Results, Line 271: Still not understandable, why the RRP was defined as {less than or equal to}10 nm and {less than or equal to}20nm. Why did you use two categories? One would be sufficient (for example {less than or equal to}20nm). Or the vesicles between 10 and 20nm were considered to be part of RRP? In this case there is a typo, it should be {greater than or equal to}10 nm and {less than or equal to}20nm.</p>
<p>
The answer of the Authors was to my question raised: We decided that also those very close within 10 and 20 nm away from the PreAZ, which is less than a SV diameter may also contribute to the RRP since it was shown that SVs are quite mobile.</p>
<p>
This does not clarify why did you use two categories. Furthermore, I did not receive answer (such as Referee #2) for my question on how could you have 3x as many docked vesicles than vesicles {less than or equal to}10nm. The category {less than or equal to}10nm should also contain the docked vesicles. Or if this is not the case, please, clarify better what were your categories.</p>
<p>(5) Astrocytic coverage</p>
<p>
On Fig. 6 data are presented on the astrocytic coverage derived from L1 and L4. In my previous review I asked to include this in the text of the Results as well, but I still do not see it. It is also lacking from the Results how many samples from which layer were investigated in this analysis. Only percentages are given, and only for L1 (but how many patients, L1a and/or L1b and/or L4 is not provided). In contrast, Figure 6 and Supplementary Table 2 (patient table) contains the information that this analysis has been made in L4 as well. Please, include this information in the text as well (around lines 348-360).</p>
<p>
About how to determine glial elements. I cannot agree with the Authors that glial elements can be determined with high certainty based only on the anatomical features of the profiles seen in the EM. „With 25 years of experience in (serial) EM work&quot; I would say, that glial elements can be very similar to spine necks and axonal profiles.</p>
<p>
All in all, if similar methods were used to determine the glial coverage in the different layers of the human neocortex, than it can be compared (I guess this is the case). However, I would say in the text that proper determination would need immunostaining and a new analysis. This only gives an estimatation with the possibility of a certain degree of error.</p>
<p>(6) Large interindividual differences in the synapse density should be discussed in the Discussion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study of Rollenhagen et al examines the ultrastructural features of Layer 1 of human temporal cortex. The tissue was derived from drug-resistant epileptic patients undergoing surgery, and was selected as further from the epilepsy focus, and as such considered to be non-epileptic. The analyses has included 4 patients with different age, sex, medication and onset of epilepsy. The MS is a follow-on study with 3 previous publications from the same authors on different layers of the temporal cortex:</p>
<p>Layer 4 - Yakoubi et al 2019 eLife</p>
<p>
Layer 5 - Yakoubi et al 2019 Cerebral Cortex,</p>
<p>
Layer 6 - Schmuhl-Giesen et al 2022 Cerebral Cortex</p>
<p>They find, the L1 synaptic boutons mainly have single active zone a very large pool of synaptic vesicles and are mostly devoid of astrocytic coverage.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The MS is well written easy to read. Result section gives a detailed set of figures showing many morphological parameters of synaptic boutons and surrounding glial elements. The authors provide comparative data of all the layers examined by them so far in the Discussion. Given that anatomical data in human brain are still very limited, the current MS has substantial relevance.</p>
<p>
The work appears to be generally well done, the EM and EM tomography images are of very good quality. The analyses is clear and precise.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors made all the corrections required, answered most of my concerns, included additional data sets, and clarified statements where needed.</p>
<p>My remaining points are:</p>
<p>Synaptic vesicle diameter (that has been established to be ~40nm independent of species) can properly be measured with EM tomography only, as it provides the possibility to find the largest diameter of every given vesicle. Measuring it in 50 nm thick sections result in underestimation (just like here the values are ~25 nm) as the measured diameter will be smaller than the true diameter if the vesicle is not cut in the middle, (which is the least probable scenario). The authors have the EM tomography data set for measuring the vesicle diameter properly.</p>
<p>It is a bit misleading to call vesicle populations at certain arbitrary distances from the presynaptic active zone as readily releasable pool, recycling pool and resting pool, as these are functional categories, and cannot directly be translated to vesicles at certain distances. Even it is debated whether the morphologically docked vesicles are the ones, that are readily releasable, as further molecular steps, such as proper priming is also a prerequisite for release.</p>
<p>
It would help to call these pools as &quot;putative&quot; correlates of the morphological categories.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Rollenhagen at al. offer a detailed description of layer 1 of the human neocortex. They use electron microscopy to assess the morphological parameters of presynaptic terminals, active zones, vesicle density/distribution, mitochondrial morphology and astrocytic coverage. The data is collected from tissue from four patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. As the epileptic focus was localized in all patients to the hippocampus, the tissue examined in this manuscript is considered non-epileptic (access) tissue.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The quality of the electron microscopic images is very high, and the data is analyzed carefully. Data from human tissue is always precious and the authors here provide a detailed analysis using adequate approaches, and the data is clearly presented.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The text connects functional and morphological characteristics in a very direct way. For example, connecting plasticity to any measurement the authors present would be rather difficult without any additional functional experiments. References to various vesicle pools based on the location of the vesicles is also more complex than it is suggested in the manuscript. The text should better reflect the limitations of the conclusions that can be drawn from the authors' data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigated the anatomical features of the synaptic boutons in layer 1 of the human temporal neocortex. They examined the size of each synapse, the macular or perforated appearance, the size of the synaptic active zone, the number and volume of the mitochondria, and the number of synaptic and dense core vesicles, also differentiating between the readily releasable, the recycling, and the resting pool of synaptic vesicles. The coverage of the synapse by astrocytic processes was also assessed, and all the above parameters were compared to other layers of the human temporal neocortex. The authors conclude that the subcellular morphology of the layer 1 synapses are suitable for the functions of the neocortical layer, i.e. the synaptic integration within the cortical column. The low glial coverage of the synapses might allow increased glutamate spillover from the synapses, enhancing synaptic crosstalk within this cortical layer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>

<p>We would like to thank reviewer#1 for his very positive comments on our manuscript stating that such data about the fine structure of the human neocortex are are highly relevant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are several weaknesses in this work. First, the authors should check and review extensively for improvements to the use of English. Second, several additional analyses performed on the existing data could substantially elevate the value of the data presented. Much more information could be gained from the existing data about the functions of the investigated layer, of the cortical column, and about the information processing of the human neocortex. Third, several methodological concerns weaken the conclusions drawn from the results.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for his critical and thus helpful comments on our manuscript. We took the first comment of the reviewer concerning the English and have thus improved our manuscript by rephrasing and shortening sentences. Secondly, according to the reviewer several additional analyses should be performed on the existing data, which could substantially elevate the value of the data presented. We will implement some of the suggestions in the improved version of the manuscript where appropriate. We will address a more detailed answer to the reviewer’s queries in her/his suggestions to the authors (see below). However, the reviewer states himself: “The techniques used to obtain the data, as well as the analyses and the statistics performed by the authors are all solid, strengthen this manuscript, and mainly support the conclusions drawn in the discussion”.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study of Rollenhagen et al. examines the ultrastructural features of Layer 1 of the human temporal cortex. The tissue was derived from drug-resistant epileptic patients undergoing surgery, and was selected as far as possible from the epilepsy focus, and as such considered to be non-epileptic. The analyses included 4 patients with different ages, sex, medication, and onset of epilepsy. The manuscript is a follow-on study with 3 previous publications from the same authors on different layers of the temporal cortex:</p>
<p>Layer 4 - Yakoubi et al 2019 eLife</p>
<p>Layer 5 - Yakoubi et al 2019 Cerebral Cortex</p>
<p>Layer 6 - Schmuhl-Giesen et al 2022 Cerebral Cortex.</p>
<p>They find, that the L1 synaptic boutons mainly have a single active zone, a very large pool of synaptic vesicles, and are mostly devoid of astrocytic coverage.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well-written and easy to read. The Results section gives a detailed set of figures showing many morphological parameters of synaptic boutons and glial elements. The authors provide comparative data of all the layers examined by them so far in the Discussion. Given that anatomical data in the human brain are still very limited, the current manuscript has substantial relevance. The work appears to be generally well done, the EM and EM tomography images are of very good quality. The analysis is clear and precise.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for his very positive evaluation of our paper and the comments that such data have a substantial relevance, in particular in the human neocortex. In contrast to reviewer#1, this reviewer’s opinion is that the manuscript is well written and easy to read.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One of the main findings of this paper is that &quot;low degree of astrocytic coverage of L1 SBs suggests that glutamate spillover and as a consequence synaptic cross-talk may occur at the majority of synaptic complexes in L1&quot;. However, the authors only quantified the volume ratio of astrocytes in all 6 layers, which is not necessarily the same as the glial coverage of synapses. In order to strengthen this statement, the authors could provide 3D data (that they have from the aligned serial sections) detailing the percentage of synapses that have glial processes in close proximity to the synaptic cleft, that would prevent spillover.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that we only quantified the volume ratio of the astrocytic coverage but not necessarily the percentage of synapses that may or not contribute to the formation of the ‘tripartite’ synapse. As suggested, we will re-analyze our material with respect to the percentage of coverage for individual synaptic boutons in each layer and will implement the results in the improved version of the manuscript. However, since this is a completely new analysis that is time-consuming we would like to ask the reviewer for additional time to perform this task.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A specific statement is missing on whether only glutamatergic boutons were analyzed in this MS, or GABAergic boutons were also included. There is a statement, that they can be distinguished from glutamatergic ones, but it would be useful to state it clearly in the Abstract, Results, and Methods section what sort of boutons were analyzed. Also, what is the percentage of those boutons from the total bouton population in L1?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this comment. Although our title clearly states, we focused on quantitative 3D-models of <bold>excitatory</bold> synaptic boutons, we will point out that more clearly in the Methods and Result chapters. Our data support recent findings by others (see for example Cano-Astorga et al. 2023, 2024; Shapson-Coe et al. 2024) that have evaluated the ratio between excitatory vs. inhibitory synaptic boutons in the temporal lobe neocortex, the same area as in our study, which was between 10-15% inhibitory terminals but with a significant layer and region specific difference. We will include the excitatory vs. inhibitory ratio and the corresponding citations in the Results section.</p>

<p>Synaptic vesicle diameter (that has been established to be ~40nm independent of species) can properly be measured with EM tomography only, as it provides the possibility to find the largest diameter of every given vesicle. Measuring it in 50 nm thick sections results in underestimation (just like here the values are ~25 nm) as the measured diameter will be smaller than the true diameter if the vesicle is not cut in the middle, (which is the least probable scenario). The authors have the EM tomography data set for measuring the vesicle diameter properly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We partially disagree with the reviewer on this point. Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, we measured the distance from the outer-to-outer membrane only on those synaptic vesicles that were round in shape with a clear ring-like structure to avoid double counts and discarded all those that were only partially cut according to criteria developed by Abercrombie (1946) and Boissonnat (1988). We assumed that within a 55±5 nm thick ultrathin section (silver to gray interference contrast) all clear-ring-like vesicles were distributed in this section assuming a vesicle diameter between 25 to 40nm. For large DCVs, double-counts were excluded by careful examination of adjacent images and were only counted in the image where they appeared largest.</p>
<p>In addition, we have measured synaptic vesicles using TEM tomography and came to similar results. We will address this in Material and Methods that both methods were used.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is a bit misleading to call vesicle populations at certain arbitrary distances from the presynaptic active zone as readily releasable pool, recycling pool, and resting pool, as these are functional categories, and cannot directly be translated to vesicles at certain distances. Indeed, it is debated whether the morphologically docked vesicles are the ones, that are readily releasable, as further molecular steps, such as proper priming are also a prerequisite for release.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. However, nobody before us tried to define a morphological correlate for the three functionally defined pools of synaptic vesicles since synaptic vesicles normally are distributed over the entire nerve terminal. As already mentioned above, after long and thorough discussions with Profs. Bill Betz, Chuck Stevens, Thomas Schikorski and other experts in this field we tried to define the readily releasable (RRP), recycling (RP) and resting pools by measuring the distance of each synaptic vesicle to the presynaptic density (PreAZ). Using distance as a criterion, we defined the RRP including all vesicles that were located within a distance (perimeter) of 10 to 20 nm from the PreAZ that is less than an average vesicle diameter (between 25 to 40 nm). The RP was defined as vesicles within a distance of 60-200 nm away, still quite close but also rapidly available on demand and the remaining ones beyond 200 nm were suggested to belong to the resting pool. This concept was developed for our first publication (Sätzler et al. 2002) and this approximation since then is very much acknowledged by scientist working in the field of synaptic neuroscience and computational neuroscientist. We were asked by several labs worldwide whether they can use our data of the perimeter analysis for modeling. We agree that our definition of the three pools can be seen as arbitrary but we never claimed that our approach is the truth but nothing as the truth. Concerning the debate whether only docked vesicles or also those very close the PreAZ should constitute the RRP we have a paper in preparation using our perimeter analysis, EM tomography and simulations trying to clarify this debate. Our preliminary results suggest that the size of the RRP should be reconsidered.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Tissue shrinkage due to aldehyde fixation is a well-documented phenomenon that needs compensation when dealing with density values. The authors cite Korogod et al 2015 - which actually draws attention to the problem comparing aldehyde fixed and non-fixed tissue, still the data is non-compensated in the manuscript. Since all the previous publications from this lab are based on aldehyde fixed non-compensated data, and for this sake, this dataset should be kept as it is for comparative purposes, it would be important to provide a scaling factor applicable to be able to compare these data to other publications.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for his suggestion. However, for several reasons we did not correct for shrinkage caused by aldehyde fixation. There are papers by Eyre et al. (2007) and the mentioned paper by Korogod et al. 2015 that have demonstrated that cryo-fixation reveals larger numbers of docked synaptic vesicles, a smaller glial volume, and a less intimate glial coverage of synapses and blood vessels compared to chemical fixation. Other structural subelements such as active zone size and shape and the total number of synaptic vesicles remained unaffected. In two further publications Zhao et al. (2012a, b) investigating hippocampal mossy fiber boutons using cryo-fixation and substitutions came to similar results with respect to bouton and active zone size and number and diameter of synaptic vesicles compared to aldehyde-fixation as described by Rollenhagen et al. 2007 for the same nerve terminal. This was one of the reasons not correcting for shrinkage. In addition, all cited papers state that chemical fixation in general provides a much better ultrastructural preservation of tissue samples when compared with cryo-fixation and substitution where optimal preservation is only regional within a block of tissue and therefore less suitable for large-scale ultrastructural analyses as we performed.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Rollenhagen et al. offer a detailed description of layer 1 of the human neocortex. They use electron microscopy to assess the morphological parameters of presynaptic terminals, active zones, vesicle density/distribution, mitochondrial morphology, and astrocytic coverage. The data is collected from tissue from four patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. As the epileptic focus was localized in all patients to the hippocampus, the tissue examined in this manuscript is considered non-epileptic (access) tissue.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The quality of the electron microscopic images is very high, and the data is analyzed carefully. Data from human tissue is always precious and the authors here provide a detailed analysis using adequate approaches, and the data is clearly presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are very thankful to the reviewer upon his very positive comments about our data analysis and presentation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study provides only morphological details, these can be useful in the future when combined with functional assessments or computational approaches. The authors emphasize the importance of their findings on astrocytic coverage and suggest important implications for glutamate spillover. However, the percentage of synapses that form tripartite synapses has not been quantified, the authors' functional claims are based solely on volumetric fraction measurements.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for his critical comments on our findings concerning the layer-specific astrocytic coverage as also suggested by reviewer#2. As already stated above we will analyze the astrocytic coverage and the layer-specific percentage of astrocytic contribution to the ‘tripartite’ synapse in more detail. We are, however, a bit puzzled about the comment that structural anatomists usually receive that our study only provides morphological details. Our thorough analysis of structural and synaptic parameters of synaptic boutons underlie and might even predict the function of synaptic boutons in a given microcircuit or network and will thus very much improve our understanding and knowledge about the functional properties of these structures, in particular in the human brain where such studies are still quite rare. The main goal of our studies in the human neocortex was the quantitative morphology of synaptic boutons and thus the synaptic organization of the cortical column, layer by layer which to our knowledge is the first such detailed study undertaken in the human brain. Our efforts have set a golden standard in the analysis of synaptic boutons embedded in different microcircuits und is meanwhile internationally very well accepted.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The distinction between excitatory and inhibitory synapses is not clear, they should be analyzed separately.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As already stated above in response to reviewer#1 our study focused on excitatory synaptic boutons since they represent the majority of synapses. However, in the improved version of our manuscript in the Material and Method section we included a paragraph with structural criteria to distinguish excitatory from inhibitory terminals (see also our comment to reviewer#1 concerning this point) including appropriate citations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The text connects functional and morphological characteristics in a very direct way. For example, connecting plasticity to any measurement the authors present would be rather difficult without any additional functional experiments. References to various vesicle pools based on the location of the vesicles are also more complex than suggested in the manuscript. The text should better reflect the limitations of the conclusions that can be drawn from the authors' data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. However, it has been shown by meanwhile numerous publications that the shape and size of the active zone together with the pool of synaptic vesicles and the astrocytic coverage critically determines synaptic transmission and synaptic strength, but can also contribute to the modulation of synaptic plasticity (see also citations within the text). It has been shown that synaptic boutons can switch upon certain stimulation conditions to different modes of release (uni- vs. multiquantal, uni- vs multivesicular release) and from asynchronous to synchronous release leading also to the modulation of synaptic short- and long-term plasticity. To the second comment: When we started with our first paper about the Calyx of Held – principal neuron synapse in the MNTB (Sätzler et al. 2002) we tried to define a morphological correlate for the three functionally defined pools. As already mentioned above in our reply to the other two reviewers, this is rather difficult since synaptic vesicles are normally distributed over the entire nerve terminal. After long and thorough discussions with Bill Betz, Chuck Stevens and other leading scientist in the field of synaptic neuroscience, we together with Bert Sakmann tried to define a morphological correlate for the functionally defined pools using a perimeter analysis. We defined the readily releasable pool as vesicles 10 to 20 nm away from the presynaptic active zone, the recycling pool as those in 60-200 nm distance and the remaining as those belonging to the resting pool. However, it has been shown by capacitance measurements (see for example Hallermann et al 2003), FM1-43 investigations (see for example Henkel et al. 1996) and high-resolution electron microscopy (see for example Schikorski and Stevens 2001; Schikorski 2014) that our estimate of the RRP nearly perfectly matches with the functionally defined pools at hippocampal and cortical synapses (Silver et al. 2003). In addition, in one of our own papers (Rollenhagen et al. 2018) we also estimated the RP functionally from trains of EPSPs using an exponential fit analysis and came to similar results upon its size using the perimeter analysis.</p>
<p>Of course, as stated by the reviewer the scenario could be more complex, using other criteria but we never claimed that our morphologically defined pools are the truth but nothing as the truth but we believe it offers a quite good approximation.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>Avoid the numerous abbreviations in the abstract. The paragraph describing the results obtained in this study is too short. Include more results, such as the size of the active zone, the proportion of perforated synapses, the ratio of synapses terminating on dendrites/spines, the percentage of volume occupied by mitochondria, etc. In the last paragraph, compare the layer-specific data to other layers of the neocortex before writing the concluding sentence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To meet the word limits of the abstract (150 words) defined by eLife we had to use abbreviations. We followed the suggestions by the reviewer and expanded our abstract by adding the proportion of macular vs. perforated active zone and the percentage of mitochondria within an SB. However, we did not include the comparison of structural parameters in the Abstract since this is discussed thoroughly in the MS at other places (see Results and Discussion).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Results:</p>
<p>First of all, wonderful data! Lots of work, very valuable quantitative electron microscopy results.</p>
<p>Main concerns:</p>
<p>Adding several analyses would give much more information about the cortical synaptic organization. It would be very useful to differentiate between excitatory and inhibitory terminals (and give their ratio) and include this information in all different analyses, such as in the SV number, SV pool analysis, mitochondrion analysis, etc., that would give functional information as well. You have all the data for this, and you know how to differentiate between inhibitory and excitatory synapses, it can be done. We could see the possible morphological differences between excitatory and inhibitory synapses (maybe one is larger/has more SVs, etc. than the other). Based on these possible differences conclusions could be drawn about functional hypotheses, such as one or the other is more efficient in inducing postsynaptic potentials, excitation or inhibition is more pronounced in layer 1, etc. Furthermore, looking at the ratio of perforated synapses, we could gain information about the formation of new synapses. Maybe there is a difference between excitatory and inhibitory circuits in this point of view.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To the first point: Since our focus was on excitatory synaptic boutons as already stated in the title we have not analyzed inhibitory SBs. To do so, we have to re-analyze our complete data which is time-consuming and an additional workload. However, we can give a ratio excitatory vs. inhibitory synaptic boutons which was between 10-15% but with layer-specific differences. Our finding are in good agreement with a recent publication in Science by the Lichtman group (Shapson-Coe et al. 2024) and work by the DeFelipe group (Cano-Astorga et al. 2023, 2024) estimating the number of inhibitory boutons in different layers of the temporal lobe neocortex as we did by 10-15%. We included a small paragraph about inhibitory synapses, their percentage and included the citations in our Results section. Concerning the ratio between macular, non-perforated vs. perforated active zones we stated the majority of synaptic boutons were of the macular, non-perforated type (~75%; see improved version of the MS). If perforated, this was found predominantly on the postsynaptic site, but quite rare in L1 SBs. Since GABAergic terminals had only a small or no clearly visible PSD this would be hard to look at.</p>
<p>To the last point, it has been demonstrated that the number of dense core vesicles and their fusion with the presynaptic density could be a critical factor in the build-up of the active zone. In addition, the findings of the Geinismann group suggesting that perforated synapses are more efficient than non-perforated ones is nowadays very controversially discussed since other factors such as size of the active zone (see for example Matz et al. 2010; Holderith et al. 2012) and the astrocytic coverage contribute to synaptic efficacy and strength.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Related to this topic: although in the case of rat CA1 pyramidal cells all inhibitory synapses terminated on dendritic shafts (Megias et al., Neuroscience 2001), please be aware that both excitatory and inhibitory synapses can terminate on both dendritic shafts and spines in humans (inhibitory synapses are though rare on spines, usually less than 10%, but they do exist, see for example Wittner et al, Neuroscience, 2001). Please, define the excitatory/inhibitory nature of the synapses based on morphological features (not on their postsynaptic target), i.e., flattened vesicles and thin postsynaptic density for GABAergic synapses, whereas larger, round vesicles and thick postsynaptic density for glutamatergic synapses. Anyway, the ratio of excitatory and inhibitory synapses on dendrites and spines in the two sublamina would also give useful information about the synaptic organization of the human neocortical layer 1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are aware that not all terminals targeting on spines are excitatory, in turn it has been shown that not all terminals on shafts were inhibitory as long thought (Silver et al. 2003). However, as stated by the reviewer their abundancy on spines is rather low. At the moment it is rather unclear which functional impact inhibitory terminals on spines have, despite a local inhibition (see for example Kubota et al. eLife 2015), and thus their role is rather speculative since excitatory synapses are the predominant class on dendritic spines. As already stated above the ratio of excitatory vs. inhibitory terminals is between 10-15% and not significantly different between the two sublaminae. We are willing to add this in the results section (see in the improved version of the manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) About the glial coverage: Please, specify how glial elements were determined. What were the morphological features specific to astroglial processes? In Figure 5, how could we know whether the glial element marked by green is not a spine neck? The lack of morphological features specific to glial processes makes this analysis weak. The most accurate would be to make it with the aid of GFAP staining. I know this is not possible with your existing data, but at least, provide information on how glial processes were identified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used the criteria first described by Peters et al. (1991) and Ventura and Harris (1999) identifying astrocytic profiles by their irregular stellate shape, relatively clear cytoplasm, numerous glycogen granules and bundles of intermediate filaments. After more than 20 years of structural investigations, we hope that the reviewers will believe us that we can identify astrocytic processes at the high-resolution TEM level. In some of our publications (Rollenhagen et al. 2007; 2015; 2018; Yakoubi et al. 2019a) we have used glutamine synthetase pre-embedding immunhistochemistry to identify astrocytic processes, but a disadvantage of this method is the reduction of the ultrastructural preservation of the tissue. We have included the criteria to identify astrocytic processes of glial coverage in our manuscript together with the two citations (see improved version of the manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors state that the total number of SVs was very variable. How was the distribution of the number of SVs? Homogenous distribution suggests that different types of synapses cannot be distinguished based on their morphological features, whereas distribution with more than one peak would suggest that different types of synapses are present in L1, and that they can be differentiated by their appearance (number of SVs, for example). This might be also related to the type of synapse (i.e., excitatory or inhibitory). The same applies to the number of RP and resting pool SVs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To look for differences in structural and synaptic parameters that can further classify synaptic boutons we have performed a hierarchical cluster and multivariance analysis. However, it turned out that according to structural and functional parameters no further classification into subtypes could be done.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors should check and review extensively for improvements to the use of English. The Results and Discussion sections contain many sentences which are not easy to understand. They have either a too complicated structure, or they are incomplete and hard to follow. Few examples: &quot;The RRP/PreAZ at p20 nm criterium was on average 19.05 {plus minus} 17.23 SVs (L1a: 25.04 {plus minus} 21.09 SVs and L1b: 13.07 {plus minus} 13.87SVs) and thus nearly 2-fold larger for L1a.&quot; If you take out the parenthesis, the sentence has no meaning. &quot;The majority of SBs in L1 of the human TLN had a single at most three AZs that could be of the non-perforated macular or perforated type comparable with results for other layers in the human TLN but by ~1.5-fold larger than in rodent and non-human primates.&quot; Rephrase these types of sentences, please.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We partially agree with the reviewer. We have improved our manuscript by rephrasing and shortening sentences.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Other suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) Put the synaptic density part after the description of the neuronal and synaptic composition part, it is more logical this way (i.e., first qualitative description, the distinction between sublayers, then quantitative data). Please write down in the description of the neuronal and synaptic composition part how L1a and L1b were differentiated (see also my comment on Figure 1).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and did the change according to the suggestion. For a better understanding, we have also expanded the neuronal and synaptic description of the two sublaminae in L1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Introduce a list of abbreviations at the beginning, that would help.</p>

<p>It is quite unusual to provide a list of abbreviations in eLife. However, when used first the full meaning of the abbreviations is now given.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) What is cleft width? Usually, it refers to the distance between the pre- and the postsynaptic membrane, but here, I think it refers to the size (diameter) of the active zone. Please, clarify in the Result section (as it appears earlier than the Methods section, where it is explained). I would probably use the expression &quot;synaptic cleft size&quot; instead of &quot;synaptic cleft width&quot; to avoid misunderstanding.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and used synaptic cleft size for better clarity and have transferred the sentence from the Material and Methods to the Results section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The description of the different SVs (RRP, RP, etc.) is not clear in lines 236-242. What does it mean, that RRP vesicles are located {less than or equal to}10 nm and {less than or equal to}20 nm from the active zone? Explain, why the two different distance criteria were used. Furthermore, how were the vesicles located at p20-p60 defined? Why were these vesicles not considered in the determination of the different pools?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As stated in the public review to the reviewers concern we have tried to define a morphological correlate to the three functionally defined pools. After thorough discussions, with leading scientists in the field of synaptic neuroscience we have decided to use the distance of individual vesicles from the PreAZ and sort vesicles upon these criteria. One can argue that this approach is random, however, these distance criteria were described by Rizzoli and Betz (2004, 2005) and Denker and Rizzoli (2010). As also stated in the public review there is still a controversial discussion whether only docked or omega-shaped SVs constitute the RRP. We decided that also those very close within 10 and 20 nm away from the PreAZ, which is less than a SV diameter may also contribute to the RRP since it was shown that SVs are quite mobile.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Please, explain how the number of docked vesicles can be 3x larger in L1b, than the number of vesicles located at p10? Docked vesicles are the closest (with the membrane touching the PreAZ)... if this comes from the fact that another pool of boutons was used for the EM tomography analysis, then the entire pool of boutons analyzed, then it means that the selection of boutons for the EM tomography is highly biased. This also implies that EM tomography data are most probably not valid for the entire L1b. The difference might also come from the different ratios of dendrite/spine synapses included in the two different analyses. In this case, it would be helpful to distinguish between synapses terminating on dendrites/spines and analyse them separately (same as for inhibitory/excitatory, which is not exactly the same as dendrite/spine!). Different n numbers of synapses are given in the text (n=25, 25, 25 25) and in Table 2 (n=91, 98, 87, and 84) for the analysis of the docked vesicles, please, correct this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a correct value and thus there is a nearly 3-fold difference. The TEM tomography was carried out on the same blocks that have been used for our 3D-volume reconstructions. To carry out TEM tomography we had to use thicker sections (250 nm) to look for complete SBs as we also did in our serial sections, but of course, we could not quantify the same SBs. The completeness of SBs was one of our main criteria to reconstruct structural and synaptic parameters. The second was that the synaptic cleft was cut perpendicular. Only SBs that met these criteria were chosen for further quantitative analysis. In this respect we are of course biased in both methods.</p>
<p>Secondly, as already stated we did not quantify inhibitory terminals in serial sections. However, we did not find significant differences between shaft vs. spine synapses.</p>
<p>Finally, in Table 2 the total number of ‘docked’ SVs is given analyzed from the total number of SBs analyzed.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>The last sentence seems far-fetched, and unrelated to the manuscript. How mostly single active zone boutons can &quot;mediate, integrate and synchronize contextual and cross-modal information, enabling flexible and state-dependent processing of feedforward sensory inputs from other layers of the cortical column&quot;? Which of the anatomical findings of the manuscript led to these conclusions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to the review by Schuman et al. (2021) layer 1 is regarded as a layer that mediate, integrate and synchronize contextual and cross-modal information, enabling flexible and state-dependent processing of feedforward sensory inputs from other layers of the cortical column to which the structural quantitative 3D- models of SBs contribute since they are an integral element connecting neurons and building networks.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I am also puzzled by the authors' statement in more than one place of the manuscript that &quot;L1a can be characterized as a predominantly astrocytic sublamina&quot;. If the L1 contains the lowest measured volume ratio of glial processes (Figure 6), then this description does not seem to hold. Please rephrase.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is right and we rephrased the sentences for more clarity in the improved version of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Results:</p>
<p>The authors find large inter-patient variability in the synapse density at L1, which raises the issue of what were the criteria to include certain patients in the analyses. Apparently, these are different from the ones analysed in their previous papers, and all the provided parameters were different (sex, age, medication, onset of epilepsy), and any of them can result in altered synapse density.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>First, we have not used all patients for this study. Secondly, it was not possible to use all patients for all six layers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would be useful to add a panel for Figure 1 with synapse density across the different layers, as they provide this data in the Discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We implemented a Supplementary Table 1 with the synaptic density values over all layers compared in the Discussion.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would be nice to put the synapse density values into context by comparing them to e.g. mouse, rat, or monkey data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since we are working on the human temporal lobe neocortex we avoided to compare those data with those estimated in experimental animals. In addition as discussed by DeFelipe et al. (1999) different methods were used to quantify synaptic density in experimental animals so these results are difficult to compare.</p>

<p>Page 7 Line 164 &quot;GABAergic synapses identified by the smaller more spherical SVs&quot;. With this fixation condition, GABAergic vesicles are more ovoid than glutamatergic ones. What were the criteria to distinguish them?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To our knowledge in meanwhile numerous publications using the same fixation inhibitory terminals contain more spherical and smaller and not roundish synaptic vesicles and showed no clear prominent PSDs as described in our paper. We have addressed that more clearly in the results section of the improved version of the MS.</p>

<p>Page 8 line 197 &quot;The majority (~98%) of SBs in L1a and L1b had only a single (Figures 2C-E, 3A-C, E) at most two or three AZs&quot; is in striking contrast with the other statement from page 7 Line 163 &quot;Numerous SBs in both sublaminae were seen to establish either two or three synaptic contacts on the same spine or dendrite&quot;. Which of these statements is valid? Please provide exact quantification for this statement and decide which one is true.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is true that the majority of synaptic boutons had a single active zone. However, for example on a spine not only a single but also two or three SBs can be found. We have rephrased this sentence for more clarity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Page 9 Line 206 &quot;L1 AZs did not show a large variability in size as indicated by the low SD, CV, and variance (Table 1)&quot; Is this inter-patient variance of mean values? As in Supplementary Figure 1, both the SBs volume and PreAZ area show large variability in a given patient sample. Only the inter-patient variability of mean values seems low. Please state it clearly throughout the MS for other datasets as well.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Page 12 Line 295 how can the number of docked vesicles for L1b be larger than the one measured by the perimeter p10 nm? This later should contain the docked and PreAZ membrane proximal pool as well. This difference is even larger if we assume, that at EM tomography only partial AZs were analysed in a 200 nm thick section, not the entire AZ as for the perimeter measurement. Can the authors provide density estimates by dividing the docked / p10 nm vesicle numbers with the AZ area and comparing them?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a result comparing both methods. To the second concern: As stated in the text only synaptic boutons were the active zone can be followed from the beginning to its end and were the synaptic cleft was cut perpendicular were included in the TEM tomography sample as we also did in our 3D-volume reconstructions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Methods:</p>
<p>Page 25 Line 624 While the PSD area can be equivocally measured, due to the dense appearance of the PSD on the EM images, the PreAZ is more difficult to outline due to lack of evident anatomical markers except the synaptic cleft (the dense material is much thinner). That is why in many publications the PreAZ area is considered to be identical to the PSD area. What are the anatomical criteria used here for the PreAZ? Why do the authors correct the PSD area, which is easy to measure with the PreAZ area that is much less certain to outline?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As stated in material and Methods both the pre- and postsynaptic densities are not defined by placing a closed contour in both densities because one can’t be certain that the dense accumulation of particles defining both areas since the impregnation (staining) and contrast of both structures critically depends on the uranyl and lead staining which could led to misinterpretation due to different staining results. That’s why we have drawn a contour line from the beginning to the end of the presynaptic density and extrapolated that for the postsynaptic density (for details see Material and Methods). In our samples both the pre- and postsynaptic densities were always clearly visible in those boutons further analyze.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Page 26 Line 640 vesicle density measurement: All the synaptic vesicles that are in the 50 nm thick section in their entirety are missed, and there are methods based on EM tomography to correct these estimations. One can not assume, that the error caused by &quot;double counts&quot; of vesicles cancels for the lost ones. There are stereological methods to estimate both types of error please include them and correct the values.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to point out that the whole body of our work to structural analysis of vesicle pools is based on image data stemming from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) generating a projection of the entire volume of the ultra-thin section and NOT from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) where only a small volume close to the surface of the section would be captured. Operating in TEM mode ensures that no vesicle is missed only because it is embedded in its entirety in the section as postulated by the reviewer. Hence, EM tomography, which is basically a TEM operating from different incident angles in relation to the specimen or section, does not provide any advantage in detecting these vesicles. It does, however, help to better position a 3D object within the section volume itself and therefore allows to detect objects that could overlap from one viewing angle by using another angle. As the average vesicle diameter is of similar size compared to the section thickness, the possibility of a complete overlap to happen, however, is almost zero. And as we only count clear ring-like structures, a stereological correction factor calculated according to Abercrombie (1946) would underestimate real counts (see also Saetzler et al. 2002). If there is, however, relevant literature on &quot;methods based on EM tomography&quot; and &quot;stereological methods to estimate both types of error&quot; (over- and underestimates) that we are missing out on, we would appreciate the reviewer providing us with the corresponding references so that we can include such calculations in our paper.</p>
