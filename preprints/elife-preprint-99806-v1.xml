<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Objective</title>
<p>Complement biomarker analysis in ocular fluid samples from subjects with geographic atrophy (GA) in a Phase I/II clinical trial of subretinal AAV2 complement factor I (<italic>CFI</italic>; FI) gene therapy, PPY988 (formerly GT005), to understand target pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics. Clinical findings were subsequently utilized to investigate the therapeutic dose in an <italic>in vitro</italic> complement activation assay.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Design, setting and participants</title>
<p>Biomarker data were evaluated from 28 subjects in FOCUS, a Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of three ascending doses of PPY988.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Main outcomes and measures</title>
<p>Vitreous humor (VH), and aqueous humor (AH) from subjects before surgery and at serial timepoints (week 5 or 12, 36, 96) were evaluated for changes in levels of intact complement factors I, B and H (FI, FB, FH) components C3, C4, and C1q and breakdown products (Ba, C3a, C3b/iC3b, C4b) using validated assays and OLINK<sup>®</sup> proteomics.</p>
<p>A modified <italic>in vitro</italic> assay of complement activation modelling VH complement concentrations was used to compare PPY988 potency to the approved intravitreal C3 inhibitor pegcetacoplan (Apellis) and complement Factor H (FH).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>An average 2-fold increase in VH FI was observed post-treatment at week 36 and week 96. This correlated with a marked post-treatment reduction in VH concentration of the FB breakdown product Ba and Ba:FB ratio, but minimal changes in C3a and C3b/iC3b levels. Variable concordance in complement biomarker levels in VH versus AH suggest AH is not a reliable proxy for VH for complement activation. During the experimental comparison of doses, a 2-fold increase of FI achieved in the vitreous had only a minor effect on the complement amplification loop <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating limited impact [IC50: 1229nM]. Pegcetacoplan completely blocks C3a generation at concentrations much lower than the estimated trough level for monthly intravitreal injections [IC50: 2nM]. Supplementation with FH in the assay revealed similar potency to pegcetacoplan [IC50: 6nM].</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions and relevance</title>
<p>PPY988 subretinal gene therapy may not have provided sufficient FI protein to meaningfully modulate complement activation to slow GA growth. Reviewing VH biomarkers is important for understanding target expression, pathway engagement, and determining optimal dose, thereby informing future clinical development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness, particularly in developed countries. In the United States (US) alone, there are approximately 18 million individuals aged 40 and above with early-stage AMD, and 1.5 million with late-stage AMD, which includes geographic atrophy (GA) and/or neovascular AMD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. GA is a condition characterized by the progressive loss of photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and underlying choriocapillaris, resulting in a central scotoma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Reduced vision can significantly impact activities of daily living and quality of life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. There have been two recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies that inhibit complement activity, with a modest slowing of GA growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. However, they require life-long monthly or bimonthly intravitreal (IVT) injections and have so far exhibited limited functional efficacy that present challenges for long term compliance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Therefore, a one-time gene therapy that provides long-lasting efficacy equivalent to or better than repeated IVT therapies is a promising avenue for exploration.</p>
<p>One such gene therapy, called PPY998 (formerly GT005), is a subretinal gene therapy that supplements complement factor I (<italic>CFI</italic>; FI) protein in the retinal layers where atrophy occurs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. A Phase II study (HORIZON, NCT04566445) was initiated, however a decision to stop the PPY988 program was taken by Novartis based on a recommendation from the independent Data Monitoring Committee following an overall benefit-risk assessment of available data from the program studies. [Press release: Novartis AG; September 11th 2023,: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.novartis.com/news/gt005-ppy988-development-program-geographic-atrophy">https://www.novartis.com/news/gt005-ppy988-development-program-geographic-atrophy</ext-link>]. This raises important questions about whether <italic>CFI</italic> was sufficiently expressed after subretinal gene therapy, whether there was evidence of modulation of intraocular complement activity, or if this modulation was sufficient to potentially alter the disease course. Such information is crucial to the retina community, as there are many companies developing complement modulating therapies for AMD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Sharing the learnings from the PPY998 program would improve the risk-benefit analysis for these programs and help understand if new approaches differentiate from PPY998, justifying further clinical study of complement targets for GA.</p>
<p>The complement system, specifically the alternative pathway (AP), plays an important role in the development of AMD, and increasing local FI concentration could be a promising approach to regulate ocular complement activity. The AP is a part of the complement system that constantly surveys for foreign cells and debris and requires tight regulation to prevent inflammation and self-cell damage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Regulatory proteins like factor H (FH), decay-accelerating factor (DAF; CD55), membrane cofactor protein (MCP; CD46), complement receptor 1 (CR1; CD35), and FI help control the AP, with FI being the only regulatory enzyme <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. FI, expressed from the <italic>CFI</italic> gene, cleaves C3b by forming a trimolecular complex with cofactors FH for C3b, and MCP and CR1 for C3b and C4b <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that carriers of rare variants (RV) in <italic>CFI</italic> have increased risk of developing advanced AMD and more rapid disease progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. <italic>CFI</italic> RV can result in low levels of serum FI (Type I variants) or normal levels with functional impairment (Type II variants) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Research has also suggested that doubling serum FI levels may help control complement overactivation driven by other AMD risk genetic factors mapping to complement genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Based on these findings, clinical trials were conducted to explore the potential of sub-retinal delivery of AAV2-<italic>CFI</italic> as a gene therapy for treating dry AMD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The FOCUS study is a Phase I/II open-label study evaluating the safety, and dose response of three doses of PPY988 AAV2-<italic>CFI</italic> subretinal gene therapy in GA. To assess transgene pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, vitreous humor (VH) and aqueous humor (AH) samples were collected at baseline (BL) and four time points up to 96 weeks after dosing and were evaluated for exploratory complement biomarkers. This report shares findings regarding change from baseline in FI and complement protein levels and activation, over time after vitrectomy and PPY988 administration. Levels of FI achieved in VH from FOCUS subjects were then used in an <italic>in vitro</italic> simulated human vitreous complement activation assay, to gain insights on the therapeutic potencies of FI, C3 inhibitor pegcetacoplan (Syfovre, Apellis), and FH. We also offer critical learnings for other AMD complement gene therapy programs and a guide for future analyses of complement biomarker data in ocular samples.</p>

<p>The FOCUS study was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and all other local regulations, in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization E6 Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and with applicable local, state, and federal laws. Institutional review board or ethics committee approval was obtained, and the study was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (reference: NCT03846193) and EudraCT (reference: 2017-003712-39).

<title>Study design</title>
<p>FOCUS is an open-label first in human Phase I/II multicentre clinical trial to evaluate the safety, and dose response of PPY988 (AAV2-<italic>CFI)</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, administered as a single subretinal injection in subjects with GA secondary to AMD, followed for up to 240 weeks (5 years) post-dosing. Subjects were administered one of three doses to the study eye under local anaesthesia by a qualified vitreoretinal surgeon: 2E10 viral genome (vg; low), 5eE10 vg (medium) and 2E11 vg (high). At screening, a saliva sample was taken from subjects and extracted DNA was analysed for <italic>CFI</italic> RV using targeted next generation sequencing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Genotyping results were not required at screening if already available through participation in a previous Gyroscope sponsored study. The term ‘rare’ was defined as variants that changed the <italic>CFI</italic> coding sequence, had ≤1% minor allele frequency in GnomAD non-Finnish Europeans (V2.1.1, accessed <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org">http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org</ext-link>), and were previously associated with FI haploinsufficiency <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. A detailed description of study design, route of administration, dose, number of subjects, biomarker matrices, sampling timing and methodology are provided in Supplementary Methods and <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Complement protein and total protein quantification</title>
<p>AH and VH samples of subjects were taken on the treated eye immediately prior to subretinal surgery at baseline (BL) and at 5 or 12 weeks, 36, and 96 weeks post-treatment, as described in detail in <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Samples were rapidly frozen at −80 °C and transported frozen for analysis. Prior to analysis, samples were thawed and subjected to centrifugation at 17,000g for 10 minutes at 4°C.Samples were kept on ice during sample preparation.</p>
<p>Complement factors C2, C4b, C5, C5a, factor D, mannose binding lectin (MBL), FI, C1q, C3b/iC3b, C3, FH, FB and C4 were quantified in AH and VH using the MILLIPLEX Human Complement Panel 1 and 2 (cat. no.

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>All subject sample biomarker analyses were performed in R version 4.1.0. The analysis set consisted of all subjects who received subretinal delivery of PPY998 from cohorts 1 to 4 and had at least one non-missing biomarker assessment performed at BL and either week 36 or week 96. Given sparsity of data at week 5 and week 12, the data were combined, and the average value was used in instances where subjects had non-missing data from both visits. Concentrations values above the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) was set to ULOQ and values below the lower limit of detection (LOD) were set to LOD. Please see Supplementary Tables 3-4 for limits.</p>
<p>Significance testing for the change in protein level from BL to week 36 or week 96 were performed on the differences of log-transformed data with the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Means and standard error bars are shown in the respective figures. Correlations between VH and AH sampling, as well as between FI and other proteins, were summarized with the Spearman’s Rank correlation coefficient.

<title>VH modelling of complement activation reveals inferior potency of FI vs pegcetacoplan</title>
<p>By modelling the components of the VH based on median measurements of C3, FB, FH, FI (broad cohort measurements) and properdin (all measurements) at baseline in the FOCUS study, we compared the potency of FI, FH and the C3 inhibitor pegcetacoplan for their effectiveness in controlling the generation of C3a on an LPS-coated plate in a simulated ocular environment context (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). In this assay, C3 is directly activated by O-antigens on LPS thus triggering activation to drive the AP amplification loop. A wide range of FI, FH and pegcetacoplan concentrations were titrated through an artificial VH matrix so that comparisons could be made to clinically relevant levels of both FI and pegcetacoplan. Serum purified FI was revealed to be of similar potency to FI expressed from Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) manufactured PPY988 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). The trough level of pegcetacoplan at 27 days was estimated using injection dose and half-life information available on the Syfovre<sup>TM</sup> prescribing information datasheet. No diffusion data in human was available so this was not counted in the trough calculation. The concentration obtained was similar to that reported in the pegcetacoplan rabbit pharmacokinetics (PK) study and PK/PD prediction study published by Apellis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.

Overall curves generated by logistic regression revealed an IC50 of 1229 nM for FI, whilst FH [IC50: 6 nM] was similar in potency to pegcetacoplan [IC50: 2 nM]. The estimated vitreous trough level of pegcetacoplan was approximately 100-fold greater than that required for complete inhibition of the AP in this assay.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Gene therapy has been suggested as a promising treatment approach for slowing macular degeneration in GA secondary to AMD. This manuscript describes a comprehensive examination of the pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic properties of complement biomarkers in the context of the PPY988 GA subretinal gene therapy program and provides technical considerations for analyzing biomarker data from treated subjects. Despite the early termination of the clinical development program, the PPY988 study achieved notable milestones in the field, including the implementation of subretinal delivery of gene therapy for GA and the use of serial vitreous sampling. Herein, we present for the first time an analysis of VH complement biomarkers at baseline and after surgical delivery of a subretinal gene therapy. Baseline levels were similar to a previous study of VH complement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> with potentially confounding loss of total protein also observed in our study, highlighting the need to analyze data in the context of changing total protein levels post-vitrectomy. Our observations reveal consistent elevation of VH FI levels over a 96-week period, accompanied by reduced detection of the FB activation product Ba and ratios of Ba:FB, consistent with sustained modulation of complement AP activity in the vitreous humor compartment. These data confirm that AAV gene therapy has a consistent and lasting effect. Furthermore, although unpowered due to low N, the effects of FI gene therapy on complement breakdown product biomarker profiles (Ba (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) and C3b/iC3b (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>) appear to be comparable in both <italic>CFI</italic> RV positive and negative sub-populations, which is counter to the original hypothesis of a more dramatic effect in a sub-population with lower baseline FI levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, due to small sample size this finding should be interpreted with caution. Although the impact on C3 breakdown products was minimal at week 36, it became significant at week 96. Elevation of FI and modulation of the broader complement system was also observed in Olink proteomic profiling of VH samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>), supporting the complement biomarker findings in the validated panel. Elevated levels of FI were detected in both AH and VH. PPY988 efflux from the sub-retinal injection may have transduced cells in the anterior chamber of the eye resulting in an increase in AH FI concentration. However, the correlation of other complement biomarkers between VH and AH was inconsistent, in particular, Ba and C1q exhibited disparate post-treatment trends (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), indicating that AH alone may not be a reliable biomarker matrix for assessing the activity of complement biomarkers at the target tissues. This cautionary advice should be considered in context of previous reports, suggesting AH could be a broadly reliable proxy for VH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, albeit that only full length complement proteins were studied therein. To ensure quality control, protein level normalization was added to the analysis comparing biomarker levels before and after vitrectomy. Interestingly, the overall conclusions remained consistent regardless of protein adjustment, which strengthens confidence in the study’s findings. After determining the futility of the Phase II study (HORIZON, NCT04566445), an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay using clinically relevant levels of complement proteins was conducted to investigate a possible biomarker-related explanation. The results showed that pegcetacoplan had higher potency than FI in reducing C3 convertase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> suggesting that limited <italic>in-vitro</italic> potency of FI may have contributed to the lack of clinical success at Phase II. Although the translatability of the VH modelling assay to GA remains to be demonstrated, FI’s lower potency suggests that further increasing FI concentration on its own by gene therapy may not achieve clinically meaningful levels of C3 inhibition. It should however be noted that intravitreal pegcetacoplan will be at its highest concentration in the mid-vitreous whereas FI will most likely be at the highest level in the subretinal space where it is being produced. Hence directly comparing vitreous levels of each compound may underestimate the activity of FI compared with pegcetacoplan at the level of the subretinal space.</p>
<p>The lack of efficacy in the PPY988 Phase II study does not detract from the viability of complement activation as an effective target for intervention in GA, given the therapeutic effect observed for complement inhibitors pegcetacoplan and avacincaptad pegol (Izervay; Iveric Bio) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, and this study’s observation that pegcetacoplan achieves a much greater potency than FI <italic>in vitro</italic>. FI had a disproportionally larger effect upon Ba compared to C3a and C3b/iC3b, which may be due to the lability of C3a, differences in diffusion capabilities of the molecules from the retina, and possible contribution of C3 concentration from the choriocapillaris as well as biosynthesis by local immune cells. In addition, we hypothesize FI’s capacity to regulate the production of Ba without causing significant changes in the levels of C3b and C3a in the fluid phase could be contributed to by regulation of AP tickover, resulting from binding and activation of FB on water-hydrolysed C3 (C3H2O.) followed by release of Ba<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Similarly, the intravitreal administration of a neutralizing factor D Fab, which was found to be ineffective in Phase III trials for GA, was also able to reduce ocular Ba levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. However, it did not have a significant impact on the generation of VH C3 breakdown products. In this study, by week 96, there was an observed rise in the levels of full-length C3 and a corresponding decrease in the ratios of breakdown products to full length. While the specific implications of this change are uncertain, it potentially suggests a reduction in C3 consumption, which aligns with the known activity of FI, but this may be confounded with upregulated biosynthesis of C3 given its acute phase nature <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. C3 breakdown products only partially diffuse due to cell-surface adherence. Based on this understanding, we hypothesize that changes in C3 breakdown products may only become detectable when a certain threshold of modulation in tissue complement activity is reached. Overall, the data suggests that fully functional FI is being secreted into the VH, but the regulatory effects on the level of Ba may be representative of convertase formation in the VH and not the macula retina/RPE nor the choroid. To validate this hypothesis, one approach would be to conduct vitreal sampling using an effective drug targeting C3 for GA in a larger cohort. Further investigations are needed to gain a better understanding of these possibilities.</p>
<p>The study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. Firstly, the study did not include a control group, which means that the observed changes in complement biomarkers may not be solely attributed to transgene expression. Other factors, such as the impact of subretinal gene therapy administration triggering local inflammation or the effects of total vitrectomy on the protein environment, could also contribute to these changes. During the study, no significant safety concerns or adverse events were reported aside from dose-responsive incidents of RPE changes in the area of the subretinal injection. However, increased levels of antibodies to the vector and transgene were observed following treatment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. It is important to note that these antibody levels were transient and resolved shortly after treatment, indicating that the observed antibody responses were not persistent or associated with any significant clinical consequences. It is worth noting that the subjects included in this early clinical trial had more advanced disease compared to the typical clinical trial GA population which may impact the generalizability of the findings to the broader GA population. Additionally, the study had a relatively small sample size, which increases the risk of bias. Furthermore, the biomarker conclusions drawn from the study subjects may not be representative of the subjects treated in the subsequent Phase II study. Therefore, caution should be exercised when generalizing the findings to larger populations. Despite convincing and robust genetic links to AMD reported for Type I <italic>CFI</italic> variants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, this study observed no difference in biomarker response when comparing <italic>CFI</italic> RV carriers to the broad population. Interestingly, emerging data have revealed more modest ORs for <italic>CFI</italic> RVs in progression from early to late AMD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and macular thinning was observed in UK Biobank eyes of carriers &lt;60 years old <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Moreover, the long-term effects of complement therapy on the progression of GA are still uncertain. Another limitation to consider is the translatability of the <italic>in vitro</italic> VH modelling assay to the disease processes occurring in GA, and the relevance of the assay to cell-surface complement activation occurring in the area of GA. The LPS-coated surface used for the VH modelling assay would most likely result in more acute complement activation than in the GA retina. Finally, this is a relative potency assay and does not take into consideration the biodistribution of different modalities and routes of administration. Despite these limitations, the conclusions drawn from this study are compelling and hold significant implications for other gene therapy programs. The introduction of the innovative <italic>in vitro</italic> complement activation assay serves as a valuable benchmark for gene therapy programs.</p>
<p>The superior potency of FH compared to FI highlights the importance of conducting potency comparisons using <italic>in vitro</italic> assays that reflect physiologically relevant levels of complement proteins to guide decision-making. This finding opens promising avenues for further investigation, with potential for engineering of more active RCA protein truncates and chimeras including CR1, MCP, DAF and FH, FHRs. To advance gene therapy programs, future research should focus on building upon the pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic findings. It is crucial to establish tissue concentrations and estimates of the target required for complement modulation before moving into clinical stages. Pre-clinical assays that can be effectively translated to GA remain elusive. Overall, the role of complement in GA and the potential benefits of a safe one-time gene therapy in reducing AMD progression suggest the need for further clinical development of complement gene therapy.</p>

<title>Study design</title>
<p>FOCUS was conducted at 13 sites over two countries and was sponsored by Gyroscope Therapeutics, a Novartis company. Key inclusion criteria included a clinical diagnosis of GA secondary to AMD in the study eye as determined by a retinal specialist, and a diagnosis of AMD in the contralateral eye (except if subject was monocular). Study eye GA lesion(s) total size was ≥1.25mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc2">2</xref></sup> and ≤17.5mm<sup>2</sup> (cohort 1 to 6) or ≥1.25mm<sup>2</sup> (cohort 7), and GA lesions resided completely within the fundus autofluorescence (FAF) fundus image. Key exclusion criteria included presence of the following in the study eye; CNV, non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, glaucomatous optic neuropathy, or cataract. Subjects were also excluded if they had an active malignancy or a history of vitrectomy, sub-macular surgery, macular photocoagulation or previously receiving a gene or cell therapy in the study eye.</p>
<p>As outlined in <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, the study had four parts, part 1 (cohorts 1-3); dose escalation, Part 2 (cohort 4); dose expansion, Part 3 (cohorts 5-6); dose escalation with the Orbit Sub-retinal Delivery System (SDS), and Part 4 (cohort 7); dose-expansion with the Orbit SDS.</p>
<p>PPY988 gene therapy aimed to transduce RPE and PR cells, considered a key site for AMD pathology and FI production. Parts 1 and 2 (cohorts 1-4) delivered PPY988 via standard transvitreal subretinal injection (TVSI), previously used for subretinal gene therapy delivery <sup>1,2</sup>. The surgeon then performed the TVSI procedure involving a standard 3-port pars plana vitrectomy. The retina was partially detached through a cannula using buffered salt solution for bleb formation, and a fixed volume of 0.1mL containing the gene therapy dose was injected into the bleb, which was expected to flatten after 24 hours.</p>
<p>Subjects in Parts 3 and 5 (cohorts 5-7) received PPY988 subretinally via suprachoroidal cannulation using Orbit SDS, a 510(k) cleared device in the US (K200325, 14-Jul-2020, US FDA), developed to improve the safety profile of subretinal injections as compared with TVSI <sup>3</sup>. However, because VH samples were not collected in Parts 3 to 5, analysis of biomarker data from subjects treated in these cohorts is not discussed herein.</p>
<p>VH, AH and plasma samples were collected from cohort 1 to 4 subjects at BL prior to surgery, at weeks 12, 36 and 96 after dosing, except for sample collection at week 5 (not week 12) in cohorts 1 and 2, and AH (not VH) was collected for cohort 4 at Week 12.</p>
<p>Approximately 25 to 100µL of AH and VH samples were collected under microscopic visualization. AH samples were collected using a 30G needle attached to a 1mL syringe. The 30G needle was entered into the anterior chamber through the temporal limbus using a clear corneal approach. VH samples were collected at BL using a non-primed 23G vitrectomy probe connected to a 1mL syringe, and post-BL using a 30G needle through the <italic>pars plana</italic>. Immediately following collection VH and AH samples were transferred to a sterile collection vial and frozen at –80°C within 30 minutes.</p>
<p>All subjects were assessed for the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) at each follow-up visit and underwent functional visual and retinal imaging/anatomical assessments and biological sampling for safety and immunogenicity monitoring at periodic timepoints up to week 48, considered the primary endpoint timepoint of the study.</p>
<p>It was intended that subjects would be invited to consent to an additional long-term follow-up assessment until week 240 (5 years). At the time of Phase II study termination, FOCUS was fully enrolled. As a consequence of the early termination of the Phase II study, all ocular sampling in FOCUS from that point onward was terminated, and subjects who had not completed the study assessment window to week 48 were transferred onto a safety monitoring regimen.</p>

<title>Olink proteomics</title>
<p>VH samples from 17 subjects were analyzed using the OLINK<sup>®</sup> Target 96 platform (OLINK<sup>®</sup> Proteomics, Uppsala, Sweden) to identify broader pathway changes affected by subretinal delivery of PPY988. A single measurement was performed for each sample. The following 4 panels were assessed by Olink: inflammation and inflammation II, cardiometabolic and neurology. Protein levels were measured on a relative scale and presented as the normalized protein expression (NPX), which is an arbitrary unit on a log2 scale.. Principal component analysis was performed to detect outlier samples. Olink provides a limit of detection (LOD) for each protein based on the background noise generated in negative controls (buffer run as a normal sample). Nonetheless, the Olink protein expression data reported NPX values even for measurements below the LOD. Low abundance proteins were excluded from the statistical analyses. To identify the proteins changing over time relative to BL, a linear mixed effect model was used. The model included the following covariates: timepoint, subject age and sex, sample total protein content and <italic>CFI</italic> RV status (subject ID as random effect). All analyses were carried out using R version 4.2.3. Nominal p-values were adjusted using false discovery rate.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> FI potency comparability assay</title>
<p>HEK293 adherent cells with the <italic>CFI</italic> and <italic>CFH</italic> genes knocked out by CRISPR-Cas9 were transduced with PPY988 (AAV2-<italic>CFI</italic>) vector material produced under good manufacturing practice (GMP) at 10 different MOIs. After a 24-hour incubation (37°C at 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) with the vector, the media was replaced and left for a further 48 hours. Supernatants were collected and stored at −20°C. Supernatants were thawed, centrifuged (5000xG for 15 mins) then mixed with a fixed volume of human purified C3b and FH (A114 and A137, Comptech) and incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C. The mixture was then reduced and labelled by incubating for 5 minutes at 90°C with a mixture of DTT, SDS buffer and the LIF dye Chromeo P503 (30693, Sigma). A standard curve of Purified FI (Comptech, Tyler, TX) was made starting at a final concentration of 4000 ng/mL down to 11 ng/mL. This was diluted in non-transduced control sample media to ensure the same background matrix for both transduction supernatants samples and Purified FI standard curve samples. Proteins were separated by CE-SDS using LIF detection and an adapted version of a published method <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc4">4</xref></sup>. The areas of the peak corresponding 114 kDa alpha prime subunit (normalised to the 75 kDa beta subunit) are collected for both the Reference (Comptech Purified FI) and the Test sample (AAV2-<italic>CFI</italic> GMP). The depletion of the peak of interest is plotted using QuBAS 3.0 Statistical Software (Quantics Biostatistics) which performs a parallel line comparison of the Test compared to the reference and produces a Relative Potency value corresponding to this analysis. Outliers are statistically identified by a Grubbs Test and removed automatically from the analysis prior to calculating the Relative Potency.</p>

Mean +/- SE is shown by bars for all (black lines) broad (blue lines) and CFI RV (green lines) groups. Significant reductions in C3b/iC3b were observed at week 36 for both non-normalised (P=0.029) (A) but not total protein (TP) normalised (P=0.271) (B) data, and at week 96 for non-normalised (P=0.038) but not TP normalised (P=0.069) data. Notably these reductions are modest compared to for Ba modulation. (C,D) Ratios of C3b/iC3b:C3 concentration (Y-axis, ng/mL) were calculated for each subject at each sampling post-surgery week (X-axis). Mean +/- SE is shown by bars for all (black lines) broad (blue lines) and CFI RV (green lines) groups. No reductions were observed at week 36 for either non-normalised (P=0.173) (C) or TP normalised (P=0.588) (D) C3b/iC3b:C3 ratios. However, reductions were observed at week 96 for non-normalized (P=0.002) and TP normalized (P=0.012) C3b/iC3b:c3 ratios. Significance is defined as *P&lt;0.05; **P&lt;0.01, ***P&lt;0.001.

<title>FOCUS study overview.</title>
<p>FOCUS consisted of four parts of either PPY988 dose escalation or expansion, divided by seven cohorts varying according to route of gene therapy administration, dose (vg; viral genomes), and biomarker matrix. Only Parts 1 and 2 (cohorts 1 to 4) are described given subretinal gene therapy delivery permitted vitreous humour (VH) sampling. VH, aqueous humour (AH) and plasma biomarker samples were collected from subjects prior to surgery at baseline (BL), and subsequent timepoints up to week 96 post-treatment. Emerging data and analysis on cohorts 1 and 2 indicated week 5 sampling from the VH was too early to evaluate an impact post-vitrectomy, so the first post-treatment evaluation for cohorts 3 and 4 was moved to a later time-point in the study (week 12), when it was expected that the proteome would have stabilised, and the transduced cells achieved maximal expression.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study analyzed biomarker data from 28 subjects with geographic atrophy (GA) in a Phase I/II clinical trial of PPY988, a subretinal AAV2 complement factor I (CFI) gene therapy, to evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Post-treatment, a 2-fold increase in the vitreous humor (VH) FI was observed, correlating with a reduction in FB breakdown product Ba but minimal changes in other complement factors. The aqueous humor (AH) was found to be an unreliable proxy for VH in assessing complement activation. In vitro assays showed that the increase in FI had a minor effect on the complement amplification loop compared to the more potent C3 inhibitor pegcetacoplan. These findings suggest that PPY988 may not provide enough FI protein to effectively modulate complement activation and slow GA progression, highlighting the need for a thorough biomarker review to determine optimal dosing in future studies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript provides critical data on the efficacy of gene therapy for the eye, specifically introducing complement FI expression. It presents the results from a halted clinical trial, making sharing this data essential for understanding the outcomes of this gene therapy approach. The findings offer valuable insights and lessons for future gene therapy attempts in similar contexts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No particular weaknesses. The study was carefully performed and limitations are discussed.</p>
<p>I have just some concerns about the methodology used. The authors use the MILLIPLEX assays, which allow for multiplexed detection of complement proteins and they mention extensive validation. How are the measurements with this assay correlating with gold standard methods? Is the specificity and the expected normal ranges preserved with this assay? This also stands for the Olink assay. Some of the proteins are measured by both assay and/or by standard ELISA. How do these measurements correlate?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The results presented demonstrate that AAV2-CFI gene therapy delivers long-term and marginally higher FI protein in vitreous humor that results in a concomitant reduction in the FB activation product Ba. However, the lack of clinical efficacy in the phase I/II study, possibly due to lower in vitro potency when compared to currently approved pegcetacoplan, raises important considerations for the utility of this therapeutic approach. Despite the early termination of the PPY988 clinical development program, the study achieved significant milestones, including the implementation of subretinal gene therapy delivery in older adults, complement biomarker comparison between serial vitreous humor and aqueous humor samples and vitreous humor proteomic assessment via Olink.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Long-term augmentation of FI protein in vitreous humor over 96 weeks and reduction of FB breakdown product Ba in vitreous humor suggests modulation of the complement system. Developed a novel in vitro assay suggesting FI's ability to reduce C3 convertase activity is weaker than pegcetacoplan and FH and may suggest a higher dose of FI will be required for clinical efficacy. Warn of the poor correlation between vitreous humor and aqueous humor biomarkers and suggest aqueous humor may not be a reliable proxy for vitreous humor with regard to complement activation/inhibition studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The vitrectomy required for the subretinal route of administration causes a long-term loss of total protein and may influence the interpretation of complement biomarker results even with normalization. The modified in vitro assay of complement activation suggests a several hundred-fold increase in FI protein is required to significantly affect C3a levels. Interestingly, the in vitro assay demonstrates 100% inhibition of C3a with pegcetacoplan and FH therapeutics, but only a 50% reduction with FI even at the highest concentrations tested. This observation suggests FI may not be rate-limiting for negative complement regulation under the in vitro conditions tested and potentially in the eye. It is unclear if pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in aqueous humor and vitreous humor compartments are reliable predictors of FI level/activity after subretinal delivery AAV2-CFI gene therapy.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Hallam et al describes the analysis of various biomarkers in patients undergoing complement factor I supplementation treatment (PPY988 gene therapy) as part of the FOCUS Phase I/II clinical trial. The authors used validated methods (multiplexed assays and OLINK proteomics) for measuring multiple soluble complement proteins in the aqueous humour (AH) and vitreous humour (VH) of 28 patients over a series of time points, up to and including 96 weeks. Based on biomarker comparisons, the levels of FI synthesised by PPY988 were believed to be insufficient to achieve the desired level of complement inhibition. Subsequent comparative experiments showed that PPY988-delivered FI was much less efficacious than Pegceptacoplan (FDA-approved complement inhibitor under the name SYFORVE) when tested in an artificial VH matrix.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written with data clearly presented and appropriate statistics used for the analysis itself. It's great to see data from real clinical samples that can help support future studies and therapeutic design. The identification that complement biomarker levels present in the AH do not represent the levels found in the VH is an important finding for the field, given the number of complement-targeting therapies in development and the desperate need for good biomarkers for target engagement. This study also provides a wealth of baseline complement protein measurements in both human AH and VH (and companion measurements in plasma) that will prove useful for future studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Perhaps the conclusions drawn regarding the lack of observed efficacy are not fully justified. The authors focus on the hypothesis that not enough FI was synthesised in these patients receiving the PPY988 gene therapy, suggesting a delivery/transduction/expression issue. But beyond rare CFI genetic variants, most genetic associations with AMD imply that it is a FI-cofactor disease. A hypothesis supported by the authors' own experiments when they supplement their artificial VH matrix with FH and achieve a significantly greater breakdown of C3b than achieved with PPY988 treatment alone. Justification around doubling FI levels driving complement turnover refers to studies conducted in blood, which has an entirely different complement protein profile than VH. In Supplemental Table 5 we see there is approx. 10-fold more FH than FI (533ug/ml vs 50ug/ml respectively) so increasing FI levels will have a direct effect. Yet in Supplemental Table 3 we see there is more FI than FH in VH (608ng/ml vs 466ng/ml respectively). Therefore, adding more FI without more co-factors would have a very limited effect. Surely this demonstrates that the study was delivering the wrong payload, i.e. FI, which hit a natural ceiling of endogenous co-factors within the eye?</p>
