<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The corticostriatal circuits are critically involved in sensory, cognition, and the learning and control of actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aoki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Graybiel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Haber, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hikosaka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jin and Costa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kupferschmidt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Stephenson-Jones et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tanji, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yin and Knowlton, 2006</xref>). Dysfunctional corticostriatal circuitry has been implicated in numerous neurological and psychiatric diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Shepherd, 2013</xref>), including Parkinson’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Redgrave et al., 2010</xref>), autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Monteiro and Feng, 2017</xref>) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dalley and Robbins, 2017</xref>). The striatal direct and indirect pathways, made up of D1- vs. D2- expressing spiny projection neurons (SPNs) respectively, constitute the core components for basal ganglia functions in relation to action learning and movement control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Albin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">DeLong, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gerfen et al., 1990</xref>). Numerous studies have suggested that the two pathways play distinct yet complementary role in controlling actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Geddes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hikosaka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hikosaka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Markowitz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mink, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tecuapetla et al., 2016</xref>). It is well known that D1- and D2-SPNs are spatially intermixed in the striatum and they both receive major excitatory inputs from the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bolam et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">C.R. Gerfen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pan et al., 2010</xref>). Previous monosynaptic rabies tracing study has revealed that sensory and limbic cortical regions preferably send projections to D1-SPNs, compared to the motor cortical inputs biased toward D2-SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wall et al., 2013</xref>). However, this anatomical analysis was based on relative percentage of various inputs and does not reflect the absolute number of cortical projections. Furthermore, how the functional distinction between these two pathways is generated in the corticostriatal circuitry, and whether the striatal D1- and D2-SPNs receive the inputs from the same or different group of cortical neurons remain largely unknown. This is mainly due to the lack of appropriate tools to label and manipulate the specific cortical subpopulations projecting to D1- vs. D2-SPNs for functional investigations.</p>
<p>Here using a new G-deleted rabies system in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Klug et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Osakada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wall <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>), we are able to selectively target and express channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in presynaptic neurons projecting to D1- vs. D2-expressing SPNs. Whole-cell recordings from brain slice reveal that only one-third of the excitatory inputs to D1-SPNs target D2-SPNs, suggesting that many excitatory inputs to D1-SPNs selectively drive the direct pathway. In contrast, a large proportion of excitatory inputs to D2-SPNs send collateral projections to D1- SPNs, implying that excitatory inputs to D2-SPNs control both the indirect and direct pathways. Optogenetic stimulation of D1- vs. D2-SPN-projecting cortical neurons in vivo differently regulate locomotion, reinforcement learning and sequence behavior, in a cell-type and brain-region dependent manner. These results reveal the functional organization of cell-type- and pathway-specific corticostriatal subcircuits, and offer essential insights into how they might control behavior in health and disease.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A new modified rabies virus system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Klug <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Osakada <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wall <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>) was employed to label and functionally target the specific cortical neurons projecting to striatal D1- versus D2-SPNs. Specifically, D1- or A2a-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gong et al., 2007</xref>) were injected with Cre-dependent helper viruses (AAV5/EF1α-Flex-TVA-mCherry, AAV8/CA-Flex-RG) in the dorsal striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Klug <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wall <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>; see Materials and Methods). Three weeks later, either (EnvA) SAD-ΔG Rabies-GFP or (EnvA) SAD-ΔG Rabies-ChR2-mCherry was injected into the same striatal location to retrogradely infect the presynaptic cortical neurons projecting to D1- or D2-SPNs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). We first injected (EnvA) SAD-ΔG Rabies-GFP in a subgroup of mice to validate the corticostriatal anatomy. In both D1- and A2a- Cre tracing experiments, intensive labeling was found in different cortical regions as expected including the midcingulate cortex (MCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">van Heukelum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Vogt and Paxinos, 2014</xref>) and the primary motor cortex (M1), which targets mainly the dorsal medial and dorsal lateral striatum respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aoki <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bolam <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">C.R. Gerfen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pan <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Shepherd, 2013</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). For functional studies, (EnvA) SAD-ΔG Rabies-ChR2-mCherry was utilized to express ChR2 in the presynaptic cortical neurons projecting to D1- or D2-SPNs. To validate the functional expression of ChR2 in the cortex, whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed from the mCherry-positive layer V pyramidal neurons in M1 around day 7 post rabies injection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-G</xref>; see Materials and Methods). Both the current-voltage relationship revealed by somatic current injections (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>) and the spiking activity elicited by blue laser frequency stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1</xref>) confirmed the overall health and the functional expression of ChR2 in the rabies-infected cortical neurons. These results thus demonstrate that we were able to successfully target and functionally express ChR2 in presynaptic cortical neurons projecting to either striatal D1- or D2-SPNs.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of this rabies-ChR2 system, we first sought to determine how many functional excitatory inputs that the striatal D1- and D2-SPNs might share. The possible functional organization of excitatory inputs to D1- and D2-SPNs at the single cell level, like the corticostriatal projections, could be completely segregated, totally overlapping, or partially mixed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In order to differentiate these possibilities, we made whole-cell recordings from D1- or D2-SPNs in brain slice by optogenetic stimulation of rabies-ChR2-infected excitatory terminals in striatum. We asked what the probability is that a D1- or D2-SPN targeted by the same presynaptic excitatory inputs projecting to the nearby D1- or D2-SPN population. D1- or A2a-Cre mice were crossed to the D1- or D2-eGFP reporter line for visualizing striatal D1- vs. D2-SPNs in slice recordings (see Methods). Following the helper viruses and rabies-ChR2-mCherry injection in the D1-/A2a-Cre x D1-/D2-eGFP mice, the mCherry negative striatal SPNs were selected to be recorded in the whole-cell mode and D1- vs. D2-SPNs can be further separated based on the eGFP expression. Picrotoxin, a GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonist, was added throughout the recordings to isolate the excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). Following the blue laser stimulation of ChR2-positive presynaptic terminals in striatum, the short-latency (&lt; 10 ms) EPSCs recorded was considered as the direct excitatory inputs on D1- or D2-SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Klug <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kress et al., 2013</xref>), which can be blocked by glutamate antagonists NBQX/APV (see Methods).</p>

<p>Recordings from the mCherry-negative, non-starter striatal D1-SPNs in striatal D1-rabies-ChR2-infected mice revealed that with high probability (∼63%) a D1-SPN receives the inputs from the presynaptic excitatory neurons projecting to surrounding D1-SPNs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>). This is true from recordings in non-starter D1-SPNs identified both as mCherry (-) / eGFP (+) in D1-Cre x D1-eGFP mice and mCherry (-) / eGFP (-) in D1-Cre x D2-eGFP mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, D</xref>). Similarly, recordings from mCherry-negative non-starter striatal D2-SPNs in striatal D2-rabies-ChR2-tracing mice revealed that with a very high probability (∼79%) a D2-SPN receives the inputs from the presynaptic excitatory neurons project to surrounding D2-SPNs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>). Again, it is similar from recordings in non-starter D2-SPNs identified both as mCherry (-) / eGFP (+) in A2a-Cre x D2-eGFP mice and mCherry (-) / eGFP (-) in A2a-Cre x D1-eGFP mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>). However, recordings from striatal D2-SPNs in the striatal D1-rabies-ChR2-tracing mice revealed that the chance for a D2-SPN to receive excitatory inputs from the presynaptic neurons projecting to surrounding D1-SPNs is rather low (∼40%, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E, G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>). In contrast, recordings from striatal D1-SPNs in the striatal D2-rabies-ChR2-tracing mice revealed that the chance for a D1-SPN to receive the excitatory inputs from the presynaptic neurons projecting to surrounding D2-SPNs is remarkably high (∼73%, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F, G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>). These data unveil a complex picture including both parallel and crosstalk between the excitatory inputs to D1- and D2-SPNs. Notably, the likelihood that the input connectivity was significantly higher from the presynaptic excitatory inputs of D2-SPNs to D1-SPNs than from the presynaptic excitatory inputs of D1-SPNs to D2-SPNs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, G</xref>). Together these results suggest largely segregated yet asymmetrically overlapping excitatory projections to striatum where the majority of excitatory inputs to D1-SPNs only target the D1-SPNs, while most excitatory inputs to D2-SPNs target both D2- and D1-SPNs.</p>
<p>Based on this asymmetrically overlapping functional organization, one would predict that the excitatory inputs to D1-SPNs mostly control the striatal direct pathway, while the inputs to D2-SPNs would drive both the indirect and direct pathways (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). To test whether this is the case, we injected rabies-ChR2-mCherry into the dorsal striatum of D1- or A2a-Cre mice as before, and implanted optic fibers bilaterally in either MCC or M1 (see Methods). This allows us to selectively activate D1- or D2-SPN projecting neurons in MCC or M1 and determine the optogenetic effects on behavior. For comparison, we performed behavioral experiments by optogenetic stimulation of striatal D1- or D2-SPNs in dorsal medial (DMS) and dorsal lateral striatum (DLS), two areas that receive dense excitatory projections from MCC and M1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aoki <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Shepherd, 2013</xref>) (see Methods). Consistent with the previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kravitz <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), optogenetic stimulation (20Hz) of D1-SPNs in the DMS or DLS facilitated locomotion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, C, E, F</xref>). Conversely, optogenetic stimulation (20Hz) of D2-SPNs in DMS significantly suppressed locomotion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, D</xref>), which is less obvious in DLS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E, G</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Notably, high-frequency (20Hz) but not low-frequency (5Hz) optogenetic stimulation of MCC neurons that project to D1-SPNs significantly facilitated locomotion in the open field (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H, I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1</xref>), similar to D1-SPN activation in DMS. However, optogenetic stimulation (20Hz) of D2-SPN projecting MCC neurons in the same location did not alter locomotion in the open field (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H, J</xref>), in contrast with the effects of stimulation of D2-SPNs in DMS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Similarly, high-frequency optogenetic stimulation (20Hz) of M1 neurons that project to D1-SPNs facilitated locomotion in the open field (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K, L</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1</xref>), while 20Hz stimulation of the M1 neurons projecting to D2-SPNs did not significantly alter locomotion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K, M</xref>). Further control experiments employing the same optogenetic stimulation in the exact cortical locations but with ChR2 expression only in the striatum do not generate any behavioral phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3</xref>). It thus rules out the possibility that the behavioral effects observed by cortical stimulation in the rabies-ChR2 mice were triggered through direct striatal activation due to the light penetration into the striatum. These results are consistent with the functional connectivity in which the excitatory inputs to D1-SPNs mostly drive the direct pathway, and the inputs to D2-SPNs target both the indirect and direct pathways (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). It also suggests that the cortical neurons in the same cortical layer and spatial location could differently control actions depending on their striatal projection targets, in a pathway- and cell type-specific manner.</p>
<p>We next ask whether the cortical subpopulations projecting to striatal D1- vs. D2-SPNs could differently control action learning. We first performed experiments in the D1-Cre mice with viral expression of ChR2 in the striatum, and found that optogenetic stimulation of D1- SPNs robustly supported intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3N</xref>) in either DMS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3O</xref>) or DLS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3P</xref>). Conversely, optogenetic stimulation of D2-SPNs, either in DMS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3O</xref>) or DLS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3P</xref>), did not promote ICSS behavior. These data confirmed that the D1-SPN activation in both DMS and DLS drives action learning and ICSS, while D2-SPN stimulation does not strongly support ICSS behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kravitz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Vicente et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>We then test how the striatum-projecting cortical neurons in MCC or M1 would support ICSS behavior, and whether there is any difference between activation of the D1- vs. D2-SPN projecting cortical neurons. Similar to the effects of direct striatal D1-SPN stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3O, P</xref>), optogenetic stimulation of striatal D1-SPN projecting neurons was sufficient to support ICSS behavior both in MCC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3Q, R</xref>) and in M1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3Q, S</xref>). Notably, optogenetic stimulation of the cortical neurons projecting to D2-SPNs also significantly drove ICSS behavior, irrespective of whether it is in MCC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3R</xref>) or M1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3S</xref>). These data suggested that optogenetic activation of either D1- or D2-SPN projecting neurons in MCC or M1 could drive reinforcement learning and support ICSS behavior.</p>
<p>Corticostriatal circuitry is critical for action sequence learning and execution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Geddes <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hikosaka <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jin and Costa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tanji, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tecuapetla <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). In particular, striatal direct and indirect pathways have been suggested to play distinct roles in controlling learned action sequences, as D1-SPNs facilitate ongoing actions while D2-SPNs inhibit actions and mediate switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Geddes <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jin and Costa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tecuapetla <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). We thus ask how the D1- vs. D2- SPN projecting neurons in MCC and M1 regulate the learned action sequences. D1- or A2a-Cre mice injected with helper viruses were trained under fixed-ratio schedule, in which a fixed amount of eight (FR8) leads to reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Geddes <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jin and Costa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tecuapetla <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>; see Methods). Three weeks later, the trained animals were injected with (EnvA) SAD-ΔG Rabies-ChR2-mCherry virus in the dorsal striatum and optic fibers were bilaterally implanted in either MCC or M1 as before. Mice were continuously trained for a few more days to allow the rabies-mediated ChR2 expression before the optogenetic experiments start (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). High-frequency stimulation (20Hz) of the cortical neurons projecting to D1-SPNs or D2-SPNs was delivered upon the first lever press of the FR8 sequence in randomly chosen 50% trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Geddes <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tecuapetla <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, E, see</xref> Methods). Stimulation of MCC inputs to D1-SPNs facilitated lever pressing over the duration of the FR8 sequence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, D</xref>). Conversely, stimulation of MCC inputs to D2-SPNs slightly reduced the lever press rate over the stimulation period (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). The modulation effects on lever pressing rate were significantly different between optogenetic stimulation of D1- and D2- SPN projecting MCC neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). On the other hand, optogenetic activation of the M1 neurons that project to D1-SPNs facilitated lever pressing during sequence execution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F, H</xref>), similar to the effects of MCC stimulation. However, optogenetic stimulation of the M1 neurons projecting to D2-SPNs delivered an overall facilitation effect on lever pressing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G, H</xref>). Overall, stimulation of either D1- or D2-SPN projecting M1 neurons facilitated lever pressing in a similar degree (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). These results thus revealed the highly heterogeneous functions of corticostriatal subcircuits in controlling learned action sequences, depending on both the cortical region and their cell-type specific targets in striatum.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By taking advantage of a new monosynaptic rabies tracing with optogenetics system, we have discovered a significant degree of segregation between the excitatory inputs to striatal D1-vs. D2-SPNs. Notably, the results unveiled an overall asymmetric crosstalk from the excitatory inputs of D2-SPNs onto D1-SPNs, but not vice versa. Striatal D1- and D2-SPNs receive excitatory inputs from both the cortex and thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Klug <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wall <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Since the current techniques do not allow us to isolate the inputs from a specific region to D1- vs. D2- SPNs in slice recording, these results do not exclude the possibility that there might be certain cortical or thalamic regions targeting D1- and D2-SPNs equally or even with a reverse bias. However, the overall functional organization does imply that while the excitatory inputs to D1- SPNs in general drive the striatal direct pathway, the excitatory inputs to D2-SPNs control both the striatal direct and indirect pathways. Indeed, it has been recently reported that corticospinal neurons, which project to both spinal cord and DLS, form uneven synapses onto direct and indirect pathway neurons in the DLS and preferentially target at D1- other than D2-SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nelson et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, a series of in vivo optogenetic experiments in both MCC and M1 have further supported this notion, and demonstrated that the functionally heterogeneous corticostriatal neuronal subpopulations differently control actions, in both a cortical-region- and striatal-targeting-cell-type-specific manner. These <italic>in vivo</italic> functional findings in corticostriatal pathways are in consistent with the observations of <italic>in vitro</italic> synapse connection probability. Future studies should aim to further dissect the organization and function of pathway-specific thalamostriatal subcircuits, and determine whether they share the same principles of corticostriatal projections.</p>
<p>The cortical neurons projecting to striatum mainly consist of layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Klug <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wall <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>), including both the intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) types of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Shepherd, 2013</xref>). While some anatomical preference might exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lei et al., 2004</xref>), it has been found that both the striatal direct and indirect pathways receive functional inputs from both the IT and PT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ballion et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kress <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Our rabies-ChR2 tracing system allows us to further separate the cortical inputs to striatal D1- vs. D2-SPNs and selectively stimulate these specific cortical subpopulations during behavior and learning. These results have further revealed the diversity of corticostriatal cell subtypes and underscored their heterogeneous functions in behavior. Although the behavioral phenotypes of optogenetic stimulation of different cortical neuronal subpopulations are largely consistent with their functional connectivity with the striatal D1- vs. D2-SPNs, it does not necessarily suggest the observed effects were mediated completely by striatum but not through their collaterals targeting other brain regions or spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nelson <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Shepherd, 2013</xref>). In addition, it has been known that both striatal direct and indirect pathways receive inhibitory inputs from certain GABAergic interneurons in motor cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Melzer et al., 2017</xref>). In our behavioral experiments with optogenetic stimulation in the motor cortex, there might be possible contribution from these striatum-projecting cortical inhibitory neurons. However, given the nature of sparse distribution of the GABAergic interneurons in the cortex, it is unlikely that they dominate the observed behavioral phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Melzer <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, from the striatum point of view, the distinct behavior effect does strongly suggest that the specific information the direct vs. indirect pathway received from the cortex is somehow channeled, but at the same time, effectively coordinated by the cortex.</p>
<p>These results have important implications on how the corticostriatal circuitry controls actions in health and disease. The traditional model of the basal ganglia suggests that the direct and indirect pathways play opponent roles in facilitating and inhibiting action, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Albin <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">DeLong, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kravitz <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). More recent models of basal ganglia, however, propose that the direct pathway co-activates and cooperates with the indirect pathway with the former activating the selected action and the latter inhibiting the competing actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cui <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hikosaka <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mink, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tecuapetla <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Under more complicated behavior context, it has been previously reported that the striatal D1- and D2- SPNs are co-activated during the initiation of an action sequence, but become largely segregated during the sequence performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Geddes <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). More specifically, the various subpopulations of striatal D1- and D2-SPNs differently change their firing activity to support the start/stop of the sequence, the execution of the elemental actions, and the switch between subsequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Geddes <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). These previous findings thus suggested that the striatal direct and indirect pathways have to dynamically coordinate their activity throughout the performance of sequential actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Geddes <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hikosaka <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jin and Costa, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Markowitz <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tecuapetla <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>But how are the dynamically different activities in the striatal direct and indirect pathways generated in the circuitry? Both the striatal direct and indirect pathways are driven by the excitatory inputs from the cerebral cortex and thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bolam <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">C.R. Gerfen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pan <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wall <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). However, whether or not they receive the projections from the same presynaptic neurons, and how the input information is channeled into the two pathways for proper action control remain mostly unknown. The current study has revealed the largely segregated but asymmetrically overlapping organization of the cortical projections to striatal direct vs. indirect pathway. This specific corticostriatal organization provides a structural foundation for the striatal direct and indirect pathways to implement such a dynamic coordination of activity during sequence behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Geddes <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hikosaka <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hikosaka <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jin and Costa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Markowitz <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tanji, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tecuapetla <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). For instance, the dedicated cortical projections to striatal direct vs. indirect pathway are well suited for controlling sequence initiation and termination, where the activation of D1- and D2-SPNs is critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">DeLong, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Geddes <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, the overlapping cortical projections to both striatal direct and indirect pathways could be crucial for action switching, which requires proper coordination of the two pathways to inhibit current action and activate the upcoming one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">DeLong, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Geddes <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Our findings also predict that the striatal D1- vs. D2-SPN projecting neurons in the cerebral cortex would fire differently but activate in relation with each other during behavior. Future work should aim to understand how these two cortical subpopulations behave and coordinate to control the striatal direct and indirect pathways for action learning and selection in health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dalley and Robbins, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Geddes <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hikosaka <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mink, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Monteiro and Feng, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Redgrave <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Shepherd, 2013</xref>).</p>

Heterozygous Drd1-Cre (The Jackson Laboratory, stock # 030329, GENSAT: EY217) and Adora2a-Cre (The Jackson Laboratory, stock # 036158, GENSAT: KG139) mice were obtained from MMRRC and were backcrossed to C57Bl6/J mice, stock # 000664 (&gt; 9 generations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Madisen <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tecuapetla <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>).

<title>Surgery and viral injection</title>
<p>For G-deleted rabies-mediated retrograde tracing and functional determination (slice recordings) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>), all surgeries were performed under aseptic conditions with animals anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) / xylazine (10 mg/kg) while mounted on a stereotaxic device (Kopf Instruments; Tujunga, CA). The skull was leveled at bregma and lambda and a small hole was drilled at the coordinate (from bregma and midline) of AP + 0.5 mm, ML ±1.8mm. A Hamilton syringe (33-gauge needle) containing 1 µl freshly mixed AAV5/EF1α-Flex-TVA-mCherry (UNC Vector Core; Chapel Hill, NC) and AAV8/CA-Flex-RG (UNC Vector Core; Chapel Hill, NC) was slowly lowered to DV - 2.2 mm from the dura to target dorsal central striatum. The virus cocktail was injected slowly over ∼10 min, and the needle was left in place for ∼5 additional minutes afterwards. Then, the needle was slowly retracted over 5 minutes to reduce the virus from moving into the needle track. After injection, mice were sutured and returned to their home cage with ibuprofen (50 mg/kg/day) in their drinking water for the following four days. They were given three weeks to allow for maximal expression of helper viruses, before they were injected with 1.5 µl of (EnvA) SAD-ΔG Rabies-eGFP or 1.5 µl of (EnvA) SAD-ΔG Rabies-ChR2-mCherry (Salk Vector Core, La Jolla, CA) on an angle (18°) to avoid labeling any neurons in the initial injection tract in the same target region. Injecting locations were identical in D1-Cre and A2a-Cre animals. All the injections were done unilaterally for anatomical and slice physiology experiments, and bilaterally for behavioral experiments.</p>
<p>To prepare animals for optogenetic behavior experiments testing D1- or D2-SPN projecting cortical neurons, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% induction, 1-2% maintenance) and locally injected with bupivacaine to numb the incision site. The animals received bilateral injections of helper virus (TVA, RG) as before in dorsal striatum. After ∼21 days of pre-training and full body weight recovered (see Operant Conditioning), the skull was exposed again, and cleaned with 4% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and UV-light etched with Opti-Bond All-in-One (Kerr, Orange, CA). Then 1.5 µl (EnvA) SAD-ΔG Rabies-ChR2-mCherry was bilaterally injected in each hemisphere using the same coordinates as before. Then, custom made, polished optical fibers (200 µm diameter, 0.37 NA; Thor Labs, Newton, NJ) were implanted in input regions: MCC (AP +0.2 mm, ML ±0.8 mm for skull holes, fibers penetrate into brain at 17° angle off midline with traveling distance of 1.3mm, actual fiber tips target brain at AP +0.2 mm, ML ±0.4 mm, DV −1.2 mm) or M1 (AP +0.5 mm, ML ±1.2 mm, DV −0.5 mm). The fibers were secured with a light-curing composite (Tetric EvoFlow, Ivoclar Vivadent; Mississauga, ON). Finally, a layer of black dental cement (Lang Dental, Wheeling, IL) was added on the top of the previous cement to support and block laser light diffusion during stimulation. Animals were given ibuprofen in their drinking water for pain management during post-surgery recovery (4 days).</p>
<p>For striatal opto-ICSS and open field experiments, D1- or A2a-Cre mice were injected bilaterally with AAV5-EF1α-DIO-ChR2(H134R)-mCherry (Salk Vector Core, La Jolla, CA) in DMS (AP 0.5 mm, ML ±1.5 mm, DV −2.2 mm) or DLS (AP 0.5 mm, ML ±2.5 mm, DV −2.2 mm), and fiber optics were implanted ∼0.2 mm above the injection site. In control experiments for testing striatal activation by light penetration from cortical optic fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig S3</xref>), D1- or A2a- Cre mice were injected with AAV5-EF1α-DIO-ChR2(H134R)-mCherry bilaterally in DMS, and fiber optics were bilaterally implanted into M1 of the same coordinates as previously described.</p>

<title><italic>Ex vivo</italic> brain slice electrophysiology</title>
<p>4-8 days were allowed for expression and optimal cell health post unilateral (EnvA) SAD-ΔG Rabies-ChR2-mCherry injection before electrophysiology recordings on acute slice were carried out (Klug <italic>et al</italic>., 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and transcardially perfused with ∼20 mL ice-cold, bubbling (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) NMDG cutting solution [consisting of (in mM): NMDG 105, HCl 105, KCl 2.5, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 26, Glucose 25, Sodium L-Ascorbate 5, Sodium Pyruvate 3, Thiourea 2, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 10, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5, 300 mOsm, pH = 7.4]. The extracted brain was blocked coronally with a brain matrix (Zivic Instruments; Pittsburg, PA) and acute coronal slices (300 µm) were cut on a vibratome (VT1000S, Leica Microsystems; Buffalo Grove, IL) through the striatum in ice-cold, bubbling NMDG based cutting solution. Slices recovered for 15 minutes at 32 °C in bubbling NMDG cutting solution, then transferred to a holding chamber containing normal aCSF [consisting of (in mM): NaCl 125, KCl 2.5, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.25, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25, D-Glucose 12.5, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2, pH = 7.4, 295 mOsm] bubbling (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) at 28 °C. At least one hour after recovery, the slices were placed in the recording chamber, in which normal aCSF (33∼34 °C, bubbling with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/ 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) was perfused over the slices at ∼2 mL/min throughout recordings. Dorsal striatal SPNs were visualized under IR-DIC optics (Zeiss Axioskop2; Oberkocken, Germany) at 40x and D1- or D2-SPNs were confirmed by eGFP expression with brief observation in the epifluorescent channel. D1-SPNs (eGFP-positive in D1-eGFP mice, or eGFP-negative in D2-eGFP mice) or D2-SPNs (eGFP-positive in D2-eGFP mice, or eGFP- negative in D1-eGFP mice) that were ChR2-mCherry-negative, but in the injection site and surrounded by cells expressing ChR2-mCherry were targeted for recording. Only animals with high efficiency labeling throughout the cortex were used for recordings to determine collateralization.</p>
<p>Voltage clamp recordings were performed using 3-4 MΩ patch pipettes (WPI; Sarasota, FL), which were pulled from borosilicate glass on a P-97 pipette puller (Sutter Instruments; Novato, CA) and filled with a Cs<sup>+</sup> methanesulfonate based internal solution [consisting of (in mM): CsMeSO<sub>3</sub> 120, NaCl 5, TEA-Cl 10, HEPES 10, QX-314 5 EGTA 1.1, Mg-ATP 4, Na- GTP 0.3, pH = 7.2-7.3, 305 mOsm]. All cells were voltage clamped at −70 mV during recording. Five minutes post break-in, paired light pulses (473nm, 5-25 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, 2.5 ms, 50 ms ISI) were delivered through a glass fiber optic (200 µm in diameter, Thor Labs; Newton, NJ), positioned close to the recorded cell (50-150 µm), at 0.05 Hz using a 473 nm blue DPSS laser system (Laserglow Technologies, Toronto, ON). Light evoked currents were collected after at least 8-10 minutes of bath application 50 - 100 µM picrotoxin (MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO) to block any ChR2-mediated fast GABA<sub>A</sub>R transmission. Twenty sweeps were collected to determine latency and CV. At the end of experiments, both 10 µM NBQX (AMPAR antagonist) and 50 µM DL-APV (NMDAR antagonist) (MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO) were applied to block AMPAR and NMDAR-mediated transmission, respectively to confirm the EPSCs. Series resistance was initially compensated and monitored continuously throughout the experiment, and the data were rejected if the series resistance changed by more than 20% over the duration of the recording. A cell is considered connected if it has a detectable, reliable current (20 sweeps, 0.05 Hz) with onset latency less than 10 ms post laser-on (Klug <italic>et al</italic>., 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Voltage clamp recordings were digitized at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz.</p>
<p>For current clamp recordings of rabies-positive pyramidal neurons in the cortex, a potassium methanesulfonate based internal solution [(in mM): KMeSO<sub>4</sub> 135, KCl 5, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5, HEPES 5, EGTA 5, Mg-ATP 2, Na-GTP 0.3, (pH = 7.3, 305 mOsm)] was used. 750 ms current injections (−250 to 200 pA) were given to test the membrane potential response of rabies-ChR2 positive pyramidal neurons, in primary motor cortex layer 5, and followed by 20 Hz or 5 Hz optogenetic stimulation to test the response of these neurons to light. Current clamp recordings were filtered and digitized at 10 kHz. All recordings were performed using a Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices; Sunnyvale, CA), digitized with Digidata 1440 (Molecular Devices; Sunnyvale, CA) and collected with pClamp 9 software (Molecular Devices; Sunnyvale, CA). Data were analyzed with Clampfit 9.</p>

<title>Open field</title>
<p>After helper viruses’ injections in the striatum, animals were put back on food and allowed to recover and viral expression. They were then injected with (EnvA) SADΔG-ChR2-mCherry virus in the striatum and implanted with fiber optics in the MCC or M1 as described above (see Surgery and Viral Injection). Then animals were allowed to recover over 3 days. On the fourth day post injection and implantation, animals went through open field test. They were connected to fiber-optic leads (Doric) that connected to a laser through a commutator for free movement. An additional light shield was attached at fiber optic connection to the mouse to mask the laser light output. Following habituation to the fiber optic connections in a home cage the mice were placed in the middle of a 41cm x 41cm square, white and evenly illuminated open field chamber. Custom MEDPC code delivered 20 Hz or 5 Hz stimulation (473 nm blue laser, 5 mW power at connection to mouse, 10 ms pulse width) for 15 seconds after every 3 minutes and 45 seconds, and each animal received 3-4 replicates. Mice with AAV5-EF1α-DIO-ChR2(H134R)-mCherry injected bilaterally in DMS or DLS went through similar open field test after 4 days of recovery from surgery, with optic stimulation in DMS, DLS or M1. Video was collected for each run and analyzed in Ethovision 8.5. To analyze the open field data, the behavior was binned in 10-s bins and distance traveled during laser on period was normalized to the averaged distances during preceding 45 s just prior to stimulation onset.</p>

<title>Optogenetic intracranial self-stimulation (opto-ICSS)</title>
<p>In opto-ICSS experiments, two different subsets of animals were used: to stimulate D1- and D2-SPNs in DMS and DLS, or to stimulate D1- or D2-SPN projecting cortical neurons in MCC and M1, respectively. Mice that had never experienced the operant chamber were injected with virus and implanted with fiber optics using the procedure described above. From the fourth day following surgery, the mice received ICSS training for 9 consecutive days. They were attached to fiber-optic patch cords and placed in an operant chamber. Each session began with the illumination of a house light and the extension of two levers: one active (left) and one inactive (right). Every time the mouse pressed the active lever, a 20 Hz stimulation was triggered (473 nm blue laser, 5 mW power at connection to mouse, 10 ms pulse width, 1 s duration) targeting the cell bodies in MCC or M1 that project to D1- or D2-SPNs. Each session concludes after 90 minutes with the retraction of the levers and the house light turning off. Continuous pressing of the lever during stimulation will not lengthen the stimulation period. Pressing of the inactive lever had no consequence and was used as a control of general activity measure of non-contingent lever pressing. All protocols were custom written in MEDPC (Med Associates).</p>

<title>Sequence training and optogenetic stimulation</title>
<p>Prior to the injection of the rabies virus, animals were pre-trained for three weeks in fixed ratio 8 (FR8) or fixed ratio 4 (FR4) task (Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Briefly, animals were food-restricted (30 hrs) to start training and weighed daily to monitor their bodyweight. They were fed approximately 2-2.5 g regular chow/mouse/day after each behavioral training session concluded to maintain around 85% of their initial weight. Animals were trained in operant chambers (21.6 cm (L) x 17.8 cm (W) x 12.7 cm (H)) housed in a sound attenuating box (Med-Associates, St. Albans, VT) with two retractable levers to the left and right of a central food magazine and a house light (3 W, 24 V) opposite to the levers and magazine. Sucrose solution (15 µl, 10%) was delivered by a syringe pump into a metal bowl as a reinforcer. Magazine entries were recorded using an infrared beam break detector. Behavioral chambers were controlled by MED-PC IV software (MED Associates, VT) that recorded all timestamps of lever presses and magazine entries with a resolution of 10 ms.</p>
<p>Operant training began with continuous reinforcement (CRF) also known as fixed ratio 1 (FR1) in which animals received a reinforcer following each lever press. The animals were trained on CRF for both levers (separate flanking sessions) over three days and the order of lever presentation was counterbalanced. Each session began with the illumination of the house light and the extension of one lever. The session ended with the offset of the house light and retraction of the lever after 90 minutes of training or after a reinforcer cap was reached. On day 1, 2, 3, the mice could earn up to 10, 15, or 30 sucrose reinforcers, respectively. After the animals acquired CRF over 3 days, they were transitioned to FR4 and FR8 schedules on independent levers and the order counterbalanced. The session began with the illumination of the house light and the extension of either the left or right lever. Following four consecutive lever presses (FR4), mice received a reinforcer in a central magazine port. There was no time requirement for completion of the action sequence. The session concluded with the retraction of the lever and the offset of the house light after the mouse received either 80 reinforcers or 90 minutes expired. Another session was given just following the conclusion of the FR4 session, where eight consecutive lever presses (FR8) on the opposite lever resulted in the delivery of a sucrose reinforcer. The order of training FR4 or FR8 was randomly shuffled over 21 days pre-training. Left and right levers were randomly assigned FR4 or FR8 schedules and that set up was maintained for each animal over pre-training.</p>
<p>On the fourth day after rabies injection and fiber optic implant, and after open field test, the mice were food deprived for 24 hours to start optogenetic test in sequence tasks. On the fifth day, the animals were tethered to two fiber-optic patch cables attached to a commutator (Doric, Canada) to allow for free rotation and placed back in the original pre-training operant box. They were given three days of re-training in a session of FR4 on one lever and subsequent session of FR8 on the opposite lever with fiber attached (90-minute session, 80 reinforcers max). The order of the sessions was randomly shuffled. If the animals successfully completed 80 reinforcers, they were transitioned to optogenetic stimulation test session. On day 8 post rabies injection, optogenetic stimulations (20 Hz, 473 nm blue laser, 5 mW power at connection to mouse, 10 ms pulse width) were randomly delivered for 8 seconds (a time period covering roughly the entire lever press sequence) on the first press (defined by the first lever press after either head entry or 2-second break after the reward delivery) with a 50% likelihood of control non-stimulated trials randomly interleaved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Geddes <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Stimulus conditions were repeated on multiple days if needed to collect enough trials for statistics. On day 12 post rabies injection, the animals were perfused for histology analysis.</p>
<p>All sequence data were analyzed in MATLAB using custom scripts. To construct the peri-event time histograms (PETH), all lever presses before the reward (control or stimulation trials) were aligned to the first press of the FR4 or FR8 sequence, averaged in 100 ms bins, and filtered with a Gaussian low-pass filter (window size = 5, standard deviation = 5). All the PETHs were plotted with the first press omitted for illustration and comparison clarity. The effects of optogenetic modulation on press rate were qualitatively similar for FR4 and FR8 sequences and thus combined for statistics.</p>

<title>Histology and microscopy</title>
<p>Approximately twelve days following rabies injection or after behavior tests, mice were anesthetized with an overdose of ketamine/xylazine and transcardially perfused with 0.01 M PBS (30-40 mL) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/0.1 M PB, pH 7.4 (30-40 mL), with a peristaltic perfusion pump (Cole Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) (Klug <italic>et al</italic>., 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). The brain was carefully extracted and post-fixed in 4% PFA/0.1 M PB overnight (16-24 hrs), then transferred to 30% sucrose/0.1 M PB for 1-2 days until the brain equilibrated and sunk. On the day of cutting, it was coronally blocked with a brain matrix (Zivic Instruments; Pittsburg, PA) and mounted on a freezing microtome. Coronal slices were collected from the most rostral to the most caudal sites at 50 µm resolution in 96 well plates containing cryoprotectant (0.1 M phosphate buffer, ethylene glycol, glycerol) to maintain AP position. Brain slices surrounding the injection site and fiber implant site were mounted on super frost plus slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), counterstained for DAPI and cover slipped with Aqua-Poly/Mount mounting media (Polysciences, Inc; Warrington, PA). Slides were scanned on an automated slide scanner (Olympus VS120) at 10x in the blue and red channels. Images were batch converted to composite TIFFs and saved for image analysis.</p>

<p>Statistics were conducted in Graph Pad Prism 6.01 (La Jolla, CA). Fisher’s exact-test was used in comparing the likelihood of connections in slice recordings. Student unpaired two-tailed t-test was used in open field test and sequence operant task to analyze optogenetic stimulation effects. Non-parametric Mann Whitney U Test was conducted when distributions significantly deviated from normal distributions. Repeated measured two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test was used to analyze opto-ICSS learning data and comparison between different genotypes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The study by Klug et al. investigated the pathway specificity of corticostriatal projections, focusing on two cortical regions. Using a G-deleted rabies system in D1-Cre and A2a-Cre mice to retrogradely deliver channelrhodopsin to cortical inputs, the authors found that M1 and MCC inputs to direct and indirect pathway spiny projection neurons (SPNs) are both partially segregated and asymmetrically overlapping. In general, corticostriatal inputs that target indirect pathway SPNs are likely to also target direct pathway SPNs, while inputs targeting direct pathway SPNs are less likely to also target indirect pathway SPNs. Such asymmetric overlap of corticostriatal inputs has important implications for how the cortex itself may determine striatal output. Indeed, the authors provide behavioral evidence that optogenetic activation of M1 or MCC cortical neurons that send axons to either direct or indirect pathway SPNs can have opposite effects on locomotion and different effects on action sequence execution. The conclusions of this study add to our understanding of how cortical activity may influence striatal output and offer important new clues about basal ganglia function.</p>
<p>The conceptual conclusions of the manuscript are supported by the data, but the details of the magnitude of afferent overlap and causal role of asymmetric corticostriatal inputs on behavioral outcomes were not yet fully resolved.</p>
<p>After virally labeling either direct pathway (D1) or indirect pathway (D2) SPNs to optogenetically tag pathway-specific cortical inputs, the authors report that a much larger number of &quot;non-starter&quot; D2-SPNs from D2-SPN labeled mice responded to optogenetic stimulation in slices than &quot;non-starter&quot; D1 SPNs from D1-SPN labeled mice did. Without knowing the relative number of D1 or D2 SPN starters used to label cortical inputs, it is difficult to interpret the exact meaning of the lower number of responsive D2-SPNs in D1 labeled mice (where only ~63% of D1-SPNs themselves respond) compared to the relatively higher number of responsive D1-SPNs (and D2-SPNs) in D2 labeled mice. While relative differences in connectivity certainly suggest that some amount of asymmetric overlap of inputs exists, differences in infection efficiency and ensuing differences in detection sensitivity in slice experiments make determining the degree of asymmetry problematic.</p>
<p>It is also unclear if retrograde labeling of D1-SPN- vs D2-SPN- targeting afferents labels the same densities of cortical neurons. This gets to the point of specificity in the behavioral experiments. If the target-based labeling strategies used to introduce channelrhodopsin into specific SPN afferents label significantly different numbers of cortical neurons, might the difference in the relative numbers of optogenetically activated cortical neurons itself lead to behavioral differences?</p>
<p>In general, the manuscript would also benefit from more clarity about the statistical comparisons that were made and sample sizes used to reach their conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Klug et al. use monosynaptic rabies tracing of inputs to D1- vs D2-SPNs in the striatum to study how separate populations of cortical neurons project to D1- and D2-SPNs. They use rabies to express ChR2, then patch D1-or D2-SPNs to measure synaptic input. They report that cortical neurons labeled as D1-SPN-projecting preferentially project to D1-SPNs over D2-SPNs. In contrast, cortical neurons labeled as D2-SPN-projecting project equally to D1- and D2-SPNs. They go on to conduct pathway-specific behavioral stimulation experiments. They compare direct optogenetic stimulation of D1- or D2-SPNs to stimulation of MCC inputs to DMS and M1 inputs to DLS. In three different behavioral assays (open field, intra-cranial self-stimulation, and a fixed ratio 8 task), they show that stimulating MCC or M1 cortical inputs to D1-SPNs is similar to D1-SPN stimulation, but that stimulating MCC or M1 cortical inputs to D2-SPNs does not recapitulate the effects of D2-SPN stimulation (presumably because both D1- and D2-SPNs are being activated by these cortical inputs).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Showing these same effects in three distinct behaviors is strong. Overall, the functional verification of the consequences of the anatomy is very nice to see. It is a good choice to patch only from mCherry-negative non-starter cells in the striatum.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
One limitation is that all inputs to SPNs are expressing ChR2, so they cannot distinguish between different cortical subregions during patching experiments. Their results could arise because the same innervation patterns are repeated in many cortical subregions or because some subregions have preferential D1-SPN input while others do not. There are also some caveats with respect to the efficacy of rabies tracing. Although they only patch non-starter cells in the striatum, only 63% of D1-SPNs receive input from D1-SPN-projecting cortical neurons. It's hard to say whether this is &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low,&quot; but one question is how far from the starter cell region they are patching. Without this spatial indication of where the cells that are being patched are relative to the starter population, it is difficult to interpret if the cells being patched are receiving cortical inputs from the same neurons that are projecting to the starter population. Convergence of cortical inputs onto SPNs may vary with distance from the starter cell region quite dramatically, as other mapping studies of corticostriatal inputs have shown specialized local input regions can be defined based on cortical input patterns (Hintiryan et al., Nat Neurosci, 2016, Hunnicutt et al., eLife 2016, Peters et al., Nature, 2021). A caveat for the optogenetic behavioral experiments is that these optogenetic experiments did not include fluorophore-only controls. Another point of confusion is that other studies (Cui et al, J Neurosci, 2021) have reported that stimulation of D1-SPNs in DLS inhibits rather than promotes movement.</p>

<p>In the manuscript by Klug and colleagues, the investigators use a rabies virus-based methodology to explore potential differences in connectivity from cortical inputs to the dorsal striatum. They report that the connectivity from cortical inputs onto D1 and D2 MSNs differs in terms of their projections onto the opposing cell type, and use these data to infer that there are differences in cross-talk between cortical cells that project to D1 vs. D2 MSNs. Overall, this manuscript adds to the overall body of work indicating that there are differential functions of different striatal pathways which likely arise at least in part by differences in connectivity that have been difficult to resolve due to difficulty in isolating pathways within striatal connectivity and several interesting and provocative observations were reported. Several different methodologies are used, with partially convergent results, to support their main points.</p>
<p>However, I have significant technical concerns about the manuscript as presented that make it difficult for me to interpret the results of the experiments. My comments are below.</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>
There is generally a large caveat to the rabies studies performed here, which is that both TVA and the ChR2-expressing rabies virus have the same fluorophore. It is thus essentially impossible to determine how many starter cells there are, what the efficiency of tracing is, and which part of the striatum is being sampled in any given experiment. This is a major caveat given the spatial topography of the cortico-striatal projections. Furthermore, the authors make a point in the introduction about previous studies not having explored absolute numbers of inputs, yet this is not at all controlled in this study. It could be that their rabies virus simply replicates better in D1-MSNs than D2-MSNs. No quantifications are done, and these possibilities do not appear to have been considered. Without a greater standardization of the rabies experiments across conditions, it is difficult to interpret the results.</p>
<p>The authors claim using a few current clamp optical stimulation experiments that the cortical cells are healthy, but this result was far from comprehensive. For example, membrane resistance, capacitance, general excitability curves, etc are not reported. In Figure S2, some of the conditions look quite different (e.g., S2B, input D2-record D2, the method used yields quite different results that the authors write off as not different). Furthermore, these experiments do not consider the likely sickness and death that occurs in starter cells, as has been reported elsewhere. The health of cells in the circuit is overall a substantial concern that alone could invalidate a large portion, if not all, of the behavioral results. This is a major confound given those neurons are thought to play critical roles in the behaviors being studied. This is a major reason why first-generation rabies viruses have not been used in combination with behavior, but this significant caveat does not appear to have been considered, and controls e.g., uninfected animals, infected with AAV helpers, etc, were not included.</p>
<p>The overall purity (e.g., EnvA pseudotyping efficiency) of the RABV prep is not shown. If there was a virus that was not well EnvA-pseudotyped and thus could directly infect cortical (or other) inputs, it would degrade specificity.</p>
<p>While most of the study focuses on the cortical inputs, in slice recordings, inputs from the thalamus are not considered, yet likely contribute to the observed results. Related to this, in in vivo optogenetic experiments, technically, if the thalamic or other inputs to the dorsal striatum project to the cortex, their method will not only target cortical neurons but also terminals of other excitatory inputs. If this cannot be ruled it, stating that the authors are able to selectively activate the cortical inputs to one or the other population should be toned down.</p>
<p>The statements about specificity of connectivity are not well-founded. It may be that in the specific case where they are assessing outside of the area of injections, their conclusions may hold (e.g., excitatory inputs onto D2s have more inputs onto D1s than vice versa). However, how this relates to the actual site of injection is not clear. At face value, if such a connectivity exists, it would suggest that D1-MSNs receive substantially more overall excitatory inputs than D2s. It is thus possible that this observation would not hold over other spatial intervals. This was not explored and thus the conclusions are over-generalized. e.g., the distance from the area of red cells in the striatum to recordings was not quantified, what constituted a high level of cortical labeling was not quantified, etc. Without more rigorous quantification of what was being done, it is difficult to interpret the results.</p>
<p>The results in figure 3 are not well controlled. The authors show contrasting effects of optogenetic stimulation of D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs in the DMS and DLS, results which are largely consistent with the canon of basal ganglia function. However, when stimulating cortical inputs, stimulating the inputs from D1-MSNs gives the expected results (increased locomotion) while stimulating putative inputs to D2-MSNs had no effect. This is not the same as showing a decrease in locomotion - showing no effect here is not possible to interpret.</p>
<p>In light of their circuit model, the result showing that inputs to D2-MSNs drive ICSS is confusing. How can the authors account for the fact that these cells are not locomotor-activating, stimulation of their putative downstream cells (D2-MSNs) does not drive ICSS, yet the cortical inputs drive ICSS? Is the idea that these inputs somehow also drive D1s? If this is the case, how do D2s get activated, if all of the cortical inputs tested net activate D1s and not D2s? Same with the results in figure 4 - the inputs and putative downstream cells do not have the same effects. Given the potential caveats of differences in viral efficiency, spatial location of injections, and cellular toxicity, I cannot interpret these experiments.</p>
