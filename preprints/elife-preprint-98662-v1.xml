<title>Abstract</title><p>In response to central nervous system (CNS) injury, tissue resident immune cells such as microglia and circulating systemic neutrophils are often first responders. The degree to which these cells interact in response to CNS damage is poorly understood, and even less so, in the neural retina which poses a challenge for high resolution imaging in vivo. In this study, we deploy fluorescence adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) to study fluorescent microglia and neutrophils in mice. We simultaneously track immune cell dynamics using label-free phase-contrast AOSLO at micron-level resolution. Retinal lesions were induced with 488 nm light focused onto photoreceptor (PR) outer segments. These lesions focally ablated PRs, with minimal collateral damage to cells above and below the plane of focus. We used in vivo (AOSLO, SLO and OCT) imaging to reveal the natural history of the microglial and neutrophil response from minutes-to-months after injury. While microglia showed dynamic and progressive immune response with cells migrating into the injury locus within 1-day after injury, neutrophils were not recruited despite close proximity to vessels carrying neutrophils only microns away. Post-mortem confocal microscopy confirmed in vivo findings. This work illustrates that microglial activation does not recruit neutrophils in response to acute, focal loss of photoreceptors, a condition encountered in many retinal diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the mammalian retina, a rapid and coordinated immune response to infection or injury is important for maintaining tissue homeostasis. This is especially critical in the eye since mature retinal neurons do not typically regenerate, resulting in long-term functional losses for the host.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> The retina is considered immune-privileged and is equipped with a resident population of innate immune cells including microglia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> Under homeostatic conditions, microglia are distributed primarily in the inner retina, residing within nerve fiber layer (NFL), inner plexiform layer (IPL) and outer plexiform layers (OPL).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, generally avoiding the nuclear layers of the retina. Microglia tile the retina and like their counterparts in the brain, exhibit long, thin cellular processes that continually probe the neuro-glial microenvironment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to phagocytosing debris<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, regulating synaptic maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and removing dead tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, microglia can secrete chemokines to recruit other leukocytes to help fight infection and repair damaged tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> For a number of injuries, one of the first systemic responders recruited and activated by microglia are neutrophils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> Neutrophils comprise a large fraction of leukocytes in murine blood (7.4 – 33.9%, “young” C57BL/6J mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>). They assist in maintaining tissue homeostasis by neutralizing foreign agents, regulating the immune response, and processing dead tissue via phagocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Beyond these well-known functions, they are also implicated in becoming activated in conditions of shock and trauma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Under inflammatory conditions, the spatiotemporal interplay between microglia and neutrophils is poorly understood. A missed window of interaction is highly problematic in histological study where a single time point only reveals a snapshot of the temporally complex immune response, which changes dynamically over time. Here, we use in vivo imaging to overcome these constraints.</p>
<p>Documenting interactions between immune cells in the retina over time has been challenged by insufficient resolution and contrast to visualize single immune cells in the living eye. Recently, advances in AOSLO imaging have provided micron-level resolution and enhanced contrast for imaging individual immune cells in the retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, and do so without requiring extrinsic dyes. This is achieved by using near infrared (NIR) light, to which the eye is less sensitive, and combining this with phase-contrast approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. In addition, AOSLO provides multi-modal information from confocal reflectance, phase-contrast and fluorescence modalities, which can reveal a variety of cell types simultaneously in the living eye. Here, we used confocal AOSLO (&lt;6 µm axial resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>) to track changes in reflectance at cellular scale. Phase-contrast AOSLO provides detail on vascular wall, single blood cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, PR somata<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, highly translucent retinal cells, and is particularly suited to image resident and systemic immune cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> Simultaneous fluorescence imaging provides the ability to study fluorescently-labeled cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> and exogenous dyes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> throughout the living retina. These modalities used in combination have recently provided detailed images of the retinal response to a model of human uveitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> Together, these innovations now provide a platform to visualize, for the first time, the dynamic interplay between many immune cell types, each with a unique role in tissue inflammation. We combine these innovative modalities with conventional histology as well as commercial OCT to reveal the progressive nature of the cellular response to acute retinal injury.</p>
<p>As this work is in its early inception, we focus on one of many immune cell interactions, the interplay of two critical first responders to injury: neutrophils and microglia. To begin unraveling the complexities in this response, we examine the innate immune response to a deep retinal laser ablation model. Using AOSLO, we track and characterize the spatial, axial and temporal changes in microglia, neutrophils and retinal structure within hours, days and months after acute laser exposure.</p>

<title>Mice</title>
<p>All experiments herein were approved by the University Committee on Animal Resources (protocol #: UCAR-2010-052E) and according to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research as well as institutional approvals by the University of Rochester. C57BL/6J (#000664, Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME) mice were used to track the retinal phenotype after laser exposure.</p>
<p>Heterozygous CX3CR1-GFP (#005582, Jackson Labs) mice were used to track GFP-expressing microglia. Mice with heterozygous transgenic expression of tdTomato in neutrophils (“Catchup” mice) were provided by the foundry lab of M. Gunzer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> 18 mice (10 male, 8 female) in total were used for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging. 10 additional mice (5 male, 5 female) were used for <italic>ex vivo</italic> histology. Age for all mice used for this work were between post-natal weeks 6 - 24.</p>

<title>Preparation for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized with intra-perotineal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). The pupil was dilated with 1% tropicamide (Sandoz, Basel, Switzerland) and 2.5% phenylephrine (Akorn, Lake Forest, IL). A custom contact lens (1.5 mm base curve, 3.2 mm diameter, +10 diopter power, Advanced Vision Technologies, Lakewood, CO) was fitted to the eye. For a subset of experiments, 50 mg/kg fluorescein (AK-FLUOR, Akorn, Decatur, IL) was administered by intra-perotineal injection to confirm vascular integrity and perfusion status after injury. During AOSLO imaging, anesthesia was supplemented with 1% (v/v) isoflurane in oxygen and mice were maintained at 37°C via electric heat pad. Eye hydration was maintained throughout imaging with regular application of saline eye drops (Refresh tears, Allergan, Sydney, Australia) and lubricating eye gel (Genteal, Alcon Laboratories Inc. Fort Worth, TX) in combination with rigid contact lens described above. Mice were placed in a positioning frame with 6-degrees of freedom to allow for stable animal positioning and to aid in retinal navigation relative to the beam of the AOSLO and OCT.</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> AOSLO imaging</title>
<p>Four light sources were used for AOSLO imaging. A 904 nm diode source (12 µW, Qphotonics, Ann Harbor, MI) was used for wavefront sensing. A second 796 nm superluminescent diode (196 µW, Superlum, Cork, Ireland) was used for reflectance imaging, including confocal and phase contrast modes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> A third 488 nm light source (56 µW, Toptica Photonics, Farmington, NY) was used to visualize GFP-positive microglia in CX3CR1-GFP mice. A fourth 561 nm light source (95 µW, Toptica Photonics) was used to visualize tdTomato-positive neutrophils in Catchup mice. All light sources were fiber-coupled and were axially combined through the AOSLO system in a free-space design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Fast (15.4 kHz) and slow (25 Hz) scanners create a raster scan pattern, which is relayed through a series of afocal telescopes to and from the eye. A Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (consisting of a lenslet array and a Rolera XR camera, QImaging, Surrey, Canada) measures the aberrations of the eye and a 97 actuator deformable mirror (ALPAO, Montbonnot-Saint-Martin, France) provided the wavefront correction. Reflected 796 nm light was collected with a photomultiplier tube (H7422-50, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). All confocal reflectance images were captured with a 30 µm pinhole (1.3 Airy Disc Diameters, ADD). Phase-contrast was achieved by displacing the pinhole relative to the principal axis of the detection plane as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> Fluorescence was captured with a photomultiplier tube (H7422-40, Hamamatsu) either coupled with a 520Δ35 band-pass filter (FF01-520/35-25, Semrock, Rochester, NY) for GFP emission, or a 630Δ92 band-pass filter (FF01-630/92-25, Semrock) for tdTomato emission. All fluorescent images were captured with a confocal 50 µm pinhole (2.1 ADD). Image field sizes were either 4.98° x 3.95° or 2.39° x 1.94°. NIR and visible imaging channels were made coplanar, compensating for longitudinal chromatic aberration by independently focusing each light source so it projected onto the same axial structure in the retina. Through-focus acquisitions were acquired by sequentially changing the focus from nerve fiber layer through to the PR outer segments by using the defocus term on the custom adaptive optics control software. This strategy allowed depth imaging while keeping all visible and NIR sources conjugate to the same axial plane.</p>
<p>As described previously, red blood cell (RBC) imaging was achieved by combining phase-contrast imaging with a strategy to arrest the slow galvanometer scanner and let the resonant scanner project a single “line” on the retina. This enabled RBC flux imaging by positioning this line orthogonal to the direction of flow for single capillaries. As blood cells moved through capillaries, they were “self-scanned” producing images of RBCs in space/time images<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1b + f</xref>). Scan angle for this modality was 0.71°.</p>

<title>PR laser damage model and post-injury time points for imaging</title>
<p>488 nm light (Continuous wave Laser diode, ±4 nm bandwidth, Toptica Photonics) was used to create an acute laser injury. Laser light was projected through the AOSLO and focused onto the PR outer segments. To create damage, 785 µW of 488 nm light was focused onto the PR outer segments for 3 minutes in a single line on the retina subtending 24 x 1 µm to concentrate the power to a small focal region. Laser injuries were placed between 5-15° from the optic disc. To avoid absorption confounds, we avoided placing lesions beneath large retinal vessels. For experiments examining neutrophil involvement, lesions were placed less than ∼100 microns away from retinal veins and within microns of capillaries to increase the chance of extravasation through these preferred pathways in the retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. As many as four such lesions were placed per retina (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We chose to use the above protocol as an established way to create modest, consistent and reproducible outer retinal damage.</p>

<p>Throughout this work, we assessed the effects of the laser injury for the following time points: baseline/control, 1 day (defined as 18 – 28 hours post-damage), 3 days, 7 days and 2 months.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title><italic>In vivo</italic> SLO, and OCT imaging</title>
<p>To confirm global ocular health and changes imparted by the laser damage, a commercial Heidelberg Spectralis system (Heidelberg, Germany) was used to acquire scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. 30° and 55° fields were used for SLO acquisitions. The 30° field was used for OCT acquisitions. The wider imaging fields allowed for global views not only of damage locations, but also adjacent, non-damaged retina. For some experiments, fluorescein angiography was captured by imaging the retina within 10 minutes of fluorescein administration (details above). As an additional advantage, the fluorescence mode of the Spectralis enabled wide-field images of GFP positive microglia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>, right).</p>
<p>OCT was acquired with the following settings: ART 16 (automatic real-time tracking) was used to average B-scans to improve signal. To capture several damage locations in a single field, we used a coarse scan area (61 B-scans over a 1.02 x 0.85 mm window, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). A dense 3D data cube was also captured (513 x 171 µm, 49 progressive B-scans, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>) to provide the most detailed information regarding the axial nature of the laser damage. “Follow-up” mode, which allows HRA software to return to the same retinal location, was used whenever possible. To reveal the cross-sectional profile for each lesion, several adjacent B-scans were spatially averaged (∼30 µm).</p>

<title>Preparation for <italic>ex vivo</italic> imaging</title>
<p>Mice were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation followed by rapid cervical dislocation. Eyes were enucleated and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, diluted from: #15714-S, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, Pennsylvania) in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS, #806552, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) within 5 minutes of asphyxiation. Intact eye globes were left in PFA fix for one hour at room temperature. Eyes were dissected to remove the cornea, lens and vitreous. Each eye cup was placed in one well of a 24-well plate containing 0.5 ml of 0.8% PFA and left overnight at 4°C. The retina was separated from the retinal pigmented epithelium/choroid with attention to preserve inner retinal layers “up” orientation. If not applying antibody, the tissue was directly flat mounted (see below). For antibody staining, the retina was placed in 1x BD perm/wash buffer (#554723, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) with 5% donkey serum (#D9663, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in PBS for overnight incubation at room temperature with gentle shaking. The following was performed in the dark. Ly-6G-647 antibody (1:200, #127610, RRID:AB_1134159, BioLegend, San Diego, CA) and DAPI (1:500 of 10 mg/ml stock, #4083, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) were diluted in 1x perm/wash buffer and retinas were incubated for 3 days at room temperature with gentle shaking. Retinas were washed with PBS three times over three hours. The retina was cut into 4 radially symmetrical petals, flat-mounted on a glass slide in ∼40 µl of Vectashield mounting buffer (H-1000-10, Vector labs, Newark, CA) with a #1.5 cover slip (#260406, Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA), sealed with nail polish and stored at 4°C until imaged.</p>

<title>Endotoxin-Induced Uveitis protocol</title>
<p>To serve as a positive control and show evidence of known neutrophil invasion, we adopted the endotoxin-induced uveitis model to confirm that fluorescent neutrophils could be observed in vivo with AOSLO. This was performed in two mice. The endotoxin-induced uveitis model has been described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> Briefly, we performed intravitreal injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, #L4391, Sigma-Aldrich). Mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine. A 34 gauge Hamilton needle was used to deliver 1 µL (1 ng) of LPS diluted in PBS into the vitreous space posterior to the limbus. 1 day post-LPS injection, mice were either imaged with AOSLO (Catchup mice) or collected for <italic>ex vivo</italic> histology (Ly-6G-647 stained C57BL/6J mice) to confirm fluorescent neutrophil presence in the neural parenchyma.</p>

<title>Characterization of deep focal laser damage</title>
<p>Four complementary imaging modalities were used to evaluate the nature and localization of the focal laser damage induced by 488 nm light: wide field SLO, OCT, AOSLO and post-mortem histology. Each is reported in turn below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Laser damage induces focal hyperreflective lesions in outer retina imaged with wide-field SLO</title>
<p>To observe global and focal retinal health, we used commercial SLO. 1 day post-488 nm light exposure, both NIR and blue reflectance modalities showed hyperreflective lesions, most apparent at a deeper retinal focus position. When SLO focus was brought to the inner retina, lesions were not visible and retina appeared otherwise healthy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). Despite the deep retinal damage phenotype, fluorescein angiography did not reveal dye leakage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>, bottom), indicating the blood retinal barrier remained intact.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>OCT B-scans reveal outer retinal hyperreflection without inner retinal damage</title>
<p>To assist in determination of which retinal layers are damaged by the 488 nm laser, we used OCT. Within 30 minutes post-laser exposure, OCT revealed a zone of hyperreflection within the ONL (<xref rid="fig2-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1</xref>). 1 day post-lesion, the focal hyperreflection remained localized to the ONL (∼50 microns wide, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). With OCT, the retina laterally adjacent to damage foci appeared normal. The hyperreflective phenotype persisted through 7 days post-damage and was cleared by 2 months (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). There did not appear to be any cellular excavation, “cratering” or evidence of edema for any post-exposure time point assessed. Despite the axially localized hyperreflective phenotype, Bruch’s membrane appeared intact for all time points assessed. This was evidenced by lack of fluorescein leakage at the site of lesion. Additionally, retinal vessels appeared normal in OCT B-scans aligning with findings from fluorescein angiography, vascular perfusion and histology (discussed below).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3d">
<title>AOSLO reveals outer retinal damage with confocal and phase-contrast modalities</title>
<p>Confocal AOSLO provided micron-level detail of the lesioned area. Confirming OCT findings, we observed hyperreflective changes localized within the ONL that were, by 1 day, the brightest at the OPL/ONL interface, shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>. The AOSLO has an axial resolution near 6 µm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and thus evidence of retinal capillaries at the deepest vascular stratification acted as an axial landmark for the OPL. At this plane, the lesions manifest as an elliptical region with the long axis in the direction of the linescan used to create the lesion. Tracking this region over time, showed most prominent hyperreflectivity at 1 day post lesion, with diminishing size and brightness by day 3 and 7. The hyperreflective phenotype was largely diminished by 2 months post-exposure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>).</p>
<p>Using phase-contrast AOSLO also allowed visualization of translucent cells within the retina which enabled us to image PR somas of the ONL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Normally, the ONL is comprised of 8-12 PR somata that are axially stacked<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. We found that the dense packing of individual somata was disrupted 1 day post-exposure (∼50 µm ovoid, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>), suggesting degradation or ablation of the cell membrane.</p>

<title>Confirmation of outer retinal cell loss using post-mortem histology</title>
<p>To assess the extent of cell loss caused by focal laser exposure, we performed DAPI staining on whole-mount retinal tissue using the same time points assessed previously for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging. 1 day after laser exposure, we observed mild thickening of the ONL compared to unexposed locations only microns away. At 3 and 7 days, local ONL thinning was observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). En-face planes at multiple layers within the ONL revealed a loss of PR nuclei in the outer aspect of the ONL for 3 and 7 day time points (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). The inner ONL exhibited little evidence of cell loss (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>), illustrating the precise axial confinement of the laser damage being induced by this method. By 2 months, the lesion’s overall appearance and ONL thickness returned to baseline (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a-c</xref>). This histological finding corroborates the OCT findings observed <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>ONL nuclear counts were reduced at locations of laser exposure. In comparison to control locations (501317 nuclei/mm<sup>2</sup> ± 46198 nuclei/mm<sup>2</sup>, mean ±SD, similar to previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>), at 3 and 7 days post-exposure, we found a corresponding reduction in the density of ONL nuclei of 18% (408965 nuclei/mm<sup>2</sup> ± 25621 nuclei/mm<sup>2</sup>) and 27% (367542 nuclei/mm<sup>2</sup> ± 9038 nuclei/mm<sup>2</sup>) respectively. Calculated in comparison to control locations, the 3 and 7 day data resulted in p-values of 0.17 and 0.07, respectively (Student’s, paired two-tailed, t-test). 2 months after damage, PR nuclear densities were indistinguishable from that of control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>, gray bars). Despite losses of PR nuclei, total cell nuclei within the INL remained unchanged for all time points (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>, black bars). These data indicate that the laser exposure focally ablated PR’s whilst leaving inner retinal cells intact.</p>

<title>Retinal vasculature unaffected by deep retinal lesion</title>
<p>A concern with laser lesions of this type is that it may coagulate large vessels or capillaries. Motion contrast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> images revealed that the vasculature remained perfused from hours to months after laser damage suggesting that acute or long term changes are not imparted by the laser injury (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). None of the primary vascular stratifications within the NFL, IPL and OPL of the mouse retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> showed stopped flow as a result of the laser lesion, reinforcing the findings above regarding the axial confinement of the damage to the outer retina.</p>

<p>In addition to perfusion status, phase-contrast AOSLO also permitted analysis of single blood cell flux within capillaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. We tracked capillary flux at different retinal depths within and above damage sites (IPL, OPL, 1 capillary each, <xref rid="fig4-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1a</xref>). Blood cell flux for capillaries within lesion locations were within the range of normal flux for the C57BL/6J mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> (Figure 4 – figure supplement 2b, c). Flux tracked from hours to days in these capillaries changed synchronously, displaying positive linear correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.59, <xref rid="fig4-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1c, d</xref>). This suggested any such changes in flux were a property of systemic perfusion, rather than locally imparted changes in flow due to the lesion. As an additional control, we evaluated blood flux in two distant capillaries; one located 10-15° temporal of the optic disc (lesion location) and another of equivalent eccentricity on the nasal side (control, <xref rid="fig4-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1e</xref>). Both capillaries displayed similar flux values from minutes to 2 months post-injury (<xref rid="fig4-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1f, g</xref>) resulting in positive linear correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.78, <xref rid="fig4-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1h</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest lesions do not rupture or stall blood flow in capillaries, nor do they appreciably impact total RBC delivery in the capillary network.</p>

<title>PR laser injury promotes a robust response in nearby microglia</title>
<p>To observe the microglial response to PR laser injury, we imaged fluorescent microglia in CX3CR1-GFP mice with both SLO and AOSLO. 1 day after injury, SLO revealed bright, focal congregations of microglia at injury locations. This was in contrast to undamaged locations which maintained a distribution resembling lateral tiling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a, b</xref>). The global visualization of microglia was augmented by high resolution fluorescence AOSLO, providing enhanced detail of the microglial response to laser injury, especially cellular process detail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup><sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Whereas AOSLO imaging of microglia in the healthy retina displayed a distributed array of microglia with ramified processes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>, left), laser damaged locations showed a congregation of cells 1 day post-injury with less lateral ramification (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>, right). Within hours of the laser exposure, we did not observe a photo-bleaching or death of regional microglia suggesting that while the laser exposure was sufficient to damage PR’s, it left inner retinal microglia intact.</p>

<p>A standing question in OCT/confocal AOSLO interpretation is whether microglia contribute or directly produce the hyperreflective phenotype seen in axial B-scans and en-face fundus images<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. With confocal AOSLO, we find that the hyperreflective phenotype is visible as early as 30 minutes and becomes slightly larger and brighter by 90 minutes. During these time points, simultaneously imaged microglia remained ramified and maintained a tiled arrangement, indicating that microglial are not the initial source of the lesion-induced hyperreflective appearance (<xref rid="fig6-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>We returned to the same laser-damaged locations to capture microglial appearance at baseline, 1, 3, 7 day and 2 month time points with AOSLO to track the natural history of the microglial response to PR damage. At 1 day post-injury, damage locations displayed aggregations of microglia. The surrounding microglia displayed process polarization with extensions projecting toward the injury (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). By days 3 and 7, microglia exhibited fewer lateral projections and somas have migrated into the ONL where they do not normally reside (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). By 2 months post-injury, the hyperreflective phenotype was absent and microglia once again occupied only the inner retina. The axial and lateral microglial distribution at 2 months after lesion was similar to baseline (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Additionally, cell morphology once again showed radially symmetrical branching projections, similar to those prior to laser injury.</p>

<title>Despite robust microglial involvement, neutrophils do not extravasate</title>

<p><italic>In vivo</italic> fluorescence imaging allowed us to track neutrophils with AOSLO in “Catchup” mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.

This provided evidence that neutrophils could be directly observed in vivo, where they are moving at exceptionally fast speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.

There was also a notable lack of rolling/crawling neutrophils (or any putative leukocyte) in large arterioles or venules surrounding the injury (Figure 8 – video 1). The deepest retinal neutrophils, closest to the ONL lesion, were occasionally detected within the deepest retinal capillaries. However, these neutrophils stayed within the retinal vasculature, as evidenced by their pill-shaped morphology and passage routes that follow the known vascular paths seen in confocal/phase contrast imaging (Figure 8 – video 2). Just like healthy mice, leukocytes, including neutrophils often impede flow due to their large size (13.7 µm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>) as they must compress through capillaries &lt;7 µm in diameter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>.

By 3 days, microglial processes and somas were found to migrate deeper, now with processes extending into the distal portions of the PR cells including the inner/outer segments. By two months microglial processes and somas had retreated out of the ONL.</p>
<p>The DAPI nuclear stain combined with confocal microscopy not only helped us discern retinal neurons, but also allowed us to differentiate between microglia and phagocytosed PR’s. Two features were different from PR and microglial nuclei. First, whereas PR’s displayed a uniform, homogeneous nuclear fluorescence, microglial nuclei showed a mottled, and heterogenous DAPI appearance (<xref rid="fig9-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 9 - figure supplement 2a</xref>). Second, microglia nuclei were nearly 3x larger in volume compared to healthy and damaged PR nuclei. Microglia had nuclear volume of 110 ± 42 µm<sup>3</sup> and PR nuclei were 35 ± 5 µm<sup>3</sup> (p &lt; 0.001, <xref rid="fig9-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 9 – figure supplement 2b</xref>). PR nuclei within microglial phagosomes displayed similar nuclear volume compared to adjacent PR’s in undamaged locations (<xref rid="fig9-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 9 – figure supplement 2a</xref>).</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In many retinal diseases, resident microglial populations are found to exhibit cross-talk with systemic immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The complex temporal dynamics between resident and systemic immune cells unfolds from seconds-to-months and has been poorly characterized due to lack of resolution, sufficient contrast and a non-destructive imaging approach that can track changes over time. Here, our engineering advance overcomes these limitations by using phase-contrast and fluorescent imaging with adaptive optics to visualize the interaction of multiple cell types. With this advanced imaging technology, we reveal the absence of neutrophil involvement in response to an acute injury, despite progressive changes in microglial activity and morphology. Here we discuss the implications of such findings in the context of retinal damage and more broadly, to retinal disease.</p>

<title>Focal retinal lesions for tracking the immune response</title>
<p>Light damage offers a number of advantages for creating acute damage in the retina. It offers placement precision that is better controlled than other acute and invasive methods, such as incision/poke injuries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, retinal detachment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> and chemical injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. In the mouse, focal light dosage comes with greater axial confinement within the retina by nature of the high numerical aperture of the mouse eye<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> which imposes minimal collateral damage to layers above or below the plane of focus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). The laser exposure protocol employed here was highly reproducible as ∼95% of light exposures resulted in retinal damage of similar size and hyperreflective phenotype.</p>
<p>Seminal studies in the brain have used focal light exposure to induce acute microglial response to targeted areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> Since then, it has been a popular damage model. Focal lesions in the retina have been conducted in a number of popular animal models including mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, macaque<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> and cats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> Laser damage is also clinically relevant as it is both experienced with accidental laser exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> as well as purposeful ablation used in photocoagulation and as a therapy for retinal ischemic disease, retinopathy of prematurity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> and diabetic retinopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Thus our results shed light toward the immune response that may be imparted due to phototoxic damage. More widely however, this approach may be considered when investigating how native microglia may signal to the systemic immune system in response to any acute injury or chronic photoreceptor loss in aging/diseased retinas.</p>

<title>Titration of the 488 nm laser leads to mild retinal damage</title>
<p>While it is beyond the scope of this report to catalog the vast parameter space in which light may impose damage in the retina, it is noteworthy to discuss that the exposure intensity, subtended angle and duration of the CW light source we used delivered an intentionally mild damage to the retina. Using dosages too high would run the risk of collateral damage to the blood retinal barrier or Bruch’s membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> which could cause a choroidal neovascularization phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Either of these would be undesirable for studying the native/systemic immune response as it would potentially confound the traditional extravasation pathways of the inflammatory system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. Instead, we chose our laser exposure condition to impart a weak, but reproducible loss in photoreceptors while minimizing collateral damage to the cells above and below the plane of focus.</p>
<p>With OCT, we see the primary damage phenotype localized to the OPL/ONL bands (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) with visibly undetectable change in the anatomy of the inner retina. Histology corroborated this finding since the only layer showing quantifiable cell loss was the photoreceptor layer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Progressive PR loss and morphology of the lesion tracked over time</title>
<p>The amount of light we delivered did not immediately ablate photoreceptors as the peak cell loss wasn’t observed until 3-7 days after laser exposure suggesting a progressive damage phenotype of apoptosis or necroptotic death rather than direct ablation. Histology showed a ∼27% reduction in PR nuclei 7 days post lesion. The total number of PR nuclei within the lesion location returned to values similar to baseline by 2 months, which was surprising given that PRs do not regenerate. Our interpretation is that adjacent PRs spill into the region of loss, similar to what several have described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. Corroborating the histological finding of mild cell loss, is the in vivo OCT data which shows no evidence of local edema, cavitation or excavation of the ONL after PR loss (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). The return of the appearance, thickness and redistribution of cells within the ablated location indicates that retinal remodeling occurs within a 2 month window. The concurrence of microglia in these outer retinal bands (where they are normally absent in health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>) support the hypothesis that microglia localized to this region to facilitate a phagocytic injury response and perhaps contribute toward synaptic remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e">
<title>The hyperreflective phenotype does not arise from microglia or neutrophils</title>
<p>Light damage is known to create a hyper-reflective bands in OCT imaging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. A common speculation is that the increased backscatter may arise from the local inflammatory cells that activate or move into the damage location. In our data, confocal AOSLO and OCT revealed a hyperreflective band at the OPL and ONL after 488 nm light exposure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a, b</xref>). However, we found that the hyperreflective bands appeared within 30 minutes after the laser injury. This phenotype preceded any detectable microglial migration toward the damage location (<xref rid="fig2-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig6-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – figure supplement 1</xref>). We thus conclude that the in vivo hyperreflective phenotype is not caused by microglial cell activity or aggregation.</p>

<sec id="s4f">
<title>Direct activation of microglia from 488 nm light exposure was minimal</title>
<p>It is conceivable that 488 nm light used for either imaging (56 µW) or imparting damage (785 µW) might activate the GFP-containing microglia in the Cx3CR1 mouse model used here. However, several lines of evidence speak against this possibility. 1) We did not observe photobleaching of CX3CR1 positive cells in response to the damage suggesting the fluorescence imaging light was insufficient to damage microglia. 2) The focal plane was adjusted using the optics of the AOSLO, focusing the light such that the dose was most axially concentrated onto the outer retina when performing retinal injury. Thus, the light dosage received by the microglia above was defocused and less than the targeted PR layer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). 3) Histology showed no evident necrotic/apoptotic microglial morphologies and were similar to cells at undamaged locations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g">
<title>488 nm laser lesion does not photocoagulate or alter retinal circulation</title>
<p>Despite imparting damage to the photoreceptors, the damage regime used here did not alter the perfusion of the retinal circulation. We show three independent measures that blood flow is uninterrupted, despite quantifiable PR loss and activation of microglia. 1) Fluorescein angiography (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>, bottom) displays intact vasculature passing through and above lesion locations. The absence of fluorescein leakage indicates that the lesion did not compromise the blood-retinal barrier. Additionally, there was no indication of a perforated Bruch’s membrane. 2) AOSLO motion contrast vascular maps <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> displayed persistent blood perfusion inside vessels near laser lesion sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). This indicated that single cell perfusion through the capillaries above and adjacent to the regional damage was maintained 3) Capillary line scans indicate that RBC flux was not modified at lesion locations and fell within the normal range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1</xref>). Altogether, these three lines of evidence indicate that the 488 nm light exposure does not impart perfusion changes within the retinal vasculature.</p>

<title>Microglial/neutrophil discrimination using label-free phase contrast</title>
<p>In this work, we use fluorescence to validate the presence and dynamics of microglia and neutrophils in response to PR damage. We have found that microglia and neutrophils show a number of differences that may be useful for identifying their type without the need for fluorescent labels. For example: under healthy conditions, these cells exhibit morphological differences: retinal microglia exhibit processes that emanate from the soma, exhibiting an arbor that actively surveys a large patch of retina, while neutrophils are spheroid, sometimes presenting as cylinders when squeezing through retinal capillaries. Another difference lies in their motility: neutrophils remain within the vasculature, often times traveling at high speeds while microglial somas generally remain stationary as they monitor the local microenvironment. With a strong base-of-knowledge about the morphological and behavioral features to expect for each cell type, label-free imaging could discriminate not just immune cells, but other retinal cells as well in the future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> This is particularly promising when considering translating these observations into the human population where dyes and fluorescent agents are used sparingly.</p>

<title>Resident microglia do not need systemic neutrophils for resolution of mild laser-damage</title>
<p>The CNS and retina, unlike other peripheral tissues, cannot suffer from excess inflammation as there may be dire functional consequences. Therefore it is possible that microglia protect against exorbitant inflammation by modulating the recruitment of systemic inflammatory cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> Of these, neutrophils are often one of the first systemic responders. Despite their helpful roles in other tissues, neutrophils can secrete neurotoxic compounds that could present a danger to the CNS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> Given their conflicted role in the body, we ask the question: to what extent do neutrophils respond to acute neural loss in the retina? Retinal cells are lost with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> and yet, for the organism, visual perception must persist. In this laser lesion model, we ablate 27% of the photoreceptors in a 50 µm region. This acute damage model can begin to provide clues about how the immune system responds when photoreceptors are lost in disease.</p>
<p>We find that microglia undergo a rapid and progressive response to this injury. We show evidence of PR phagocytosis (<xref rid="fig9-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 9 - figure supplement 2</xref>), interaction with neighboring microglia (<xref rid="fig9-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 9 – figure supplement 1</xref>) and they are also axially positioned to facilitate retinal remodeling (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Furthermore, throughout the temporal evolution of the microglial response, we find no evidence of neutrophil recruitment despite the damage being within 10s of microns from retinal vessels that carry systemic neutrophils. At the onset of the neutrophil extravasation cascade, endothelial cells in the vicinity of inflamed tissue typically elevate the expression of adhesion molecules, facilitating the adherence and extravasation of circulating neutrophils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup> Furthermore, neutrophils are dependent on priming events as prerequisite to further activation and engagement of their effector functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup> Based on our data, we suggest that although microglia show a strong and lasting activation, at no time point from seconds-to-months, are the damage-associated molecular patterns or chemotactic gradients strong enough to recruit neutrophils in response to this damage. This is evidenced in our data from two key observations: 1) in response to laser injury, we saw no examples of systemic leukocytes rolling in vessels adjacent to injury locations (Figure 8 – video 1). 2) Using fluorescence, we did not observe adherent or extravasated neutrophils adjacent to imparted photoreceptor loss (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). This may suggest that the region of insult is too small, or that activated microglia are not sufficient for recruiting neutrophils with damage of this magnitude. This could mean that a minimum threshold of neural damage must be met before neutrophils will respond to damage of this type. Such a strategy would benefit the CNS. It is possible that resident microglia facilitate the necessary phagocytic and retinal remodeling response despite release of cytokines from damaged retinal cells that would normally recruit systemic immune cells in peripheral tissues.</p>
<p>Future work will explore whether there is a threshold magnitude of neuronal cell loss required for recruitment of systemic cells that is unique to the retina. Building on this work, next studies will examine more severe or widespread injury regimes that may provide stronger activating molecular signals and interact with a larger population of systemic cells.</p>

<title>Microglia may inhibit neutrophil activation</title>
<p>Microglia may be involved in a system that protects the CNS from propagating a much larger systemic response, potentially exacerbating disease pathologies that would compromise overall CNS function. From this work, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> data corroborate the finding that microglia become reactive, whereas no evidence of neutrophil recruitment is observed. In another damage model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>, they report that tissue-resident macrophages may exhibit the capacity to cloak tissue micro-damage. This offers the possibility that resident immune cells, such as retinal microglia, can handle small insults without inducing a chemokine cascade that may invoke a larger systemic response that could further damage the precious retinal tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup> Regardless of the mechanism, we find that despite a robust microglial activation that lasts for weeks, at no time point do they recruit neutrophils. The nuance of this interaction likely represents the fine balance that facilitates a helpful local response within the CNS that does not impart a more widespread cytokine storm that may otherwise exacerbate retinal damage. Further work will explore whether microglia exhibit a cloaking response in the retina, inhibiting neutrophil or other immune cell extravasation/chemotaxis toward lesion sites. We expect such work to be pivotal in understanding the balance that is broken or left unchecked in conditions of autoimmune disease and the umbrella of diseases that comprise the uveitic response which is a direct threat to lifelong vision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Here, we have applied innovative <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging at the microscopic scale to reveal the cellular immune response to a retina in jeopardy. The dynamic environment of the retina includes a native population of resident microglia and systemic immune cells delivered through the vasculature. These two lines of defense work in concert in the mammalian body and are critical for maintaining retinal homeostasis. In this work we directly study the interaction between microglia and neutrophils, two major classes of immune cells that are implicated in inflammatory initiation, escalation, propagation and debris removal in response to an acute geographical injury in the retina. Using cutting-edge retinal imaging modalities, we find that resident microglia become locally activated and regionally responsive to focal laser lesion. Cells migrate away from their stratified locations near plexiform layers of the retina and migrate toward the axial site of damage within hours to weeks after injury. However, systemic neutrophils, which are typically regarded as first-line responders to tissue damage, are not recruited to this damage despite neutrophils flowing within 10s of microns away from the location of damage (Figure 8 – video 2). Beyond the context of this specific finding, we share this work with the excitement that AOSLO cellular level imaging may reveal the interaction of multiple immune cell types in the living retina, a unique tissue in its own regard. By using fluorophores associated with specific immune cell populations, the complex immune cell dynamics that orchestrate the immune response may be examined in this specialized tissue and may reveal further insights to the interactions of single immune cells in the living body in a non-invasive way.</p>

<p>The study by Power and colleagues is <bold>important</bold> as elucidating the dynamic immune responses to photoreceptor damage in vivo potentiates future work in the field to better understand the disease process. However the evidence supporting the authors' claims is <bold>incomplete</bold>. The current manuscript would further benefit from validating their conclusion with additional supporting data from earlier time points (6 to 12 hours), additional markers to characterize neutrophils, more n numbers to strengthen the analysis, and evaluation of immune responses in mice with a stronger laser ablation, as well as further evidence to distinguish resident microglia vs. infiltrating macrophages due to the BRB breakdown. The authors should reorganize the article to make it easier and more straightforward to follow.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to investigate the interaction between tissue-resident immune cells (microglia) and circulating systemic neutrophils in response to acute, focal retinal injury. They induced retinal lesions using 488 nm light to ablate photoreceptor (PR) outer segments, then utilized various imaging techniques (AOSLO, SLO, and OCT) to study the dynamics of fluorescent microglia and neutrophils in mice over time. Their findings revealed that while microglia showed a dynamic response and migrated to the injury site within a day, neutrophils were not recruited to the area despite being nearby. Post-mortem confocal microscopy confirmed these in vivo results. The study concluded that microglial activation does not recruit neutrophils in response to acute, focal photoreceptor loss, a scenario common in many retinal diseases.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The primary strength of this manuscript lies in the techniques employed.</p>
<p>In this study, the authors utilized advanced Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) to document immune cell interactions in the retina accurately. AOSLO's micron-level resolution and enhanced contrast, achieved through near-infrared (NIR) light and phase-contrast techniques, allowed visualization of individual immune cells without extrinsic dyes. This method combined confocal reflectance, phase-contrast, and fluorescence modalities to reveal various cell types simultaneously. Confocal AOSLO tracked cellular changes with less than 6 μm axial resolution, while phase-contrast AOSLO provided detailed views of vascular walls, blood cells, and immune cells. Fluorescence imaging enabled the study of labeled cells and dyes throughout the retina. These techniques, integrated with conventional histology and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), offered a comprehensive platform to visualize immune cell dynamics during retinal inflammation and injury.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One significant weakness of the manuscript is the use of Cx3cr1GFP mice to specifically track GFP-expressing microglia. While this model is valuable for identifying resident phagocytic cells when the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is intact, it is important to note that recruited macrophages also express the same marker following BRB breakdown. This overlap complicates the interpretation of results and makes it difficult to distinguish between the contributions of microglia and infiltrating macrophages, a point that is not addressed in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Another major concern is the time point chosen for analyzing the neutrophil response. The authors assess neutrophil activity 24 hours after injury, which may be too late to capture the initial inflammatory response. This delayed assessment could overlook crucial early dynamics that occur shortly after injury, potentially impacting the overall findings and conclusions of the study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study uses in vivo multimodal high-resolution imaging to track how microglia and neutrophils respond to light-induced retinal injury from soon after injury to 2 months post-injury. The in vivo imaging finding was subsequently verified by an ex vivo study. The results suggest that despite the highly active microglia at the injury site, neutrophils were not recruited in response to acute light-induced retinal injury.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>An extremely thorough examination of the cellular-level immune activity at the injury site. In vivo imaging observations being verified using ex vivo techniques is a strong plus.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This paper is extremely long, and in the perspective of this reviewer, needs to be better organized.</p>
<p>Study weakness: though the finding prompts more questions and future studies, the findings discussed in this paper are potentially important for us to understand how the immune cells respond differently to different severity levels of injury.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work investigated the immune response in the murine retina after focal laser lesions. These lesions are made with close to 2 orders of magnitude lower laser power than the more prevalent choroidal neovascularization model of laser ablation. Histology and OCT together show that the laser insult is localized to the photoreceptors and spares the inner retina, the vasculature, and the pigment epithelium. As early as 1-day after injury, a loss of cell bodies in the outer nuclear layer is observed. This is accompanied by strong microglial proliferation at the site of injury in the outer retina where microglia do not typically reside. The injury did not seem to result in the extravasation of neutrophils from the capillary network constituting one of the main findings of the paper. The demonstrated paradigm of studying the immune response and potentially retinal remodeling in the future in vivo is valuable and would appeal to a broad audience in visual neuroscience. However, there are some issues with the conclusions drawn from the data and analysis that can be addressed to further bolster the manuscript.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Adaptive optics imaging of the murine retina is cutting edge and enables non-destructive visualization of fluorescently labeled cells in the milieu of retinal injury. As may be obvious, this in vivo approach is beneficial for studying fast and dynamic immune processes on a local time scale - minutes and hours, and also for the longer days-to-months follow-up of retinal remodeling as demonstrated in the article. In certain cases, the in vivo findings are corroborated with histology.</p>
<p>The analysis is sound and accompanied by stunning video and static imagery. A few different sets of mouse models are used, (a) two different mouse lines, each with a fluorescent tag for neutrophils and microglia, (b) two different models of inflammation - endotoxin-induced uveitis (EAU) and laser ablation are used to study differences in the immune interaction.</p>
<p>One of the major advances in this article is the development of the laser ablation model for 'mild' retinal damage as an alternative to the more severe neovascularization models. While not directly shown in the article, this model would potentially allow for controlling the size, depth, and severity of the laser injury opening interesting avenues for future study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) It is unclear based on the current data/study to what extent the mild laser damage phenotype is generalizable to disease phenotypes. The outer nuclear cell loss of 28% and a complete recovery in 2 months would seem quite mild, thus the generalizability in terms of immune-mediated response in the face of retinal remodeling is not certain, specifically whether the key finding regarding the lack of neutrophil recruitment will be maintained with a stronger laser ablation.</p>
<p>(2) Mice numbers and associated statistics are insufficient to draw strong conclusions in the paper on the activity of neutrophils, some examples are below :</p>
<p>a) 2 catchup mice and 2 positive control EAU mice are used to draw inferences about immune-mediated activity in response to injury. If the goal was to show 'feasibility' of imaging these mouse models for the purposes of tracking specific cell type behavior, the case is sufficiently made and already published by the authors earlier. It is possible that a larger sample size would alter the conclusion.</p>
<p>b) There are only 2 examples of extravasated neutrophils in the entire article, shown in the positive control EAU model. With the rare extravasation events of these cells and their high-speed motility, the chance of observing their exit from the vasculature is likely low overall, therefore the general conclusions made about their recruitment or lack thereof are not justified by these limited examples shown.</p>
<p>c) In Figure 3, the 3-day time point post laser injury shows an 18% reduction in the density of ONL nuclei (p-value of 0.17 compared to baseline). In the case of neutrophils, it is noted that &quot;Control locations (n = 2 mice, 4 z-stacks) had 15 {plus minus} 8 neutrophils per sq.mm of retina whereas lesioned locations (n = 2 mice, 4 z-stacks) had 23 {plus minus} 5 neutrophils per sq.mm of retina (Figure 10b). The difference between control and lesioned groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.19).&quot; These data both come from histology. While the p-values - 0.17 and 0.19 - are similar, in the first case a reduction in ONL cell density is concluded while in the latter, no difference in neutrophil density is inferred in the lesioned case compared to control. Why is there a difference in the interpretation where the same statistical test and methodology are used in both cases? Besides this statistical nuance, is there an alternate possibility that there is an increased, albeit statistically insignificant, concentration of circulating neutrophils in the lesioned model? The increase is nearly 50% (15 {plus minus} 8 vs. 23 {plus minus} 5 neutrophils per sq.mm) and the reader may wonder if a larger animal number might skew the statistic towards significance.</p>
<p>(2) The conclusions on the relative activity of neutrophils and microglia come from separate animals. The reader may wonder why simultaneous imaging of microglia and neutrophils is not shown in either the EAU mice or the fluorescently labeled catchup mice where the non-labeled cell type could possibly be imaged with phase-contrast as has been shown by the authors previously. One might suspect that the microglia dynamics are not substantially altered in these mice compared to the CX3CR1-GFP mice subjected to laser lesions, but for future applicability of this paradigm of in vivo imaging assessment of the laser damage model, including documenting the repeatability of the laser damage model and the immune cell behavior, acquiring these data in the same animals would be critical.</p>
<p>(3) Along the same lines as above, the phase contrast ONL images at time points from 3-day to 2-month post laser injury are not shown and the absence of this data is not addressed. This missing data pertains only to the in vivo imaging mice model but are conducted in histology that adequately conveys the time-course of cell loss in the ONL. It is suggested that the reason be elaborated for the exclusion of this data and the simultaneous imaging of microglia and neutrophils mentioned above. Also, it would be valuable to further qualify and check the claims in the Discussion that &quot;ex vivo analysis confirms in vivo findings&quot; and &quot;Microglial/neutrophil discrimination using label-free phase contrast&quot;</p>
