<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The uniparental transmission of the maternal mitochondrial genome is achieved by the disposal of the sperm mitochondria and their DNA (mtDNA) around fertilization. <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo allowed the identification of several factors and mechanisms involved after fertilization. The discovery that the autophagy pathway and its adaptor ALLO-1 are implicated represented a major progress. In addition, studies in fish and fly have implicated CPS-6, a sperm mitochondrial endonuclease, in the degradation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> sperm-derived mtDNA. The sperm mitochondria-associated proteins FNDC-1 and PHB-2 were also implicated in efficiently removing sperm-derived mitochondria. Despite these recent findings, it is still not clear whether they account for the complete degradation and if we can experimentally prevent sperm-mitochondria clearance and induce sperm-mtDNA transmission to the progeny.</p>
<p>Here, we investigated the genetic interactions and tested the impact of simultaneous inactivation of known factors on the fate of sperm-derived mitochondria and their mtDNA. We revealed an additive effect of ALLO-1 and CPS-6 loss of function. Furthermore, the inactivation of known factors acting in sperm mitochondria clearance was not sufficient to avoid sperm mitochondria removal and to allow paternal mtDNA inheritance across generations.</p>
<p>These findings reveal that <italic>C. elegans</italic> employs at least two parallel pathways to ensure the degradation of paternal mitochondria and suggest the presence of unidentified mechanism(s) safeguarding maternal mitochondrial inheritance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mitochondria are essential organelles that produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and control many cellular processes. Mitochondria have their genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). In most eukaryotes, contrary to the nuclear genome which is inherited equally from both parents during sexual reproduction, the mtDNA is only inherited from the mother. It is now well established that maternal mitochondrial heredity is not only the result of dilution of the sperm-derived mtDNA over the maternal mtDNA. Indeed, it relies on various active mechanisms that prevent the transmission of the sperm mitochondrial genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Birky, 2001</xref>). Even though uniparental maternal heredity is a conserved phenomenon, the elimination of sperm mitochondrial genome occurs at distinct stages of the reproductive cycle, depending on the species.</p>
<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, as in most animal species, the sperm mitochondria and their genomes enter the oocyte upon fertilization. But within 20-25 minutes after fertilization, a strong and selective autophagy wave named allophagy is induced against sperm-derived mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Al Rawi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Sato and Sato, 2011</xref>). The maternal autophagy receptor/adaptor ALLO-1 is, to date, the earliest factor recruited around the two derived sperm organelles aimed to be eliminated in worms: the sperm mitochondria and the membranous organelles (MOs), a Golgi-derived sperm organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Al Rawi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Sato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Sato and Sato, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Several other conserved factors were described to participate in sperm-derived mitochondria degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Merlet et al., 2019</xref>). Among them, the mitochondrial endonuclease G (CPS-6 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) acts as a paternal factor required for sperm mitochondria and mtDNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Unlike in <italic>C. elegans</italic> where CPS-6 acts after fertilization, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, endonuclease G contributes to uniparental maternal mitochondrial inheritance before fertilization during the sperm individualization process. Two other paternal conserved factors, known for their role in mitophagy in somatic cells, also participate in sperm-derived mitochondria degradation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> after fertilization : FNDC-1 - the ortholog of human FUNDC1 - and PHB-2 a mitochondrial inner membrane receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Lim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Wei et al., 2017</xref>). A single inactivation of one of these four factors does not allow for a stable transmission to the following generations. In addition, little is known about their genetic interaction(s) and if they can account for the complete mechanisms sustaining uniparental maternal inheritance or if additional mechanism(s) exist.</p>
<p>To better understand the genetic interaction(s) between ALLO-1, CPS-6, FNDC-1, and PHB-2 in sperm-derived mitochondria degradation, we simultaneously inactivated these factors. We revealed an additive effect of ALLO-1 and CPS-6 loss of function indicating that they act in parallel pathways. However, the simultaneous inactivation of those four factors did not allow sperm mitochondrial inheritance. Therefore, our results suggest that in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, at least two pathways act in parallel to ensure the proper degradation of sperm-derived mitochondria. Our results also suggest that additional mechanism(s), which remain(s) to be identified, ensure mtDNA removal and prevent transmission to the next generation.</p>

<title>Simultaneous inactivation of <italic>cps-6</italic> and <italic>allo-1</italic> showed a synergistic effect on sperm mitochondria stabilization</title>
<p>To establish the respective contribution and potential functional interaction between <italic>allo-1</italic> and <italic>cps-6</italic>, we tested if depleting both factors impacted on the stabilization of sperm-derived mitochondria. In the <italic>cps-6(tm3222)</italic> allele, the deletion removes the catalytic site of CPS-6 which is required for endonuclease activity and to mediate sperm-derived mitochondria elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Parrish et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). In the <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic> allele, the deletion creates a premature stop codon which results in a truncated protein without its LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, required for LGG-1 recruitment - the mammalian homolog of LC3/Atg-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Sato et al., 2018</xref>). For each different genetic background tested, males expressing HSP-6::GFP in the germline were crossed with hermaphrodites of the corresponding genotype. In order to prevent auto-fertilization and analysis of embryos from un-labeled spermatozoa, we introduced the feminizing <italic>fem-2(b245)</italic> mutation that prevents sperm formation when worms develop at 25°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Kimble et al., 1984</xref>). We crossed feminized worms with males expressing a mitochondrial HSP-6::GFP and recovered the embryos. To overcome the variability associated with counting fluorescently labeled sperm-derived mitochondria, we developed a semi-autonomous method to quantify sperm-derived mitochondria in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In <italic>cps-6(tm3222)</italic> embryos, the average HSP-6::GFP intensity for the remaining sperm-inherited mitochondria at the 4-cell stage was slightly different from control embryos (7.0% ± 2.0% and 5.0% ± 2.4% respectively). Whereas, as expected, <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic> embryos displayed a stabilization of sperm mitochondria with a remaining signal intensity of 61.2% ± 7.4% at 4-cell stage. Noticeably, double mutant embryos exhibited a significantly higher persistence of sperm mitochondria signal when compared to the single <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic>, with a signal intensity of 82.1% ± 10.1% at 4-cell stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The stabilizing effect in the double mutant was still visible at the 51-100-cell stage. Indeed, only 0.2% ± 0.1% of the signal intensity remained in the control, compared to 31.0% ± 5.1% in <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic> and 57.3% ± 4.8% in double mutant embryos. Therefore, our results revealed a synergistic effect of the simultaneous inactivation of <italic>allo-1</italic> and <italic>cps-6</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>We then analyzed if sperm-derived mitochondria were stabilized in older embryos. At the 3-fold stage, the quantification data showed no difference between control and double mutant embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref><bold><italic> and </italic></bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). We then analyzed by PCR how long sperm mtDNA was maintained in double mutants. As expected from our quantifications, the sperm-contributed mtDNA, <italic>uaDf5</italic> allele, was amplified in F1 early embryos. To better evaluate the possibility that sperm mtDNA could be maintained in F1, we looked for the <italic>uaDf5</italic> allele on F1 single adults. We found that 27/43 adults F1 contained the <italic>uaDf5</italic> allele. However, none of the F2 progeny from <italic>uaDf5</italic> positive F1 contained the <italic>uaDf5</italic> allele (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>We then evaluated whether <italic>cps-6(tm3222)</italic> and <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic> alleles cause deleterious defects. We measured the brood size of the adult hermaphrodites N2 (control), single, and double mutants. We observed a modest but significant reduction of the brood size in each single mutants (245 ± 50 for <italic>cps-6(tm3222)</italic>, 248 ± 56 for <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic>) as well as in the double mutant (215 ± 52 for <italic>cps-6(tm3222); allo-1(tm4756)</italic>) compared to control (290 ± 47 for N2) (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). This modest decrease in the brood size was not combined with a reduction in embryonic viability since we did not observe any significant reduction in the fraction of hatching embryos in none of the mutants’ backgrounds (0.5% ± 0.5% for <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic>, 1.1% ± 1.6% for <italic>cps-6(tm3222)</italic> and 0.6% ± 1.0% for <italic>cps-6(tm3222); allo-1(tm4756)</italic>) compared to control (0.4% ± 0.4% for N2) (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our results showed that, despite a greater persistence of sperm mitochondria in the embryos in double mutant <italic>cps-6(tm3222); allo-1(tm4756)</italic>, this is not enough to maintain the paternal mtDNA over the generations.</p>

<title>The combined inactivation of ALLO-1, CPS-6, FNDC-1 and PHB-2 is not sufficient to transmit paternal mtDNA over the generations</title>
<p>The simultaneous inactivation of ALLO-1 and CPS-6 was not sufficient to stabilize sperm mitochondria or their mtDNA across the generations. Therefore, we tested the effect of simultaneously inactivating ALLO-1 and CPS-6 endonuclease, along with the depletion of two other known sperm factors FNDC-1 and PHB-2. In order to achieve this goal and avoid potential deleterious effects on development, we crossed feminized hermaphrodites containing <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic> mutation with males mutants <italic>cps-6(tm3222); fndc-1(rny14); phb-2(RNAi)</italic> expressing HSP-6::GFP. Feminized worms were also treated with <italic>allo-1(RNAi)</italic> to avoid the embryonic expression of the paternally <italic>allo-1</italic> contributed gene.</p>
<p>We measured the stability of the sperm-inherited mitochondria as previously described. The depletion of FNDC-1 and PHB-2 did not increase the stability of sperm-derived mitochondria compared to the double <italic>cps-6(tm3222); allo-1(tm4756)</italic> mutant embryos neither at early nor late stages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, 2B</xref><bold><italic> and </italic></bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D</xref>). Even though sperm-derived mitochondria are visible in some embryos, the remaining GFP signal associated with sperm-derived mitochondria at 3-fold stage was not significantly different in the quadruple mutant than in the double mutant (3.0% ± 0.8% and 2.5% ± 0.8% for <italic>cps-6(tm3222); fndc-1(rny14); phb-2(RNAi); allo-1(tm4756)</italic> and <italic>cps-6(tm3222); allo-1(tm4756)</italic> mutants respectively). Our results showed that depletion of ALLO-1, CPS-6, FNDC-1 and PHB-2 does not differ from the double <italic>cps-6(tm3222); allo-1(tm4756)</italic> mutant, suggesting that sperm-derived mitochondria are still degraded in the absence of functional ALLO-1, CPS-6, FNDC-1 and PHB-2. We obtained similar results by tracking sperm-derived mitochondria with CMXRos, a fluorescent cationic mitochondrial marker (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). To analyze sperm mtDNA persistence, we followed by PCR the sperm provided <italic>uaDf5</italic> allele. We were able to detect the <italic>uaDf5</italic> allele in 17/36 adults F1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). However, inactivation of these four factors does not allow amplification in none of the F2 animals tested from an <italic>uaDf5</italic> positive L1 adult.</p>

ALLO-1, FNDC-1 and PHB-2 ability to directly induce autophagosomes formation through their LIR domain suggests that they may act in parallel pathways. Therefore, we tested whether FNDC-1 and PHB-2 could act together or not with CPS-6.

<title>Sperm-derived mitochondria are not poly-ubiquitylated in late embryos</title>
<p>The combined inactivation of known factors involved in sperm-derived mitochondria degradation induced a stabilization without preventing their clearance at later stages of development (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). To elucidate a potential involvement of poly-ubiquitylation in the targeting of transiently stabilized sperm-derived organelles for degradation, we tested the presence of poly-ubiquitin chains using Tandem-repeated Ubiquitin-Binding Entities (TUBEs).</p>

As expected from our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cailloce et al., 2023a</xref>), MOs are predominantly poly-ubiquitylated at the 2-cell stage in both control and mutant embryos (66.5% ± 20.8% and 95.5% ± 14.5%, respectively). At later developmental stages in <italic>cps-6(tm3222); fndc-1(rny14); phb-2(RNAi); allo-1(tm4756)</italic> mutant embryos, MOs remained poly-ubiquitylated with 76.6% ± 17.8% of MOs positively labeled at the bean stage and 70.8% ± 34.3% at the 1.5-fold stage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). However, in late mutant embryos, TUBEs signal remained not detectable in sperm-derived mitochondria with no labeling at bean and 1.5-fold stages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>) like in early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cailloce et al., 2023a</xref>). These results suggested that, although MOs are predominantly poly-ubiquitylated, sperm-derived mitochondria do not exhibit a positive signal for Pan-TUBEs labeling, even when stabilized in embryos.</p>

<title>PINK-1 can target sperm-derived mitochondria in <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic> mutant embryos</title>
<p>To further evaluate a role of poly-ubiquitylation in sperm-derived mitochondria degradation, we tested if in <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic> background the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway could take over the ALLO-1 pathway. We measured sperm-derived mitochondria stability in the <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic> embryos upon <italic>pink-1</italic> inactivation. This was achieved by crossing <italic>pink-1(ok3538); allo-1(tm4756)</italic> mutant hermaphrodites, treated by <italic>pink-1</italic> RNAi to avoid embryonic expression of the paternally contributed gene, with <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic> males expressing HSP-6::GFP. We measured the remaining sperm-derived mitochondria at different stages of development and established the kinetic of degradation for <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic> and <italic>pink-1(ok3538); allo-1(tm4756)</italic> mutants. In agreement with published results showing that the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway was not involved in sperm-derived mitochondria degradation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Sato et al., 2018</xref>), we did not observe any difference in GFP intensity in early embryos (data not shown) and late embryos (3-fold stage) between single <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic> and double <italic>pink-1(ok3538); allo-1(tm4756)</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Unexpectedly, we observed a significant but limited increase of the GFP signal between the 10 and 100-cell stages. The increase in sperm-derived mitochondria signal was of 77.3% ± 5.4% compared to 49.6% ± 6.5% respectively in <italic>pink-1(ok3538); allo-1(tm4756)</italic> double mutant and in <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic> at 10-16-cell stage.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In most eukaryotes, mitochondria together with their mtDNA are maternally inherited. This uniparental maternal mode of heredity is very conserved in various vertebrate and invertebrate species. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> model system has been instrumental in understanding how sperm-derived mitochondria are eliminated after fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Merlet et al., 2019</xref>). Several factors (ALLO-1, CPS-6, FNDC-1 and PHB-2) involved in sperm-derived mitochondria degradation have been identified, but how they interact together or not was unknown. Here, we provided new insights into the mechanisms driving sperm-derived mitochondria degradation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, specifically addressing how ALLO-1, CPS-6, FNDC-1, and PHB-2 cooperate or not in sperm mitochondria elimination.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>ALLO-1 and CPS-6 act synergistically in sperm mitochondrial degradation</title>
<p>One way to quantify sperm mitochondria after fertilization was to count the fluorescently labeled mitochondria. However, in early stages of development when sperm mitochondria are aggregated, counting individual mitochondria spots was almost impossible and resulted in a lot of variability. We developed a semi-autonomous method to quantify the mitochondrial HSP-6::GFP protein signal as a readout for sperm mitochondria quantification after fertilization which provides more accurate data. Using this method, we quantified sperm-derived mitochondria in double <italic>cps-6(tm3222); allo-1(tm4756)</italic> and in single <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic> and <italic>cps-6(tm3222)</italic> mutants. We observed that sperm-derived mitochondria remain longer in the double <italic>cps-6(tm3222); allo-1(tm4756)</italic> mutant compared to single mutants. Whereas we were able to reproduce published results from single <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Sato et al., 2018</xref>), we did not observe sperm mitochondria persistence on single <italic>cps-6(tm3222)</italic> mutant as published in Zhou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). We also manually counted CMXRos labeled sperm mitochondria in <italic>cps-6(tm3222)</italic> mutants and did not find any mitochondria persistence (data not shown). The lack of effect we observed in single <italic>cps-6(tm3222)</italic> mutant suggested that, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, CPS-6 is more dispensable on sperm-derived mitochondria elimination contrary to <italic>Drosophila</italic> where its homologous, the endonuclease endoG, seems to have a more central role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">DeLuca and O’Farrell, 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, we observed an additive effect on stabilization of sperm-derived mitochondria on the double mutant <italic>cps-6(tm3222); allo-1(tm4756)</italic> which confirms the involvement of CPS-6 in the elimination of sperm-derived mitochondria. This result also suggested that ALLO-1 and CPS-6 act in pathways that are at least partially independent. The existence of several pathways acting in parallel was suggested by Zhou et al. which showed that 43% of sperm mitochondria are still surrounded by LGG-1 in <italic>cps-6(tm3222)</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Our results provide evidence that at least two pathways co-exist, which act at least partially independently: one involving ALLO-1 and the other one CPS-6.</p>

<title>Possible contribution of the PINK-1 pathway in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title>
<p>We quantified sperm-derived mitochondria in double <italic>pink-1(ok3538); allo-1(tm4756)</italic> mutants. In early embryos, no additive effect was observed in this double mutant compared to single <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic> mutant. This finding corroborates previously published results, which demonstrated that degradation of sperm-derived mitochondria at early stages following fertilization was independent of PINK-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Sato et al., 2018</xref>). However, across all analyzed stages, we observed that sperm-derived mitochondria remain longer in double <italic>pink-1(ok3538); allo-1(tm4756)</italic> mutant than in single <italic>allo-1(tm4756)</italic> mutant between the 10-cell and 100-cell stages suggesting that PINK-1 could play a role in sperm-derived mitochondria elimination. Various previous studies have demonstrated that loss of mitochondrial membrane potential induces PINK-1 accumulation, which initiates the autophagic degradation of damaged mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Matsuda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Narendra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Vives-Bauza et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, we also reported that in the absence of allophagy, 16% of sperm-derived mitochondria lose their TMRE signal - a cationic mitochondrial fluorescent marker that stains mitochondria with intact membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Zorova et al., 2018</xref>) - at 20-24-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Rubio-Peña et al., 2021</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that TMRE negative sperm mitochondria could be targeted to the autophagy machinery <italic>via</italic> PINK-1 but this hypothesis remains to be validated. Nevertheless, our results suggest that in an <italic>allo-1</italic> null sensitised background, the canonical mitophagy pathway mediated by PINK-1 may contribute to the degradation of at least a fraction of sperm-derived mitochondria.</p>

<title>A nematode specific pathway is predominant for sperm mitochondria degradation after fertilization in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title>
<p><italic>C. elegans</italic> model system has been instrumental in deciphering the molecular mechanisms contributing to ensure a proper uniparental maternal mitochondrial heredity. Several proteins were identified independently: ALLO-1, CPS-6, FNDC-1 and PHB-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Lim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Sato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Wei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>) but how they interact all together was unknown. Here, we analysed sperm-derived mitochondria fate in the embryo in the absence of all four proteins. Interestingly, we showed that in the quadruple mutant, sperm-derived mitochondria stabilization was the same as in the double mutant <italic>cps-6(tm3222); allo-1(tm4756)</italic> suggesting that all four proteins contributed to at least two pathways, one involving ALLO-1 and the other CPS-6. Furthermore, we showed that stabilization of sperm-derived mitochondria was not different in single <italic>fndc-1(rny14)</italic>, double <italic>cps-6(tm3222); fndc-1(rny14)</italic> and triple <italic>cps-6(tm3222); fndc-1(rny14); phb-2(RNAi)</italic> mutants suggesting that CPS-6, FNDC-1 and PHB-2 act in the same genetic pathway. Therefore, our results suggested that in <italic>C. elegans</italic> two pathways act in parallel, one involving ALLO-1 and the other one CPS-6, FNDC-1 and PHB-2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Our quantifications of sperm-derived mitochondria in embryos also indicate that ALLO-1 pathway is the main pathway used in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to remove sperm mitochondria. Indeed, the inactivation of <italic>allo-1</italic> alone is enough to preserve 30 to 60% of sperm-derived mitochondria up to the 100-cell stage compared to other single mutants.</p>

</fig>
<p>ALLO-1 is a nematode specific protein whereas CPS-6, FNDC-1 and PHB-2 are conserved proteins acting also in mitophagy of somatic cells. It seems that nematodes have developed a specific pathway to remove sperm mitochondria after fertilization but also conserved CPS-6, FNDC-1 and PHB-2 that might be part of an ancestral pathway. Altogether, those four proteins participate to ensure proper uniparental maternal mitochondrial heredity. Indeed, homologues of CPS-6 and PHB-2 have been found to participate in regulation of uniparental mitochondrial inheritance in other species like <italic>Drosophila</italic> and bivalves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">DeLuca and O’Farrell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). The role of FNDC-1 homologue in sperm-derived degradation in other species remains to be tested.</p>
<p>CPS-6, FNDC-1 and PHB-2 are all paternal factors; it will be interesting in the future to better understand when and how precisely they act during sperm development in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Our analysis of the quadruple mutant showed that inactivation of those four factors is not sufficient to stabilize sperm-derived mitochondria. Indeed, in the quadruple mutant we observed that sperm-labeled mitochondria signal decreased in late embryos either when analyzed for GFP tagged HSP-6 protein or CMXRos staining. This suggests that other(s) mechanism(s) is(are) used in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to remove sperm-derived mitochondria and their mtDNA which remain(s) to be found.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our observations indicate that in <italic>C. elegans</italic> at least two main pathways act in parallel to ensure proper uniparental maternal mitochondrial heredity: a minor one involving the conserved proteins CPS-6, FNDC-1 and PHB-2 and a major worm specific pathway, involving the autophagy receptor ALLO-1.</p>

A 10×10 mm coverslip is then placed over the sample before snap-freezing the slide on dry ice. The coverslip is removed by “popping” them with a scalpel. Embryos were fixed in dehydrated methanol at −20°C for 30 minutes. Slides are rinsed for 10 minutes in PBS-T (Phosphate Buffered Salin with 0.1% Tween-20) at room temperature, then mounted with 8 μL of Vectashield-DAPI (Vector Lab).

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> work used molecular biology, cell biology, and genetic approaches to unravel individual genes and potential pathways that contribute to paternal mitochondrial inheritance using C. elegans as the model organism. Their microscopy method is cutting edge, with sufficient biological replicates, proper control, and appropriate statistics. These findings are <bold>convincing</bold> and are of general interest for understanding mitochondrial inheritance in C. elegans, which could have implications for understanding similar biological processes in other organisms.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Melin et al. developed a quantitative assay to measure the fate of paternal mitochondria after fertilization. They combine this assay with C. elegans genetics to show that multiple genes contribute to paternal mitochondrial elimination. However, despite their claims, they unconvincingly place these genes into distinct pathways and fail to determine whether additional unknown genes are involved in the process.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Melin et al. develop a new assay to quantify the fate of paternal mitochondria during embryonic development in C. elegans. They use complex C. elegans genetics to disrupt 5 different genes and nicely measure their contributions to paternal mitochondrial elimination. In an attempt to place these genes into pathways, the authors interrupt genes in various combinations and measure paternal mitochondrial persistence. The authors discovered that disrupting 4 of the genes known to contribute to paternal mitochondrial elimination still resulted in paternal mitochondrial elimination, suggesting that more genes also contribute to this process. Finally, the authors discovered that pink-1, which had previously been discounted, indeed contributes to paternal mitochondrial elimination when the major pathway involving allo-1 is also disrupted.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In the introduction, the authors describe the importance of studying the maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA. However, the authors mostly study the inheritance of paternally-derived mitochondrial proteins (HSP6::GFP). While the authors do use a PCR approach to measure paternal mitochondrial DNA, their results are not as quantitative and thorough (applied to multiple mutant combinations) as their microscopy assay. Using their microscopy assay, the authors did not combine mutants for all 5 genes. Therefore, they cannot support or discount the possibility that undiscovered paternal mitochondrial elimination mechanisms exist. The author's genetic epistasis experiments are incomplete and occasionally improperly interpreted (as described below). Finally, the authors were unable to achieve paternal mitochondrial transmission to the F2 generation (which admittedly has not been achieved in any experimental system).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is exclusively maternally transmitted in almost all species. Paternal mitochondria, with their mtDNA, must be rapidly degraded after fertilisation to prevent their transmission to progeny, which could lead to subsequent detrimental mito-nuclear incompatibilities. Multiple layers of mechanisms contribute to blocking the transmission of paternal mitochondria and their mtDNA to progeny. Endonuclease activity and mitophagy form a part of these strategies. However, other key regulatory mechanisms remain to be elucidated, as inactivating endonuclease and mitophagy activity only delays the clearance of paternal mitochondria. In this study, the authors mainly focused on genes involved in endonuclease function (csp-6) and autophagy (allo-1) in C. elegans, demonstrating a synergic genetic interaction that potentialize their activity. They also revealed a contribution by pink-1/pink1, in the absence of allo-1.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The majority of data relies on confocal microscopy images and corresponding image analysis and quantification. Images are clear, and quantifications are supported by several biological replicates of &gt;10 n and standard statistical tests. Mutants used were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC) and were previously validated and confirmed by the C. elegans community. The scientific approach is solid and rigorous and in line with state-of-the-art C. elegans methods. Proper controls have been performed to rule out the effect of animal viability on observed results or to confirm the staining validity of TUBES on subcellular structures surrounding paternal mitochondria. Controls validating uaDf5 PCR specificity were conducted.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, the embryonic expression of paternally contributing genes in feminised animals cannot be completely ruled out, as RNAi was used to alter gene expression levels. An issue inherent to RNAi approaches. Also, the impact of pink-1/pink1 is significant, but there is a lack of evidence demonstrating its mitophagic function.</p>
<p>Goal achievements and data supportive of conclusions:</p>
<p>In the first part of the study, the authors strongly and clearly demonstrate the synergistic interaction between the csp-6 and allo-1 in delaying paternal mitochondria degradation and associated mtDNA in the fertilised egg. In wild-type animals, paternal mitochondria are visible (using a mitochondrial HSP-::GFP marker) until the 4-cell stage embryo. In the csp-6; allo-1 double mutant genetic background, paternal mitochondria very significantly perdures until the 2-fold embryonic stage. The uaDf5 mitochondrial deletion, detectable by PCR, that was introduced by crossing with a male, followed the same trend. In addition, loss of fncd-1/fndc1 and phb-2 did not extend the perdurance of paternal mitochondria. In the second part of the study, the authors demonstrate a contribution of the loss of pink-1/pink1, in the absence of allo-1, in delaying paternal mitochondria degradation until the 100-cell stage. Overall, the conclusions are in accordance with the data shown.</p>
<p>Impact on the field:</p>
<p>Endonuclease activity and mitophagy aren't sufficient to prevent the transmission of paternal mitochondria and associated mtDNA to progeny, but they still contribute significantly to regulating the perdurance of paternal mitochondria in early embryos. Understanding how these two functions work in concert to potentialize their activity is important, as they could potentially be manipulated/enhanced to improve paternal mitochondrial degradation in the future. Here, the authors demonstrate a detailed synergistic genetic interaction between these functions. Also, they pointed out a new potential contribution of pink-1/pink1, which may underlie a potentially more complex mitophagic protective function.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The present study examines the cooperation among four allophagy/mitophagy factors, ALLO-1, CPS-6, FNDC-1, and PHB-2, implicated in the elimination of the sperm-derived mitochondria in C. elegans embryos. The key finding of the cumulative effect of ALLO-1 and CPS-6 inactivation causing delayed sperm mitophagy is significant for the understanding of mitochondrial inheritance in the nematode model and in general. Below are some specific suggestions on how the impact of the article could be elevated:</p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>The authors should shorten the description of previously identified mitophagy factors and provide more detail on the present study results. An impact statement should be added at the end, with significance for understanding mitochondrial inheritance across taxa, all the way to mammals/humans.</p>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>The authors should provide more details on ALLO-1 and its interaction with LC-3. Also, it should be specified which of those previously identified allophagy factors are unique to worms and which ones are conserved. See also my comment below about including a diagram and a table of pathways and determinants involved in allophagy/paternal mitophagy.</p>
<p>Results:</p>
<p>If I understand the mtDNA data correctly, paternal mtDNA is maintained throughout the lifespan of the F1 generation but absent from the F2 generation. This is reminiscent of past studies of interspecific Mus musculus/Mus spretus mouse crosses by Kaneda/Shitara in which the paternal mtDNA was maintained F1 generation, resulting in heteroplasmy, but was lost from the F2 generation after back-crossing. Are CPS-6 and ALLO-1 effectors, but not determinants of maternal mtDNA inheritance in the nematode?</p>
<p>The finding that PINK-1 inactivation stabilizes sperm-derived mitochondria in the embryos is interesting. Are the substrates of PINK1 known in C. elegans? This could provide a clue concerning the aforementioned mitophagy determinants acting independently of ALLO-1.</p>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>A summary-diagram compiling the intersecting allophagy pathways would be helpful to accompany discussion, in addition to or expanding on the simple diagram presented as Figure 5; also, a table listing all the factors implicated in nematode allophagy next to those implicated in human/mammalian sperm mitophagy, which would highlight the divergences and overlaps between vertebrates and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Is it known how CPC-6 enters/gets imported into the sperm mitochondria inside the embryo? This pathway could potentially be targeted to decipher the allophagy mechanism.</p>
<p>PINK/PARKIN/PACRG and FUNDC1/2 pathways have been implicated in mammalian neurodegeneration as well as in mitophagy, including but not limited to sperm mitophagy after fertilization. These pathways in mammals should be briefly reviewed as they may provide further clues to how the allophagy pathways intersect in C. elegans.</p>
