<title>Abstract</title><p>5-Methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) is one of the major post-transcriptional modifications in mRNA and is highly involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases. However, the capacity of existing assays for accurately and comprehensively transcriptome-wide m<sup>5</sup>C mapping still needs improvement. Here, we develop a detection method named DRAM (deaminase and reader protein assisted RNA methylation analysis), in which deaminases (APOBEC1 and TadA-8e) are fused with m<sup>5</sup>C reader proteins (ALYREF and YBX1) to identify the m<sup>5</sup>C sites through deamination events neighboring the methylation sites. This antibody-free and bisulfite-free approach provides transcriptome-wide editing regions which are highly overlapped with the publicly available BS-seq datasets and allows for a more stable and comprehensive identification of the m<sup>5</sup>C loci. In addition, DRAM system even supports ultra-low input RNA (10ng) and monitors the dynamic accumulation of cellular m<sup>5</sup>C. We anticipate that the DRAM system could pave the way for uncovering further biological functions of m<sup>5</sup>C modifications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epigenetics refers to stable inheritance without changing the basic sequence of DNA, involving various forms such as DNA methylation, histone modification and RNA modification. In recent years, RNA sequencing technology has boosted research on RNA epigenetics. More than 170 RNA modifications have been identified, mainly including m<sup>6</sup>A, m<sup>5</sup>C, m<sup>1</sup>A, m<sup>7</sup>G and others <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Notably, RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation represents a crucial post-transcriptional modification observed across different RNA types, such as tRNA, mRNA, rRNA, vault RNA, microRNA, long non-coding RNA and enhancer RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Numerous studies have revealed multiple molecular functions of m<sup>5</sup>C in numerous key stages of RNA metabolism, such as mRNA stability, translation, and nuclear export<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. The dynamic alterations of m<sup>5</sup>C play integral roles in many physiological and pathological processes, such as early embryonic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, neurodevelopmental disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and multifarious tumorigenesis and migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Moreover, this modification significantly contributes to the regulation of gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, the detection of m<sup>5</sup>C sites appears to be essential for understanding their underlying effects on cellular function and disease states.</p>
<p>With the recent advances in sequencing techniques, several high-throughput assays have been developed for qualitative or quantitative analysis of m<sup>5</sup>C. To date, bisulfite-sequencing (BS-seq) has been proven to be the gold standard method for RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. This approach chemically deaminates unmethylated cytosine to uracil, while keeping methylated cytosine unchanged. The m<sup>5</sup>C methylation sites can be identified by subsequent library construction and sequencing. However, bisulfite treatment of BS-seq is extremely detrimental to RNA, thus resulting in unstable detection of m<sup>5</sup>C in low abundance RNA or highly structured RNA, which directly affects the confidence of results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Another major type of global m<sup>5</sup>C analysis depends on antibody-assisted immunoprecipitation of m<sup>5</sup>C methylated RNAs, such as m<sup>5</sup>C-RIP-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, AZA-IP-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> or miCLIP-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. These methods are unable to recognize methylation on mRNAs with low abundance and secondary structure. Moreover, these methods are highly dependent on antibody specificity, which usually leads to unspecific binding of RNA and a low amount of m<sup>5</sup>C-modified regions. Moreover, TAWO-seq, originally developed for the identification of hm<sup>5</sup>C, is also capable of m<sup>5</sup>C analysis, but it highly depends on the oxidation efficiency of perovskite, which usually causes false positives and unstable conversion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the emerging third-generation sequencing, such as Nanopore-seq, can directly map m<sup>5</sup>C by tracking the characteristic changes of bases, but it still faces challenges of a high error rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. These together largely hamper its wide application on transcriptome profiling of m<sup>5</sup>C (Supplementary Table 1). Hence, there is an urgent need for a simple, efficient, sensitive, and antibody-independent method for global m<sup>5</sup>C detection.</p>
<p>The RNA-binding protein ALYREF is the initially recognized nuclear m<sup>5</sup>C reader that binds directly to m<sup>5</sup>C sites in mRNA and plays key roles in promoting mRNA nuclear export or tumor progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Another well-known m<sup>5</sup>C reader, YBX1, can also recognize m<sup>5</sup>C-modified mRNA through its cold-shock domain and participates in a variety of RNA-dependent events such as mRNA packaging, mRNA stabilization and translational regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. RNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses using biotin-labelled oligonucleotides with or without m<sup>5</sup>C were performed in previous reports, which indicated that ALYREF and YBX1 had a more prominent binding ability to m<sup>5</sup>C-modified oligonucleotides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. YBX1 can preferentially recognize mRNAs with m<sup>5</sup>C modifications via key amino acids W65-N70 (WFNVRN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, while K171 is essential for the specific binding of ALYREF to m<sup>5</sup>C sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that mutations in key amino acids responsible for recognising m<sup>5</sup>C binding in ALYREF and YBX1 lead to a significant reduction in their binding levels to m<sup>5</sup>C-containing oligonucleotides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Nucleic acid deaminases, primarily categorized as cytosine deaminases and adenine deaminases, are zinc-dependent enzymes which facilitate the deamination of cytosine or adenine within DNA or RNA substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. APOBEC1, an evolutionarily conserved family member of APOBEC proteins, can specifically catalyze the deamination of cytosine in single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) or DNA (ssDNA) to uracil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. TadA8e is an adenine deaminase optimized through re-engineering of TadA and it induces conversion of adenine to inosine (eventually read as guanine by transcriptases) in ssRNA or ssDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. APOBEC1 and TadA8e, with their prominent deamination efficiency, have been employed for the development of precise and efficient base editors such as CBE and ABE8e, which find widespread application in studies related to genome editing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here we aim to establish a deaminase and m<sup>5</sup>C reader-assisted RNA methylation sequencing approach (DRAM-seq), which identifies the m<sup>5</sup>C sites through reader-mediated recognitions and deaminase-mediated point mutations neighboring the m<sup>5</sup>C methylation sites. This bisulfite-free and antibody-free method is anticipated to provide more comprehensive and cost-effective transcriptome-wide detection of m<sup>5</sup>C methylation, which may better assist on exploring its further regulatory mechanisms.</p>

<title>Development of DRAM system for m<sup>5</sup>C detection</title>
<p>Our sequencing platform is inspired by the concept of the m<sup>6</sup>A DART-seq assay, in which C near the m<sup>6</sup>A site is converted into U without affecting sequences near non-m6A sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized that, by utilizing the targeted binding of m<sup>5</sup>C readers, deaminase can be recruited to achieve deamination of cytosine or adenine in the vicinity of the m<sup>5</sup>C sites on single-stranded RNA, thereby facilitating the detection of the m<sup>5</sup>C site. This approach was named DRAM (deaminase and m<sup>5</sup>C reader-assisted RNA methylation sequencing). As RNA-binding proteins, ALYREF and YBX1 also could bind to RNAs without m<sup>5</sup>C modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. To exclude the false-positive detection of DRAM due to the non-m<sup>5</sup>C specific binding of ALYREF and YBX1, knockout of W65-N70 (WFNVRN) amino acids in YBX1and K171A mutation in ALYREF were introduced seperately, resulting in the DRAM<sup>mut</sup> system (Fig. S1A-S1D). DRAM<sup>mut</sup> exhibits substantially reduced binding to m<sup>5</sup>C in RNA pulldown assays (Fig. S1D-S1F). To confirm the recognition of m<sup>5</sup>C site by DRAM system, DRAM, DRAM<sup>mut</sup> and Deaminase system were transfected into the human HEK293T cells, respectively. Finally, we considered the presence of m<sup>5</sup>C modification in the vicinity only if the deamination changes produced under DRAM induction were significantly different from those produced under DRAM<sup>mut</sup> or Deaminase induction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

To comprehensively detect the m<sup>5</sup>C loci, the readers of m<sup>5</sup>C (ALYREF and YBX1) were separately fused to the C-terminus of the deaminases (APOBEC1 and TadA-8e), namely DRAM-ABE and DRAM-CBE system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B</xref>).</p>

<title>DRAM detection system is assayed in an m<sup>5</sup>C-dependent form</title>
<p>To confirm the recognition of m<sup>5</sup>C site by DRAM system, DRAM, DRAM<sup>mut</sup> and Deaminase were transfected into the human HEK293T cells, respectively. To evaluate candidate DRAM constructs within a cellular environment, we performed fluorescence microscopy to analyze the expression of DRAM. The results showed that DRAM-ABE and DRAM-CBE were properly expressed in HEK293T cells (Fig. S2A-S2B). In addition, flow cytometry displayed ∼60% of cells were GFP-positive (Fig. S2C). Two previously reported m<sup>5</sup>C sites in RPSA and AP5Z1 were selected for the analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, and their methylation status was verified by bisulfite sequencing PCR. The deep sequencing results showed that the m[C fraction of RPSA and SZRD1 was 75.5% and 27.25%, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref> and B). Sanger sequencing following RT-PCR was then performed to determine the editing of neighbouring m<sup>5</sup>C sites by DRAM system in these two mRNA. Notably, adenine close to the m<sup>5</sup>C site in RPSA mRNA was mutated into guanine, resulting in an A-to-G editing rate of 14.7% by DRAM-ABE, whereas this was rarely observed with TadA-8e or DRAM<sup>mut</sup>-ABE (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2C</xref>). DRAM-CBE induced C to U editing in the vicinity of the m<sup>5</sup>C site in AP5Z1 mRNA, with 13.6% C-to-U editing, while this effect was significantly reduced with APOBEC1 or DRAM<sup>mut</sup>-CBE (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2D</xref>). Subsequently, in order to investigate whether the DRAM system can detect other types of RNA, such as tRNA, 28S rRNA, or others, we performed PCR amplification of the flanking sequences of the m<sup>5</sup>C sites 3782 and 4447 on 28S rRNA and several m<sup>5</sup>C sites on tRNA, such as the m<sup>5</sup>C48 and m<sup>5</sup>C49 sites of tRNA<sup>Val</sup>, the m<sup>5</sup>C48 and m<sup>5</sup>C49 sites of tRNA<sup>Asp</sup>, and the m<sup>5</sup>C48 site of tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>. But Sanger sequencing showed that there was no valid A-to-G/C-to-U mutation detected, which is most likely due to the fact that ALYTEF and YBX1 are mainly responsible for the mRNA m<sup>5</sup>C binding proteins, and thus the DRAM system is more suitable for the mRNA m<sup>5</sup>C detection (Fig. S3). Taken together, the fusion of m<sup>5</sup>C reader and deaminase can effectively and selectively deaminate cytosine/adenine in the vicinity of the mRNA m<sup>5</sup>C sites.</p>

<p>NSUN2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> and NSUN6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, two family members of NOL1/NSUN protein, were both identified as m<sup>5</sup>C methyltransferase of mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. To verify that the detection of DRAM occurs in the presence of m<sup>5</sup>C, we individually depleted NSUN2 and NSUN6 in HEK293T cells and performed DRAM transfection. The knockout efficiency has been confirmed by western blotting (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2E, 2F</xref> and Fig. S4A,4B). It has been previously demonstrated that m<sup>5</sup>C methylation of AP5Z1 and RPSA is catalyzed by NSUN2 and NSUN6, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.

<p>Subsequently, we performed RNA-seq analysis after DRAM transfection by detecting C-to-U/A-to-G editing events to accomplish transcriptome-wide detection of m<sup>5</sup>C (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3A</xref>).

<p>DRAM-seq analysis further confirmed that DRAM was detected in an m<sup>5</sup>C-dependent manner and that mutations in AP5Z1 and RPSA mRNA were reduced in methyltransferase knockout cells compared to wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D, 3E</xref>). Moreover, the knockout cells exhibited overall rare DRAM-seq editing events close to m<sup>5</sup>C sites in other mRNAs (Fig. S6). Unfortunately however due to the inability of the DRAM detection system to achieve m<sup>5</sup>C detection with single base resolution, we did not find sequence preferences for the m<sup>5</sup>C sites responsible for catalysis by each of the two methyltransferases NSUN2 and NSUN6(Fig. S4D).</p>
<p>A comparison of three biological replicates from each experimental group revealed a strong reproducibility of A-to-G/C-to-U mutations in HEK293T cells expressing DRAM-ABE and DRAM-CBE (Fig. S7). Moreover, the integration and analysis of the experimental data revealed a high degree of overlap between the three biological replicates (Fig. S4C). And a recent study by Wang et al. showed that ALYREF deletion affects the expression of 94 mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, and only 55.32% of these ALYREF-regulated mRNAs can be detected by the DRAM system (Fig. S4E). These findings suggest that DRAM selectively targets specific RNAs for editing, exhibiting a high degree of consistency across samples.</p>
<p>To obtain information on a set of high-confidence DRAM-seq data, we filtered the list of sites transfected with deaminase alone and screened the sequencing results with methyltransferase depleted, pooled editing events occurring in at least 10% of reads across multiple samples to obtain a set of high-confidence editing sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref> and Supplementary Table 2), and integrated genes with editing sites occurring in DRAM-ABE and DRAM-CBE (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref> and Supplementary Table 3).</p>
<p>Previous studies have indicated that m<sup>5</sup>C sites are predominantly distributed in the coding sequences (CDS) and notably enriched near the initiation codon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. To further delineate the characteristics of the DRAM-seq data, we compared the distribution of DRAM-seq editing sites within the gene structure, specifically examining their occurrences in the 5’untranslated region (5’UTR), 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR), CDS and Intergenic/Intron region. Our analysis revealed that DRAM-seq editing events in cells expressing DRAM-ABE and DRAM-CBE were primarily located in the CDS and 3’UTR, indicating a non-random distribution of m<sup>5</sup>C (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3G</xref>, Fig. S8A and 8B). Moreover, plotting the distribution of DRAM-seq editing sites in mRNA segments (5’UTR, CDS, and 3’UTR) highlighted a significant enrichment in the CDS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3H</xref>). In contrast, cells expressing the deaminase exhibited a distinct distribution pattern of editing sites, characterized by a prevalence throughout the 3’UTR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3H</xref>). This finding reaffirms that the specific editing pattern observed in DRAM-seq across the transcriptome depends on its capacity to bind m<sup>5</sup>C.</p>
<p>Comparative analysis of the DRAM-seq editing sites with the previously published BS-seq m<sup>5</sup>C sites indicated that the likelihood of editing was notably higher in closer proximity to the m<sup>5</sup>C sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3I</xref>). Furthermore, the editing window of DRAM exhibited enrichment approximately 20bp before and after the m<sup>5</sup>C site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3I</xref>). Investigation into the sequences surrounding the editing window revealed that AC motifs were the most significantly enriched in DRAM-CBE, whereas (U/C) A motifs were most notably enriched in DRAM-ABE. In contrast, the APOBEC1 and TadA-8e samples displayed no significantly enriched motifs, with mutations being more randomly orientated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3J, 3K</xref>).</p>

<title>DRAM-seq provides stable and comprehensive identification of m<sup>5</sup>C loci</title>
<p>Subsequently, we then evaluated the ability of DRAM-seq to detect m<sup>5</sup>C across the entire transcriptome and compared its performance to that of the previously reported BS-seq. Although both previous studies employed bisulfite treatment, the resulting data obtained significant discrepancies due to variations in their treatment and analysis methodologies. Our results indicated that DRAM-seq identified the presence of m<sup>5</sup>C modifications covering 79.6% of the genes detected by Yang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and 91.9% of the genes detected by Zhang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A</xref> and C).

<title>DRAM monitors m<sup>5</sup>C dynamics in cellular RNA</title>
<p>Next, we aim to determine whether changes in m<sup>5</sup>C can be detected in real time by DRAM. Previous studies have established that oxidative stress induced by 200 μM sodium arsenite (NaAsO<sub>2</sub>) treatment inhibited the expression of NSUN2 and NSUN6, resulting in a gradual decrease in m<sup>5</sup>C methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>.

<p>Next, we performed DRAM system assays, and Sanger sequencing results showed that induction of the DRAM system after NaAsO<sub>2</sub> treatment resulted in a highly significant reduction of A-to-G/C-to-U mutations on both RPSA and AP5Z1 mRNAs compared to cells without NaAsO<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5E</xref> and F). Taken together, with our previous evidence that the methyltransferase-deleted cells exhibited overall rare DRAM editing events close to m<sup>5</sup>C sites, we suggest that the DRAM could effectively monitor the accumulation of m<sup>5</sup>C in individual RNAs in response to the alteration of cellular conditions.</p>

<title>DRAM enables low-input m<sup>5</sup>C profiling</title>
<p>A significant challenge in m<sup>5</sup>C detection lies in the specificity of antibodies and the substantial amount of input RNA required for sequencing. RNA is susceptible to degradation during denaturation, sodium bisulfite treatment and desulfurization steps in the BS-seq assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Immunoprecipitation-based m<sup>5</sup>C assays and LC-MS/MS also impose high demand for sample input<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Several experiments have highlighted the requirement of 100-500 ng of RNA for m<sup>5</sup>C-RIP-seq, while BS-seq necessitates an even more demanding 750-1000 ng of RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. To assess the detection limits of DRAM-Sanger, we attempted to amplify two representative m<sup>5</sup>C-containing sites in the RPSA and AP5Z1 transcripts from diluted RNA samples.</p>
<p>Remarkably, we successfully generated PCR products of these two mRNAs from cDNAs corresponding to 250 ng, 50 ng, and 10 ng of total RNA. Quantitative analysis by Sanger sequencing demonstrated nearly identical Sanger traces across these dilutions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5G</xref> and H). This finding underscores that the specificity of DRAM editing depended on its ability to bind m<sup>5</sup>C, and DRAM is proficient in low-input m<sup>5</sup>C analyses. Furthermore, cell viability was determined by CCK8 assay on HEK293T cells transfected with DRAM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5I</xref>). Importantly, there was no significant difference in the relative proliferative capacity of the cells compared to untransfected cells (NC), indicating that DRAM expression did not adversely affect cell viability (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5J</xref>).</p>
<p>Transfection of the DRAM system in cells results in the transient overexpression of fusion proteins. To investigate how varying expression levels of these proteins influence A-to-G and C-to-U editing within the same m<sup>5</sup>C region, we conducted a gradient transfection using plasmid concentrations of 1500 ng, 750 ng and 300 ng. This approach allowed us to progressively reduce the expression levels of the fusion proteins (Fig. S9A and S9B). Sanger sequencing revealed that the editing efficiency of A-to-G and C-to-U within the m<sup>5</sup>C region significantly decreased as fusion protein expression diminished (Fig. S9C and S9D). These findings suggest that the transfection efficiency of the DRAM system is concentration-dependent and that the ratio of editing efficiency to transfection efficiency may assist in the quantitative analysis of m<sup>5</sup>C using the DRAM system.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In recent years, m<sup>5</sup>C methylation modifications have received increasing attention, with multiple reports detailing the distribution of RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation modifications across various species and tissues, elucidating their characteristics. Despite the relatively low abundance of m<sup>5</sup>C, its highly dynamic changes hold significant implications for the regulation of physiological and pathological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. However, due to the limitations of sequencing methods and the variability of data processing, there remains ample room for progress in the study of m<sup>5</sup>C detection methods.</p>
<p>In this study, we developed a site-specific, depth-sequencing-free m<sup>5</sup>C detection method using DRAM-Sanger. This workflow relies on conventional molecular biology assays such as RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing, eliminating the need for specialized techniques and thereby simplifying the process of m<sup>5</sup>C detection.</p>
<p>DRAM-seq introduces a novel strategy for transcriptome-wide m<sup>5</sup>C detection, overcoming inherent limitations in existing methods. Notably, DRAM-seq covered around 80% of the high-confidence m<sup>5</sup>C-modified genes detected by BS-seq and identified more potential m<sup>5</sup>C sites. This can be attributed to the avoidance of bisulfite treatment by DRAM-seq, preventing RNA damage and ensuring a more comprehensive representation of RNA samples. This feature also likely contributes to the observed stability of DRAM-seq in comparison to BS-seq. Additionally, DRAM-seq is not limited by antibody specificity and is resistant to chemical-induced damage.</p>
<p>A prominent challenge in existing m<sup>5</sup>C profiling methods is their reliance on substantial amounts of input RNA samples. In contrast, DRAM operates through the deamination activity of deamination activity of deaminase, preserving RNA integrity and preventing degradation. The notable advantage of DRAM lies in its capacity for low-input m<sup>5</sup>C detection. Our analysis demonstrates that DRAM requires as low as 10ng of total RNA for m<sup>5</sup>C detection. While DRAM is currently well-suited for detecting m<sup>5</sup>C on a transcriptome-wide scale, the potential for future applications involving third-generation sequencing could extend its utility to individual mRNAs, particularly m<sup>5</sup>C heterogeneity on mRNA splicing variants. In addition, the DRAM system depends on the specific recognition of m<sup>5</sup>C modifications on ssRNA by the reader protein, theoretically avoiding the false-positive effects of 5-hydroxymethylation modifications in other assays, such as BS-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. This potential feature could enhance the accuracy of the DRAM assay, albeit it still requires careful validation.</p>
<p>In our study, m<sup>5</sup>C detection was performed following the transient transfection of the DRAM detection system into mammalian cells, which might result in a lower mutation rate at the corresponding site. Therefore, employing lentiviral-mediated transfection into cell lines of interest could potentially enhance the efficiency of m<sup>5</sup>C detection. In the present study, the editing efficiency of the DRAM system, which is believed to detect dynamic changes in m<sup>5</sup>C, was significantly reduced following sodium arsenite treatment. However, sodium arsenite can adversely affect all proteins containing thiol groups, impacting not only NSUN proteins but potentially also the function of reader proteins and deaminases. As a result, this validation cannot entirely rule out the possibility that the observed decrease in editing frequency is due to the inactivation of fusion proteins by sodium arsenite. The optimization of this validation may require the development of more specific m<sup>5</sup>C inhibitors in the future. Further elucidation of the key amino acids directing ALYREF and YBX1’s binding to m<sup>5</sup>C methylation sites should enable more accurate and sensitive m<sup>5</sup>C detection by DRAM-seq. Due to the lack of a fixed base composition for characterizing all m<sup>5</sup>C modification sites, DRAM has an apparent limitation in achieving single-base resolution for detecting m<sup>5</sup>C. However, our present study proved that the measuring resolution of DRAM is around 40nt, which facilitates higher precision than that of m<sup>5</sup>C-RIP-seq (∼100nt). In the future, with more in-depth analyses of m<sup>5</sup>C reader structures and the identification of new potential m<sup>5</sup>C readers, we expect to achieve more precise m<sup>5</sup>C localization and more comprehensive m<sup>5</sup>C modification detection. Moreover, the substitution of deaminases, such as A3A and A3G (the family members of APOBEC), could also potentially enhance the efficiency of the DRAM detection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Following the purification of DRAM fusion protein, achieving <italic>in vitro</italic> detection of RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation could broaden the applicability to a more diverse range of samples. Another potential application for DRAM-seq could be the expression of drug-inducible DRAM systems <italic>in vivo</italic> using various animal models for m<sup>5</sup>C analysis. These will together provide novel insights into m<sup>5</sup>C modifications for biological and clinical research.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In summary, we developed a novel deaminase and reader protein-assisted RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation approach that detects the m<sup>5</sup>C region by deaminating As or Cs in close proximity to the m<sup>5</sup>C sites, which does not rely on antibodies or bisulfite, thus leading to unprecedently comprehensive transcriptome-wide RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation profiling. We anticipated that this system could pave the way for uncovering further biological functions of m<sup>5</sup>C modifications and facilitate the development of therapeutic interventions for associated diseases.</p>

<title>Library construction and next-generation sequencing</title>
<p>1μg of total cellular RNA was used for sequencing library generation by NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA, Catalog #: E7530L) following manufacturer’s recommendations and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Fragmentation was carried out using divalent cations under elevated temperature in NEB Next First Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer(5X). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H). Second-strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. Remaining overhangs was converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities. After adenylation of 3’ ends of DNA fragments, NEB Next Adaptor with hairpin loop structure was ligated to prepare for hybridization. To select cDNA fragments of preferentially 370∼420 bp in length, the library fragments were purified with AMPure XP system (Beverly, USA). Then 3 µL USER Enzyme (NEB, USA) was used with size selected, adaptor-ligated cDNA at 37°C for 15 min followed by 5 min at 95 °C before PCR. Then PCR was performed with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase, Universal PCR primers and Index (X) Primer. At last, PCR products were purified (AMPure XP system) and library quality was assessed on the Agilent 5400 system(Agilent, USA)and quantified by QPCR (library concentration ≥ 1.5 nM). The qualified libraries were pooled and sequenced on Illumina platforms with PE150 strategy in Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd (Beijing, China), according to effective library concentration and data amount required.</p>

<p>This potentially <bold>useful</bold> study introduces an orthogonal approach for detecting RNA modification, without chemical modification of RNA, which often results in RNA degradation and therefore loss of RNA molecules. While the authors have improved the work compared to a previous version, uncertainty regarding false positive and false negative rates leave the evidence for the broad applicability of the method <bold>incomplete</bold>. If properly validated, the approach might be of particular interest for sites where modifications are rare.</p>

<p>The fledgling field of epitranscriptomics has encountered various technical roadblocks with implications as to the validity of early epitranscriptomics mapping data. As a prime example, the low specificity of (supposedly) modification-specific antibodies for the enrichment of modified RNAs, has been ignored for quite some time and is only now recognized for its dismal reproducibility (between different labs), which necessitates the development of alternative methods for modification detection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, early attempts to map individual epitranscriptomes using sequencing-based techniques are largely characterized by the deliberate avoidance of orthogonal approaches aimed at confirming the existence of RNA modifications that have been originally identified.</p>
<p>Improved methodology, the inclusion of various controls, and better mapping algorithms as well as the application of robust statistics for the identification of false-positive RNA modification calls have allowed revisiting original (seminal) publications whose early mapping data allowed making hyperbolic claims about the number, localization and importance of RNA modifications, especially in mRNA. Besides the existence of m6A in mRNA, the detectable incidence of RNA modifications in mRNAs has drastically dropped.</p>
<p>As for m5C, the subject of the manuscript submitted by Zhou et al., its identification in mRNA goes back to Squires et al., 2012 reporting on &gt;10.000 sites in mRNA of a human cancer cell line, followed by intermittent findings reporting on pretty much every number between 0 to &gt; 100.000 m5C sites in different human cell-derived mRNA transcriptomes. The reason for such discrepancy is most likely of a technical nature. Importantly, all studies reporting on actual transcript numbers that were m5C-modified relied on RNA bisulfite sequencing, an NGS-based method, that can discriminate between methylated and non-methylated Cs after chemical deamination of C but not m5C. RNA bisulfite sequencing has a notoriously high background due to deamination artifacts, which occur largely due to incomplete denaturation of double-stranded regions (denaturing-resistant) of RNA molecules. Furthermore, m5C sites in mRNAs have now been mapped to regions that have not only sequence identity but also structural features of tRNAs. Various studies revealed that the highly conserved m5C RNA methyltransferases NSUN2 and NSUN6 do not only accept tRNAs but also other RNAs (including mRNAs) as methylation substrates, which in combination account for most of the RNA bisulfite-mapped m5C sites in human mRNA transcriptomes. Is m5C in mRNA only a result of the Star activity of tRNA or rRNA modification enzymes, or is their low stoichiometry biologically relevant?</p>
<p>
In light of the short-comings of existing tools to robustly determine m5C in transcriptomes, other methods, like DRAM-seq, allowing to map m5C independently of ex situ RNA treatment with chemicals, are needed to arrive at a more solid &quot;ground state&quot;, from which it will be possible to state and test various hypotheses as to the biological function of m5C, especially in lowly abundant RNAs such as mRNA.</p>
<p>Importantly, the identification of &gt;10.000 sites containing m5C increases through DRAM-Seq, increases the number of potential m5C marks in human cancer cells from a couple of 100 (after rigorous post-hoc analysis of RNA bisulfite sequencing data) by orders of magnitude. This begs the question, whether or not the application of these editing tools results in editing artefacts overstating the number of actual m5C sites in the human cancer transcriptome.</p>
<p>Remaining comments after resubmission:</p>
<p>(1) The use of two m5C reader proteins is likely a reason for the high number of edits introduced by the DRAM-Seq method. Both ALYREF and YBX1 are ubiquitous proteins with multiple roles in RNA metabolism including splicing and mRNA export. It is reasonable to assume that both ALYREF and YBX1 bind to many mRNAs that do not contain m5C.</p>
<p>
To substantiate the author's claim that ALYREF or YBX1 binds m5C-modified RNAs to an extent that would allow distinguishing its binding to non-modified RNAs from binding to m5C-modified RNAs, it would be recommendable to provide data on the affinity of these, supposedly proven, m5C readers to non-modified versus m5C-modified RNAs. To do so, this reviewer suggests performing experiments as described in Slama et al., 2020 (doi: 10.1016/j.ymeth.2018.10.020). Mind you that using dot blots like in so many published studies to show modification-specific antibody or protein binding, is insufficient as an argument because no antibody, nor protein encounters nanograms to micrograms of a specific RNA identity in a cell. This issue remains a major caveat in all studies using so-called RNA modification reader proteins as bait for detecting RNA modifications in epitranscriptomics research and becomes a pertinent problem, if used as a platform for base-editing similar to the work presented in this manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) Using sodium arsenite treatment of cells as a means to change the m5C status of transcripts through the downregulation of the two major m5C writer proteins NSUN2 and NSUN6 is problematic and the conclusions from these experiments are not warranted. Sodium arsenite is a chemical that poisons every protein containing thiol groups. Not only do NSUN proteins contain cysteines but also the base editor fusion proteins. Arsenite will inactivate these proteins, hence the editing frequency will drop, as observed in the experiments shown in Figure 5, which the authors explain with fewer m5C sites to be detected by the fusion proteins.</p>
<p>(3) The authors should move high-confidence editing site data contained in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 into one of the main Figures to substantiate what is discussed in Figure 4A. However, the data needs to be visualized in another way then excel format. Furthermore, Supplementary Table 2 does not contain a description of the columns, while Supplementary Table 3 contains a single row with letters and numbers.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>In this manuscript, Zhou et al describe a deaminase and reader protein-assisted RNA m5C sequencing method. The general strategy is similar to DART-seq for m6A sequencing, but the difference is that in DART-seq, m6A sites are always followed by C which can be deaminated by fused APOBEC1 to provide a high resolution of m6A sites, while in the case of m5C, no such obvious conserved motifs for m5C sites exist, therefore, the detection resolution is much lower. In addition, the authors used two known m5C binding proteins ALYREF and YBX1 to guide the fused deaminases, but it is not clear whether these two binding proteins can bind most m5C sites and compete with other m5C binding proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your kind suggestion. RNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses using biotin-labelled oligonucleotides with or without m5C were performed in previous reports (doi:10.1038/cr.2017.55 and doi: 10.1038/s41556-019-0361-y), and the results showed that ALYREF and YBX1 had a more prominent binding ability to m5C -modified oligonucleotides. Moreover, these two m5C -binding proteins are also responsible for mRNA m5C binding, so we chose to use their ability to bind targeted m5C to construct a DRAM detection system in anticipation of transcriptome-wide m5C detection. We hope to propose a suitable detection strategy for RNA m5C, and there will certainly be room for optimization of the DRAM system in the future with more in-depth studies of m5C binding proteins. We have discussed the above issue in lines 75-82 and 315-318.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is well known that two highly modified m5C sites exist in 28S RNA and many m5C sites exist in tRNA, the authors should validate their methods first by detecting these known m5C sites and evaluate the possible false positives in rRNA and tRNA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your kind suggestion. We attempted PCR amplification of sequences flanking m5C sites 3782 and 4447 on 28S rRNA, as well as multiple m5C sites on tRNA, including m5C48 and m5C49 on tRNAVal, m5C48 and m5C49 on tRNAAsp, and m5C48 on tRNALys.</p>
<p>However, Sanger sequencing revealed no valid mutations, which was implemented in Figure S3. We believe this outcome indicates that the DRAM system is more suited for transcriptome-wide m5C detection of mRNAs. This is supported by current reports that ALYREF and YBX1 are responsible for the m5C-binding proteins of mRNAs (doi:10.1038/cr.2017.55 and doi: 10.1038/s41556-019-0361-y). The above results and descriptions were added to lines 136-143.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In mRNA, it is not clear what is the overlap between the technical replicates. In Figures 4A and 4C, they detected more than 10K m5C sites, and most of them did not overlap with sites uncovered by other methods. These numbers are much larger than expected and possibly most of them are false positives.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your kind suggestion. We observed significant overlap between the technical repeats by comparing the data across biological repeats, as shown in Figure S4C and described in lines 174-175. We considered m5C modification in a region only when editing events were detected in at least two biological replicates, ensuring a high-stringency screening process (details seen in the revised method in lines 448-455 and Figure 3F). With more in-depth research into m5C readers, we aim to achieve more accurate detection in the future.</p>

<p>Besides, it is not clear what is the detection sensitivity and accuracy since the method is neither single base resolution nor quantitative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. As shown in Figure 3G, we found that the editing window of the DRAM system exhibited enrichment of approximately 20 bp upstream and downstream of the m5C site. Previous reports identified Type I m5C sites, which tend to have a downstream &quot;NGGG&quot; motif, and Type II m5C sites, which often contain a downstream &quot;UCCA&quot; motif. However, these m5C motifs do not fully characterize all m5C sites, and their presence downstream of an m5C site is not guaranteed (doi: 10.1038/s41594-019-0218-x). This limitation complicates single-base resolution analysis by the DRAM system. Nevertheless, we believe that with further exploration of m5C sequence features, precise single-base resolution detection can be achieved in the future. This point is also discussed in lines 314-322.</p>
<p>Regarding the quantitative level of the assay, we conducted additional experiments by progressively reducing the expression levels of the fusion proteins. Sanger sequencing revealed that the editing efficiency of A-to-G and C-to-U within the m5C region significantly decreased as fusion protein expression diminished (Figure S9). These findings suggest that the DRAM system's transfection efficiency is concentration-dependent and that the ratio of editing efficiency to transfection efficiency could aid in the quantitative analysis of m5C using the DRAM system. The relative results were supplemented in Figure S9 and discussed in lines 263-271.</p>

<p>There are no experiments to show that the detected m5C sites are responsive to the writer proteins such as NSUN2 and NSUN6, and the determination of the motifs of these writer proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your kind suggestion. We have performed a motif enrichment analysis based on the sequences spanning 10 nt upstream and downstream of DRAM-editing sites. The relative results of this analysis were supplemented in Figure S4D and lines 168-171. Unfortunately, we did not identify any clear sequence preferences for the m5C sites catalyzed by the methyltransferases NSUN2 and NSUN6, which have previously been associated with “G”-rich sequences and the “CUCCA” motif. This limitation is mainly due to the DRAM detection system’s inability to achieve single-base resolution for m5C detection, which is also explained in the above response.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>(1) The use of two m5C reader proteins is likely a reason for the high number of edits introduced by the DRAM-Seq method. Both ALYREF and YBX1 are ubiquitous proteins with multiple roles in RNA metabolism including splicing and mRNA export. It is reasonable to assume that both ALYREF and YBX1 bind to many mRNAs that do not contain m5C.</p>
<p>To substantiate the author's claim that ALYREF or YBX1 binds m5C-modified RNAs to an extent that would allow distinguishing its binding to non-modified RNAs from binding to m5C-modified RNAs, it would be recommended to provide data on the affinity of these, supposedly proven, m5C readers to non-modified versus m5C-modified RNAs. To do so, this reviewer suggests performing experiments as described in Slama et al., 2020 (doi: 10.1016/j.ymeth.2018.10.020). However, using dot blots like in so many published studies to show modification of a specific antibody or protein binding, is insufficient as an argument because no antibody, nor protein, encounters nanograms to micrograms of a specific RNA identity in a cell. This issue remains a major caveat in all studies using so-called RNA modification reader proteins as bait for detecting RNA modifications in epitranscriptomics research. It becomes a pertinent problem if used as a platform for base editing similar to the work presented in this manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestion. Previous studies have shown that while ALYREF and YBX1 can bind mRNAs without the m5C modification, their binding affinity for m5C-modified oligonucleotides is significantly higher than for unmethylated controls. This has been demonstrated through experiments such as in vitro tractography, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fcr.2017.55">10.1038/cr.2017.55</ext-link>), and UHPLC-MRM-MS/MS. Additionally, isothermal titration calorimetry measurements and PAR-CLIP experiments have shown that mutations in the key amino acids responsible for m5C binding in ALYREF and YBX1 result in a significant reduction in their ability to m5C (doi: 10.1038/s41556-019-0361-y).</p>
<p>Although Me-RIP analysis was unsuccessful in our laboratory, likely due to the poor specificity of the m5C antibody, we alternatively performed RNA pulldown experiments. These experiments verified that the ability of DRAMmut-expressing proteins to bind RNA with m5C modification was virtually absent compared to DRAM-expressing proteins, while their binding ability with non-modified RNA was not significantly affected. The relative RNA pulldown results were supplemented in Figure S1E, S1F and lines 110-111. Therefore, we believe that by integrating DRAMmut group, our DRAM system could effectively exclude the false-positive mutations caused by unspecific binding of DRAM’s reader protein to non-m5C-modified mRNAs.</p>

<p>(2) Since the authors use a system that results in transient overexpression of base editor fusion proteins, they might introduce advantageous binding of these proteins to RNAs. It is unclear, which promotor is driving construct expression but it stands to reason that part of the data is based on artifacts caused by overexpression. Could the authors attempt testing whether manipulating expression levels of these fusion proteins results in different editing levels at the same RNA substrate?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. To investigate how different expression levels of these proteins influence A-to-G and C-to-U editing within the same m5C region, we conducted a gradient transfection using plasmid concentrations of 1500 ng, 750 ng and 300 ng. This approach allowed us to progressively reduce the expression levels of the fusion proteins. Sanger sequencing revealed that the editing efficiency of A-to-G and C-to-U within the m5C region significantly decreased as fusion protein expression diminished. These findings suggest that the transfection efficiency of the DRAM system is concentration-dependent and that the ratio of editing efficiency to transfection efficiency may assist in the quantitative analysis of m5C using the DRAM system. The relative results and hypotheses were added and discussed in Figure S9 and lines 263-271 of the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(3) Using sodium arsenite treatment of cells as a means to change the m5C status of transcripts through the downregulation of the two major m5C writer proteins NSUN2 and NSUN6 is problematic and the conclusions from these experiments are not warranted. Sodium arsenite is a chemical that poisons every protein containing thiol groups. Not only do NSUN proteins contain cysteines but also the base editor fusion proteins. Arsenite will inactivate these proteins, hence the editing frequency will drop, as observed in the experiments shown in Figure 5, which the authors explain with fewer m5C sites to be detected by the fusion proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We used bisulfite sequencing PCR to determine that the m5C levels in RPSA and AP5Z1 were significantly reduced after sodium arsenite treatment. This was followed by a significant decrease in editing frequency detected by the DRAM system in sodium arsenite-treated samples compared to untreated samples. This reduction aligns with the decreased editing efficiency observed in methyltransferase-deficient cells (as shown in Figures 2G and 2H), which initially convinced us that these results reflected the DRAM system's ability to monitor dynamic changes in m5C levels.</p>
<p>However, as the reviewer pointed out, sodium arsenite treatment could potentially inactivate the fusion proteins, leading to the observed reduction in editing efficiency. This possibility has not been conclusively ruled out in our current experiments. Optimizing this validation may require the future development of more specific m5C inhibitors. In light of this, we have revised our previous results and conclusions in lines 235-244, and discussed these points in lines 308-315.</p>

<p>(4) The authors should move high-confidence editing site data contained in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 into one of the main Figures to substantiate what is discussed in Figure 4A.

<p>(a) To underscore point (1), a recent publication (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-023-05661-y">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-023-05661-y</ext-link>) reported: &quot;To further identify the potential mRNAs regulated by ALYREF, we performed RNA-seq analysis in control or ALYREF knockdown T24 cells. After knockdown of ALYREF, 143 mRNAs differentially expressed, including 94 downregulated mRNAs (NC reads &gt;100, |Fold change | &gt;1.5, P-value &lt;0.05). Functional enrichment analysis using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) indicated that regulated mRNAs by ALYREF are chiefly enriched in canonical cancer-related pathways (Fig. S4A), including TGF-β signaling, MAPK signaling, and NF-κB signaling, strongly supporting the oncogenic function of ALYREF in tumor progression. Among these 94 downregulated genes, 11 mRNA showed a significant reduction in m5C methylation after NUSN2 silencing in T24 cells, combined with previously transcriptome-wide RNA-BisSeq data of T24 cells [21] (Fig. 4A).&quot;</p>
<p>These results translate into 94 mRNAs are regulated by ALYREF in bladder cancer-derived cells. From those, very few (11) mRNA identities respond to NSUN2-dependent RNA methylation mediated by ALYREF binding.The question then arises, is that number sufficient to claim that ALYREF is a m5C-binding protein?</p>
<p>And if so, how does the identification of 10.000+ edits by DRAM-Seq compare with the 94 mRNAs that are regulated by ALYREF? Were these 94 mRNAs identified by DRAM-Seq.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your kind suggestion. Previous reports by Yang et al. ( doi: 10.1038/cr.2017.55), including the literature you refer to, have detailed the close relationship between ALYREF and m5C modification, and the ALY/REF export factor (ALYREF) was identified as the first nuclear m5C reader, and it was demonstrated that many mRNAs are regulated by ALYREF, and is therefore considered to be an m5C-binding protein.</p>
<p>As required, by comparing the DRAM-edited mRNAs with the reported 94 mRNAs, we found that only 55.32% of the 94 mRNAs regulated by ALYREF could be detected by the DRAM system. This indicates that the DRAM system specifically targets certain mRNAs, as illustrated in Figure S4E. The relevant results were described and discussed in lines 175-179.</p>
