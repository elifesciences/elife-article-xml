<abstract>
<p>A third of patients with the pediatric cerebellar tumor Medulloblastoma (MB) have mutations that activate Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling (SHH-MB subgroup). The contribution of secondary mutations to tumor severity, however is not clear. <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations are enriched in the SHH-1 subtype that has the lowest survival rate. Widespread heterozygous loss of <italic>Pten</italic> in two SHH-MB mouse models increases penetrance and excellerates onset of differentiated tumors. We delineated cellular and transcriptional changes that accelerate tumor growth and cause differentiation using a sporadic SHH-MB mouse model expressing oncogenic SmoM2 in rare cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs) and scRNA-seq analysis. Homozygous but not heterozygous sporadic loss of <italic>Pten</italic> resulted in rapid acceleration of tumor growth and end stage disease by 40 days, compared to ∼25% survival in control <italic>SmoM2</italic> mice at 100 days. Heterozygous <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations therefore should negatively impact disease outcome primarily with germline mutations. Loss of <italic>Pten</italic> in normal or SmoM2-expressing GCPs increased proliferation and enhanced progenitor state initially but by 12 days <italic>Pten</italic> mutant <italic>SmoM2</italic> tumors were highly differentiated due to increased survival of non-proliferating GCPs. Furthermore, macrophage infiltration and cytotoxicity appeared reduced in differentiated regions of tumors lacking <italic>Pten</italic>, indicating cell nonautonomous changes could also contribute to accelerated tumor growth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Medulloblastoma (MB) is a brain tumor seen mainly in pediatric patients and which has four molecular subgroups, WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The Sonic hedgehog subgroup of MB (SHH-MB) constitutes approximately 30% of MB and is characterized by mutations that constitutively activate SHH-signaling. Most SHH-MBs have one of four types of mutations that activate SHH-signaling: activating mutations in <italic>SMO</italic>, loss of function mutations in the pathway inhibitors <italic>PTCH1</italic> and <italic>SUFU</italic> or loss of <italic>TP53</italic> in association with amplification of the pathway effectors <italic>GLI2</italic> or <italic>MYCN</italic>. SHH-MB is further divided into four subtypes based on molecular, biological and clinical parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The work on SHH-MB subtypes has highlighted that particular secondary mutations likely contribution to tumor severity. For example, heterozygous <italic>PTEN</italic> and <italic>KMT2D</italic> loss-of-function mutations are enriched in the SHH-1 or beta subtype which has the lowest overall survival rate and highest frequency of metastasis and occurs primarily in infants (&lt;4 years). Our recent work on the chromatin modifier <italic>KMT2D</italic> using two SHH-MB mouse models showed that when one or two copies of <italic>Kmt2d</italic> are deleted, not only is there a nearly two-fold increase in tumor penetrance with a Classic tumor cytoarchitecture (highly proliferative), but strikingly a near 100% penetrance of spinal cord metastasis and hindbrain invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The transcriptional/chromatin landscape of mouse <italic>Kmt2d</italic> mutant SHH-MB primary and metastatic tumors was found to be shifted towards decreased expression of neural differentiation genes and an increase in oncogenes seen in more aggressive tumors compared to tumors with intact <italic>Kmt2d</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Thus, mouse models support the clinical data that loss of <italic>KMT2D</italic> contributes to more aggressive disease.</p>
<p>The gene encoding the dual specificity phosphatase <italic>PTEN</italic> (Phosphatase and TENsin homolog deleted on chromosome 10), is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes in human cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and is mutated in ∼5% of SHH-MB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. PTEN regulates an array of cellular functions, including cell survival, proliferation and metabolism through attenuating phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K-AKT) signaling and genome stability through nuclear functions. Recent work showed that PTEN also can be secreted and act in a cell nonautonomous manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. PTEN is secreted by tumor cells via binding to TMED10 and then binds to PLXDC2 on tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and induces inflammatory status through triggering JAK2-STAT signaling, thus contributing to the tumor suppressor function of PTEN. Mouse models of SHH-MB indicate loss of <italic>Pten</italic> increases tumor incidence, but the underlying cell autonomous and nonautonomous reasons and impact on metastasis are not as clear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>SHH-medulloblastoma arises in <italic>Atoh1</italic>-expressing granule cell precursors (GCPs) on the surface of the developing cerebellum. These precursor cells are dependent on SHH-signaling for their sustained proliferation and major expansion during the first two weeks after birth in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In a mouse model of SHH-MB in which a <italic>NeuroD2</italic> promoter drives expression of an oncogenic form of SMO (SmoA1) in the GCP-lineage, heterozygous loss of <italic>Pten</italic> in all cells (null mutation) or conditional knock-out in Nestin-expressing cells, which includes all cerebellar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, leads to increased penetrance and earlier onset of tumor formation with no increase in metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Whereas most mouse models of SHH-MB have a classic (highly proliferative) histology, the <italic>Pten</italic> heterozygous mutant tumors have a nodular character with extensive regions of neural differentiation (NeuN+ cells) and an apparent decrease in cell death and increase in angiogenesis. In a mouse SHH-MB conditional model in which <italic>Ptch1</italic> is homozygously deleted at embryonic day 14 (E14) in all GCPs (<italic>Atoh1-Cre</italic>), additional homozygous loss of <italic>Pten</italic> leads to rapid tumor formation, and heterozygous loss leads to a slightly more aggressive phenotype than <italic>Ptch1</italic> loss alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Similar to <italic>NeuroD2</italic>-SmoA1 tumors, in <italic>Ptch1</italic> mutant tumors <italic>Pten</italic> loss causes highly differentiated tumors with decreased cell death. In a mutagenic screen for increased SHH-MB penetrance and metastasis using a Sleeping beauty transposon approach in mice with heterozygous mutations in <italic>Ptch1</italic> or <italic>Trp53</italic>, insertions found in tumors with spinal cord metastasis were associated with mutations in <italic>Pten</italic>, <italic>Akt2, Pik3R</italic> and <italic>Igf2,</italic> implicating increased PI3K signaling in metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Consist with this, in a mouse model where <italic>Shh</italic> is expressed in GCPs, additional expression of an activated form of AKT increases tumor incidence and spinal cord metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Data from human tumors support that a reduction in <italic>PTEN</italic> protein enhances tumor progression, since SHH-MB human patients with reduced or no PTEN protein have a worse overall survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. However, no correlation was seen between PTEN protein level and histology or metastasis. Thus, several questions remain as to whether <italic>Pten</italic> loss increases metastasis, what accounts for the faster growth and a more differentiated cellular phenotype in mouse <italic>Pten</italic> mutant SHH-MBs and why only in some models <italic>Pten</italic> heterozygous loss is sufficient to greatly enhance tumor progression.</p>
<p>We addressed these questions by comparing tumor progression and spinal cord metastasis in a sporadic mouse model of SHH-MB in which rare GCPs are induced to express an oncogenic form of SMO, SmoM2, at postnatal day 0 (P0) and have deletion of one or both copies of <italic>Pten</italic>. We found that only homozygous loss of <italic>Pten</italic> combined with SmoM2 expression enhances tumor progression in this sporadic model, and metastasis is not increased. Furthermore, the differentiated phenotype of the tumors is primarily due to a specific decrease in cell death of non-proliferative cells in the tumors, whereas cell death is as high in regions of high proliferation as in <italic>SmoM2</italic> tumors with normal <italic>Pten</italic> or heterozygous loss of <italic>Pten</italic>. Loss of <italic>Pten</italic> in normal GCPs, or those expressing SmoM2, leads to a mild initial increase in the proliferation index, indicating a cell autonomous function of PTEN in reducing proliferation. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis revealed that proliferating tumor cells that lack <italic>Pten</italic> not only have the expected increase in mTOR signaling, but also have altered expression of genes involved in neural differentiation and down regulation of inflammatory and interferon alpha response genes. Homozygous loss of <italic>Pten</italic> in GCPs also leads to a major decrease in infiltration of macrophages into tumors and an altered transcriptome indicating reduced cytotoxicity, revealing a possible cell nonautonomous function of PTEN that normally reduces tumor progression.</p>

<p>Using the cBioPortal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and a dataset of 127 patient samples considered to be SHH-MB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, we determined whether patients with mutations that activate SHH-signaling have <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations. 4.3% of the 127 samples had a mutation in <italic>PTEN</italic> and furthermore 4/5 of the mutations co-occurred with mutations that activate SHH-signaling (<italic>Ptch1</italic>, <italic>SUFU</italic> or <italic>SMO</italic>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).

<title>Homozygous loss of <italic>Pten</italic> in sporadic SHH-MB accelerates growth and increases penetrance to 100%</title>
<p>We next used our mosaic mutant technique (MASTR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> to test the impact of lowering <italic>Pten</italic> in a sporadic mouse model of SHH-MB. The approach involves inducing expression of an oncogenic form of the SHH receptor SMO (SmoM2) and eGFP in ∼20,000 GCPs (∼0.1%) at P0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The model allows penetrance and survival time to be determined since less than 75% of mutant mice die by 100 days. Using the model, we asked whether loss of one or both copies of <italic>Pten</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> in rare GCPs-expressing SmoM2 changes the survival curves of mice by comparing <italic>Atoh1-FlpoER/+</italic>; <italic>R26<sup>MASTR/LSL-SmoM</sup></italic><sup>2</sup> mice (referred to as <italic>SmoM2</italic>) to <italic>Atoh1-FlpoER/+</italic>; <italic>R26<sup>MASTR/LSL-SmoM</sup></italic><sup>2</sup>; <italic>Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (referred to as <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) and <italic>Atoh1-FlpoER/+</italic>; <italic>R26<sup>MASTR/LSL-SmoM</sup></italic><sup>2</sup>; <italic>Pten<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> (referred to as <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/+</sup></italic>) mice administered tamoxifen at P0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Strikingly, all <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice succumbed to disease between P20 and P40, whereas <italic>SmoM2</italic> and <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/+</sup></italic>mice began dying at ∼P40 and by P100 ∼25% of mice of both genotypes survived (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Thus, loss of both <italic>Pten</italic> alleles is required to accelerate tumor progression in a mosaic <italic>SmoM2</italic> model of SHH-MB, unlike a <italic>NeuroD2</italic>-SmoA1 model with germline or broad neural deletion of <italic>Pten</italic> in the cerebellum where heterozygous deletion is sufficient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Homozygous and heterozygous loss of <italic>Pten</italic> does not increase metastasis to the spinal cord in <italic>SmoM2</italic> SHH-MB</title>
<p>Given the different reported findings as to whether <italic>Pten</italic> loss increases metastasis in mouse models of SHH-MB, we asked whether in our sporadic <italic>SmoM2</italic> mice loss of <italic>Pten</italic> alters the frequency of spinal cord metastasis when mice show signs of brain tumor disease. Coronal spinal cord sections of each mouse (n=55-138 sections per mouse) were analyzed by cytology for the presence of spinal cord metastasis and tumors were confirmed with immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for GFP, Ki67 and PTEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). Quantification of the percentage of mice that had at least 2 sections with more than a few tumor cells showed a similar tumor incidence between the three genotypes (<italic>SmoM2</italic>: 64%, n=11; <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/+</sup></italic>: 69%, n=13; <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>: 58%, n=12). Furthermore, quantification of the percentage of spinal cord sections per mouse with tumor cells showed no difference between the <italic>Pten</italic> mutant tumors and <italic>SmoM2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1D</xref>). Likewise, measuring the area of the tumors did not detect a difference in metastatic disease when <italic>Pten</italic> was lowered or deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). Thus, in mouse sporadic <italic>SmoM2</italic> SHH-MB, heterozygous or homozygous loss of <italic>Pten</italic> does not appear to increase spinal cord metastasis.</p>

G-I</xref>) and only <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>tumors lacked PTEN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1.

Staining with markers of cell proliferation (Ki67) and differentiation revealed that whereas <italic>SmoM2</italic> tumors consisted of mostly Ki67+ cells, <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> tumors were highly differentiated expressing the post mitotic marker P27 and neural differentiation marker NeuN with only small areas of proliferative cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-H</xref>). The <italic>SmoM2</italic> tumors had broad expression of the SHH target gene <italic>Gli1</italic>, whereas the <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>tumors expressed <italic>Gli1</italic> mRNA only in Ki67+ regions of the tumors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I-L</xref>), which was complementary to the neural differentiation marker Synaptophysin (SYP/<italic>Syp</italic>) that was absent from <italic>SmoM2</italic> tumors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K-P</xref>). Thus, despite <italic>SmoM2</italic> being expressed in the differentiated cells of the <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>tumors, SHH-signaling is down regulated specifically in differentiated cells. Interestingly, in 3/9 tumors from <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> mice some sections had patches of cells devoid of PTEN and positive for pAKT, indicating spontaneous loss of the second allele of <italic>Pten</italic> in rare cells that expand as a coherent group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2-1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1E-H</xref>). The regions without PTEN in <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> mice had a similar differentiated phenotype (SYP+ and NeuN+) to <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2-1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1I-K</xref>).</p>

<title>Loss of <italic>Pten</italic> leads to rapid cell autonomous changes in SmoM2 GCP behaviors</title>
<p>Given how rapidly the tumors grow in the <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>mice and that lethal disease occurs between P20-40, we asked how early a differential growth phenotype can be seen in the three genotypes. In our previous study of the effect of loss of <italic>Kmt2d</italic> in SHH-MB models, no difference in tumor size was detected at P12 but was by P21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. We therefore asked whether <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> tumors have a growth advantage over <italic>SmoM2</italic> tumors at P12. Staining of sagittal sections of <italic>SmoM2</italic> tumors of the three <italic>Pten</italic> genotypes with EdU (1 hour pulse) and GFP to mark the proliferating GCPs in the external granule cell layer (EGL) showed a massive expansion of the EGL in <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>mice compared to <italic>SmoM2</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A-C</xref>).

<p>One prediction of our findings is that once <italic>SmoM2</italic> GCPs lacking <italic>Pten</italic> differentiate their survival should be enhanced. Therefore, if proliferating GCPs are labeled and then fate mapped for two days, a higher percentage of <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> labeled cells should be differentiated (post-mitotic) compared to in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mice. To test this idea, we administered one injection of BrdU into P10 mice and then sacrificed them at P12 and quantified the percentage of BrdU+ cells in the EGL that were Ki67-(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4P</xref>). As predicted, a higher percentage of BrdU+ cells in <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were Ki67-at P12 compared to <italic>SmoM2</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Q</xref>). This result indicates that by P10 after loss of <italic>Pten</italic> at P0, either differentiation is promoted in <italic>SmoM2</italic> GCPs and/or that the differentiated progeny of GCPs lacking PTEN are spared from cell death. The proliferation rate of GCPs in <italic>SmoM2</italic> and <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were similar at P12 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4R</xref>), as determined by injecting EdU 1 hour before sacrificing the mice (%EdU+ and Ki67+ cells/Ki67+ cells), indicating the latter possibility.</p>
<p>Given that at P12 the cellular phenotype of GCPs in <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice was similar to in mice at end stage, we analyzed GCPs at P8, eight days after the mice were treated with tamoxifen. Similar to at P12, the area of the proliferating EGL of the cerebellum was significantly greater in both the <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and the <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/+</sup></italic>mice compared to <italic>SmoM2</italic>, although the area of the cerebellum was similar across genotypes likely due to the relatively small increase in EGL area (∼2-fold)(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-E</xref>). Quantification of the proliferation rate (%GFP+ and EdU+ cells/total GFP+ cells in the outer EGL (oEGL) of lobule 4/5 (L5) containing proliferating cells (region containing EdU+ cells) was slightly but significantly higher in the <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and the <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/+</sup></italic>mice compared to <italic>SmoM2</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Moreover, the percentage of <italic>Pten</italic> mutant/control (GFP+) cells that remained in the oEGL of all the GFP+ cells in L5 (including those that differentiated) was significantly higher in the two <italic>Pten</italic> mutant genotypes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). This result indicates that loss or reduction of <italic>Pten</italic> initially induces a pro-proliferative or progenitor state in <italic>SmoM2</italic>-expressing GCPs. By P12 however, <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> GCP-lineage cells accumulate more in the EGL than do <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> or <italic>SmoM2</italic> GCPs, in part because there is an accumulation of NeuN+/SYP+ granule cell (GC)-like cells, likely due to a survival advantage of these cells. This survival advantage suggests that the rapid growth of tumors in <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>mice is due to accumulation of GC-like cells and would account for the highly differentiated cytology of end stage tumors.</p>

<title>Loss of <italic>Pten</italic> in <italic>SmoM2</italic> SHH-MB tumor cells results in a cell nonautonomous decrease in macrophage infiltration</title>
<p>Given the low density of dying cells in <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>SHH-MB, we asked whether the tumors have a change in the density of infiltrating macrophages. We previously showed that tumors in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mice have a high infiltration of macrophages ant that they are pro-tumorigenic in a majority of tumors, because reduction of macrophages using PLX5622 treatment leads to a decrease in tumor incidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Staining of cerebellar tumor sections from <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>SmoM2</italic> mice at end stage revealed the expected high infiltration of IBA1+ macrophages in <italic>SmoM2</italic> tumors, but also a striking decrease in macrophage density in tumors lacking <italic>Pten</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-D</xref>). Moreover, co-staining with Ki67 or NeuN showed that in <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice the macrophages were preferentially located in the areas with proliferating cells and thus increased cell death (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C-F</xref>). The decrease in macrophages in the differentiated regions of <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice is not due to a lack of blood vessels, based on CD31 staining of tumors (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G, H</xref>). At P12, in small lesions the macrophages mainly accumulated in the meninges between the lobules but in large lesions they were more concentrated in regions of proliferation in both genotypes and as in end stage were decreased in NeuN+ regions in <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7I-P</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our work delineates cellular and transcriptional changes that lead to greatly accellerated tumor growth when <italic>Pten</italic> is mosaicly removed in GCPs that have activated SHH-signaling due to expression of SmoM2. We uncovered that in both wild type and <italic>SmoM2</italic> GCPs loss of <italic>Pten</italic> results in an initial increase in mitotic rate and likelihood to remain in the progenitor state. As <italic>SmoM2</italic> tumor formation proceeds, tumors lacking <italic>Pten</italic> accumulate differentiated early GC-like cells that are stalled in their differentiation and are protected from cell death. Thus, the bulk of the <italic>Pten</italic> mutant tumors are post mitotic cells. Macrophages seem to avoid or do not readily penetrate the differentiated regions of the tumors, perhaps because there are less dying cells. With possible relevance to human tumors, unlike previous models of <italic>Pten</italic> heterozygous mutant mice that model Cowden Syndrome or hamartoma syndromes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> or ones that involve embryonic conditional loss of <italic>Pten</italic> in all GCPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, we found that heterozygous loss of <italic>Pten</italic> in sporadic GCPs does not result in more aggressive tumors than activating SHH-siganling alone in rare GCPs. Since our model more closely reflects the sporadic nature of human tumor mutations, our results predict that heterozygous loss of <italic>PTEN</italic> will primarily have a negative impact on disease outcome when the mutations are germline (<italic>PTEN<sup>+/-</sup></italic>). If human <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant SHH-MB have a similar differentiated cellular phenotype to mouse models, then targeting such tumors with drugs to kill proliferating cells will not remove the bulk of the tumor and will require the drugs having access to the rare proliferating GCP-like tumor stem-like cells.</p>
<p>We found that loss or reduction of <italic>Pten</italic> in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mice initially increases expansion of proliferating GCPs through increased proliferation and decreased differentiation such that by P8 (one week after gene mutation at P0) the EGL is expanded in <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> and <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice compared to <italic>SmoM2</italic>. By P12, however the EGL expansion is greatly exhanced only in <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>mice, and this is accompanied by an abundance of differentiated cells and a significant reduction in cell death. Our label retention assay involving BrdU injection at P10 revealed that a greater proportion of BrdU<sup>+</sup> <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>GCPs were Ki67<sup>-</sup> at P12 than in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mice. This result indicates either that by P10 the loss of <italic>Pten</italic> results in an increase in differentiation of GCPs compared to in <italic>SmoM2</italic> mice, which would be consistent with our scRNA-seq analysis, but also likely due to a greater survival of the differentiated cells since the density of TUNEL<sup>+</sup> particles is reduced in the EGL of <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice at P12. Consistent with this, it was shown that NeuN+ cells in SHH-MB tumors preferentially die compared to proliferating or quiescent tumor cells in a <italic>Ptch1</italic> mutant model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. This previous result is the opposite to what we observed in late stage <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> tumors where the proliferative comparments of the tumors has greater cell death than the NeuN<sup>+</sup> or SYP<sup>+</sup> regions, and a similar density of TUNEL particles to in <italic>SmoM2</italic> tumors. Thus, a key reason for the accelerated tumor growth in <italic>Pten</italic> mutant SHH-MB models is the survival of the differentiated compartment.</p>
<p>In a mouse <italic>NeuroD2-SmoA1</italic> model of SHH-MB <italic>Pten</italic> heterozygosity leads to earlier onset of disease and a differentiated/nodular cellular phenotype when <italic>Pten</italic> is deleted in the germline or conditionally throughout the brain (<italic>Nestin-Cre</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Heterozygous loss of <italic>Pten</italic> in GCPs using an <italic>Atoh1-Cre</italic> transgene to delete <italic>Pten<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ptch1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>apparently also slightly increases the time of onset and produces a differentiated phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In contrast, in our sporadic SHH-MB model (<italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/+</sup></italic>) where only rare GCPs lack one copy of <italic>Pten</italic> (and express <italic>SmoM2</italic>), the time of onset and penetrance are not accelerated and the tumors have a classic histology. Only in rare <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> clones of cells in a minority of tumors where PTEN protein is lacking, likely due to loss of heterozygosity, did we observe a differentiated phenotype with reduced cell death as seen in <italic>SmoM2-Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. The difference in the outcome of our model and the other two is either because of the SHH-activating mutations (SmoM2 vs SmoA1 expression or <italic>Ptch1</italic> loss) or more likely because when all GCPs lack a copy of <italic>Pten</italic> and have activated SHH-signaling that the microenvironemnt provides an advantage for <italic>Pten</italic> heterozygous cells to form a differentiated tumor. It is also possible that another cell type targeted by the other two <italic>Cre</italic> transgenes (<italic>Netstin</italic> and <italic>Atoh1</italic>) supports tumor growth when <italic>Pten</italic> loss is heterozygous.</p>
<p>A previous study provided evidence that increased mTOR signaling in SHH-MB promotes spinal cord metastasis by expressing <italic>Shh</italic> in GCPs along with an activated form of AKT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, in our sporadic model and the two other models of <italic>Pten</italic> loss in mouse SHH-MB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, spinal cord metastasis is not increased. Thus it appears that the way in which the mTOR pathway is activates affects metastasis. Perhaps related to this, in a model of <italic>Trp53</italic> heterozygous loss and <italic>Rictor</italic> homozygous loss, which reduces pAKT, GCPs were found to persist longer than normal in the EGL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, which is the same as what we found when <italic>Pten</italic> was deleted. Thus, the way the pathway downstream of PTEN is altered disctates the subsequent behavior of the mutant GCPs.</p>
<p>In our previous study we showed that in <italic>Kmt2d</italic> mutant SHH-MB models, no difference in tumor size was detected at P12 but by P21 tumors lacking one or two copies of <italic>Kmt2d</italic> were more than twice the size of those with intact <italic>Kmt2d</italic> and had a classic cytoarchitecture. Thus, there is a delayed positive effect of reducing/ablating this chromatin modifier gene on tumor growth rate compared to loss of <italic>Pten</italic> where there is a rapid expansion of the EGL. Another major difference between secondary loss of the two tumor suppressors in SHH-MB is that <italic>Kmt2d</italic> mutant tumors have nearly fully penetrant spinal cord metastasis. Thus, continued mechanistic studies in mouse models of recurrent mutations seen in SHH-MB should provide valuable insights into how the disease is expected to progress and provide ideas for development of targeted therapies based on the cellular phenotypes of tumors not just the signaling pathways altered.</p>

Except for <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Syp,</italic> antisense riboprobes were labeled with UTP-digoxigenin using a DIG RNA labeling mix (Sigma-Aldrich) with PCR-amplified templates prepared from cDNA synthesized from an early postnatal mouse cerebellum lysate. Signal was detected with alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-digoxigenin antibodies using BM purple (Sigma-Aldrich) as the substrate. The primers used for PCR amplification were based on the Allen Brain Atlas. <italic>Gli1</italic> RNA in situ was performed using an antisense RNA probe made from a plasmid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and for <italic>Syp</italic> BioMatik generanted a plasmid in Bluescript containing <italic>Syp</italic> sequences using the primers described in the Key Resources Table. Primers were flanked in the 3’ with SP6 (antisense) and 5’ with T3 (sense) promoters. Primers for RNA in situ probes are listed in Key Resources Table.</p>

<title>Microscopy, image processing, and analyses</title>
<p>Images were acquired with a DM6000 Leica fluorescent microscope (Leica Camera, Wetzlar, Germany) or NanoZoomer Digital Pathology microscope (Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan) and were processed and analyzed using Fiji<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> or Photoshop (Adobe Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Cell counts were manually obtained using the Cell Counter plugin for Fiji or semi-automated using a custom script using the Analyze Particle plugin for Fiji as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The same region of the brain was analyzed in each animal for each assay, and the regions are stated in the figure legends. For early postnatal stages, sections near the midline were analyzed. For analysis of tumors, they were done on lateral sections.</p>

Then the tumors were dissociated in Papain (Worthington) for 30 minutes at 37°C before being washed out in Ovalbumin (Worthington). Tumors were triturated by pipetting up and down using a P1000 and filtered through a 40µm cell strainer (Falcon). Once the cells were dissociated, the dead cells were removed using the kit EasySep Dead Cell Removal (Annexin V) (StemCell). Then cells were centrifuged at 500g at 4°C for 5 minutes. Cells were then washed with PBS. For every sample (2 <italic>SmoM2</italic> and 2 <italic>SmoM2 Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>), cells were counted using 0.2% Trypan on hemocytometer and diluted before loading to 10X chip, targeting 10,000 viable cells per sample. The scRNA-Seq of tumor cell suspensions was performed on a Chromium instrument (10X genomics) following the user guide manual for 3’ v3.1. Final libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 by the IGO core of MSKCC.</p>

<title>scRNA-seq data analysis</title>
<p>The Cell Ranger Single Cell software suite (10x Genomics) was used to align reads and generate feature-barcode matrices. The reference genome used was the Genome Reference Consortium Mouse Build 38 (GRCm38, Gencode annotation mm10). Raw reads were processed using the Cell Ranger count program using default parameters.</p>
<p>Seurat v5.0.2 package was used to generate a UMI (unique molecular identifier) count matrix from the Cell Ranger output<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Genes expressed in less than 10 cells were removed for further analyses. Cells with larger than 18000 UMIs, 0.20 mitoRatio, UMI≤500 and ≤500 genes detected were considered low quality/outliers and discarded from the datasets. Normalization was performed on individual samples using the NormalizeData function with default parameters. The normalized data was scaled by ScaleData function with mitochondrial gene percentage regressed out. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the scaled data by runPCA. Samples were then integrated using IntegrateLayers function with the Harmony Integration method. The first 20 dimensions were used for the FindNeighbors function, and clusters were identified using the FindClusters function with a resolution of 0.5. Data were projected onto the 2D space using the FindUMAP or RunUMAP function with 20 dimensions. Cluster markers and further differential gene expression analyses were performed using normalized counts (NormalizeData) in the RNA assay. Cluster markers were identified using the FindAllMarkers and comparing markers generated to the literature. To refine clustering further, the SubsetData function was used to create a new Seurat object, and the above clustering was reiterated.</p>
<p>Differential gene expression analyses between genotypes or clusters were performed using the FindMarkers function in the Seurat package. Genes with an adjusted <italic>P</italic> value (<italic>Padj</italic>) &lt; 0.05 were considered significantly up or downregulated. Results were visualized by Violin plot and Umap plot using Seurat package, and Volcano plot using the EnhancedVolcano package on Bioconductor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. GSEA analysis on GO and Hallmark terms were performed using the enrichGO, clusterProfiler packages on Bioconductor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. To build a pseudotime trajectory using the UMAP data, the Seurat object was converted to a monocle 3 (1.3.7) object by as.cell_data_set function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Cells were then clustered by the cluster cells function. The trajectory GCP-lineage partition was constructed using learn graph function followed by order cells function.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study provides insights into the role of Pten mutations in SHH-medulloblastoma, by using mouse models to resolve the effects of heterozygous vs homozygous mutations on proliferation and cell death throughout tumorigenesis. The experiments presented are <bold>convincing</bold>, with rigorous quantifications and orthogonal experimentation provided throughout, and the models employing sporadic oncogene induction, rather than EGL-wide genetic modifications, represent an advancement in experimental design. However, additional experimentation focused on a greater characterization of macrophage phenotypes (e.g., microglia vs circulating monocytes) would enhance this study. The work will be of interest to medical biologists studying general cancer mechanisms, as the function of Pten may be similar across tumor types.</p>

<p>This study investigates how Pten loss influences medulloblastoma development in mouse models of Shh-driven MB. Previous studies have shown that Pten heterozygosity can accelerate tumorigenesis in models where the entire GNP compartment harbours MB-promoting mutations, raising questions about how Pten levels and context interact, especially when MB-initiating mutations occur sporadically in the cerebellum. Here, the authors create an allelic series combining sporadic, cell-autonomous induction of oncogenic SmoM2 with Pten loss in granule neuron progenitors. In contrast to previous studies, Pten heterozygosity does not significantly impact tumour development from sporadic SmoM2 induction, whereas complete Pten loss accelerates tumour onset. Analysis of Pten-deficient tumours reveals accumulation of death-resistant differentiated cells and reduced macrophage infiltration. At early stages, Pten-deficient pre-tumour cells exhibit increased proliferation and EGL hyperplasia, indicating that Pten loss drives proliferation but shifts cells towards differentiation.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>This study raises the bar for modelling and interpreting the effects of secondary mutations on MB development. It is carefully executed, and the models-using sporadic oncogene induction rather than EGL-wide genetic manipulations-represent an advance in experimental design. The deeper phenotyping, including single-cell RNA-seq and target validation, adds rigor. This work extends previous work on ShhMB and Pten by showing that Pten heterozygosity in GNPs is likely not responsible for the accelerated tumour development reported in earlier studies. The evolution of these Pten-deficient tumours from proliferative to post-mitotic and death-resistant is an important observation with potential clinical significance.</p>
<p>Minor weakness</p>
<p>The absence of an effect of Pten heterozygosity on tumour development in their model suggests non-cell-autonomous effects, but this is not directly demonstrated. Changes in macrophage recruitment warrant further exploration and represent an interesting avenue for future investigation.</p>

<p>The authors sought to answer several questions about the role of the tumor suppressor PTEN in SHH-medulloblastoma formation. Namely, whether Pten loss increases metastasis, understanding why Pten loss accelerates tumor growth, and the effect of single-copy vs double-copy loss on tumorigenesis. Using an elegant mouse model, the authors found that Pten mutations do not increase metastasis in a SmoD2-driven SHH-medullolbastoma mouse model, based on extensive characterization of the presence of spinal cord metastases. Upon examining the cellular phenotype of Pten-null tumors in the cerebellum, the authors made the interesting and puzzling observation that Pten loss increased the differentiation state of the tumor, with less cycling cells, seemingly in contrast to the higher penetrance and decreased latency of tumor growth.</p>
<p>The authors then examined the rate of cell death in the tumor. Interestingly, Pten-null tumors had less dying cells, as assessed by TUNEL. In addition, the tumors expressed differentiaton markers NeuN and SyP, which are rare in SHH-MB mouse models. This reduction in dying cells is also evident at earlier stages of tumor growth. By looking shortly after Pten-loss induction, the authors found that Pten loss had an immediate impact on increasing the proliferative state of GCPs, followed by enhancing survival of differentiated cells. These two pro-tumor features together account for the increased penetrance and decreased latency of the model. While heterozygous loss of Pten also promoted proliferation, it did not protect against cell death.</p>
<p>
Interestingly, loss of Pten alone in GCPs caused an increase in cerebellar size throughout development. The authors suggest that Pten normally constrants GCP proliferation, although they did not check whether reduced cell death is also contributing to cerebellum size.</p>
<p>Lastly, the authors examined macrophage infiltration and found that there was less macrophage infiltration to the Pten-null tumors. Using scRNA-seq, they suggest that the observed reduction in macrophages might be due to immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.</p>
<p>This mouse model will be of high relevance to the medulloblastoma community, as current models do not reflect the heterogeneity of the disease. In addition, the elegant experimentation into Pten function may be relevant to cancer biologists outside of the medulloblastoma field.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The in-depth characterisation of the mouse model is a major strength of the study, including multiple time points and quantifications. The single-cell sequencing adds a nice molecular feature, and this dataset may be relevant to other researchers with specific questions of Pten function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Adequately addressed in revisions.</p>

<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>This valuable study provides insights into the role of Pten mutations in SHH-medulloblastoma, by using mouse models to resolve the effects of heterozygous vs homozygous mutations on proliferation and cell death throughout tumorigenesis. The experiments presented are convincing, with rigorous quantifications and orthogonal experimentation provided throughout, and the models employing sporadic oncogene induction, rather than EGL-wide genetic modifications, represent an advancement in experimental design. However, the study remains incomplete, such that the biological conclusions do not extend greatly from those in the extant literature; this could be addressed with additional experimentation focused on cell cycle kinetic changes at early stages, as well as greater characterization of macrophage phenotypes (e.g., microglia vs circulating monocytes). The work will be of interest to medical biologists studying general cancer mechanisms, as the function of Pten may be similar across tumor types.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the summary of the importance of our work and agree that it provides a foundation for future experiments addressing underlying mechanisms including the role of macrophages in tumor progression/regression</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper investigates how Pten loss influences the development of medulloblastoma using mouse models of Shh-driven MB. Previous studies have shown that Pten heterozygosity can accelerate tumorigenesis in models where the entire GNP compartment has MB-promoting mutations, raising questions about how Pten levels and context interact, especially when cancer-causing mutations are more sporadic. Here, the authors create an allelic series combining sporadic, cell-autonomous induction of SmoM2 with Pten loss in granule neuron progenitors. In their models, Pten heterozygosity does not significantly impact tumor development, whereas complete Pten loss accelerates tumour onset. Notably, Pten-deficient tumours accumulate differentiated cells, reduced cell death, and decreased macrophage infiltration. At early stages, before tumour establishment, they observe EGL hyperplasia and more pre-tumour cells in S phase, leading them to suggest that Pten loss initially drives proliferation but later shifts towards differentiation and accumulation of death-resistant, postmitotic cells. Overall, this is a well-executed and technically elegant study that confirms and extends earlier findings with more refined models. The phenotyping is strong, but the mechanistic insight is limited, especially with respect to dosage effects and macrophage biology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is carefully executed, and the models-using sporadic oncogene induction rather than EGL-wide genetic manipulations-represent an advance in experimental design. The deeper phenotyping, including singlecell RNA-seq and target validation, adds rigor.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The biological conclusions largely confirm findings from previous studies (Castellino et al, 2010; Metcalf et al, 2013), showing that germline or conditional Pten heterozygosity accelerates tumorigenesis, generates tumors with a very similar phenotype, including abundant postmitotic cells, and reduced cell death.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully would like to point out that we have added new insights not covered in the previous more abbreviated studies. First, we are the first to show that in a sporadic model, heterozygous loss of Pten does not lead to accelerated or more aggressive disease. This is an important finding, since this is the case for many patients and only germline PTEN mutant humans are likely to have more aggressive tumors. Also, the previous studies did not examine tumor progress by analyzing neonatal stages or analyze spinal cord metastasis. We found a different phenotype at some early stages then at end stage, thus they provide new insights. Our study also is the only one to apply a mosaic analysis to study cell behaviors at early stages of progression, including proliferation and differentiation/survival. We are also the first to demonstrate a reduction in macrophages in Pten mutant SHH-MB.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The second stated goal - to understand why Pten dosage might matter - remains underdeveloped. The difference between earlier models using EGL-wide SmoA1 or Ptch loss versus sporadic cell-autonomous SmoM2 induction and Pten loss in this study could reflect model-specific effects or non-cell-autonomous contributions from Pten-deficient neighbouring cells in the EGL, for example. However, the study does not explore these possibilities. For instance, examining germline Pten loss in the sporadic SmoM2 context could have provided insight into whether dosage effects are cell-autonomous or dependent on the context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting this experiment and agree it would be an informative one for other groups to perform as a follow up to our work to allow a direct comparison in the same sporadic SHH-MB model of mosaic vs germline loss of Pten. Also, we would like to point out that we do show a dosage effect of lowering vs removing Pten when only sporadic GCPs also have an activating mutation in SMO. Please see above comments for additional new mechanistic insight we have provided.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The observations on macrophages are intriguing but preliminary. The reduction in Iba1+ cells could reflect changes in microglia, barrier-associated macrophages, or infiltrating peripheral macrophages, but these populations are not distinguished. Moreover, the functional relevance of these immune changes for tumor initiation or progression remains unexplored.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree, further studies of the influence of Pten mutations on macrophage phenotypes will be interesting.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One weakness of the study was the examination of the macrophage phenotype, which did not include quantification (only single images), so it is difficult to assess whether this reduction of macrophages holds true across multiple samples. Future studies will also be needed to assess whether Pten-mutated patient medulloblastomas also have a differentiation phenotype, but this is difficult to assess given the low number of samples worldwide.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the importance of our sporadic mutant approach and new findings. As stated above, we agree, further studies of the influence of Pten mutations on macrophage phenotypes will be interesting as well as of human samples once large numbers can be obtained. All conclusions about macrophages are based on analyzing 3 independent tumors/genotype, which was stated in the Figure legends, and for all end stage tumors the sections were collected from one lateral edge of the tumor to the midline and for earlier stage from one side of the brain to the other, thus we believe the reported phenotypes are consistent within tumor and stages</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Minor points</p>
<p>(1) The authors should state explicitly that early EGL analyses sample the same cerebellar region across animals (e.g., matched lobule or distance from the midline) because position-dependent effects are possible.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree this is an important aspect of the rigor of the study and are sorry this was not clear enough. We had stated in the legends to Figures 4 and 5 that midline sections were analyzed and when it was not the entire EGL quantified the region analyzed was shown, but we now include more details in all relevant Figure legends and in the Methods section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It is not clear from Figure 3i-k that TUNEL density in Syp-high regions differs between Pten+/- and Pten-/- tumors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added a new graph as Figure 3 Supplemental Figure 1D with this direct comparison. Indeed, there is no difference between the Syp-high regions of Pten+/- and Pten-/- tumors as these regions of Pten+/- tumors have no detectable PTEN protein and thus have the same behavior as Pten-/- tumors (reduced cell death).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors interpret the increase in the %EdU+ GFP+ cells in the EGL as evidence of a faster cell cycle. However, EdU labeling alone does not demonstrate altered cell cycle kinetics; this would require a dedicated assay. It would also be informative to combine EdU with Ki67 staining. This could clarify whether the effect reflects changes in differentiation - for example, if a higher proportion of GFP+ pre-tumor cells remain Ki67+-or whether the increase in EdU simply reflects a greater fraction of cells being in cycle. Such an analysis might even reveal no change in cycling if the proliferation index in controls is lower.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry we did not make our analysis sufficiently clear in Figure 5 and Figure 6. The quantification of EdU+ cells was restricted to the outer EGL (region defined by containing GFP+ and EdU+ cells) where all cells should be Ki67+.  We cannot perform co-staining of Ki67 and GFP, since antigen retrieval for Ki67 removes the epitope for our GFP antibody. We have revised the wording in the figure legends and results sections.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Some of the stains are unconvincing - for example, Figure 2 E,F, the p27 staining is difficult to distinguish from the background, Figure 7G,E- CD31+ blood vessels are difficult to see.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As requested, in Fig. 2 we adjusted the level of the green color for P27 to reduce the background in A, B, E , F using Photoshop. In Fig. 7G, H we adjusted the level of the green color for CD31 to reduce the background.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Line 158: &quot;unlike a SmoA2 model with germline or broad deletion of Pten in the cerebellum, where heterozygous deletion is sufficient...&quot; That paper refers to the Neuro-D2SmoA1 mouse model. So this statement should be clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have made this edit.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) I find the final discussion paragraph about Kmt2d does not add much to the study, as it seems obvious that the mechanisms of tumor formation would differ between two different tumor suppressor genes, but this is only my opinion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully think it is interesting, even if expected, so have left it in the Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) There is also a typo on line 342 that changes the meaning of the sentence: mTORC1 signaling is significantly 'unregulated';</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this mistake. We have changed 'unregulated' to ‘upregulated’.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 9Q,R mislabeled: not mTORC1, but instead UPR</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Asns is included in the mTOR pathway in Hallmark MTOR1 signaling as well as in the Unfolded Protein Response gene list. We have made a note of this in the Figure legend.</p>
