<title>Abstract</title><p>The β-catenin-dependent canonical Wnt signaling is pivotal in organ development, tissue homeostasis, and cancer. Here we identified an upstream enhancer of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic>, named ieCtnnb1, that is crucial for intestinal homeostasis. ieCtnnb1 is predominantly active in the base of small intestinal crypts and throughout the epithelia of large intestine. Knockout of ieCtnnb1 led to a reduction in <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> transcription, compromising the canonical Wnt signaling in intestinal crypts. Single-cell sequencing revealed that ieCtnnb1 knockout altered epithelial compositions and potentially compromised functions of small intestinal crypts. While deletion of ieCtnnb1 hampered epithelial turnovers in physiologic conditions, it prevented occurrence and progression of Wnt/β- catenin-driven colorectal cancers. Human ieCTNNB1 drove reporter gene expression in a pattern highly similar to mouse ieCtnnb1. ieCTNNB1 contains a single-nucleotide polymorphism associated with <italic>CTNNB1</italic> expression levels in human gastrointestinal epithelia. The enhancer activity of ieCTNNB1 in colorectal cancer tissues was stronger than that in adjacent normal tissues. HNF4α and phosphorylated CREB1 were identified as key trans-factors binding to ieCTNNB1 and regulating <italic>CTNNB1</italic> transcription. Together, these findings unveil an enhancer-dependent mechanism controlling the dosage of Wnt signaling and homeostasis in intestinal epithelia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium, a high turnover organ, contains multiple cell types to fulfill complex functions including food digestion, nutrient absorption, pathogen insulation and clearance, as well as endocrine roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kurokawa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Noah et al., 2011</xref>). Enterocytes (ECs) constitute ∼90% of all differentiated cells and function as highly efficient cells for absorbing nutrients and water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Snoeck et al., 2005</xref>). Goblet cells (GCs) produce mucus to lubricate the mucosal surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gustafsson &amp; Johansson, 2022</xref>). Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) sense luminal nutrients and secrete peptide hormones to regulate appetite, intestinal motility, and insulin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gribble &amp; Reimann, 2019</xref>). Tuft cells (TCs) are chemosensory cells that respond to various stimuli including infections and hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Schneider et al., 2019</xref>). The crypts of GI epithelium harbor various types of stem cells that continually replenish lost epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ramadan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">van der Flier &amp; Clevers, 2009</xref>). While the prevailing belief is that <italic>Lgr5</italic>-expressing crypt base columnar (CBC) cells are actively dividing stem cells and <italic>Bmi</italic>-expressing &quot; +4 &quot; cells (positioned four cells above the base of the crypt) are slowly cycling stem cells, it’s important to note that crypt cells have the capacity for fate reprogramming and de-differentiation to sustain regenerative capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Beumer &amp; Clevers, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Metcalfe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yan et al., 2012</xref>). Intestinal stem cells generate transit-amplifying cells (TACs), which undergo multiple cell divisions and differentiate into all intestinal lineages while migrating towards the crypt orifice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Krausova &amp; Korinek, 2014</xref>). In addition to stem and progenitor cells, the base of small intestinal crypts contains Paneth cells (PCs) that secret antimicrobial peptides, called defensins, thereby contributing to host defense against microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barreto et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lueschow &amp; McElroy, 2020</xref>). PCs also contribute to the stem cell niche function, <italic>e.g.</italic> secreting Wnt ligands, to maintain epithelial homeostasis of the small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sato et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The behavior of crypt cells is precisely regulated by multiple signals, which can act sequentially, additively, synergistically, or antagonistically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nakamura et al., 2007</xref>). Among them, the Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway represents the principal force governing intestinal epithelium homeostasis, particularly in the preservation of stem cell proliferation and multipotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Clevers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mah et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pinto et al., 2003</xref>). Upon Wnt ligand binding, the β-catenin degradation complex is inactivated, leading to accumulation of β-catenin and its translocation into the nucleus, where it works with the co-activator TCF-4 to turn on the transcription of a plethora of target genes, including <italic>c-Myc</italic>, <italic>CCND1</italic>, <italic>AXIN2</italic>, and <italic>CD44</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Clevers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Clevers &amp; Nusse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nusse &amp; Clevers, 2017</xref>). Inhibition of Wnt ligand secretion reduced number of functional stem cells and led to a faster crypt fixation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Huels et al., 2018</xref>). In the process of aging, reduced Wnt signaling in stem cells and the niche of intestinal crypts causes inhibition of proliferation and reduced numbers of intestinal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nalapareddy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pentinmikko et al., 2019</xref>). The Wnt signal is also essential for commitment, maturation, and location of PCs and other secretory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andreu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">van Es et al., 2005</xref>). On the other hand, Wnt, EGF and Delta-like 1/4 ligands presented by PCs sustained CBCs’ proliferative states and the production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sato et al., 2011</xref>). Although the Wnt signal dosage, largely <italic>via</italic> post-translational regulations, controls early lineage specification, hematopoiesis, and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bakker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Luis et al., 2011</xref>), it remains elusive how Wnt signaling dosage, particularly through the transcriptional control of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic>, regulates composition and function of intestinal epithelia.</p>
<p>Aberrant activation of canonical Wnt signaling is associated with GI cancers, most notably colorectal cancer (CRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhu &amp; Li, 2023</xref>). Germinal mutations of the <italic>APC</italic> gene, which encodes the negative regulator of β-catenin, underlie the Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), a hereditary neoplastic syndrome and the pre-cancerous condition for CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cheng et al., 2019</xref><bold>; J. </bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, <italic>APC</italic> is mutated in up to 80% of human sporadic CRCs (<bold>J. </bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Inactivation of APC causes enhanced accumulation of β-catenin in nuclei and subsequent activation of proliferative and pro-survival signals in CRC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>). However, largely due to lack of specificity, no molecular therapeutic strategy targeting the pathway has been incorporated into CRC treatment. Interestingly, the transcriptional activity of <italic>CTNNB1</italic>, the coding gene for β-catenin, is also enhanced in CRCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Terrin et al., 2017</xref>); however, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Dissecting it would facilitate the development of new Wnt/β- catenin targeting means to treat CRC.</p>
<p>Enhancers are essential <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory DNA elements that control spatiotemporal gene expressions during cell fate specification and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pachano et al., 2022</xref>). Active enhancers are often associated with cell fate specifiers, mostly transcription factors (TFs), and are enriched with specific histone modification such as H3K27ac (acetylated lysine 27 of histone H3) and H3K4me1 (mono-methylated lysine 4) of histone H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jindal &amp; Farley, 2021</xref>). Importantly, variations of enhancer sequences often lead to aberrant gene silence and activation, thereby causing developmental anomalies and cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kvon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sengupta &amp; George, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zabidi &amp; Stark, 2016</xref>). Although numerous putative enhancers have been identified by high- throughput studies, only a fraction of them were functionally annotated.</p>
<p>The proper expression of essential fate genes in different cell types is often controlled by specific enhancers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kvon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pachano et al., 2022</xref>). We previously identified a neocortical enhancer of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic>, the coding gene of β- catenin. The enhancer – neCtnnb1, is specifically active in the subventricular zone of developing neocortex and regulates the abundance of intermediate progenitors and production of superficial-layer pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Here we have identified an intestinal enhancer for <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> and name it as ieCtnnb1. Reporter mice showed that ieCtnnb1 is predominantly active in the base of small intestinal crypts and across the epithelium of large intestine. Knockout of ieCtnnb1 slows down turnovers of intestinal epithelia at physiology and cancer conditions in a Wnt/β-catenin dependent manner. The human ieCTNNB1 contains a SNP that is associated with <italic>CTNNB1</italic> expression levels in human gastrointestinal epithelia. The enhancer activity of ieCTNNB1 in CRC tissues is higher than that in adjacent normal tissues and positively correlates with <italic>CTNNB1</italic> expression levels. HNF4α and phosphorylated CREB1 at serine 133 (p-S133-CREB1) were found to associate with ieCtnnb1 and regulate <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> transcription.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>ieCtnnb1 is a gastrointestinal enhancer of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic></title>
<p>We previously identified an evolutionarily conserved upstream enhancer for <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> – neCtnnb1, which regulates neocortical neurogenesis <bold>(Figure 1 - figure supplement 1A</bold>). We reasoned that there might be other potential enhancer regions that control <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> expression in a cell-specific manner. Therefore, we scanned upstream regions of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> for active enhancer properties – open chromatin with enriched H3K27ac and H3K4me1 – in different tissues using data retrieved from the ENCODE database. Interestingly, we noticed that a region that is 29,068 base pair (bp) upstream of the transcription starting site (TSS) for <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> displayed typical enhancer feature in intestinal tissues and resides in the same topologically associating domain (TAD) with <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 2A</bold>). The region, named as ieCtnnb1 (intestinal <underline>e</underline>nhancer of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic>), is at open chromatin status (DNase I hypersensitive site) and enriched with H3K27ac and H3K4me1, two histone marks for active enhancers, in 8-week-old mouse small intestine tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Importantly, the enrichment of H3K27ac at ieCtnnb1 is also prominent in embryonic intestine and stomach tissue, as well as in adult kidney and liver (<bold>Figure 1</bold> - <bold>figure supplement 1B and D</bold>). In contrast, the enrichment was not detected in non-gastrointestinal tissues such as embryonic and adult brain (<bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 1D</bold>). In line with signatures of active enhancers, the enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 at ieCtnnb1 is negligible in all examined tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 1B and C</bold>).</p>

<p>We next performed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses to validate ieCtnnb1’s enhancer activity. First, the 2,153 bp core region (CR), representing the H3K27ac peak region of ieCtnnb1, could drive the expression of luciferase reporter in multiple cell types (<bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 2B</bold>). Second, the ieCtnnb1 reporter mice (<italic>H11<sup>i.enh</sup></italic>) were constructed by inserting the reporter cassette – 5’-<italic>Shh</italic>’s promoter-ieCtnnb1-CR-<italic>LacZ</italic>-<italic>iCre</italic>-3’ – into the <italic>H11</italic> locus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1B</xref>). Of note, the <italic>Shh</italic> promoter alone at the <italic>H11</italic> locus did not drive the expression of reporter gene in all examined tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kvon et al., 2020</xref>). Wholemount β-galactosidase (β-gal) staining of 8-week-old tissues revealed prominent ieCtnnb1-<italic>LacZ</italic> signals along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The signal exhibited a proximal-low to distal-high gradient, with the ileum, cecum, and colon showing the strongest signals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1B</xref>, <bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 2C</bold>). The stomach and proximal duodenum also displayed reporter activity driven by ieCtnnb1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1B</xref>, <bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 2C</bold>). β-gal staining of intestinal sections revealed that the ieCtnnb1-<italic>LacZ</italic> signal could be visualized at the bottom of small intestinal crypts and in the entire large intestinal epithelia, but is absent in sections of liver, kidney, and spleen (<bold>Figure 1</bold> - <bold>figure supplement 2D and data not shown</bold>). Interestingly, the proximal- low to distal-high gradient of ieCtnnb1-<italic>LacZ</italic> signal along the small intestine corresponds to the expression pattern of β-catenin (<bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 2E</bold>).</p>
<p>The transcription activity of ieCtnnb1 is strongest at the bottom of crypts, where <italic>Lgr5</italic>-expressing CBC cells and Paneth cells (PCs) reside. To more precisely elucidate cell types in which ieCtnnb1 is active, we crossed <italic>H11<sup>i.enh</sup></italic>mice with <italic>Lgr5</italic>-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2 (<italic>Lgr5</italic>-EGFP) mice to obtain 8-week-old <italic>H11<sup>i.enh</sup></italic>;<italic>Lgr5-EGFP</italic> mice. Small intestinal crypts were respectively harvested from <italic>Lgr5-EGFP</italic> and <italic>H11<sup>i.enh</sup></italic>;<italic>Lgr5-EGFP</italic> mice followed by enrichment of both eGFP+ and eGFP- cells (<bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 2F</bold>). Quantitative RT- PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses indicated that <italic>LacZ</italic> transcripts could be detected in both eGFP+ and eGFP- crypt cells in <italic>H11<sup>i.enh</sup></italic>;<italic>Lgr5-EGFP</italic> mice (<bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 2F</bold>). Next, sections of <italic>H11<sup>i.enh</sup></italic> crypts were subjected with β-gal staining followed by immunohistochemistry of OLFM4 (a CBC marker) or lysozyme (a PC marker). Data showed X-gal signals are in close proximity with both OLFM4 and lysozyme (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1C</xref>), suggesting that the activity of ieCtnnb1 is present in both CBCs and PCs.</p>
<p>We further examined the ieCtnnb1 activity in GI tracts of postnatal day 7 (P7) pups, when GI epithelia are rapidly expanding. The ieCtnnb1-<italic>LacZ</italic> signals could be visualized in epithelia of P7 small and large intestines, aligning well with the distribution of canonical Wnt signaling illustrated by the BAT-Gal mice (<bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 2G and H</bold>). Together, ieCtnnb1 drives transcription in embryonic intestinal epithelia, the base of small intestinal crypts and large intestinal epithelia of adult mice.</p>

<title>ieCtnnb1 maintains the expression of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> in intestinal epithelia</title>
<p>We next examined whether ieCtnnb1 controls the transcription of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> in intestinal epithelia. For this purpose, we employed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to delete the genomic region containing ieCtnnb1 (<bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 2I</bold>). Homozygous ieCtnnb1 knockout (<italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic>) mice were born in Mendelian ratios and thrived through adulthood. Interestingly, the body weight of 8-week-old male <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic> mice was slightly but significantly lighter than that of wildtype controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1D and F</xref>), but the length of small and large intestines of <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic> mice was comparable to that of control mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1E, G and H</xref>). We then collected crypts from small and large intestine, finding that the expression levels of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> were decreased by 26.5% and 22.3% respectively in <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic> crypts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1I and J</xref>). In contrast, the expression level of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> in the <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic> liver remained unaltered (<bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 2J</bold>). In addition, the expression of genes located in the same TAD as <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> and ieCtnnb1, including <italic>Ulk4</italic>, <italic>Rpl14</italic> and <italic>Entpd3</italic>, was not changed in <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic> small intestinal crypts (<bold>Figure 1 - figure supplement 2K</bold>). These data suggest that ieCtnnb1 specifically maintains <italic>Ctnnb1</italic>’s transcription in intestinal epithelia.</p>
<p>In epithelial tissues, most β-Catenin is localized at cell adhesion sites to maintain barrier integrity, while a smaller fraction translocates into the nucleus to active transcription upon Wnt ligand binding. We therefore carried out nuclear/cytosol fractionation assays, which revealed a more substantial decrease in the level of nuclear β-Catenin compared to cytosolic β-Catenin (49.5% versus 29.8%) in small intestinal crypts of <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1K and L</xref>). RNA-seq transcriptome and RT-qPCR analyses revealed a significant reduction in the expression levels of components in the Wnt signaling pathway, as well as Wnt target genes, in <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic>crypts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1M and N</xref>). Together, the loss of ieCtnnb1 undermined the Wnt signaling in intestinal epithelia by reducing <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> transcription.</p>

<title>Loss of ieCtnnb1 altered cellular composition and expression profiles of small intestinal crypts</title>
<p>The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for the construction and homeostasis of intestinal epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mah et al., 2016</xref>). Because ieCtnnb1 maintains the expression level of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> of intestinal crypts, we investigated how the deletion of ieCtnnb1 affects cellular components and functions of intestinal crypts. We performed single-cell sequencing on EpCAM+ epithelial cells from small intestinal crypts of 10-week-old <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic> and control (<italic>H11<sup>i.enh</sup></italic>) mice (n = 2 female mice for each genotype) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2A</xref>, <bold>Figure 2 - figure supplement 1A</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ayyaz et al., 2019</xref>). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was employed for dimensionality reduction to cluster cells, then well-established marker genes were mapped onto the UMAP representation to designate cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Haber et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2B</xref>, <bold>Figure 2 - figure supplement 1B-D</bold>). A small population of crypt cells could not be clearly defined probably due to certain technical issues during crypt extraction, antibody staining, or cell sorting (<bold>Figure 2 - figure supplement 1D</bold>). First, in accordance with bulk RNA-seq and RT-qPCR results, the expression levels of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> were downregulated in almost all <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic> crypt cells, and the expression of <italic>Axin2</italic> was decreased in CBCs and TACs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2C and D</xref>). Second, the proportion of PCs was decreased by 49.2% in <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic> crypts, which was confirmed by the immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of <italic>Defensin 5α</italic>, a PC marker (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2E and F</xref>). The ieCtnnb1-driving <italic>LacZ</italic> could be detected in the PC cluster (n = 4 10-week-old mice) (<bold>Figure 2 - figure supplement 1E</bold>). Accordingly, the expression levels of examined PC markers – <italic>Lyz1</italic>, <italic>Pla2g2a</italic>, <italic>Wnt3</italic> and <italic>Math1</italic> - were all significantly compromised in <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic> crypts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2G</xref>). The number of goblet cells (GCs) was slightly (not statistically significant) reduced upon loss of ieCtnnb1 (<bold>Figure 2 - figure supplement 1F</bold>). Third, the proliferative capability of CSCs and TACs were compromised in <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic> crypts, as the proportion of G2/M cells and the expression of <italic>Mki67</italic> were decreased in the two cell types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2H-J</xref>). Consistently, the numbers of Ki67-positive cells and EdU-labeled cells (4 hours pulse) were decreased by 16.1% and 21.9%, respectively, in <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic> small intestinal epithelia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2K and L</xref>). Fourth, in secretory cells (PCs GCs and EECs), as well as enterocytes/absorptive cells (mature enterocytes (mECs) and immature enterocytes (imECs)), and stem cells of <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic> crypts, the expression of genes related to secretory functions including <italic>Lyz1</italic>, <italic>Ang4</italic>, <italic>Muc2</italic>, and <italic>Mmp7</italic> was decreased. In contrast, the expression of markers for absorptive cells such as <italic>Fabp6</italic>, <italic>Apoa1</italic>, <italic>Fabp2</italic>, and <italic>Reg3b</italic> was elevated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2M and N</xref>, <bold>Figure 2 - figure supplement 1G</bold>). Accordingly, gene ontology (GO) analyses showed in stem cells and secretory cells of <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic> crypts, upregulated genes were enriched with terms associated with absorptive functions including ribosome biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation; whereas downregulated genes in stem cells and secretory cells were respectively enriched with terms related to cell division and secretory functions (<bold>Figure 2 - figure supplement 1H and I</bold>).

<p>In summary, the loss of ieCtnnb1 results in a reduction in the number of PCs, compromises stem cell proliferation, and disrupts the expression of genes related to secretory and absorptive functions. These effects could be attributed to a combination of reduced Wnt/β-catenin signaling and dysregulated crosstalk among crypt cells.</p>

<title>ieCtnnb1 deletion inhibits tumorigenesis of intestinal cancers by suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling</title>
<p>Tumorigenesis of most colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhu &amp; Li, 2023</xref>). To investigate whether knockout of ieCtnnb1 could suppress the carcinogenesis of Wnt-driven intestinal tumors, we crossbred <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic> mice with <italic>Apc<sup>Min/+</sup></italic> mice. In <italic>Apc<sup>Min/+</sup></italic>mice, a nonsense mutation of the <italic>Apc</italic> gene results in the translation of truncated and dysfunction APC protein, leading to failed degradation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. <italic>Apc<sup>Min/+</sup></italic> mice spontaneously develop intestinal tumors due to enhanced canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the intestinal epithelia, particularly in stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Su et al., 1992</xref>). The survival period of <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic>;<italic>Apc<sup>Min/+</sup></italic>mice (median survival - 255 days) was significantly longer than the <italic>Apc<sup>Min/+</sup></italic> mice (median survival - 165 days), with the former having a heavier body weight (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure. 3A and C</xref>). Strikingly, the <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic>;<italic>Apc<sup>Min/+</sup></italic> mice barely grow colorectal cancers and have much fewer intestinal tumors compared to <italic>Apc<sup>Min/+</sup></italic>mice, with significantly smaller tumor area (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure. 3B, D-F</xref>, <bold>Figure 3 - figure supplement 1A-C</bold>). IHC analyses showed that tumors in <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic>;<italic>Apc<sup>Min/+</sup></italic> large and small intestines had much fewer Ki67+ proliferating cells, expressed significant less β-catenin, but contained more Muc2-expressing Goblet cells, suggesting <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic>;<italic>Apc<sup>Min/+</sup></italic>tumors behave like normal epithelia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure. 3G-L</xref>, <bold>Figure 3 - figure supplement 1D-I</bold>).

Thus, ablation of ieCtnnb1 deters tumorigenesis of intestinal cancers by suppressing the Wnt signaling.</p>

<title>HNF4α and p-S133-CREB1 bind to ieCTNNB1 and maintains the expression of <italic>CTNNB1</italic></title>
<p>Characterizing associated trans-factors of ieCtnnb1 and ieCTNNB1 is essential for revealing related transcriptional mechanisms and holds clinical relevance. By examining Cistrome Data Browser for ChIP-seq data, eight trans- factors were found to associate with ieCTNNB1 in human colorectal cancer cells or ieCtnnb1 in mouse GI tissues (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure. 6A</xref>, <bold>Figure 6 - figure supplement 1A</bold>). Moreover, they are relatively highly expressed and/or have positive correlation with <italic>CTNNB1</italic>’s expression in colon cancer samples. We then transduced shRNAs-expressing plasmids into HCT-15 cells to individually down-regulate their expressions, revealing that decreasing the expression of <italic>CREB1</italic> (cAMP responsive element binding protein 1) or <italic>HNF4A</italic> (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha) could compromise <italic>CTNNB1</italic>’s transcription (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure. 6B</xref>, <bold>Figure 6 - figure supplement 1B</bold>). Of note, HNF4α plays crucial roles in the normal development of the colon and the maintenance of epithelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cattin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Garrison et al., 2006</xref>). The phosphorylation of CREB1 at serine 133 (p-S133-CREB1) is essential for its role in activation of gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carlezon et al., 2005</xref>). ChIP-qPCR experiments showed that enrichment of p-S133-CREB1 was more prominent than CREB1 at ieCtnnb1 in small intestinal crypts and at ieCTNNB1 in HCT-15 cells (<bold>data not shown</bold>). Notably, HNF4α and p-S133-CREB1 bind to multiple subregions of ieCTNNB1 and ieCtnnb1, as well as the promoters of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> and <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> (<italic>pCTNNB1</italic> and <italic>pCtnnb1</italic>) in HCT-15 cells and small intestinal crypts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure. 6C and D</xref>, <bold>Figure 6 - figure supplement 1C and D</bold>). By analyzing the GEIPA-COAD (colon adenocarcinoma) and READ (rectum adenocarcinoma) database, expression levels of <italic>CREB1</italic> and <italic>HNF4A</italic> were found to be significantly higher in colon and rectum cancer samples than those of normal tissues (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure. 6E</xref>). Furthermore, expression levels of <italic>CREB1</italic> and <italic>HNF4A</italic> positively correlated with that of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure. 6F</xref>). HNF4α and p-S133-CREB1 were significantly enriched at the promoter of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> in <italic>Apc</italic> mutation induced colon cancer tissues (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure. 6G and H</xref>). Intriguingly, knockout of ieCtnnb1 greatly diminished the association of HNF4α and p-S133-CREB1 with <italic>Ctnnb1</italic>’s promoter (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure. 6G and H</xref>). In summary, HNF4α and p-S133-CREB1 were identified as essential trans-factors that bind to ieCTNNB1 and maintain <italic>CTNNB1</italic>’s expression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The intestinal epithelia replenish themselves rapidly throughout lifetime, which enables regeneration while predisposes to GI cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Clevers, 2013</xref>). The optimal strength and dynamics of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is central to both homeostasis and tumorigenesis of GI tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Beumer &amp; Clevers, 2016</xref><bold>; </bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pinto et al., 2003</xref><bold>; Silvia Maretto, 2003</bold>). While the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin is the key step for Wnt signaling activation, the transcriptional control of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> could be another layer of regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhang &amp; Wang, 2020</xref>). Here we unveiled an enhancer-dependent transcriptional machinery that tunes expressions of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> in multiple cell types of intestinal crypts, thereby balancing homeostasis and tumorigenesis of intestinal epithelia (<bold>Figure supplement 8</bold>).</p>
<p>Our findings reinforce the notion that the canonical Wnt signaling is required for the establishment of the secretory cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pinto &amp; Clevers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pinto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">van Es et al., 2005</xref>). Expression levels of markers for secretory cells were greatly reduced whereas levels of markers for absorptive cells were elevated in all small intestinal crypt cells of <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic> mice. Fate determinations of CBC daughter cells occur upon leaving the stem cell niche, exposed to changing WNT, Notch and EGF levels. Progenitors losing contact with PC Notch ligands upregulate DLL1 and DLL4, commit to the secretory lineage, and induce Notch activity in neighboring cells, promoting enterocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beumer &amp; Clevers, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">van Es et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>WNT signaling not only directs PC-fated progenitors toward the crypt bottom but also directly induces their differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andreu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beumer &amp; Clevers, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">van Es et al., 2005</xref>). Single-cell sequencing and reporter gene analyses indicated that the activity of ieCtnnb1 is present in PCs. Knockout of ieCtnnb1 decreases number of PCs by almost 50% but the pool size of CBCs was not significantly altered. A previous study showed that genetic removal of PCs leads to the concomitant loss of Lgr5+ stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sato et al., 2011</xref>), while other studies indicated that PCs are not mandatory niche cells for the intestinal epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Durand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Garabedian et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Although Wnt ligands provided by PCs may support Lgr5+ CBCs<sup>32</sup>, essential Wnt ligands are primarily supplied by subepithelial stromal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Degirmenci et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Shoshkes-Carmel et al., 2018</xref>). The presence of redundancy at the stem cell niche enhances the accuracy in maintaining intestinal homeostasis.</p>
<p>ieCtnnb1 knockout compromises Wnt signaling dosage, leading to PC loss, dysregulation of genes controlling absorptive and secretory functions of intestinal epithelia, and reduced proliferation of stem cells. These combined effects could account for the lighter body weight observed in adult <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic>mice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, colon and small intestinal tumors were rarely observed in <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup>;Apc<sup>Min/+</sup></italic> mice. Among the few <italic>Ctnnb1<sup>Δi.enh</sup></italic> tumors analyzed, they exhibited lower <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> expression, reduced proliferation, and behaved more like normal intestinal epithelia. Different truncations or mutations of <italic>APC</italic> lead to specific tumor types throughout the body in a Wnt/β-catenin dosage- dependent manner. For example, although <italic>Apc<sup>1638N</sup></italic>;<italic>Ctnnb1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice were less prone to GI cancers, <italic>Apc<sup>1638N</sup></italic>;<italic>Ctnnb1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>female animals tended to grow breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bakker et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, the intestinal specificity of ieCtnnb1 makes it an ideal target to lower the strength of Wnt signaling in treating colorectal cancer without affecting other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hamdan &amp; Johnsen, 2019</xref><bold>; Orouji, 2022</bold>).</p>
<p>Both mouse ieCtnnb1 and human ieCTNNB1 were able to drive reporter gene expression at the base of small intestinal crypts and throughout the epithelium of the large intestine. Very intriguingly, unlike the highly conserved neCtnnb1 sequence among amniotes, mouse ieCtnnb1 and human ieCTNNB1 do not share significant homology in primary sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Nonetheless, both ieCtnnb1 and ieCTNNB1 localize at the intergenic region 30- 40 kb upstream of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic>’s promoter. Moreover, both ieCtnnb1 and ieCTNNB1 contain binding motifs for HNF4α and CREB1. HNF4α and p-S133-CREB1 were found to associate with ieCtnnb1 and <italic>Ctnnb1</italic>’s promoter to maintain <italic>Ctnnb1</italic>’s expression. These findings support the notion that conserved TF binding motifs stabilize and preserve enhancer functionality over evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zabidi &amp; Stark, 2016</xref>). Future studies could dissect how sequence variations of ieCtnnb1 are adapted to intestinal homeostasis of different species.</p>

<title>Bulk RNA sequencing</title>
<p>RNA-seq and data analyses were performed at Novogene Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). Crypt cells or tumor tissues were harvested and total RNAs were extracted. RNA integrity was assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). RNA-seq library construction was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, first strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H-). Second strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. Then, the library fragments were purified with AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA). Then PCR was performed with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase, Universal PCR primers and Index (X) Primer. At last, PCR products were purified (AMPure XP system). The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumia) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq platform and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated.</p>

<title>Bulk RNA-seq data processing</title>
<p>For data analysis, raw data of fastq format were firstly processed through in- house perl scripts. In this step, clean data were obtained by removing reads containing adapter, reads containing ploy-N and low-quality reads from raw data. Index of the reference genome was built using Hisat2 v2.0.5 and paired- end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using Hisat2 v2.0.5. featureCounts v1.5.0-p3 was used to count reads numbers mapped to each gene. Differential expression analysis of two groups was performed using the DESeq2 R package (1.20.0). The resulting P-values were adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg’s approach for controlling the false discovery rate.</p>
<p>Genes with an adjusted P-value &lt;0.05 found by DESeq2 were assigned as differentially expressed. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes was implemented by the clusterProfiler R package, in which gene length bias was corrected. clusterProfiler R package was also used to test the statistical enrichment of differential expression genes in KEGG pathways. Local version of the GSEA analysis tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp">http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp</ext-link>), GO, KEGG, Reactome, DO and DisGeNET data sets were used for GSEA independently.</p>

<title>Single-Cell RNA sequencing and data analysis</title>
<p>ScRNA-seq and data analysis were performed at Novogene Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). The protoplast suspension was loaded into Chromium microfluidic chips with 30 chemistry (v2 or v3) and barcoded with a 10× Chromium Controller (10X Genomics). RNA from the barcoded cells was subsequently reverse-transcribed and sequencing libraries constructed with reagents from a Chromium Single Cell 30 v2 reagent kit (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was performed with Illumina HiSeq 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For data analysis, we use FastQC to perform basic statistics on the quality of the raw reads. Raw reads were demultiplexed and mapped to the reference genome by 10X Genomics Cell Ranger pipeline using default parameters. All downstream single-cell analyses were performed using Cell Ranger and Seurat unless mentioned specifically. In brief, for each gene and each cell barcode (filtered by CellRanger), unique molecule identifiers were counted to construct digital expression matrices. Secondary filtration by Seurat: a gene with expression in more than 3 cells was considered as expressed, and each cell was required to have at least 200 expressed genes.</p>

<title>Hi-C data analysis</title>
<p>Hi-C data analysis completed by Frasergen Medicine Co., Ltd (Wuhan, China). Hi-C data of BALB/c mice large intestinal epithelial cells were provided by Dr. Gen Zheng(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zheng et al., 2023</xref>). The Hi-C data of SW480 cells was obtained from deposited data(Orouji, 2022). According to the reported method, the dynamic changes of TAD structures can be explored by calculating the relative signal values of TAD boundaries. TAD boundaries that are common among individuals and are not within the 2 Mb range of chromosomal ends were included, followed by filtering out boundaries with interactions less than 10 in the 2 Mb upstream and downstream regions. The ratio of the interaction between the boundary and its 2 Mb upstream and downstream regions were calculated using log2 to obtain the signal value of the TAD boundary, then the minimum value was subtracted from it to finally obtain the distribution of the relative signal value of each sample TAD boundary.</p>

All ChIP-seq raw fastq data were removed of adaptor sequence. Cutadapt (version 1.16) was used with the parameters -u 3 -u −10 -U 3 -U -10 -m 30. Cleaned reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) using bowtie2 (version 2.4.4) with default settings. The CrossMap (0.6.5) package was used as a conversion between different versions of the human genome (hg19 and hg38). We calculated the normalized RPM (reads per million mapped reads) of ChIP-seq signal at ieCTNNB1 and <italic>CTNNB1</italic> promoter. Briefly, reads aligned to the specified region were calculated with bedtools multicov command. These reads were normalized with RPM.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Ctnnb1 encodes β-catenin, an essential component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. In this study, the authors identify an upstream enhancer of Ctnnb1 responsible for the specific expression level of β-catenin in the gastrointestinal tract. Deletion of this promoter in mice and analyses of its association with human colorectal tumors support that it controls the dosage of Wnt signaling critical to the homeostasis in intestinal epithelia and colorectal cancers.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study has provided convincing evidence to demonstrate the functions of a gastrointestinal enhancer of Ctnnb1 using combined approaches of bioinformatics, genomics, in vitro cell culture models, mouse genetics, and human genetics. The results support the idea that the dosage of Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays an important role in the pathophysiological functions of intestinal epithelia. The experimental designs are solid and the data presented are of high quality. This study significantly contributes to the research fields of Wnt signaling, tissue-specific enhancers, and intestinal homeostasis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One weakness of this manuscript is an insufficient discussion on the Ctnnb1 enhancers for different tissues. For example, do specific DNA motifs and transcriptional factors contribute to the tissue-specificity of the neocortical and gastrointestinal enhancers? It is also worth discussing the potential molecular mechanisms controlling the gastrointestinal expression of Ctnnb1 in different species since the identified human and mouse enhancers don't seem to share significant similarities in primary sequences.</p>

<p>Wnt signaling is the name given to a cell-communication mechanism that cells employ to inform on each other's position and identity during development. In cells that receive the Wnt signal from the extracellular environment, intracellular changes are triggered that cause the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, a protein that can turn on groups of genes referred to as Wnt targets. Typically these are genes involved in cell proliferation. Genetic mutations that affect Wnt signaling components can therefore affect tissue expansion. Loss of function of APC is a drastic example: APC is part of the β-catenin destruction complex, and in its absence, β-catenin protein is not degraded and constitutively turns on proliferation genes, causing cancers in the colon and rectum. And here lies the importance of the finding: β-catenin has for long been considered to be regulated almost exclusively by tuning its protein turnover. In this article, a new aspect is revealed: Ctnnb1, the gene encoding for β-catenin, possesses tissue-specific regulation with transcriptional enhancers in its vicinity that drive its upregulation in intestinal stem cells. The observation that there is more active β-catenin in colorectal tumors not only because the broken APC cannot degrade it, but also because transcription of the Ctnnb1 gene occurs at higher rates, is novel and potentially game-changing. As genomic regulatory regions can be targeted, one could now envision that mutational approaches aimed at dampening Ctnnb1 transcription could be a viable additional strategy to treat Wnt-driven tumors.</p>

<p>The authors of this paper identify an enhancer upstream of the Ctnnb1 gene that selectively enhances expression in intestinal cells. This enhancer sequence drives expression of a reporter gene in the intestine and knockout of this enhancer attenuates Ctnnb1 expression in the intestine while protecting mice from intestinal cancers. The human counterpart of this enhancer sequence is functional and involved in tumorigenesis. Overall, this is an excellent example of how to fully characterize a cell-specific enhancer. The strength of the study is the thorough nature of the analysis and the relevance of the data to the development of intestinal tumors in both mice and humans. A minor weakness is that the loss of this enhancer does not completely compromise the expression of the Ctnnb1 gene in the intestine, suggesting that other elements are likely involved. Adding some discussion on that point would be helpful.</p>

<p>This important study identifies a novel gastrointestinal enhancer of Ctnnb1. The authors present convincing evidence to support their claim that the dosage of Wnt/β-catenin signaling controlled by this enhancer is critical to intestinal epithelia homeostasis and the progression of colorectal cancers. The study will be of interest to biomedical researchers interested in Wnt signaling, tissue-specific enhancers, intestinal homeostasis, and colon cancer.</p>

<p>We greatly appreciate editors’ and reviewers’ extensive and constructive comments and suggestions. We will do our utmost to revise the manuscript accordingly.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review)</bold>:</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Ctnnb1 encodes β-catenin, an essential component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. In this study, the authors identify an upstream enhancer of Ctnnb1 responsible for the specific expression level of β-catenin in the gastrointestinal tract. Deletion of this promoter in mice and analyses of its association with human colorectal tumors support that it controls the dosage of Wnt signaling critical to the homeostasis in intestinal epithelia and colorectal cancers.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study has provided convincing evidence to demonstrate the functions of a gastrointestinal enhancer of Ctnnb1 using combined approaches of bioinformatics, genomics, in vitro cell culture models, mouse genetics, and human genetics. The results support the idea that the dosage of Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays an important role in the pathophysiological functions of intestinal epithelia. The experimental designs are solid and the data presented are of high quality. This study significantly contributes to the research fields of Wnt signaling, tissue-specific enhancers, and intestinal homeostasis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One weakness of this manuscript is an insufficient discussion on the Ctnnb1 enhancers for different tissues. For example, do specific DNA motifs and transcriptional factors contribute to the tissue-specificity of the neocortical and gastrointestinal enhancers? It is also worth discussing the potential molecular mechanisms controlling the gastrointestinal expression of Ctnnb1 in different species since the identified human and mouse enhancers don't seem to share significant similarities in primary sequences.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the manuscript lacks sufficient discussions on how enhancers control cell-type-specific expressions of target genes, which is one of the most important questions in the field of transcription regulation. Equally important are the common and species-specific features of this regulation. In general, motif composition, location, order, and affinity with trans-factors within enhancers are four key elements. We will elaborate the point in follow-up revision.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Wnt signaling is the name given to a cell-communication mechanism that cells employ to inform on each other's position and identity during development. In cells that receive the Wnt signal from the extracellular environment, intracellular changes are triggered that cause the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, a protein that can turn on groups of genes referred to as Wnt targets. Typically these are genes involved in cell proliferation. Genetic mutations that affect Wnt signaling components can therefore affect tissue expansion. Loss of function of APC is a drastic example: APC is part of the β-catenin destruction complex, and in its absence, β-catenin protein is not degraded and constitutively turns on proliferation genes, causing cancers in the colon and rectum. And here lies the importance of the finding: β-catenin has for long been considered to be regulated almost exclusively by tuning its protein turnover. In this article, a new aspect is revealed: Ctnnb1, the gene encoding for β-catenin, possesses tissue-specific regulation with transcriptional enhancers in its vicinity that drive its upregulation in intestinal stem cells. The observation that there is more active β-catenin in colorectal tumors not only because the broken APC cannot degrade it, but also because transcription of the Ctnnb1 gene occurs at higher rates, is novel and potentially game-changing. As genomic regulatory regions can be targeted, one could now envision that mutational approaches aimed at dampening Ctnnb1 transcription could be a viable additional strategy to treat Wnt-driven tumors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for acknowledging the potential significance represented by the manuscript. We also recognize that targeting genomic regulatory regions to dampen Ctnnb1 transcription could be a promising strategy for treating Wnt-driven tumors, including many colorectal carcinomas. However, we would like to point out that three are significant technical challenges associated with AAV delivery to the GI epithelium, including the hostile environment, immune response, and low delivery efficiency.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors of this paper identify an enhancer upstream of the Ctnnb1 gene that selectively enhances expression in intestinal cells. This enhancer sequence drives expression of a reporter gene in the intestine and knockout of this enhancer attenuates Ctnnb1 expression in the intestine while protecting mice from intestinal cancers. The human counterpart of this enhancer sequence is functional and involved in tumorigenesis. Overall, this is an excellent example of how to fully characterize a cell-specific enhancer. The strength of the study is the thorough nature of the analysis and the relevance of the data to the development of intestinal tumors in both mice and humans. A minor weakness is that the loss of this enhancer does not completely compromise the expression of the Ctnnb1 gene in the intestine, suggesting that other elements are likely involved. Adding some discussion on that point would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are quite encouraged by the reviewer’s positive comments. We agree with the reviewer that other cis-regulatory elements may be involved in the transcription of Ctnnb1 within the GI epithelium. It is also possible that the basal transcription of Ctnnb1 within the GI epithelium is relatively high, and that enhancers can only boost transcription within a certain range. We will discuss these possibilities in the revision.</p>
