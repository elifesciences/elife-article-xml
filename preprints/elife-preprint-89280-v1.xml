<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Plant pathogens secrete proteins, known as effectors, that function in the apoplast or inside plant cells to promote virulence. Effector detection by cell-surface or cytosolic receptors results in the activation of defence pathways and plant immunity. Despite their importance, our general understanding of fungal effector function and detection by immunity receptors remains poor. One complication often associated with effectors is their high sequence diversity and lack of identifiable sequence motifs precluding prediction of structure or function. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated that fungal effectors can be grouped into structural classes, despite significant sequence variation and existence across taxonomic groups. Using protein x-ray crystallography, we identify a new structural class of effectors hidden within the secreted in xylem (SIX) effectors from <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>lycopersici</italic> (<italic>Fol</italic>). The recognised effectors Avr1 (SIX4) and Avr3 (SIX1) represent the founding members of the <bold><italic>Fol</italic> d</bold>ual-domain (FOLD) effector class, with members containing two distinct domains. Using AlphaFold2, we predicted the full SIX effector repertoire of <italic>Fol</italic> and show that SIX6 and SIX13 are also FOLD effectors, which we validated experimentally for SIX6. Based on structural prediction and comparisons, we show that FOLD effectors are present within three divisions of fungi and are expanded in pathogens and symbionts. Further structural comparisons demonstrate that <italic>Fol</italic> secretes a limited number of structurally related effectors during infection of tomato. This analysis also revealed a structural relationship between transcriptionally co-regulated effector pairs. We make use of the Avr1 structure to understand its recognition by the I receptor, which lead to disease resistance in tomato. This study represents an important advance in our understanding of <italic>Fol</italic>-tomato, and by extension plant-fungal interactions, which will assist the development of novel control and engineering strategies to combat plant pathogens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Fusariumoxysporum</italic> is a soil-borne fungal pathogen responsible for destructive vascular wilt diseases in a wide range of plants. It ranks within the top ten important fungal pathogens in terms of scientific and economic importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The best-characterised <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> pathosystem is <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>lycopersici</italic> (<italic>Fol</italic>), which specifically infects tomato. Previous studies of <italic>Fol</italic>-infected tomato identified a number of fungal proteins within the xylem sap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. These secreted in xylem (SIX) effector proteins represent major pathogenicity determinants across different <italic>formae speciales</italic> of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. Currently, 14 SIX effectors have been identified in <italic>Fol</italic> consisting of small (less than 300 amino acids in length), secreted, cysteine-rich proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Most SIX effectors are encoded on the conditionally-dispensable chromosome 14 required for <italic>Fol</italic> pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. This dispensable chromosome can be horizontally transferred from <italic>Fol</italic> to a non-pathogenic strain of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, resulting in a transfer of pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. To date, all 14 SIX effectors lack sequence identity with proteins of known function, preventing prediction of function based on their amino acid sequence. Several SIX effectors have been shown to be essential for full virulence including SIX1, SIX2, SIX3, SIX5 and SIX6 from <italic>Fol</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], SIX1 from <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>conglutinans</italic> (<italic>Focn</italic>), which infects cabbage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], SIX4 from <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> isolate Fo5176, which infects Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], and SIX1 and SIX8 from <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>cubense</italic>, which infects banana [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. <italic>Fol SIX3</italic> (Avr2) and <italic>SIX5</italic> are adjacent, divergently-transcribed genes with a common promoter, and SIX5 has been shown to interact with SIX3 to promote virulence by enabling symplastic movement of SIX3 via plasmodesmata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. <italic>Focn SIX8</italic> and <italic>PSE1</italic> (pair with <italic>SIX8</italic> 1) are also a divergently-transcribed effector gene pair that function together to suppress phytoalexin production and plant immunity in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. In <italic>Fol, SIX8</italic> forms a similar gene pair with <italic>PSL1</italic> (<italic>PSE1</italic>-like 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Despite their roles in fungal pathogenicity, the virulence functions of most SIX effectors remain unknown.</p>
<p>To combat pathogen attack, plants possess resistance genes that encode immune receptors capable of recognising specific effectors leading to disease resistance. Four resistance genes, introgressed into tomato from related wild species, have been cloned. <italic>I</italic> and <italic>I-7</italic> encode transmembrane receptor proteins containing extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains and short cytoplasmic domains (LRR-RPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. <italic>I-2</italic> encodes a cytoplasmic receptor containing nucleotide binding (NB) and C-terminal LRR domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], while <italic>I-3</italic> encodes a transmembrane protein with an extracellular S-receptor-like domain and cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain (SRLK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. <italic>Fol</italic> Avr1 (SIX4), Avr2 (SIX3) and Avr3 (SIX1) are recognised by tomato resistance proteins I, I-2 and I-3, respectively, leading to effector-triggered immunity and disease resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].</p>
<p>By understanding the function of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> effector proteins, and how specific effectors are detected by resistance proteins, we (and others) hope to develop novel disease management strategies targeting vascular wilt diseases. Protein structure studies of effectors provide one avenue to assist this pursuit. Currently, Avr2 represents the only SIX effector whose protein structure has been determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Interestingly, the β-sandwich fold of Avr2 revealed that this effector shares structural homology to ToxA from <italic>Pyrenophora tritici-repentis</italic> and AvrL567 from <italic>Melampsora lini</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], despite a lack of sequence identity. The observation of structural classes for effectors without identifiable domains or homologies to proteins of known function has been demonstrated experimentally for four effector structural families, including the so-called MAX (<italic><bold>M</bold>agnaporthe oryzae</italic> <bold>A</bold>vr effectors and To<bold>x</bold>B from <italic>P. tritici-repentis</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], RALPH (<bold>R</bold>N<bold>A</bold>se-<bold>L</bold>ike <bold>P</bold>roteins associated with <bold>H</bold>austoria) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], LARS (<italic><bold>L</bold>eptosphaeria</italic> <bold>A</bold>vi<bold>r</bold>ulence-<bold>S</bold>uppressing) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] and ToxA-like families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Combining experimental and computational approaches, we present the structural repertoire of sequence unrelated effectors utilised by <italic>Fol</italic> during infection of tomato, including the classification of a new effector family, the FOLD (<bold><italic>Fol</italic> d</bold>ual-domain) effectors. We show using structural comparisons that FOLD effectors are widely distributed in phytopathogenic fungi as well as symbionts. Further, we defined the domains and residue that mediate the recognition of the FOLD effector, Avr1, by its corresponding receptor.</p>

<title>The structures of Avr1 and Avr3 adopt a similar dual-domain fold</title>
<p>Avr1 and Avr3 are cysteine-rich effectors that belong to the K2PP (Kex2-processed pro-domain) effector class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. To help understand their function, and recognition by I and I-3, we sought to solve their structures using x-ray crystallography. Using our optimised protein production strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], we produced Avr1 (Avr1<sup>18-242</sup>) and Avr3 (Avr3<sup>22-284</sup>) in <italic>E. coli</italic> for crystallisation studies (S1A and S1B Fig). Crystals were obtained for Avr3<sup>22-284</sup> (S1B Fig), however, Avr1<sup>18-242</sup> failed to crystallise. Previously, we demonstrated that pro-domain removal from the K2PP effector SnTox3 was required to obtain protein crystals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] and predicted this may also be important for Avr1. Treatment of Avr1 with Kex2 <italic>in vitro</italic> resulted in a predominant Avr1 band of ∼20 kDa consistent with a mature Avr1<sup>59-242</sup> protein, however, lower molecular weight bands were also observed suggesting in vitro Kex2 cleavage at additional sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. To address this, Avr1 was engineered with an internal thrombin cleavage site (replacing the Kex2 site) to produce a single Avr1<sup>59-242</sup> product after thrombin cleavage. This protein was subsequently used for crystallisation studies resulting in rectangular plate-like crystals (S1A Fig).</p>
<p>The crystal structures of Avr1 and Avr3 were solved using a bromide-ion-based single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) approach (S1 Table), and subsequently were refined using a native dataset to a resolution of 1.65 Å and 1.68 Å, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Despite sharing low amino-acid sequence identity (19.5%), Avr1 and Avr3 adopt a structurally similar dual-domain protein fold. Interpretable, continuous electron density was observed from residue 96 in Avr3 and some regions of the intact pro-domain could be interpreted in the electron density (residues 26-49) (S2A Fig). We also identified regions of the pro-domain (residues 23-45) of Avr1 in the electron density, despite thrombin cleavage of the pro-domain prior to crystallisation (S1A Fig). This indicates that an association between respective Avr and pro-domain was maintained post cleavage <italic>in vitro</italic> (S2B Fig). The importance of this association, if any, remains unclear, but for simplicity, the pro-domains were excluded from further analysis.</p>

<p>The structures of the N-terminal (N-domain) and C-terminal (C-domain) domains of Avr1 and Avr3 are very similar with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 2.1 Å and 2.8 Å, respectively (superposition performed using DALI server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). While the individual domains are very similar, superposition of the dual-domain structures returns an RMSD of ∼3.4 Å. The larger difference is due to a rotation between the N-and C-domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). The structures of Avr1 and Avr3, when compared with the solved structures of other fungal effectors, demonstrate that they adopt a unique two-domain fold and represent the founding members of a new structural class of fungal effectors we have designated the FOLD (<bold><italic>Fol</italic> d</bold>ual-domain) effectors.</p>

<title>SIX6 and SIX13 belong to the FOLD effector family</title>
<p>We were interested to determine if other SIX effectors belonged to the FOLD effector family. One conserved sequence feature observed in Avr1 and Avr3 was the spacing of the six cysteines within the N-domain. We analysed the cysteine spacing of the other SIX effectors and found that SIX6 and SIX13 contained a cysteine profile like Avr1 and Avr3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), suggesting they may be FOLD effectors. With the recent advances in <italic>ab initio</italic> structural prediction by Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] we predicted the structures of the SIX effectors to determine if, as suggested by our sequence analysis, other SIX effectors are FOLD effector family members.</p>

<p>As an initial step we benchmarked the AlphaFold2 predicted models of Avr1 and Avr3 (downstream of the Kex2 cleavage site (Avr1<sup>59-242</sup> and Avr3<sup>96-284</sup>) against our experimentally determined structures (S3 Fig). The AlphaFold2 model of Avr1 returned a low average per-residue confidence score (pLDDT = 55%) and the RMSD was 6.9 Å when model and structure were compared, however, the dual domain architecture was correctly predicted with a Z-score of 11.3 identified using a DALI pair-wise structural comparison (S3A Fig and S3E). The AlphaFold2 model of Avr3 returned a high average pLDDT score (92%) and superimposed well to the solved structure (S3B Fig), despite a slight skew between the orientation of the individual domains (RMSD = 3.7 Å overall; 1.1 Å for the N-domain; 0.8 Å for the C-domain). This demonstrated that accurate FOLD effector prediction was possible using AlphaFold2.</p>
<p>We subsequently generated SIX6 and SIX13 models, downstream of the predicted Kex2 cleavage site (SIX6<sup>58-225</sup>, SIX13<sup>78-293</sup>), using AlphaFold2 and obtained high average confidence scored models supporting their inclusion in the FOLD family (S4 Fig). To validate this experimentally, we produced SIX6 and SIX13 as described for Avr1/Avr3 and obtained crystals for both proteins (S1 Fig). While the SIX13 crystals diffracted poorly, the SIX6 crystals diffracted x-rays to ∼1.9 Å and we solved the structure of SIX6 using the AlphaFold2 generated model as a template for molecular replacement (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, S1 Table), confirming its inclusion as a member of the FOLD family. Despite lacking an N-terminal helix, the N-domain contains five β-strands held together by three disulfide bonds with an arrangement, identical to Avr1 and Avr3. The C-domain is an eight stranded β-sandwich that is stabilised by a single disulfide bond (unique to SIX6) connecting the β7 and β12 strands. Like Avr1, we identified regions of the pro-domain within the SIX6 structure (residues 29-46), despite cleavage of the pro-domain prior to crystallisation (S2C Fig), but only within one molecule in the asymmetric unit (S2D Fig). For structural analysis, we used the structured region of Chain A of SIX6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>FOLD effectors are distributed across multiple fungal genera</title>
<p>Despite structural similarities, the FOLD effectors are divergent in their amino acid sequences, sharing 15.5 – 22.5% sequence identities between all members (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Homologues of FOLD effectors are dispersed across multiple <italic>formae speciales</italic> of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> (S5 Fig) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. We were interested to understand the distribution of FOLD effectors in fungi. Previous structural-based searches performed on effector candidates from <italic>Venturia inaequalis</italic> using Avr1 and Avr3 as templates (which we provided to the authors) found three candidates predicted to be FOLD effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Here, we utilised our experimentally determined structures (Avr1, Avr3 and SIX6) to search for other fungal FOLD effectors within the AlphaFold2 protein structure database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/">https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/</ext-link>) using the Foldseek webserver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. This analysis identified 124 putative FOLD protein family members across three Divisions of Fungi (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Glomeromycota) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Over half of these were found in Ascomycetes (73), with expanded families in species of <italic>Colletotrichum, Diversispora</italic>, and <italic>Rhizophagus</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, S2 Table), as well as many <italic>formae speciales</italic> of <italic>Fusarium</italic> oxysporum and other Fusarium species (S2 Table). Expanded families of FOLD proteins were observed in the genus of <italic>Glomeromycota</italic> that form arbuscular mycorrhiza in plant roots, while two putative FOLD effectors were also predicted in the ectomycorrhizal fungus <italic>Piloderma olivaceum</italic> (basidiomycete), which forms mutualistic associations with conifer and hardwood species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Structural superposition of members from the three Divisions confirms the structural similarities between the N and C domains and highlights that the major differences identified are the orientation of the domains relative to each other (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), consistent with our experimental data for Avr1, Avr3 and SIX6.</p>

<title>Distinct structural families exist among the other SIX effectors</title>
<p>With the successful utilisation of AlphaFold2 as a model for molecular replacement (SIX6 structure), and structural similarity searches for FOLD effectors, we decided to perform structural comparisons with the remaining SIX effectors. AlphaFold2 modelling of the effectors was conducted on sequences with the signal peptide and putative pro-domain (if present) removed (S6 Fig). The models and experimentally determined SIX effector structures (Avr1, Avr2, Avr3 and SIX6) were compared using the DALI server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] and a Z-score with a cutoff of &gt;2 was used to indicate structure similarity.</p>
<p>The observed structural similarity between the FOLD effectors was high, with scores above 8 for all comparisons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>).

<p>Beyond these described structural families, the Z-scores indicated that two additional, but not yet characterised, structural families exist within the SIX effectors. Here, we define these as structural family 3 and 4, consisting of SIX9<sup>19-114</sup> and SIX11<sup>19-110</sup>, and SIX5<sup>18-119</sup> and SIX14<sup>18-88</sup>, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>, E). The structures of SIX9 and SIX11 both consist of five β-strands and either two or three α-helices (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>, S8 Fig), despite sharing only 14% sequence identity. To further our understanding of the putative function of this family we did a structural search against the protein databank (PDB) and found that both structures share structural similarity to various RNA binding proteins, such as the RNA recognition motif (RRM) fold of the Musashi-1 RNA-binding domain (PDB code: 5X3Z) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>].</p>
<p>SIX5 and SIX14 also share limited sequence identity (23%) but the structural predictions show a similar secondary-structure topology consisting of two α-helices and four to six β-strands (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>, S8 Fig). We compared the models of SIX5 and SIX14 against the PDB using DALI and identified structural similarity toward the <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> and <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic> KP6 effector (PDB codes: 4GVB and 6QPK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], suggesting SIX5 and SIX14 belong to the KP6-like structural family (S7 Fig).

<title>Structural modelling and comparison of an expanded set of <italic>Fol</italic> effectors</title>
<p>The SIX effectors are only a subset of effectors utilised by <italic>Fol</italic> during infection of tomato. Recently, the <italic>Fol</italic> genome was re-sequenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>] and reannotated in combination with RNAseq data from <italic>Fol</italic>-infected tomato plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. A total of 26 genes encoding novel effector candidates were identified that were consistently upregulated during <italic>Fol</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], which were not previously predicted or predicted incorrectly in the original genome annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Of these, 14 genes encoded proteins with no recognised domains or motifs based on their amino acid sequences. We generated structural models using AlphaFold2 of these 14 (S3 Table, S6 Fig) and structurally aligning them using DALI against SIX effector representatives from each family to assess if they fell into any of the established families (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). We found the predicted structure of FOXGR_015533 adopts a nine β-stranded sandwich and is likely a member of the ToxA-like class (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). PSL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] and FOXGR_015322, here designated PSL2, are sequence related effectors (∼85% sequence identity) and show a conserved structure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). Both have Z-scores of &gt;2 against Family 4 and are likely members of this family.</p>
<p>Based on this analysis we also suggest an additional structural family. FOXG_18699 and FOXGR_015522 are structurally related (Z-score of 2.2) with a sequence identity of ∼29%. While FOXGR_015522 does share some resemblance to Family 4, based on manual alignment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>) and domain topology analysis (S8 Fig) these effectors appear to belong to an independent structural family, designated Family 5.

<p>We heterologously produced <italic>Fol</italic> SIX8<sup>50-141</sup> (S1E Fig) and PSL1<sup>18-111</sup> (S1F Fig) and co-incubated the proteins before analysing by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). The elution profile of PSL1 alone showed a major peak (∼12.25 mL) at a volume consistent with a dimeric form of the protein, while SIX8 showed a major peak (∼15 mL) consistent with a monomer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Strikingly, when incubated together the major protein peaks migrate to ∼12.8 mL. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that presence of PSL1 and SIX8, indicating that the migration of both proteins on SEC is altered after incubation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). These data are consistent with PSL1 and SIX8 forming a heterodimer.</p>
<p>To understand the structural basis of the interaction, we attempted to solve the structure of the complex, but we were unable to obtain crystals. We subsequently utilised AlphaFold2-Multimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] through ColabFold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>], to model the interaction. Manual inspection of the top 5 models (S10A Fig, top model shown <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) demonstrated that the thiol side chain of a free cysteine in PSL1 (Cys 37) and SIX8 (Cys 58) co-localised in the dimer interface, suggesting that an inter-disulfide bond may mediate the interaction. To test this, we performed intact mass spectrometry of SIX8 and PSL1 (alone and post incubation) under non-reduced and reducing conditions. The mass observed from the incubated SIX8 and PSL1 non-reduced sample contained a predominant species consistent with the combined molecular weight of SIX8 and PSL1 (20777 Da) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>, S9G-H Fig). SIX8 and PSL1 failed to form a heterodimer with an unrelated protein containing a free cysteine, suggesting specificity in the interaction (S9I-L Fig). Collectively, these data demonstrated that the SIX8-PSL1 heterodimer is mediated via a disulfide bond.</p>
<p>To confirm the involvement of the predicted residues involved, interaction with cysteine mutants of PSL1 (PSL1_C37S<sup>18-111</sup>) and SIX8 (SIX8_C58S<sup>50-141</sup>) were analysed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). When PSL1_C37S was incubated with SIX8_C37S or SIX8 alone, the heterodimer was not resolved via SEC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>, S10B Fig). This was further confirmed using mass spectrometry (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). We crystallised and solved the structure of SIX8_C58S<sup>50-141</sup> at 1.28 Å (S1E Fig and S10C Fig) which confirms its inclusion within the ToxA-like structural family (S10D Fig).</p>

<title>The molecular basis of Avr1 recognition by the I receptor</title>
<p>The structural identification of the FOLD effector family provides an opportunity to understand their recognition by cognate resistance proteins. Here, we focussed on Avr1 (SIX4), which is recognised by the I resistance protein leading to effector-triggered immunity (ETI) and disease resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Previous studies have shown co-expression of the <italic>I</italic> gene from the M82 tomato cultivar (I<sup>M82</sup>) with Avr1 in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leads to a cell death response, a proxy for ETI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Conversely, co-expression with the allelic variant (i<sup>Moneymaker</sup>) from the susceptible cultivar Moneymaker does not lead to cell death as the receptor cannot recognise Avr1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>).

<p>To facilitate this, we identified homologues of Avr1 that possess natural residue variation. FonSIX4, a homologue of Avr1 from the watermelon pathogen, <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>niveum</italic> (<italic>Fon</italic>) shares 79% identity with Avr1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Using the <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> assay we show FonSIX4 is recognised by I receptors from both cultivars (I<sup>M82</sup> and i<sup>Moneymaker</sup>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). FonSIX4 and Avr1 differ by 34 residues distributed across both N-and C-domains of the protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). To narrow down the regions involved in recognition we designed chimeric variants by swapping the N-and C-domains (Avr1<sup>N</sup>FonSIX4<sup>C</sup> and FonSIX4<sup>N</sup>Avr1<sup>C</sup>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, C). When these were co-expressed with i<sup>Moneymaker</sup> the cell death response, quantified using ion leakage assays (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D-E</xref>) and visual inspection (S11A Fig), suggest the C-domain of FonSIX4 is recognised by i<sup>Moneymaker</sup>. We separated Avr1 and FonSIX4 proteins into their N-or C-domains and co-infiltrated with both I<sup>M82</sup> and i<sup>Moneymaker</sup>. Quantification using ion leakage assays demonstrate that the C-domains of Avr1 and FonSIX4 cause cell death when expressed with I<sup>M82</sup> and I<sup>M82/Moneymaker</sup>, respectively. These data confirms the C-domain is sufficient for I receptor recognition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D-E</xref>, S12 Fig, see S11 Fig for <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaf infiltration and protein accumulation data).</p>
<p>To understand how Avr1 can escape i<sup>Moneymaker</sup> recognition, we focussed on surface exposed variant residues (underlined) mapping to four regions within the C-domain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Four reciprocal swap mutants between Avr1 and FonSIX4 (Avr1<sup>ADVKT</sup>, Avr1<sup>IDH</sup>, Avr1<underline><sup>NGQAR</sup></underline>, Avr1<sup>EEEY<underline>GIN</underline></sup>) were co-expressed with i<sup>Moneymaker</sup> to identify the residues required for FonSIX4 recognition. Avr1<sup>EEEY<underline>GIN</underline></sup> showed consistent ion leakage and cell death similar to FonSIX4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F-G</xref>), whereas ion leakage quantification for the other three mutants (Avr1<sup>ADVKT</sup>, Avr1<sup>ID<underline>H</underline></sup>, Avr1<underline><sup>NGQAR</sup></underline>) was statistically similar to the non-recognised Avr1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref>). The reciprocal mutations in FonSIX4 (FonSIX4<sup>KEVY<underline>HID</underline></sup>) significantly reduced ion leakage and cell death response when co-expressed with i<sup>Moneymaker</sup> compared to FonSIX4 (S11D-E Fig, see S11G Fig for protein accumulation data). Collectively, these data show that the C-domains in Avr1 is recognised by I<sup>M82</sup>, and surface exposed residues in the C-domain allow Avr1 to escape recognition by i<sup>Moneymaker</sup>.</p>

<p>Pathogenic fungi are in a continuous arms race with their plant hosts.

<title>Expanding the structural classes in fungal effectors</title>
<p>To date, five fungal effector families have been defined based on experimentally-determined structural homology, including the MAX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], RALPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>], ToxA-like [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], LARS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] and FOLD effectors, defined here. Effectors that fall within many of these structural families are shared across distantly related fungal species. The ToxA-like family includes effectors from fungi that group to both divisions of higher-fungi (basidiomycetes and ascomycetes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. The MAX effector family were originally defined as AVR effectors from <italic>M. oryzae</italic> and ToxB from <italic>P. tritici-repentis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] but pattern-based sequence searches suggest they are widely distributed amongst the Dothideomycetes and Sordariomycetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. Similarly, LARS effectors, defined in <italic>Leptosphaeria maculans</italic> and <italic>Fulvia fulva</italic>, have structural homologues predicted in at least 13 different fungal species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Based on sequence homologues alone, FOLD effectors are well dispersed in fungi with homologues amongst the Sordariomycetes including many <italic>formae speciales</italic> of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> and <italic>Ustilaginoidea</italic>. Based on structural comparison of the AlphaFold2 structural database we show that is extended to fungi in three Divisions, including plant pathogens and symbionts. This was supported by a recent study modelling the secretomes of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi which found enlarged and diversified gene families encoded proteins predicted to share the FOLD effector structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. The exclusive presence of FOLD effectors in plant-colonising fungi may suggest they facilitate plant colonisation in pathogenic and symbiotic fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>].</p>

<title>Effector structure prediction</title>
<p>Experimentally determining the structures of fungal effectors is not a trivial undertaking. From challenges associated with effector protein production through to hurdles related to structure solution (such as experimental phasing), the research time required to determine an effector structure experimentally ranges from months to many years (sometimes never). Not surprisingly, any reliable structural modelling methods are welcomed by researchers interested in effector biology. To this end, several recent studies have used effector structure prediction to expand our understanding of plant-microbe interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>].</p>

In doing so, they suggested an expansion in the number of MAX effectors and identified numerous sequence-unrelated groups of structural homologues (putative structural classes) within <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. Making use of AlphaFold2, Yan and colleagues show that structurally conserved effectors, including the MAX effector family, from <italic>M. oryzae</italic> are temporally co-expressed during the infection process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. In the largest comparison study to date, Seong and Krasileva carried out a large comparative structural genomics study of fungal effectors utilising AlphaFold2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Their findings support the hypothesis that the structurally conserved effector families are the result of divergent evolution and support previous finding that the structural landscape of effectors is more limited than what is suggested by sequence-diversification.</p>
<p>Here, we were in a unique position to apply and benchmark AlphaFold2 against experimentally determined structures for <italic>Fol</italic> effector prediction. We subsequently used AlphaFold2 to demonstrate that, within the repertoire of effectors we tested, up to five sequence-unrelated structural families are secreted during <italic>Fol</italic> infection. There are numerous caveats in relying solely on AlphaFold2 to generate structural models of effectors. The accuracy of models generated by AlphaFold2 can decline in cases with low numbers of homologues (∼30 sequences in the multiple sequence alignment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. This may help explain the low confidence prediction for SIX4 (Avr1) (S4A Fig), which is only distributed in a few <italic>ff. spp</italic>. of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. This poses a potential issue for predicting the structures of fungal effectors that lack homologues. In our hands, we have had mixed results when comparing several unpublished effector structures experimentally determined in our lab to AlphaFold2 models. In some instances, the models are wrong, for example AvrSr50 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>], however, in these cases the AlphaFold2 predictions reported low confidence scores, an important criterion for assessment of model reliability. Despite this, AlphaFold2 models were critical in solving the structure of SIX6 and SIX8, as templates for molecular replacement. This negated the need to derivatise our crystals, a process that we had struggled with for SIX6 crystals, significantly reducing the time and research effort to determine the experimental structures.</p>

<title>Structural classes: A starting point for functional characterisation</title>
<p>Given their lack of sequence identity to proteins of known function or conserved motifs, structural determination of effectors is often pursued to provide functional insight and understanding of residues involved in recognition. The existence of structural families of effectors raises the question of whether links can now be made concerning their function based on structural similarities. Unfortunately, the FOLD effectors share little overall structural similarity with known structures in the PDB. However, at a domain level, the N-domain of FOLD effectors have structural similarities with cystatin cysteine protease inhibitors (PDB code: 4N6V, PDB code: 5ZC1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>], while the C-domains have structural similarities with tumour necrosis factors (PDB code: 6X83) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>] and carbohydrate-binding lectins (PDB code: 2WQ4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. Though a functional link has not yet been established, the information gleaned from the FOLD effector structures gives us a starting point for further functional characterisation, with various avenues now being explored.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the predicted models for SIX9 and SIX11 within Family 3 have structural homology with RNA-binding proteins (PDB code: 3NS6, PDB code: 5X3Z) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>], unrelated to RALPH effectors. Despite this structural homology, close inspection of these models suggests RNA binding is unlikely, as in both models the putative RNA binding surface is disrupted by a disulfide bond.</p>
<p>The putative family 4 effectors (SIX5, SIX14, PSL1 and PSL2) have structural homology with KP6 effectors and heavy metal associated (HMA) domains. Metal binding within HMA domains is facilitated by conserved cysteine residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>], however, their absence in the family 4 effectors suggests they are unlikely to have this activity.</p>
<p>The putative family 5 effectors (FOXGR_015522 and FOXG_18699) have structural homology with different proteins within the PDB. FOXGR_015522 is structurally similar to plant defensins (PDB code: 6MRY, PDB code: 7JN6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>] and K<sup>+</sup> channel-blocking scorpion toxins (PDB code: 1J5J, PDB code: 2AXK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]. FOXG_18699 has structural homology with the C-terminal domain of bacterial arginine repressors (PDB code: 1XXB, PDB code: 3CAG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>].</p>

<title>A structural explanation for functional effector pairs</title>
<p>One interesting outcome of this study is a link between structural families and co-operative interactions between effectors. The ToxA-like effectors, Avr2 and SIX8 are known to form functional effector pairs with SIX5 and PSE1 (PSL1-homolouge), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. According to our modelling work, both SIX5 and PSL1 are members of structural family 4. <italic>Avr2</italic> and <italic>SIX5</italic> are adjacent divergently-transcribed genes on <italic>Fol</italic> chromosome 14 and the protein products have been shown to physically interact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Likewise, <italic>SIX8</italic> and <italic>PSL1</italic> are adjacent divergently-transcribed genes in the <italic>Fol</italic> genome and we demonstrate here a physical interaction between the proteins. The AlphaFold2-multimer models of the <italic>SIX8</italic> and <italic>PSL1</italic> heterodimer, drew our attention to the inter-disulfide bond between SIX8 and PSL1 required for the interaction, which we confirmed experimentally. While these residues are conserved in <italic>Focn</italic> SIX8 and PSE1, the Avr2 structure and SIX5 model lack free cysteine residues, suggesting a different mode of interaction.</p>
<p>Interestingly, two other <italic>SIX</italic> genes also form a divergently-transcribed gene pair on <italic>Fol</italic> chromosome 14. <italic>SIX7</italic> (ToxA-like family) and <italic>SIX12</italic> possess start codons 2,319 base-pairs apart and potentially share a common promoter. While SIX12 did not group with any structural families, the AlphaFold2 model had a very low prediction confidence (35.5%). On closer inspection of the sequence, we observed that the cysteine spacing in SIX12 closely resembles other family 4 members (S13 Fig), which suggests that SIX12 may also be a family 4 member. We therefore speculate that SIX7 and SIX12 may function together, as described for the Avr2/SIX5 and SIX8/PSL1 pairs.</p>

<title>Are experimentally derived effector structures still worth the effort?</title>
<p>The potential of machine-learning structural-prediction programs, such as AlphaFold2, heralds an exciting era, especially for a field that has long suffered from a lack of prediction power based on effector sequences. A question now emerges; when prediction model confidence is high, should we bother solving structures experimentally? The answer to such a question will always depend on what the structure is being used for. Ultimately, structural models, whether experimentally or computationally derived, represent information to base and/or develop a hypothesis to subsequently test. Here we demonstrate the power of structure prediction in combination with experimentation, both for validating models and understanding protein:protein interaction interfaces. One interesting observation we made was that while the AphaFold2-multimer models of the SIX8 and PSL1 heterodimer were sufficient to highlight the cysteine residues required for mediating the interaction, the models and interaction interfaces differed significantly (S10A Fig). When the modelling was repeated with the SIX8<sup>C58S</sup> experimentally derived structure included as a template, the interaction models and heterodimer interface were of higher quality and essentially identical (S10E Fig). This observation can be retrospectively reconciled. The region of SIX8 involved in the interaction with PSL1 was modelled incorrectly by AlphaFold2 when compared to the structure (S10D Fig). Collectively, these data highlight that some models are good enough, but others maybe better.</p>

<title>Effector structural classes and understanding receptor recognition</title>
<p>Understanding the structural basis of plant immunity receptor-effector interactions represent a key step towards engineering plant immunity receptors with novel specificities. Recent structures of full-length NLR proteins reveal exquisite details of these direct interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>]. The FOLD effectors, Avr1 and Avr3, are recognised by different classes of resistance protein; I, an LRR-RP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] and I-3, a SRLK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. While the mode of recognition has not yet been described for Avr3, we demonstrate here that Avr1 is recognised at the C-domain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). This is significant because it demonstrates that different immunity receptor classes can recognise structural homologues. It might also help explain the function of Avr1 during <italic>Fol</italic> infection. When Houterman and colleagues identified Avr1, they demonstrated that it could suppress plant immunity conferred by the <italic>I-2</italic> and <italic>I-3</italic> receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Considering our structural understanding of these FOLD effectors, it is plausible that Avr1 achieves suppression of I-3-mediated immunity by preventing Avr3 recognition through competitive inhibition. The LARS effectors represent another example of effectors that can activate and suppress resistance-gene-mediated immunity. AvrLm4-7 can prevent recognition of AvrLm3 and AvrLm9 (all LARS structural homologues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]), by their cognate Rlm receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>]. <italic>Rlm9</italic> encodes a wall-associated kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>], but the identify of <italic>Rlm4</italic>, –<italic>7</italic> and –<italic>3</italic> remain unknown. These studies demonstrate that members of at least two different structural effector families can suppress immunity triggered by structurally homologous effectors.</p>
<p>Collectively, the results presented here will aid future studies to understand the molecular basis of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> effector function and recognition, and by extension, the design and engineering of immunity receptors with novel recognition specificities to help protect plants against <italic>Fusarium</italic> wilt disease.</p>

<p>This study provides <bold>important</bold> new insights into the structural diversity of effectors - proteins secreted by pathogens and symbionts into host cells - from the plant-associated fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. The study provides a <bold>convincing</bold> approach to understand how effectors navigate their host environment using both computational and experimental approaches to understand how their structure influences binding partners. The work will be of interest to those studying molecular host-microbe interactions and disease protection.</p>

<p>Yu et al. investigated Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici SIX effectors structure using experimental and computational approaches, and while doing so, the authors identified several SIX effectors as member of the FOLD family, and expanded the known diversity of the SIX effectors. A very interesting and novel finding is the presence of FOLD putative effectors in other Ascomycetes secretome, sharing structural similarities with SIX effectors Avr1, Avr3 and SIX6.</p>
<p>By performing technically sound predictions and experimental confirmation, the authors also confirmed co-operative interactions between Fol effectors, something that was previously known for different pairs of proteins, expanding this observation for new SIX effectors. In addition, the authors contributed to the understanding of the interaction Fol effectors, specifically FOLD and LARS effectors, - I receptors to suppress immunity by structurally similar effectors.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are supported by data and I think it is a pioneer study analyzing the correspondence between AlphaFold predictions and experimentally derived structures, highlighting that models can answer the scientific questions in some cases but could not be enough in others.</p>

<p>Yu et al. investigated the structural landscape of 'secreted in xylem' (SIX) effector (virulence and avirulence) proteins from the plant-pathogenic fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol), with the goal of better understanding effector function and recognition by host (tomato) immune receptors. In recent years, several experimental and computational studies have shown that many effector proteins of plant-associated fungi can be assigned to one of a few major structural families. In the study by Yu et al., X-ray crystallography was used to show that two avirulence effectors of Fol, Avr1 (SIX4) and Avr3 (SIX1), which are recognized by the tomato immune receptors I and I-3, respectively, form part of a new structural family, the Fol dual-domain (FOLD) family, found across three fungal divisions. Using AlphaFold2, an ab initio structural prediction tool, the authors then predicted the structures of all proteins within the Fol SIX effector repertoire (and other effector candidates) and provided evidence that two other effectors, SIX6 and SIX13, also belong to this family.</p>
<p>In addition to identifying members of the FOLD family, structural prediction revealed that proteins of the Fol effector repertoire can largely be classified into a reduced set of structural families. Examples included four members of the ToxA-like family (including Avr2 (SIX3) and SIX8), as well as four members of a new family, Family 4 (including SIX5 and PSL1). Given previous studies had demonstrated that Avr2 (ToxA-like) and SIX5 (Family 4) interact and function together and that the genes encoding these proteins are divergently transcribed, and because homologues of SIX8 (ToxA-like) and PSL1 (Family 4) from another Fusarium pathogen are functionally dependent on each other and, in the case of Fol, are encoded by genes that are next to each other in the genome, the authors hypothesized that SIX8 and PSL1 may also physically interact. In line with this, co-incubation of the SIX8 and PSL1 proteins, followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), gave elution and gel migration profiles consistent with interaction in the form of a heterodimer. AlphaFold2-Multimer modelling then suggested that this interaction was mediated through an intermolecular disulfide bond. Such a prediction was subsequently confirmed through mutational analysis of the relevant cysteine residue in each protein in conjunction with SEC.</p>
<p>Finally, using a variant (homologue) of Avr1 from another Fusarium pathogen, as well as chimeric forms of this protein that integrated regions of Avr1 from Fol, Yu et al. determined through co-expression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana with the I immune receptor, as well as subsequent ion leakage assays, that the C-domain of Avr1 is recognized by the I immune receptor. Furthermore, through these assays, the authors were also able to show that surface-exposed residues in the C-domain enable Avr1 to evade recognition by a variant of the I receptor in Moneymaker tomato that does not provide resistance to Fol.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript presents a large body of work that is well supported by the data. A key strength of the manuscript is the validation (benchmarking) of protein structures predicted using AlphaFold2, which is a first for largescale effector structure prediction papers published to date. Another key strength is the use of largescale effector structure predictions to make hypotheses about functional relationships or interactions that are then tested (i.e. the SIX8-PSL1 protein interaction and recognition of Avr1 by the I immune receptor). This testing again goes above and beyond the large scale effector structure prediction papers published to date. Taken together, this showcases how experimental and computational experiments can be effectively combined to provide biologically relevant data for the plant protection and molecular plant-microbe interactions fields.</p>
<p>In terms of weaknesses, the manuscript could have validated the SIX8-PSL1 protein interaction with in planta experiments, such as co-immunoprecipitation assays or co-localization experiments in conjunction with confocal microscopy, to provide support for the interaction in a plant setting. However, given what is already known about the Avr2-SIX5 interaction, these additional experiments are not crucial and could instead form part of a follow-up study. With regards to the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient expression assays involving co-expression of the Avr1 effector and I immune receptor, the authors need to make clear how many biological replicates were performed as this information is only provided for the ion leakage assay.</p>

<p>In this work, the authors shed light onto the structures of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici proteins involved in the infection of tomato. They unravelled several new secreted effector protein structures and additionally used computational approaches to structurally classify the remaining effectors known from this pathogen. Through this they uncovered a new and unique structural class of proteins which they found to be present and widely distributed in fungal plant pathogens and plant symbiotic fungi. The authors further predicted structural models for the full SIX effector set revealing that genome-proximal effector pairs share similar structural classes. Building on their Avr1 structure, the authors also define the C-terminal domain and specific amino acid residues that are essential to Avr1 detection by its cognate immune receptor.</p>
<p>A major strength of this work is a portfolio of several (Avr1, Avr3, SIX6, SIX8) new structurally resolved proteins which led to the discovery that several of them fall into the same structural class. These findings are supported by strong results.</p>
<p>The experiments addressing the structure-function relationship of Avr1's avirulence activity are highly relevant to our understanding of disease resistance mechanisms against Fusarium, but will require additional controls to allow for solid conclusions to be drawn. In particular, it needs to be demonstrated that specific I gene alleles are at all required for FonSIX4's cell death activity in N.benthamiana leaves or whether FonSIX4 and those of some chimeric proteins is independent of the tomato I receptor. Complementary work in Fusarium mutants lacking Avr1 and expressing chimeric versions would document that the observations from transient expressions in Nicotiana benthamiana are relevant in the biological context of a Fusarium/tomato interaction.</p>
<p>The discovered solvent-exposed residues conditioning Avr1 recognition by the I receptor seem to be positioned in an area of the protein which had previously been highlighted as being highly variable in FOLD proteins of symbiotic fungi but it is not clear from the work whether this is indeed the case or whether Avr1 differs significantly in its structure from FOLD proteins found in other fungi.</p>
<p>
It also remains to be addressed whether the residues conditioning avirulence activity is also crucial for virulence activity in Fusarium?</p>
<p>This work uncovered a new structural class of proteins with critical roles in plant-pathogen interactions. Structure-based predictions and genome-wide comparisons have emerged as a new approach enabling the identification of similar proteins with divergent sequences. The work undertaken by the authors adds to a growing body of work in plant-microbe research, predominantly from pathogenic organisms, and more recently in symbiotic fungi.</p>
