<title>Abstract</title><p>Phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases (i.e., lysins) are considered a promising alternative to traditional antibiotics due to their low risks of resistance and unique mechanisms of action. However, the discovery of these enzymes is often hampered by limited source of available phage genomes. Herein, we report a new strategy to mine novel peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes by lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening. As a proof-of-concept, five novel <underline>p</underline>eptidoglycan <underline>h</underline>ydrolases from the <italic><underline>A</underline>cinetobacter <underline>b</underline>aumannii</italic> proteome (PHAb7-PHAb11) were identified using PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template. PHAb10 and PHAb11 showed potent bactericidal activity against a variety of pathogens even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hour, while the other three were thermosensitive. We solved the crystal structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 and unveiled that hyper-thermostable PHAb10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by the dimer-monomer transition, while thermosensitive PHAb8 formed a monomer. Two mouse models of bacterial infection further demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PHAb10. Altogether, our antimicrobial peptide-primed strategy provides new clues for the discovery of novel antimicrobial drugs with therapeutic promise.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite decades of concerted action from all over the world, antimicrobial resistance remains a growing global threat nowadays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The unreasonable use of antimicrobial agents in human, livestock, industrial agriculture, and aquaculture is the main reason for the uncontrollable spread and accumulation of antimicrobial resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Abuse and overuse of antimicrobial agents leads to the accumulation of these antimicrobials in environment, eventually increasing the chances of evolution of bacterial pathogens to acquire resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Therefore, the concept of “One Health” has been proposed to address the alarming levels of antimicrobial resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). In recent decades, the number of bacteria resistant to first-line drugs has been increasing, and the number of bacteria resistant to second- or third-line drugs has also increased. Some of them have even been identified as multi-drug resistant, extensively drug resistant, or pan-drug resistant isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). For example, methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, vancomycin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic>, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, third generation of cephalosporin-resistant <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, carbapenem-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and multi-drug <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> cause a severe threat and are responsible for most of the morbidity and mortality in modern clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Certainly, the global medical need for novel antimicrobial has yet to be fully addressed.</p>
<p>Recently, many attempts have been made to develop novel antimicrobial drugs with different targets or mechanisms of action than traditional antibiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). These antibacterial pipelines include small molecules with new targets such as ribosomal binding sites, membrane and cell wall, gene interference, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>); antibacterial vaccines, antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates targeting conserved antigens of specific pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>); phages and phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases, i.e., lysins that can lysis susceptible bacteria individually or as a cocktail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>); microbiome-modulating therapies targeting bacterial colonization environments (primarily the intestine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>); anti-virulent agents that target different bacterial virulence factors, such as quorum sensing, biofilm formation, adhesion, multiple regulators and persisters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>); potentiators that alone have no or low antibacterial activity but otherwise restore or enhance the activity of another antibacterial agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>); immunomodulators that modulate the outcome of bacterial infection <italic>via</italic> a host-directed approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>); and nanobiotics that have antibacterial capacity through the generation of reactive oxygen species, cell membrane permeation, triggering DNA damage or interrupting transmembrane electron transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). In addition, drug repurposing, the strategy of repurposing non-antimicrobial drugs to treat bacterial infections, also represents a time-saving and cost-effective approach to antimicrobial discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). While these approaches hold particular promise and advantages in accelerating discovery of potential compounds for clinical studies, they nevertheless have substantial obstacles to overcome. The common denominator is the lack of efficient hit-to-lead discovery methods.</p>
<p>Recent advances in metagenomics, artificial intelligence and synthetic biology have allowed and inspired a renaissance in research into novel antimicrobial agent discovery. There is a trend towards mining encrypted antimicrobial agents, especially peptides, through algorithms coupled with biophysical feature selection that rely on rational design, machine learning, or artificial intelligence-based tools derived from big data, such as the human proteome and intestinal microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), human and environmental metagenomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), protein sequence space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), and virtual prediction library and display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). It is not fully known yet how this event will affect the evolutionary arms race between bacteria and the agents designed to kill them, and consequently the entire field of antimicrobial resistance. But it is clear that novel antimicrobial agents with relatively low risk of resistance will be crucial.</p>
<p>Abundant evidence has showed that bacterial peptidoglycans are a promising target for the development of antimicrobial agents with low risk of inducing resistance. A well-documented example in this regard is the peptidoglycan hydrolases, also known as lysins, derived from phages. In recent years, lysins have been shown to be efficient alternatives to traditional antibiotics for infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria in various animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Encouragingly, several lysins targeting <italic>S. aureus</italic> has been evaluated in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). However, the discovery of lysins against Gram-negative pathogens meeting the needs described in the WHO list of priority pathogens is still in its infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Additionally, the discovery of phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases has also been hampered by limited sources of published phage genome data. Although not yet tested extensively, recent progress in lysins targeting on Gram-negative bacteria have demonstrated a clue linking antibacterial activity to their internal antimicrobial peptides, by which lysins cross the bacterial outer membrane and contact its underlying peptidoglycan substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). These observations led us to consider whether it is feasible to mine novel antibacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases or their homologues from bacterial proteomes by using lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide as template. As a proof-of-concept, here we searched for novel <underline>p</underline>eptidoglycan <underline>h</underline>ydrolases from the <italic><underline>A</underline>. <underline>b</underline>aumannii</italic> proteome database (PHAbs, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>) using the antimicrobial peptide P307 derived from PlyF307 lysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) as a template. Two of them (PHAb10 and PHAb11) were found to be hyperthermally stable even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hour, which might be mediated by a unique monomer-dimer swapping. Furthermore, both were active against a wide variety of clinically relevant bacteria <italic>in vitro</italic> and in mouse infection models. This observation supports our hypothesis that antimicrobial peptide-primed mining strategy was feasible for discovering novel peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteome with high bactericidal activity and ideal physicochemical properties.</p>

<title>Screening of putative peptidoglycan hydrolases from the <italic>A. baumannii</italic> proteome based on a lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed mining strategy</title>
<p>Since a variety of lysins active against Gram-negative bacteria are shown to harbor an N- or C-terminal antimicrobial peptide, this led us to speculate that antimicrobial peptide would be used as template to mine novel peptidoglycan hydrolases. To prove this hypothesis, P307, a well-documented antimicrobial peptide against <italic>A. baumannii</italic> from PlyF307 lysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), was used as the template to mine putative <underline>p</underline>eptidoglycan <underline>h</underline>ydrolases from <italic><underline>A</underline>. <underline>b</underline>aumannii</italic> (PHAb) proteome database publicly available in NCBI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Finally, 204 hits were identified and further divided into 5 clades base on phylogenetic analysis. Clade I contained 162 hits with high similarity (&gt; 85%) to the AcLys lysin from <italic>A. baumannii</italic> 5057UW prophage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), and clade II-V contained 42 hits with relatively lower homology (40-77%) to each other (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2a</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Due to the high similarity of amino acid sequences within each clade, we selected a putative peptidoglycan hydrolase from each clade for further characterization by analyzing the selectivity priority in evolution and the overall physicochemical properties (water solubility, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, charge, flexibility, and rigidity) of each sequence <italic>in silico</italic>. Finally, WP_065188953.1 from clade I, WP_0383495441.1 from clade II, KCY28522.1 from clade III, WP_000109885.1 from clade IV, and WP_032023242.1 from clade V were shortlisted and renamed as PHAb11, PHAb10, PHAb9, PHAb8, and PHAb7, respectively, for further investigation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Further homology analysis revealed that these five peptidoglycan hydrolases showed great diversity with the structured AcLys lysin and the original PlyF307 lysin (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2b</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>PHAb10 and PHAb11 are highly thermostable peptidoglycan hydrolases with a broad-spectrum of action</title>
<p>To test the activity of these PHAbs, their coding sequences were chemically synthesized, cloned to vector, and expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. As expected, all five PHAbs were well expressed as soluble proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) with high purity (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3a</xref>). Next, we examined the hydrolytic activity of these 5 PHAbs on peptidoglycan derived from <italic>A. baumannii</italic> 3437 by halo assay. Results showed that even at a low concentration of 2.5 μg/ml, all PHAbs formed clear zones on autoclaved <italic>A. baumannii</italic> lawns (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3b</xref>), indicating that these PHAbs were active against peptidoglycan from <italic>A. baumannii</italic>. To further confirm the ability of these PHAbs against peptidoglycan from different bacteria, we measured the area of clear zones generated by different concentrations of PHAbs on each lawn of two isolates of <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic>E. coli</italic>. Encouragingly, these PHAbs were active against peptidoglycans from all strains tested and formed a clear halo (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Among these PHAbs, PHAb10 and PHAb11 showed larger size of clear zones under each concentration tested (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), indicating that these two PHAbs might have stronger peptidoglycan hydrolyzing activity. To prove this, we further evaluated the bactericidal activity of these PHAbs against each isolate of <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic>E. coli</italic> by a log-killing assay. Consistent with the halo assay, PHAb10 and PHAb11 exhibited outstanding bactericidal activity against all strains tested, with a 3.5-4.6 log reduction in viable bacterial counts after treatment for 1 hour with 50 μg/ml of each enzyme (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Like other lysins, the potent bactericidal activity of PHAb10 and PHAb11 was time-dependent. After treatment with 50 μg/ml of either enzyme, a ⁓0.9 log reduction in viable <italic>A. baumannii</italic> 3437 for both enzymes were observed within the first 30 seconds, with a substantial reduction to 3.1 logs (from 6.0 log to 2.9 log) for PHAb10 and 2.5 logs (from 6.0 log to 3.5 log) for PHAb11 after 15 minutes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>

<p>Since previous reports documented the diverse performance of lysins against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species in exponential and stationary phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), we therefore examined the bactericidal activity of PHAb10 and PHAb11 against different bacteria in different growth phases. Interestingly, robust bactericidal activity was observed for both enzymes in exponential and stationary phase cultures of <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>S. suis</italic>, and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). It should also be noted that exponential bacteria were more susceptible to these two enzymes than stationary bacteria, similar to observations reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). However, for <italic>S. aureus</italic>, detectable susceptibility to PHAb11 was only observed in its exponential phase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). In addition, PHAb10 and PHAb11 exhibited dose-dependent killing against sensitive Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains tested. Specifically, treatment with 6.25 μg/ml PHAb10 for 1 hour resulted in a ⁓3 log reduction in <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, a ⁓2.7 log reduction in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, a ⁓3 log reduction in <italic>E. coli</italic>, ⁓1.08 log reduction in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, and a ⁓0.94 log reduction in <italic>S. suis</italic>, and treatment with 6.25 μg/ml PHAb11 for 1 hour caused a ⁓2.8 log reduction in <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, a ⁓2.6 log reduction in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, a ⁓2.7 log reduction in <italic>E. coli</italic>, a ⁓0.69 log reduction in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, a ⁓1.3 log reduction in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and a ⁓2.15 log reduction in <italic>S. suis</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>E. faecalis</italic> was more sensitive to PHAb10 and PHAb11, showing a ⁓3.8 log and a ⁓4.6 log reduction respectively after treatment with 10 μg/ml of each enzyme for 1 hour (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p>
<p>To further confirm the bactericidal activity of PHAb10 and PHAb11, the susceptibility of various clinical isolates such as <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>K. pneumonia</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and <italic>E. faecalis,</italic> as well as representative isolates of <italic>S. dysgalactiae, S. agalactiae</italic>, <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, and <italic>S. suis</italic> to both enzymes were examined by log-killing assay. Our results showed that all tested strains, whether antibiotic-resistant or not, were sensitive to PHAb10 and PHAb11 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g-h</xref>). Importantly, Gram-negative bacteria were more sensitive to PHAb10, with 3.9-6.0 log reductions for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> isolates, 3.7-5.0 log reductions for <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates, 2.4-4.3 log reductions for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates, and 1.1-3.6 log reductions for <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> isolates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>). In contrast, PHAb11 was more bactericidal than PHAb10 against Gram-positive bacteria, causing 1.8-4.3 log reductions for <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates, 4.5-5.0 log reductions for <italic>E. faecalis</italic> isolates, and 1.0-6.1 log reductions for various streptococcal strains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>). Further biochemical characterization showed that PHAb10 and PHAb11 remained highly active at pH 5.0-10.0, and the maximum bactericidal activity was observed at pH 7.0 for both enzymes (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3c</xref>). Similar to other previously reported lysins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), PHAb10 and PHAb11 were sensitive to NaCl and urea in a dose-dependent inhibitory manner (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3d</xref>). Surprisingly, both enzymes retained outstanding bactericidal activity after heat treatment at temperature up to 100°C for 1 hour (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>). Indeed, after 1 hour treatment at 100°C, the bactericidal activity was improved slightly for both enzymes. In contrast, PHAb7, PHAb8, and PHAb9 completely lost their activity after treatment at 70°C for 1 hour (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3e</xref>). Together, these observations showed that PHAb10 and PHAb11 were highly thermostable peptidoglycan hydrolases with a broad spectrum of action.</p>

<title>Different action mechanisms of PHAb10 and PHAb11 in killing Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria</title>
<p>Due to the natural barrier of the outer membrane, several peptidoglycan hydrolases (i.e., lysins) have been reported to have no or low bactericidal activity against Gram-negative bacteria in the absence of outer membrane penetrating agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). However, for most of these lysins, their activity is almost exclusively restricted to Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), which casts doubt on the mechanisms of action of PHAb10 and PHAb11 in killing both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Structural prediction analysis showed that PHAb10 contained a putative lysozyme catalytic domain (amino acids 1-110, P10-Lys) and a C-terminal cationic peptide (amino acids 111-149, P10-CP), whilst PHAb11 contained an N-terminal cationic peptide with unknown function (amino acids 1-36, P11-NP), followed by a putative lysozyme catalytic domain (amino acids 37-145, P11-Lys) and a C-terminal cationic peptide (amino acids 146-184, P11-CP) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Studies have shown that the cationic region of phage lysins can facilitate their penetration into the outer membrane, thereby fulfilling their bactericidal activity against Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). To examine whether it is the reason for the killing ability of PHAb10 and PHAb11 against Gram-negative bacteria, we further analyzed <italic>in silico</italic> the physicochemical properties of these putative cationic peptides harbored by these two enzymes and found that all three peptides, that is, P10-CP, P11-CP, and P11-NP might act as antimicrobial peptides (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). Therefore, we synthesized these peptides and examined their antibacterial activity by log-killing assay. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, we observed bactericidal activity in P10-CP and P11-CP against <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> in both the exponential and stationary phases. However, rare lytic activity was observed in P11-NP, suggesting that a potential role for it in functions other than bactericidal activity. Notably, P11-CP was more robust than P10-CP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), which might be due to an extra positively charged amino acid (i.e., Lysine) in P11-CP (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). More importantly, the putative lysozyme catalytic domains of two enzymes, P10-Lys, P11-Lys, and P11-N showed rare bactericidal activity against all Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria tested (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c-d</xref>), which indicated that the antimicrobial peptides, namely P10-CP and P11-CP, were essential for the bactericidal activity of both enzymes. Curiously, for unknown reasons, P11-C showed higher bactericidal activity than the holoenzyme PHAb11 against all bacteria tested (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Considering the different targets of antimicrobial peptide and peptidoglycan hydrolase, we further asked the killing mechanism of susceptible bacteria by PHAb10 and PHAb11. To this end, we evaluated the effects of different truncations of PHAb10 and PHAb11 on different bacteria by halo assay to test their peptidoglycan hydrolase activity. Results showed that lysozyme-containing truncations from both enzymes showed hydrolytic activity only towards peptidoglycan from Gram-negative bacteria but not from Gram-positive bacteria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>), suggesting that the killing of Gram-positive bacteria by PHAb10 and PHAb11 is probably mediated mainly by their internal antimicrobial peptides, i.e., P10-CP and P11-CP. Supporting to this assumption, rare peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity was observed in P10-CP and P11-CP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Altogether, these results suggested that the killing of Gram-negative bacteria by PHAb10 and PHAb11 might be a combination of lysozyme-mediated peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity and antimicrobial peptide-mediated outer membrane-disruption activity. However, their bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria was primed solely by their internal antimicrobial peptides (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p>

<title>PHAb8 is a thermosensitive monomer, whilst PHAb10 and PHAb11 formed a thermostable dimer</title>
<p>To understand the catalytic mechanism and thermal stability of these novel peptidoglycan hydrolases, we solved the crystal structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 by X-ray crystallography (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>), and the results showed that PHAb8 was a monomer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4a</xref>), whilst PHAb10 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) and PHAb11 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>) formed an asymmetric dimer. Specifically, the two asymmetric units of PHAb10 formed an antiparallel dimer with a rotation angle of 177.2° along the rotation axis and a distance of 10.5 Å between them. Further, PHAb10 dimer adopted a circularly permuted architecture, in which the N-terminus of one chain and the C-terminus of another chain formed a cavity, which might be the binding site of the peptidoglycan substrate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). The two subunits of PHAb11 formed a tail-to-tail dimer with a rotation angle of -179.4° along the rotation axis and a distance of 37.1 Å between them. Each PHAb11 monomer contained an independent substrate-binding cavity around its catalytic triad (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Notably, the N-terminal 36 amino acids, P11-NP, were missing in our PHAb11 dimer. We speculated that it may be destroyed during crystal formation. Interestingly, PHAb8 showed high topological similarity to monomeric PHAb10 and PHAb11, with the typical catalytic triad (Glu-Asp-Thr) located at the coil region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4a-c</xref>). Dali-based screening further showed that the catalytic triad of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 were highly conserved in homologous proteins, including AcLys (PDB ID 6ET6), LysF1 (PDB ID 7M5I), SpmX-Mur-<italic>Ae</italic> (PDB ID 6H9D), P22 (PDB ID 2ANX), and R21 (PDB ID 3HDE) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4d</xref> and <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Table S3</xref>). Superimposition of PHAb8, PHAb10, PHAb11 with other well-known lysozymes, including hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL, PDB ID 4HPI), goose egg-white lysozyme (GEWL, PDB ID 153L), T4 lysozyme (T4L, PDB ID 1LYD), and lambda lytic transglycosylase (PDB ID 1LYD) revealed that the overall structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 had relatively low similarity to HEWL, GEWL, and lambda lytic transglycosylase (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4e-g</xref>). Despite their lower amino acid sequence similarity (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4h</xref>), PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 superimposed well with T4 lysozyme, especially in their Glu-Asp-Thr catalytic triad regions (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4i</xref> and <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Table S3</xref>), suggesting that PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 may be phage-originated. Supporting to this, all three enzymes were predicted to be originated from prophages by PhageBoost (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). All these observations together indicated that PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 were highly evolutionarily related to T4 lysozyme and might share similar catalytic mechanisms of action.</p>

<p>To reveal which domain contributes to the thermal stability of PHAb10 and PHAb11, we examined the residual bactericidal activity of their individual domains by treating them at 100°C for 1 hour. Results showed that for all strains tested, the holoenzyme and its antimicrobial peptide domain P10-CP retained high bactericidal activity, but its lysozyme catalytic domain P10-Lys did not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Except for the N-terminal peptide P11-NP, other truncated PHAb11 still maintained substantial bactericidal activity after heating at 100°C for 1 hour (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). These observations raised the question of whether PHAb10 and PHAb11 dimers are hyper-thermostable. To test this, we determined the temperature-dependent denaturation of these enzymes by nano-differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF). Our results showed that PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 were denatured with transition temperatures of 41.4, 53.7, and 59.9°C, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). Interestingly, signs of aggregation were only observed in PHAb8 but not in PHAb10 and PHAb11 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4j</xref>), indicating that PHAb10 and PHAb11 underwent structural refolding without precipitation during heat treatment. Consistent with these observations, the corresponding circular dichroism (CD) curves of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 at 90°C were significantly different from their corresponding curves at temperature close to their transition temperature (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h-j</xref>), suggesting that, similar to PHAb8, PHAb10 and PHAb11 lost their native conformation at high temperature such as 90°C. To further understand the thermodynamics of PHAb10 and PHAb11, we examined the structure of PHAb10 before and after heat treatment at 100°C for 1 hour by CD. Intriguingly, only minor differences were observed before and after heat treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4k</xref>), indicating that PHAb10 almost refolded to its native conformation during cooling after heat treatment. The C-terminal antimicrobial peptide P10-CP of PHAb10 could withstand heat treatment, but P10-Lys was deformed after being treated at 100°C for 1 hour (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4l</xref>). Similar to the folding-refolding phenomenon of PHAb10, PHAb11 and its N-terminal peptide-deleted variant P11-C could restore to their native conformation after 1 hour treatment at 100°C (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4m-n</xref>), whilst its C-terminal peptide-deleted variant P11-N could not refold to its native conformation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4o</xref>), indicating that C-terminal peptide was essential for its hyper-thermostability. Altogether, these observations suggested that dimerized PHAb10 and PHAb11 possessed unique folding-refolding thermodynamic mechanism.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Folding-refolding thermodynamic of PHAb10 dimer is governed by intermolecular interactions</title>
<p>Since PHAb10 dimer and PHAb11 dimer exhibit a similar folding-refolding thermodynamic profiles, we wondered whether it was achieved through dimer-monomer switching. Therefore, we used PHAb10 as an example to test this hypothesis. We carefully examined the topology of the PHAb10 dimer and found that it was supported by 7 pairs of intermolecular H-bonds, with 3 pairs supporting the head, each 2 pairs in midbody and tail of the PHAb10 dimer (<xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table S4</xref>). Specifically, in the top view of chain A, Arg20 and Gly27 were involved in intermolecular H-bond interactions, supporting the head region, Gly128 and Gly129-mediated interaction contributed to the stability of midbody, whilst Lys133 and Arg137 were involved in intermolecular H-bond forces anchoring the tails of the PHAb10 dimer (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table S4</xref>). Next, we constructed several PHAb10 variants involving depletion of intermolecular force at the head, midbody, tail, or entire entity of the PHAb10 dimer (<xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Table S5</xref>). Since PHAb10 was a verified dimer after chemical cross-linking in SDS-PAGE gel (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>), we further examined the polymerization of these PHAb10 variants by Native-PAGE. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, wildtype PHAb10 showed two bands corresponding to its monomeric and dimeric forms. Whilst the variants R20IG27D, which has mutations in the head-supporting site, and G27DR137I, which has mutations in both the head and tail supporting sites, lost dimerization ability. As a result, both variants lost most of their bactericidal activity after treatment at 100°C for 1 hour (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>), which could be further explained by the failure to recover their native forms after heat treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e-f</xref>). In support of these observations, the variant PHAb10-mut containing mutations in all 7 pairs of dimer-supporting sites showed aborted bactericidal activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>) and failed to recover its native conformation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e-f</xref>) after treatment at 100°C for 1 hour. In contrast, the variants G128D/G129D with mutations in the midbody-supporting sites still showed a mixture of monomers and dimers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>), indicating that depletion of the midbody-supporting force hardly affected the dimerization of PHAb10. Consistent with this observation, the variant G128D/G129D still remained intact bactericidal activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>) and could refold to its native form after heat treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e-f</xref>). Moreover, the variant K133A/R137I with mutations in the tail-supporting site also showed aborted bactericidal activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>) and an irreversible conformation change after heat treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e-f</xref>), although it maintained a weak dimerization ability (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). This suggested that intermolecular forces at the tail of the PHAb10 dimer had only a small impact on its thermodynamics properties. Taken all these observations together, we proposed a model by which the PHAb10 dimer executed its folding-refolding thermodynamics (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>). At temperatures above its transition point (i.e., &gt;53.7°C), dimerized PHAb10 dissociated into monomers without precipitation. During the cooling process, monomeric PHAb10 refolded to a stable dimer <italic>via</italic> the intermolecular interactions between the two monomers, i.e., three pairs of intermolecular bonds at the head, two in the midbody, and two at the tail of the PHAb10 dimer. The folding and refolding dynamics of PHAb10 after heat treatment were somewhat similar to the opening and closing of zippers, where the intermolecular bonds act as inducers.</p>

Six days after infection, viable bacteria were recovered from the infection site and counted (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The uncontrollable spread and emergence of antimicrobial resistance requires the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents with different targets or mechanisms of action from traditional antibiotics. Policy makers, scientists, enterprisers, and investigators have worked together for decades to exploit the ‘trojan horse’ globally, but new options for treating antimicrobial resistance in the clinic remain to be seen. Bacteriophage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases (i.e., lysins) have been considered as promising alternatives against drug-resistant bacteria due to their potent bactericidal activity, low risks of drug resistance, and unique mechanism of action, as witnessed by several ongoing clinical trials targeting on Gram-positive bacteria. However, for Gram-negative bacteria, the effects of phage-derived lysins were often hampered by their outer membranes, which requires more strategies to overcome. In the present work, we report a new strategy to mine novel bactericidal peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes through lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-priming screening. As a proof-of-concept, we successfully discovered two novel peptidoglycan hydrolases from the <italic>A. baumannii</italic> proteome using PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template, highlighting the utility of this strategy in mining antimicrobial agents from bacterial database.</p>
<p>Notably, PHAb10 and PHAb11 exhibited high bactericidal activity against a variety of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microbes. Unlike other Gram-negative lysins that act in an outer membrane permeabilizer-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), PHAb10 and PHAb11 exhibited intrinsic activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens <italic>via</italic> different mechanisms of action. Due to their C-terminal antimicrobial peptides, namely, P10-CP and P11-CP, PHAb10 and PHAb11 were able to penetrate the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria in an auto-priming manner, allowing them to access and cleave peptidoglycan bonds, ultimately leading to osmotic lysis of Gram-negative pathogens. For Gram-positive bacteria, they are primarily killed through the action of intrinsic antimicrobial peptides. Interestingly, we noted a difference in the killing of Gram-positive bacteria by PHAb10 and PHAb11, which may be due to the fact that P11-CP had one more basic amino acid than P10-CP, so it had stronger bactericidal activity. In addition, compared to other naturally occurring lysins such as PlyPa03, PlyPa91, and PlyE146 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), PHAb10 and PHAb11 showed traceable bactericidal activity even at concentrations as low as 0.625 μg/ml.</p>
<p>Structure-based homology analysis revealed that PHAb10 and PHAb11 probably belonged to the T4 lysozyme family and possessed the conserved Glu-Asp-Thr catalytic triad shared by traditional phage lysins and bacterial autolysins, namely Glu17, Asp26, and Thr32 of PHAb10, and Glu52, Asp61, and Thr67 of PHAb11. However, unlike most other enzymes reported to date, PHAb10 and PHAb11 exhibited excellent thermostability, retaining almost 100% bactericidal activity after treatment at 100°C for 1 hour. In contrast, gp36C lysin from bacteriophage ϕKMV, a known highly thermostable lysozyme, retains only ⁓50% residual activity after 1 hour of treatment at 100°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Also, T4 lysozyme derived from T4 phage, which shares 44% sequence similarity and 27% sequence identity with gp36C, was completely inactivated after treatment at 75°C for 5 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, phage-derived lysins with such high thermostability similar to PHAb10 and PHAb11 had yet to be described. Heat-resistant lysin have potential applications in animal feed premixes (pelletizing temperature 75-98°C) and medical devices requiring autoclaving.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, few proteins have been demonstrated to have reversible folding-refolding thermodynamics at high temperature, but their mechanisms are unclear, such as HPL118, HPL511, and HPLP35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Here we found that PHAb10 had a unique temperature-dependent folding-refolding thermodynamic, and structural and biochemical analyses further suggested that PHAb10 undergoes a unique dimer-monomer switching mediated by 6 pairs of intermolecular interactions to survive heat treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an enzyme had been found to adapt to ambient temperature by altering its dimerization state.</p>
<p>Bacteriophages are known to be the most abundant biological entities on earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Over billions of years of coevolution, more than 80% of bacterial genomes have become populated with at least one prophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>), also known as molecular imprints, which serve as an untapped arsenal for the discovery of phage-related antimicrobial agents. Notably, prophage identification lags greatly behind genome or metagenome sequencing. Therefore, there is reason to believe that advances in bacterial culturomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), ‘rebooting’ phage genomes in more tractable hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), and computational biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), may help discover otherwise inaccessible prophages from bacterial genome big data. In turn, this will increase the added value of bacterial genome as a new source of unearthed therapeutically promising antimicrobial drugs. More importantly, our findings implied that daily updated big data, such as bacterial genomes and proteomes, human proteomes, and various metagenomic data, could in principle became an encrypted power in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.</p>

<p>To determine the antibacterial activity of peptidoglycan hydrolases, bacteria were cultured overnight (stationary phase, OD<sub>600</sub> = 1.2-1.6), then transferred to fresh medium at 100-fold dilution and continued to grow for 3 hours to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5-0.6 in the exponential growth phase. Cultures of different bacteria were centrifuged at 10,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 1 minute, washed once and resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Stationary phase bacterial cells were diluted to a final OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6 before use.

The number of viable bacteria after each treatment was counted by plating serial dilutions on LB agar. Wells treated with an equal volume of dialysis buffer instead of peptidoglycan hydrolases were used as controls. Specifically, to test the dose-dependent antibacterial activity of PHAb10 and PHAb11, exponential cultures of various Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were treated with 0, 0.625, 1.25. 2.5, 5, 6.25, 10, 12.5, 25, 50, or 100 μg/ml of each enzyme in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at 37°C for 1 hour.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Li Zhang et al. characterized two new Gram-negative endolysins identified through an AMP-targeted search in bacterial proteomes. These endolysins exhibit broad lytic activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and retain significant antimicrobial activity even after prolonged exposure to high temperatures (100{degree sign}C for 1 hour). This stability is attributed to a temperature-reversible transition from a dimer to a monomer. The authors suggest several potential applications, such as complementing heat sterilization processes or being used in animal feed premixes that undergo high-temperature pelleting, which I agree with.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The claims are well-supported by relevant and complementary assays, as well as extensive bioinformatic analyses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are numerous statements in the introduction and discussion sections that I currently do not agree with and consider need to be addressed. Therefore, I recommend major revisions.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>Introduction and Discussion:</p>
<p>The introduction and the discussion are currently too general and not focused. Furthermore, there are some key concepts that are missing and are important for the reader to have an overview of the current state-of-the-art regarding endolysins that target gram-negatives. Specifically, the concepts of 'Artilysins', 'Innolysins', and 'Lysocins' are not introduced. Besides this, the authors do not mention other high-throughput mining or engineering strategies for endolysins, such as e.g. the VersaTile platform, which was initially developed by Hans Gerstmans et al. for one of the targeted pathogens in this manuscript (i.e., Acinetobacter baumannii). Recent works by Niels Vander Elst et al. have demonstrated that this VersaTile platform can be used to high-throughput screen and hit-to-lead select endolysins in the magnitude tens of thousands. Lastly, Roberto Vázquez et al. have recently demonstrated with bio-informatic analyses that approximately 30% of Gram-negative endolysin entries have AMP-like regions (hydrophobic short sequences), and that these entries are interesting candidates for further wet lab testing due to their outer membrane penetrating capacities. Therefore, I fully disagree with the statement being made in the introduction that endolysin strategies to target Gram-negatives are 'in its infancy' and I urge the authors to provide a new introduction that properly gives an overview of the Gram-negative endolysin field.</p>
<p>Results:</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that the halo assay is a qualitative assay for activity testing. I personally do not like that the size of the halos is used to discriminate in endolysin activity. In this reviewer's opinion, the size of the halo is highly dependent on (i) the molecular size of the endolysin as smaller proteins can diffuse further in the agar, and (ii) the affinity of the CBD subdomain of the endolysin for the bacterial peptidoglycan. It should also be said that in the halo assay, there is a long contact time between the endolysin and the bacteria that are statically embedded in the agar, which can result in false positive results. How did the authors mitigate this?</p>
<p>Testing should have been done at equimolar concentrations. If the authors decided to e.g. test 50 µg/mL for each protein, how was this then compensated for differences in molecular weight? For example, if PHAb10 and PHAb11 have smaller molecular sizes than PHAb7, 8, and 9, there is more protein present in 50 µg/mL for the first two compared to the others, and this would explain the higher decrease in bacterial killing (and possibly the larger halos).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study explores a new strategy of lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening to find peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes. Using this strategy authors identified five peptidoglycan hydrolases from A. baumannii. They further tested their antimicrobial activities on various Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the study is good and adds new members to the peptidoglycan hydrolases family. The authors also show that these lysins have bactericidal activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The crystal structure data is good, and reveals different thermostablility to the peptidoglycan hydrolases. Structural data also reveals that PhAb10 and PHAb11 form thermostable dimers and data is corroborated by generating variant protein defective in supporting intermolecular bond pairs. The mice bacterial infection shows promise for the use of these hydrolases as antimicrobial agents.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the authors have employed various mechanisms to justify their findings, some aspects are still unclear. Only CFU has been used to test bactericidal activity. This should also be corroborated by live/dead assay. Moreover, SEM or TEM analysis would reveal the effect of these peptidoglycan hydrolases on Gram-negative /Gram-positive cell envelopes. The authors claim that these hydrolases are similar to T4 lysozyme, but they have not correlated their findings with already published findings on T4 lysozyme. T4 lysozyme has a C-terminal amphipathic helix with antimicrobial properties. Moreover, heat, denatured lysozyme also shows enhanced bactericidal activity due to the formation of hydrophobic dimeric forms, which are inserted in the membrane. Authors also observe that heat-denatured PHAb10 and PHAb11 have bactericidal activity but no enzymatic activity. These findings should be corroborated by studying the effect of these holoenzymes/ truncated peptides on bacterial cell membranes. Also, a quantitative peptidoglycan cleavage assay should be performed in addition to the halo assay. Including these details would make the work more comprehensive.</p>
