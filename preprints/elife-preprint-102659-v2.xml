<abstract>
<p>Monocyte-derived macrophages recruited into inflamed tissues can acquire an array of functional states depending on the extracellular environment. Since the anti-inflammatory/pro-fibrotic macrophage profile is determined by MAFB, whose activity/protein levels are regulated by GSK3, we addressed the macrophage re-programming potential of GSK3 modulation. GM-CSF-dependent (GM-MØ) and M-CSF-dependent monocyte-derived macrophages (M-MØ) exhibited distinct levels of inactive GSK3, and inhibiting GSK3 in GM-MØ led to acquisition of transcriptional, phenotypic and functional properties characteristic of M-MØ (enhanced expression of IL-10 and monocyte-recruiting factors, and higher efferocytosis). These re-programming effects were also observed upon GSK3α/β knockdown, and through GSK3 inhibition in <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated human alveolar macrophages (AMØ). Notably, GSK3 downmodulation potentiated the transcriptional signature of Interstitial Macrophages (IMØ) while suppressed the AMØ-specific gene profile. Indeed, heightened levels of inactive GSK3 and MAFB-dependent proteins were observed in severe COVID-19 patients lung macrophages, highlighting the GSK3-MAFB axis as a therapeutic target for macrophage re-programming.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Macrophages exhibit considerable functional plasticity during inflammatory responses, transitioning from pro-inflammatory activities to tissue repair and inflammation resolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. This functional versatility of macrophages is intrincately tied to factors such as their ontogeny (fetal origin vs. monocyte-derived) and the specific tissue and extracellular environment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Notably, monocyte-derived macrophages are oppositely instructed by M-CSF or GM-CSF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. GM-CSF directs monocyte-derived macrophages (GM-MØ) towards heightened pro-inflammatory activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and the acquisition of the lung alveolar macrophage phenotype and gene profile <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In fact, GM-CSF is essential for generating lung alveolar macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, crucial for surfactant homeostasis, whereas deficient GM-CSF signaling leads to pulmonary alveolar proteinosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, a condition marked by defective surfactant clearance and disruption of pulmonary homeostasis due to alveolar macrophage dysfunction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Conversely, M-CSF gives rise to anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving, and immunosuppressive monocyte-derived macrophages (M-MØ) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> but promotes the development of pro-fibrotic pathogenic monocyte-derived macrophages in lung pathologies like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and severe COVID-19 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The pathological relevance of GM-MØ and M-MØ subsets is evident in severe COVID-19, with a huge increase in monocyte-derived M-MØ and a reduction of tissue-resident GM-MØ-like lung macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Despite their crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis, deregulated macrophage functional specialization contributes to various human diseases, including tumors and chronic inflammatory pathologies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Consequently, macrophage re-programming has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. However, achieving this necessitates a profound understanding of the transcriptional and signaling mechanisms governing the pro- and anti-inflammatory nature of macrophages. In this regard, recent findings indicate that the homeostatic and reparative transcriptional profile of human M-MØ is orchestrated by MAF and MAFB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, closely related transcription factors that regulate stemness and self-renewal in the mouse haematopoietic lineage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. In fact, the distinctive expression of MAFB in M-MØ, influencing IL-10 production <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, also mediates macrophage re-programming induced by methotrexate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and LXR ligands <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Given the pivotal role of MAFB/MAF in human macrophage functional specification, and considering the regulation of large MAF factors through GSK3-mediated phosphorylation-induced proteasomal degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that modulating GSK3 activity could offer a viable avenue for re-programming monocyte-derived macrophages. Our findings reveal significant differences in inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β (Ser<sup>9</sup>-GSK3β) and GSK3α (Ser<sup>21</sup>-GSK3α) between M-MØ and GM-MØ, and that GSK3 inhibition (using CHIR-99021) or knock-down (using siRNA) in GM-MØ prompts the adoption of transcriptional, phenotypic, and functional characteristics resembling those of M-MØ. This re-programming effect was manifested in elevated expression of IL-10, monocyte-recruiting chemokines, pro-fibrotic factors, as well as in enhanced phagocytic capability, all correlating with increased MAFB expression. The re-programming action of GSK3 inhibition was also observed in control monocytes and in monocytes exposed to a pathological pro-inflammatory environment. Importantly, GSK3 inhibition in <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated human Alveolar Macrophages (AMØ), led to the loss of the AMØ gene signature and the acquisition of the gene profile that characterizes Interstitial Macrophages (IMØ). Since pathogenic lung macrophages in severe COVID-19 exhibit high levels of inactive GSK3 and heightened levels of MAFB and MAFB-dependent proteins, our results underscore the potent macrophage re-programming impact of GSK3 inhibition, and highlight the GSK3-MAFB axis as a promising therapeutic target for macrophage re-programming.</p>

<title>Generation of human monocyte-derived macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic> and treatments</title>
<p>Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were isolated from buffy coats from anonymous healthy donors over a Lymphoprep (Nycomed Pharma) gradient according to standard procedures. Monocytes were purified from PBMC by magnetic cell sorting using anti-CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Monocytes (&gt;95% CD14<sup>+</sup> cells) were cultured at 0.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI 1640, Gibco) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Biowest) (complete medium) for 7 days in the presence of 1000 U/ml GM-CSF or 10 ng/ml M-CSF (ImmunoTools) to generate GM-CSF-polarized macrophages (GM-MØ) or M-CSF-polarized macrophages (M-MØ), respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Cytokines were added every two days and cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 21% O<sub>2</sub>. Alveolar macrophages (AMØ) were obtained from remains of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of patients undergoing bronchoscopy for diagnostic purposes under a protocol approved by the Internal Review Board of Instituto de Investigación Hospital 12 de Octubre (Reference TP24/0183). BAL procedure was performed with a flexible bronchoscope and a total volume of 150 ml of sterile isotonic saline solution at 37°C. BAL fluid fractions were maintained at 4°C and cellular debris removed using a 40 μm cell strainer. BAL cells were washed with PBS, centrifuged and resuspended in complete medium containing 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (#15140-122,Gibco), 50 μg/ml gentamicin (#G1397, Sigma-Aldrich), and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B (#A2942, Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were seeded at 6–8 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in 12-well plates for 1 h and washed extensively to remove non-adherent cells. Finally, 2 ml of complete medium with antibiotics was added to each well and the adherent cells incubated for 16–18 h before treatments. More than 95% of adherent BAL cells were identified as AMØ according to morphology and phenotypic analysis. When indicated, monocytes, GM-MØ or AMØ were exposed to the GSK3 inhibitors CHIR99021 (10 μM), SB-216763 (10 μM) or LiCl (10 mM), using DMSO as control. For macrophage activation, cells were treated with either 100 ng/ml CL264 (InvivoGen), 10 ng/ml <italic>E. coli</italic> 0111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS-EB Ultrapure, Invivogen), TNF (20 ng/ml, ImmunoTools) or IFNγ (5 ng/ml, ImmunoTools). Human cytokine production was measured in M-MØ culture supernatants using commercial ELISA [CCL2 (BD Biosciences), IL-10, CCL18, LGMN, SPP1 (R&amp;D Systems) and activin A (BD Biosciences)] and following the procedures supplied by the manufacturers.</p>

<title>Monocyte-derived macrophages generated in the presence of GM-CSF (GM-MØ) or M-CSF (M-MØ) differ in the state of activation of GSK3α and GSK3β</title>
<p>Monocyte-derived M-MØ exhibit a transcriptional profile akin to that of pathogenic macrophages in severe COVID-19 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, whereas GM-MØ resemble lung alveolar macrophages (AMØ) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Our prior research has established that MAFB determines the transcriptional and functional specification of monocyte-derived M-MØ, characterized by significantly higher MAFB levels compared to GM-MØ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Since the protein levels of large MAF family members (MAF, MAFA, MAFB, NRL) are controlled through GSK3 phosphorylation-dependent proteasome degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, we initially assessed the relative levels of the inhibitory (Ser<sup>21</sup> for GSK3α and Ser<sup>9</sup> for GSK3β) and activation-associated (Tyr<sup>279</sup> for GSK3α and Tyr<sup>216</sup> for GSK3β) phosphorylation of GSK3 in M-MØ and GM-MØ. Ser<sup>21</sup>-GSK3α and Ser<sup>9</sup>-GSK3β phosphorylation was more pronounced in M-MØ, aligning with their elevated levels of MAFB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Conversely, no significant difference in Tyr<sup>279</sup>–GSK3α and Tyr<sup>216</sup>–GSK3β phosphorylation was observed between M-MØ and GM-MØ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).

<title>Inhibition of GSK3 leads to transcriptional, phenotypic, functional, and metabolic reprogramming in monocyte-derived GM-MØ</title>
<p>Building upon the above findings, we aimed to examine the macrophage re-programming effects of GSK3 activity modulation in GM-MØ through the use of the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR-99021 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Kinetics and dose-response analysis of the effects of CHIR-99021 on MAFB expression showed that maximal protein levels were achieved after a 24-48 hour exposure to 10μM CHIR-99021 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>), conditions that were used hereafter. Indeed, treatment of GM-MØ with CHIR-99021 for 48 hours resulted in a significant decrease in the activation-associated Tyr<sup>216</sup>–GSK3β phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) and a robust elevation in MAFB protein levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Moreover, reversal of the Tyr<sup>216</sup>/Ser<sup>9</sup> GSK3β phosphorylation ratio was also seen after CHIR-99021 treatment, albeit it was not observed after exposure to other GSK3 inhibitors (SB-216763 or LiCl; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). RNA-Seq analysis of CHIR-GM-MØ unveiled a huge transcriptional impact of GSK3 inhibition, with more than 2000 differentially expressed genes ([log<sub>2</sub>FC]&gt;1; <italic>adj p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Corresponding with the higher MAFB expression, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that the CHIR-GM-MØ transcriptome was significantly enriched in genes that either mark M-MØ (GSE68061) or are upregulated during monocyte-to-M-MØ differentiation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Conversely, GM-MØ-specific genes (GSE68061) or genes increased during monocyte-to-GM-MØ differentiation, were downregulated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Additional gene ontology analysis further supported the pathophysiological significance of the macrophage re-programming induced by modulating GSK3 activity. Thus, analysis of the MoMac-VERSE (a resource that identified conserved monocyte and macrophage states derived from healthy and pathologic human tissues) (GSE178209) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, indicated that GSK3 inhibition augments the expression of the gene sets that define MoMac-VERSE subsets identified as long-term resident macrophages [Cluster HES1_Mac (#2)] and tumor-associated macrophages with an M2-like signature [Clusters HES1_Mac (#2), TREM2_Mac (#3), C1Q<sup>hi</sup>_Mac (#16) and FTL_Mac (#17)] <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Moreover, GSK3 inhibition increased the expression of the gene sets that define pathogenic pro-fibrotic macrophage subsets in severe COVID-19 [(Group 3 or SPP1<sup>+</sup>, GSE145926) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, MoAM3 (GSE155249) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> or CD163<sup>+</sup>/LGMN<sup>+</sup> MØ (EGAS00001005634) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Therefore, GSK3 inhibition enhances MAFB expression and re-programs macrophage by promoting the acquisition of the gene profile that defines anti-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic macrophages.</p>
<p>In agreement with the increased MAFB levels detected in CHIR-GM-MØ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), screening for mediators of the re-programming action of GSK3 inhibition using DoRoThEA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://saezlab.github.io/dorothea/">https://saezlab.github.io/dorothea/</ext-link>) revealed a significant enrichment in MAFB-regulated genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), and similar results were yielded upon Enrichr analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/">https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/</ext-link>) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). In fact, GSEA confirmed that CHIR-GM-MØ are enriched in MAFB-dependent genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-C</xref>) along with macrophage genes whose regulatory regions are directly bound by MAFB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> (75-geneset, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), including <italic>CCL2</italic>, <italic>CCL8</italic>, <italic>CCL18</italic>, <italic>IGF1</italic>, <italic>IL10</italic> and <italic>LGMN</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Importantly, all these changes were reflected in the phenotype of CHIR-GM-MØ, that showed elevated expression of transcription factors like MAF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), cell surface proteins like CD163 and FOLR2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E, F</xref>), and soluble factors like CCL2, CCL18, IL-10, LGMN and SPP1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), all of which are either direct MAFB targets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> or MAFB-regulated genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Likewise, the attenuated expression of the GM-MØ-specific <italic>INHBA</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) corresponded to a decrease in Activin A production by CHIR-GM-MØ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). These results underscore the phenotypic re-programming induced by GSK3 inhibition in GM-MØ, wherein there is an upregulation of MAFB-dependent transcription factors, cell surface markers, and soluble factors which collectively define an anti-inflammatory/pro-fibrotic phenotype characteristic of M-CSF-dependent monocyte-derived macrophages.</p>

<p>Remarkably, the phenotypic changes induced by GSK3 inhibition were also accompanied by alterations in macrophage functional capabilities. Thus, CHIR-GM-MØ exhibited elevated anti-inflammatory activity, evidenced by increased production of IL-10 upon activation by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF or IFNγ, or exposure to PAMPs like LPS or the TLR7 ligand CL264 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).

Of note, in line with the well-established connection between inflammatory potential and metabolic state in macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, GSK3 inhibition also induced modifications in various metabolic parameters in GM-MØ, including basal respiration and maximal ATP production (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1D-F</xref>).</p>

<title>GSK3 inhibition redirects monocytes towards acquiring a gene profile reminiscent of anti-inflammatory M-MØ</title>
<p>Given the swift and profound anti-inflammatory impact observed in fully differentiated GM-MØ upon GSK3 inhibition or knock-down, we next delved into assessing whether modulation of GSK3 activity influence the differentiation capability of peripheral blood monocytes. To that end, monocytes were exposed to CHIR-99021, and the resulting cells (CHIR-Mon, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) exhibited increased MAFB levels as early as 16 hours post-treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Remarkably, the 16-hour exposure to the GSK3 inhibitor induced significant alterations in the expression of over 2000 genes ([log<sub>2</sub>FC]&gt;1; <italic>adj p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) and sufficed to augment the expression of M-MØ-specific genes and genes upregulated during M-CSF-dependent monocyte-to-M-MØ differentiation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), including <italic>CCL2</italic>, <italic>CD163</italic> and <italic>IL10</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Notably, the transcriptome of CHIR-Mon exhibited a significant enrichment in MAFB-dependent genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>) and genes characterizing the MAFB+ pathogenic macrophages in severe COVID-19 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>), whereas it showed an under-representation of genes inhibited by MAFB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Compared to DMSO, CHIR-99021 treatment upregulated the expression of 25% of M-MØ-specific genes, including MAFB-dependent genes like <italic>CCL2</italic>, <italic>IL10</italic> and <italic>CD163</italic>, while downregulating 30% of GM-MØ-specific genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>), and this transcriptional effect was also evident in comparison with M-CSF-treated monocytes (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2D</xref>). To broaden the scope of these findings, we also examined the consequences of inhibiting GSK3 in monocytes exposed to a pathologic pro-inflammatory environment, namely synovial fluid from patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RASF) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). Evaluation of CHIR-99021-treated monocytes in the presence of RASF revealed an enhanced expression of MAFB (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>) and MAFB-dependent genes such as <italic>IL10</italic> and <italic>LGMN</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>). Therefore, GSK3 inhibition in monocytes also leads to heightened MAFB expression, ultimately steering differentiation towards anti-inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages.</p>

<title>Inhibition of GSK3 in <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated human alveolar macrophages promotes the acquisition of an M-MØ-like anti-inflammatory profile</title>
<p>To further validate the macrophage re-programming potential of GSK3 inhibition, we next conducted experiments on <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated human alveolar macrophages (AMØ, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), whose development and gene expression profile is GM-CSF-dependent <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. To that end, we determined the transcriptome of three independent isolates of AMØ, purified from broncho-alveolar lavages, after exposure to CHIR-99021 for 24 hours (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). A total of 865 differentially expressed genes ([log<sub>2</sub>FC]&gt;1; <italic>adj p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were identified, with 316 genes upregulated in CHIR-AMØ (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Further comparisons and gene ontology analysis revealed that GSK3 inhibition by CHIR-99021 (CHIR-AMØ) upregulated the gene sets that define pathogenic pro-fibrotic macrophage subsets in severe COVID-19 [(SPP1<sup>+</sup>, GSE145926) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, MoAM3 (GSE155249) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> or CD163<sup>+</sup>/LGMN<sup>+</sup> MØ (EGAS00001005634) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>] (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C,D</xref>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2E</xref>).

Like in the case of CHIR-GM-MØ, CHIR-AMØ exhibited an over-representation of M-MØ-specific genes and genes acquired along the monocyte-to-M-MØ differentiation (GSE188278) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2G</xref>). Consistent with these findings, CHIR-AMØ exhibited higher expression of MAFB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>) whose increase correlated with an augmented secretion of Legumain, CCL2 and IL-10 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>), although the latter was only seen in two samples, probably reflecting heterogeneity in primary cell responses. In contrast, lower levels of activin A were detected in CHIR-AMØ-conditioned medium (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Remarkably, and in agreement with the shift in macrophage subsets that takes place in severe COVID-19 lungs (loss of AMØ, appearance of monocyte-derived pro-fibrotic macrophages) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, the level of phosphorylated Ser<sup>21</sup>-GSK3α and Ser<sup>9</sup>-GSK3β was very significantly augmented in lung macrophages (CD68+) from severe COVID-19 patients, an increase that correlated with a robust enhancement of the macrophage expression of both MAFB and the MAFB-dependent protein CD163 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). These results collectively demonstrate that macrophage re-programming through GSK3 inhibition can also be achieved on <italic>in vivo</italic> isolated macrophages, leading to enhanced expression of MAFB and MAFB-dependent genes, the acquisition of an anti-inflammatory transcriptional profile and the loss of the signature of lung-resident human AMØ.</p>

The comparison of IMØ and AMØ subsets revealed that the genes upregulated upon inhibition of GSK3 include numerous MAFB-dependent genes (e.g., <italic>MAFB</italic>, <italic>IL10</italic>, <italic>LGMN</italic>, <italic>SPP1</italic>, <italic>CCL2</italic>) and showed a higher expression in IMØ (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>).

Therefore, GSK3 inhibition prompts macrophages towards the acquisition of a gene profile that resembles that of IMØ, while provokes the loss of the AMØ gene signature. Such a conclusion was also reached upon analysis of pseudo bulk-RNA sequencing data from GSE128033 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.

Further GSEA evidenced that GSK3 inhibition in either GM-MØ (CHIR-GM-MØ) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>) or AMØ (CHIR-AMØ) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>) very significantly enhance the expression of MAFB-dependent IMØ-specific genes (as defined by Morse <italic>et al</italic>. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> or by Li <italic>et al</italic>. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>), while simultaneosuly impaired the expression of genes characterizing human AMØ (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E-F</xref>).

Altogether, these results indicate that inhibiting GSK3 shifts the gene profile of Alveolar Macrophages towards that of Interstitial Macrophages (or monocyte-derived macrophages), and imply that the activation status of GSK3 significantly influences the specification of lung-resident macrophages (AMØ <italic>vs</italic>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our previous investigations have demonstrated that the macrophage re-programming effect of LXR modulators <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> and methotrexate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> coincide with alterations in the protein levels of MAFB. Similarly, intravenous immunoglobulins have been shown to alter the inflammatory state of macrophages and modulate MAFB levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Building upon these findings and others, we have explored whether modulating the activity of GSK3, a primary regulator of MAFB protein levels and activity, is sufficient to induce a shift in the inflammatory profile of human macrophages. Our results indicate that GSK3 inhibition impairs the expression of genes associated with GM-CSF-dependent differentiation of monocyte-derived macrophages while concurrently promoting the acquisition of genes and functions associated with M-CSF-dependent monocyte-derived macrophages, particularly those regulated by MAFB. The physiological relevance of these findings is underscored by the contrasting effect that GSK3 inhibition has on genes that define lung-resident alveolar macrophages (decrease) versus monocyte-derived macrophages recruited into the lung (increase) during inflammatory responses. Thus, modulation of GSK3 activity emerges as a plausible strategy for macrophage reprogramming in therapeutic interventions.</p>
<p>Therapeutic approaches aimed at re-educating tumor-associated macrophages into immunostimulatory cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> may involve targeting the macrophage PI3Kγ intracellular signaling pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, which inhibits NFκB activation through Akt and mTOR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, thereby inducing an anti-inflammatory program that promotes immune suppression. Indeed, macrophage PI3Kγ inactivation stimulates and prolongs NFκB activation, promoting an immunostimulatory transcriptional program <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. The ability of PI3Kγ to toggle between immune stimulation and suppression aligns with our findings on GSK3 inhibition, as PI3Kγ inactivates GSK3 via phosphorylation of Ser<sup>9</sup> (GSK3β) and Ser<sup>21</sup> (GSK3α) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Threfore, GSK3 inhibition may contribute to the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of PI3Kγ inactivation by enhancing MAFB expression. Moreover, MAFB might even participate in the macrophage reprogramming consequences of mTOR modulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> due to the known reciprocal interactions between GSK3 and mTOR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Hence, since the phosporylation of MAFB by GSK3 requires of a prior “priming” phosphorylation event <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, identification of the MAFB priming kinase(s) emerges as a potentially relevant effort in the search for additional targets for macrophage re-programming.</p>
<p>The significant impact of GSK3 inhibition by CHIR-99021 on the macrophage transcriptional profile mirrors the effects observed with other GSK3 inhibitors on the differentiation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Specifically, GSK3 inhibitors like LiCl, SB415286, or SB216763 redirect the GM-CSF+IL-4-dependent development of MDDC towards the generation of macrophage-like cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Considering that MAFB expression is higher in monocyte-derived macrophages than in dendritic cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, it is reasonable to infer that GSK3 inhibitors also boost MAFB expression in cells differentiated in the presence of GM-CSF+IL-4, thereby supporting the modulation of GSK3 activity as a tool to alter lineage determination in myeloid cells.</p>
<p>The re-programming effect of GSK3 inhibition on <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated alveolar macrophages bears significant therapeutic implications, particularly in severe COVID-19 cases where profibrotic monocyte-derived macrophages replace GM-CSF-dependent tissue-resident alveolar macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Our observations reveal that exposure of <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated alveolar macrophages to CHIR-99021 leads to the loss of the alveolar macrophage GM-CSF-dependent gene profile and the acquisition of a MAFB-dependent pro-fibrotic transcriptional landscape resembling that of M-CSF-dependent monocyte-derived macrophages. Given that MAFB serves as a negative regulator of GM-CSF signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, downregulation of MAFB expression through modulation of GSK3 activity emerges as a rationale strategy to re-direct pathogenic monocyte-derived macrophages towards the acquisition of a lung-resident alveolar macrophage-like profile during severe COVID-19. This approach aligns with the proposed therapeutic use of GM-CSF in COVID-19 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, as GM-CSF would impede or limit the MAFB-dependent upregulation of profibrotic and neutrophil-attracting factors observed in severe COVID-19 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Rios et al. investigates the potential of GSK3 inhibition to reprogram human macrophages, exploring its therapeutic implications in conditions like severe COVID-19. The authors present convincing evidence that GSK3 inhibition shifts macrophage phenotypes from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory states, thus highlighting the GSK3-MAFB axis as a potential therapeutic target. Using both GM-CSF- and M-CSF-dependent monocyte-derived macrophages as model systems, the study provides extensive transcriptional, phenotypic, and functional characterizations of these reprogrammed cells.

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are no significant weaknesses in the study, though some minor points could be addressed for clarity and completeness, as outlined in the recommendations below.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Many thanks for these comments. Please find below the response to the  specific recommendations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors</bold>:</p>
<p>(1) In lines 263-266, the term &quot;MoMac-VERSE&quot; and its associated clusters are introduced without sufficient explanation. The authors should provide additional clarification on what these clusters represent and how they were derived.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the text according to the reviewer´s suggestion and followed the original nomenclature of the MoMac-VERSE monocyte/macrophage clusters, also recognizing the procedure for their identification. The newly modified text now states: &quot;Thus, analysis of the MoMac-VERSE (a resource that identified conserved monocyte and macrophage states derived from healthy and pathologic human tissues) (GSE178209) (2), indicated that GSK3 inhibition augments the expression of the gene sets that define MoMac-VERSE subsets identified as long-term resident macrophages [Cluster HES1_Mac (#2)] and tumor-associated macrophages with an M2-like signature [Clusters HES1_Mac (#2), TREM2_Mac (#3), C1Q<sup>hi</sup>_Mac (#16) and FTL_Mac (#17)] (2) (Figure 1H).&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In line 283, the reference labeled &quot;2227&quot; appears incorrect. It seems to be a formatting issue, and it might refer to references 22-27. Please verify and correct.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All wrongly formatted references throughout the manuscript have been checked and corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In line 353, the reference is incorrect. Please reviewe ensure that all references are properly cited throughout the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All wrongly formatted references throughout the manuscript have been checked and corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In line 368, one of the patient samples shows a decreased IL-10 response after CHIR treatment. The authors should acknowledge the heterogeneity in the primary cell responses and adjust the conclusion accordingly to reflect this variability.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have modified the text following the reviewer´s comment, and acknowledge the heterogeneity in the production of IL-10 after GSK3 inhibition in the three analyzed samples. The modified text now states: &quot;Consistent with these findings, CHIR-AMØ exhibited higher expression of MAFB (Figure 6F) whose increase correlated with an augmented secretion of Legumain, CCL2 and IL-10 (Figure 6G), although the latter was only seen in two samples, probably reflecting heterogeneity in primary cell responses.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 7B: the UMAP shows 4 populations, but according to the visualization in the sup fig 3, there should be many more clusters. How do the authors explain this? Are these patient-specific clusters? Also, IMs can be separated into at least subpopulations. Can the authors plot also bona fide macrophage markers expressed by all subpopulations?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To clarify this whole issue, and avoid misleading visualization of donor-specific clusters (see below), we have now replaced all UMAP plots shown in the previous version (in old Figure 7 and old Supplementary Figure 3) with new UMAP plots after running scVI reduction. In addition, we are including a new Supplementary Figure (new Supplementary Figure 3) that contains the information of the 21310 single-cell transcriptomes from human lungs reported in GSE128033 (ref. 47) after filtering and integration [nFeature &gt; 200 and &lt; 6000; Unique Molecular Identifiers (nCount) &gt; 1000) and % of mitochondrial genes (&lt; 15 %)]. Besides, old Supplementary Figure 3 has been replaced by the new Supplementary Figure 4, which includes the information of the single-cell transcriptomes from human lung macrophages selected from GSE128033 (ref. 47) based on their expression of the monocyte/macrophage-associated markers <italic>CD163</italic>, <italic>FABP4</italic>, <italic>LYVE1</italic> or <italic>FCN1</italic>.</p>
<p>Addresing the first question, UMAPs in old Figure 7B and old Supplementary Figure 3B had a different  number of clusters because old Figure 7B was derived from old Supplementary Figure 3B after grouping macrophage clusters according to the expression of previously defined markers and to limit the weight of donor-specific clusters. Specifically, the macrophage clusters from old Figure 7B were re-grouped according to the differential expression of:</p>
<p><italic>- FCN1</italic> (including cluster 4, 7 and 12 from Figure 7B): Infiltrating monocytes.</p>
<p>- <italic>FABP4</italic> and <italic>TYMS</italic>-negative (including clusters 0, 2, 5 and 13 from Figure 7B), or MARCO and INHBA (cluster 9 from Figure 7B) or PPARG (cluster 11 from Figure 7B): Alveolar macrophages (AMØ).</p>
<p>- <italic>TYMS</italic>, <italic>MKI67</italic>, <italic>TOP2A</italic> and <italic>NUSAP1</italic> (cluster 15 from Figure 7B): Proliferating AMØ.</p>
<p>- <italic>LYVE1</italic> or <italic>RNASE1</italic> or <italic>LGMN</italic> (including clusters 1, 3, 6, 8, 10 and 14 from Figure 7B): Interstitial Macrophages (IMØ).</p>
<p>As the reviewer suggested, this type of UMAP plot yielded a large number of donor-specific clusters. To avoid such a misleading representation, we have now plotted UMAPs after running scVI reduction in every case. The new plots are now shown in new Figure 7A, new Figure 7B, new Supplementary Figure 3 (containing the information of the 21310 single-cell transcriptomes from GSE128033) and the novel Supplementary Figure 4 (with the information of the single-cell transcriptomes from human lung macrophages from GSE128033).</p>
<p>Finally, to address the last issue, we have now plotted the expression of genes used for macrophage definition (<italic>CD163, FABP4, LYVE1, FCN1</italic>), as well as proliferation-associated genes (<italic>TYMS, MKI67, TOP2A, NUSAP1</italic>) and other <italic>bona fide</italic> macrophage marker genes (<italic>SPI1, FOLR2</italic>) in Supplementary Figure 4C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) statistics should be indicated in every figure legend and for every subfigure where applicable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now included the specific statistical procedure applied for each Figure and panel.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>The study by Rios and colleagues provides the scientific community with a compelling exploration of macrophage plasticity and its potential as a therapeutic target. By focusing on the GSK3-MAFB axis, the authors present a strong case for macrophage reprogramming as a strategy to combat inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, including severe COVID-19. Using a robust and comprehensive methodology, in this study it is conducted a broad transcriptomic and functional analyses and offers valuable mechanistic insights while highlighting its clinical relevance</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Well performed and analyzed</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Additional analyses, including mechanistic studies, would increase the value of the study</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In an effort to address the comment of the reviewer, we have performed more detailed analysis of the kinetics and dose-response effects of GSK3 inhibition, which are now provided as new Supplementary Figure 3A.</p>
<p>Regarding additional mechanistic studies, we decided to explore the relationship between inactive GSK3β and MAFB levels at the early stages of M-CSF- or GM-CSF-driven monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. These experiments, performed in three independent monocyte preparations, indicated that, 48 hours along differentiation, M-CSF promoted a huge increase in both MAFB expression and a slight (albeit significant) rise in inactive GSK3β (P-Ser9-GSK3β) (compared to either untreated or GM-CSF-treated monocytes), further supporting the macrophage re-programming effect of GSK3. However, since the M-CSF-promoted increase in MAFB levels was much robust than the enhancement in inactive GSK3β, we hypothesize that proteasomal degradation of MAFB might be also distinct between M-CSF- (M-MØ) and GM-CSF-dependent (GM-MØ) monocyte-derived macrophages.</p>

<p>Vinculin protein levels were determined as protein loading control. Mean ± SEM of the GSK3β/Vinculin, p-Ser9-GSK3β/Vinculin, and MAFB/Vinculin protein ratios from the three independent experiments are shown (lower panel) (paired Student’s t test: *, p&lt;0.05; ****, p&lt;0.001).</p>

</fig>
<p>Based on this finding, we then determined proteasome activity in fully differentiated M-CSF- and GM-CSF-dependent monocyte-derived macrophages. Use of the Immunoproteasome Activity Fluorometric Assay Kit II (UBPBio) in M-MØ and GM-MØ, either untreated or exposed to the proteasome inhibitor MG132, revealed that immune-proteasomal and proteasomal activity is significantly stronger in GM-MØ than in M-MØ,  as demonstrated in assays for chymotrypsin-like (ANW) and branched amino acid preferring (PAL) activity (immunoproteasome), and trypsin-like (KQL) activity (both proteasome and immunoproteasome). This result suggested that, indeed, immunoproteasomal activity might contribute to the differential expression of MAFB in M-MØ and GM-MØ.</p>

</fig>
<p>Consequently, we next set up experiments to assess whether the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was capable of enhancing the expression of MAFB-dependent genes in GM-MØ. Preliminary results of GM-MØ exposure to MG132 for 6 hours indicated an increase in the expression of MAFB protein and the MAFB-dependent genes <italic>LGMN</italic> and <italic>IL10</italic>. , as well as a reduction in the expression of the GM-MØ-specific gene <italic>CD1C</italic>.</p>

Mean ± SEM of the MAFB/GAPDH protein ratios from the four independent experiments are shown (right panel) (paired Student’s t test: ***, p&lt;0.005). C.

<p>Unfortunately, this proteasome inhibitor (MG-132) caused a great reduction in cell viability after 6-8 hours. Since a similar decrease in cell viability was observed upon analysis with the ONX-0914 immunoproteasome inhibitor, we could not procede any further with this approach.</p>
<p>Given the reviewer´s suggestion to include mechanistic insights to the manuscript, we are now providing these results (and the corresponding figures) only for the reviewer´s information and to make clear our attempts to comply with his/her request.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors</bold>:</p>
<p>The results are of interest, and only some minor issues need to be addressed to strengthen the conclusions of the study.</p>

<p>We gratefully thank the reviewer for his/her comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) This study employs a single dose of 10 μM of the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR-99021 for 48 hours, which is reasonable for in vitro studies. However, further investigation into the effect of different doses and exposure times could provide additional insight into optimal dosing and durability of reprogramming effects. In addition, would an alternative GSK3 inhibitors have comparable effects?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the reviewer suggestion, we have performed a kinetics and dose-response analysis of the effects of CHIR-99021, using MAFB protein levels as a readout. This experiments is now shown in new Supplementary Figure 1A, that replaces the old Supplementary Figure 1A panel where a shorter kinetics was presented. Results of this new experiment indicates a maximal effect of 10µM CHIR-99021, and that the effect of the inhibitor becomes maximal 24-48 hours after treatment. The text has been modified accordingly, and it now states: &quot;Kinetics and dose-response analysis of the effects of CHIR-99021 on MAFB expression showed that maximal protein levels were achieved after a 24-48 hour exposure to 10µM CHIR-99021 (Supplementary Figure 1A), conditions that were used hereafter.&quot;</p>
<p>Regarding the use of alternative GSK3 inhibitors, we had already provided that information in Supplementary Figure 1B, where the effects of SB-216763 (10 µM) or LiCl (10 mM) were evaluated. The huge reversal of the Tyr<sup>216</sup>/Ser<sup>9</sup> GSK3β phosphorylation ratio observed with CHIR-99021 was not seen with other GSK3 inhibitors, as indicated in the text. In any event, we believe that the relevance of this result with SB-216763 or LiCl is minimized by the results generated after siRNA-mediated GSK3 knockdown (shown in Figure 4), that completely reproduced the effects seen with CHIR-99021.</p>

<p>(2) Why in the &quot;reanalysis of single cell RNAseq data&quot; section, the authors use Seurat v5 (R) but then change to python, and the other way around?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As indicated in the documentation for Integrative Analysis in Seurat v5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/seurat5_integration">https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/seurat5_integration</ext-link>), scVIIntegration requires reticulate package which allow us to run Python environment in R.</p>

<p>(3) When the authors refer to the clusters enriched in MoMacVERSE, they use the labels of the clusters (for example #2 or #3). I would suggest using the annotations described in the original paper, to link it to the bibliography published through the labels established in the paper.</p>

<p>We have revised the text according to the reviewer´s suggestion and followed the original nomenclature of the MoMac-VERSE monocyte/macrophage clusters, also recognizing the procedure for their identification. The newly modified text now states: &quot;Thus, analysis of the MoMac-VERSE (a resource that identified conserved monocyte and macrophage states derived from healthy and pathologic human tissues) (GSE178209) (2), indicated that GSK3 inhibition augments the expression of the gene sets that define MoMac-VERSE subsets identified as long-term resident macrophages [Cluster HES1_Mac (#2)] and tumor-associated macrophages with an M2-like signature [Clusters HES1_Mac (#2), TREM2_Mac (#3), C1Q<sup>hi</sup>_Mac (#16) and FTL_Mac (#17)] (2) (Figure 1H).&quot;</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the misleading sentence. The phrase has been modified for better clarity, and the text now states: &quot;Like CHIR-99021, silencing of both GSK3A and GSK3B augmented the expression of MAFB, with the simultaneous silencing of both GSK3A and GSK3B genes having a stronger effect (Figure 4B), and modulated the expression of 329 genes (Figure 4C,D).&quot;</p>

<p>(6) In the single-cell reanalysis, could you please provide integration Qc plots? It would be interesting to have it on the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To clarify this whole issue, and avoid misleading visualization of donor-specific clusters (see below), we have now replaced all UMAP plots shown in the previous version (in old Figure 7 and old Supplementary Figure 3) with new UMAP plots after running scVI reduction. In addition, we are including a new Supplementary Figure (new Supplementary Figure 3) that contains the information of the 21310 single-cell transcriptomes from human lungs reported in GSE128033 (ref. 47) after filtering and integration [nFeature &gt; 200 and &lt; 6000; Unique Molecular Identifiers (nCount) &gt; 1000) and % of mitochondrial genes (&lt; 15 %)]. Besides, old Supplementary Figure 3 has been replaced by the new Supplementary Figure 4, which includes the information of the single-cell transcriptomes from human lung macrophages selected from GSE128033 (ref. 47) based on their expression of the monocyte/macrophage-associated markers <italic>CD163</italic>, <italic>FABP4</italic>, <italic>LYVE1</italic> or <italic>FCN1</italic>.</p>
<p>As requested by the reviewer, we are now providing the Qc plots for the re-analysis in the new Supplementary Figures 3 and 4.</p>
