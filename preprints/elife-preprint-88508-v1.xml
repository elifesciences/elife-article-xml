<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Yes-associated protein (YAP), the downstream effector of the evolutionarily conserved Hippo pathway, promotes cellular proliferation and coordinates certain regenerative responses in mammals. Small molecule activators of YAP may therefore display therapeutic utility in treating disease states involving insufficient proliferative repair. From a high-throughput chemical screen of the comprehensive drug repurposing library ReFRAME, here we report the identification of SM04690, a clinical stage inhibitor of CLK2, as a potent activator of YAP driven transcriptional activity in cells. CLK2 inhibition promotes alternative splicing of the Hippo pathway protein AMOTL2, producing an exon-skipped gene product that can no longer associate with membrane-bound proteins, resulting in decreased phosphorylation and membrane localization of YAP. This study reveals a novel mechanism by which pharmacological perturbation of alternative splicing inactivates the Hippo pathway and promotes YAP dependent cellular growth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The evolutionarily and functionally conserved Hippo signaling pathway functions as a master regulator of cellular proliferation and tissue growth in animals. Molecularly, the Hippo pathway is composed of a kinase cascade that catalyzes a series of phosphorylation events at the plasma membrane. The core pathway includes Ste20-like kinase 1 (MST1) and MST2, which phosphorylate and activate large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1) and LATS2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. LATS1/2 phosphorylation results in the phosphorylation of downstream effector Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP), leading to its cytoplasmic retention and inactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Several other proteins work together to regulate the core kinase cascade, such as Salvador homolog 1 (SAV1) and MOB kinase activator 1A and 1B (MOB1A/B), binders of MST1/2 and LATS1/2, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In addition to phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the Hippo pathway, YAP is also regulated by protein-protein interactions, such as with the angiomotin family of proteins (AMOT, AMOTL1, and AMOTL2), which directly bind to and cause the localization of YAP at tight junctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Adherens junctions and tight junctions are important sites of Hippo pathway regulation that link to the core kinases of the Hippo pathway through the AMOT proteins. When the Hippo pathway is inactivated, YAP translocates to the nucleus, acting as a transcriptional co-activator of TEA domain transcription factors (TEADs), which increases the transcription of genes involved in cellular proliferation and survival.</p>
<p>Regulation of the Hippo Pathway by cell-cell contacts, metabolic changes, and diverse extrinsic inputs results in decreased activity of YAP, which prevents organ overgrowth and abnormal cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. On the other hand, YAP activity is also critical in healing injury by augmenting cellular proliferation and survival. While many multicellular organisms can repair wounded or damaged organs, mammalian regeneration is more limited, as many adult tissues lack the capacity to regenerate. Genetic activation of YAP, either by genetic inactivation of upstream Hippo pathway proteins or by forced overexpression of YAP, has been shown to enhance endogenous repair in wounded tissues. For example, hepatic knockdown of MST1/2 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) in the mouse after partial hepatectomy augments regeneration of the liver via YAP dependent hepatocyte proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Likewise, in the skin, YAP is essential for regenerative wound repair, as siRNA-mediated knockdown of YAP markedly delays wound closure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. On the other hand, conditional hyperactivation of YAP enhances proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes, thickening the epidermal layer of neonatal mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Lastly, in the heart, an organ previously considered to have no regenerative potential post-development, conditional SAV deletion promotes proliferation of cardiomyocytes and reverses deficits in ejection fraction volume post myocardial infarction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Collectively, these studies suggest that small molecule activators of YAP may therefore display therapeutic utility in treating diseases etiologically defined by an insufficient proliferative response.</p>
<p>We recently reported the identification of PY-60, a small molecule that activates YAP by binding to a membrane-binding scaffolding protein, annexin A2 (ANXA2), which we defined as a central component of the Hippo pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. This study suggested to us that likely many other druggable mechanisms exist for activating YAP including those associated with previously drugged cellular proteins. Here, to explore the hypothesis that known drugs might activate YAP driven transcriptional activity, we performed a reporter-based screen of the comprehensive drug repurposing library ReFRAME. We found that SM04690, a small molecule kinase inhibitor in clinical trials for the treatment of osteoarthritis, activates YAP with nanomolar potency in cells. Mechanistic studies revealed the relevant target kinase of SM04690 to be CDC-like Kinase 2 (CLK2), inhibition of which induces alternative splicing of Hippo signaling component AMOTL2 that can no longer localize YAP to the plasma membrane, in effect activating YAP.</p>

<title>Screening of the ReFRAME library</title>
<p>To identify small molecule activators of YAP, we screened the Repurposing, Focused Rescue, and Accelerated Medchem (ReFRAME) small molecule library using a HEK293A cell line with a stably integrated cassette of eight copies of the TEAD-binding element upstream of luciferase (293A-TEAD-LUC). This library contains â¼13,000 small molecules that have undergone substantial preclinical evaluation, clinical development, or are FDA-approved (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. The screen was conducted using a previously validated assay in 1,536-well format at three compound concentrations (200 nM, 2 Î¼M, and 10 Î¼M) to maximize the potential number of mechanisms surveyed. Hit compounds were defined if they displayed increases of TEAD-LUC signal of more than 5 robust Z scores above mean plate signal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Identified hits could be grouped into several classes of inhibitors including known nonspecific modulators of transcription (e.g., bromodomain inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors), ion channel modulators, and kinase inhibitors, among others (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Of these, we identified 15 kinase inhibitors that did not have any associated YAP augmenting activity and are not characterized inhibitors of MST1/2 and LATS1/2. Evaluating these 15 hits in dose response using the original screening assay with library material, we confirmed 9 displayed reproducible YAP activation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Of these, three were inhibitors of non-receptor tyrosine kinases including Cerdulatinib (inhibitor of SYK and JAK paralogs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>; TEAD-LUC EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.31 Î¼M), peficitinib (a pan JAK inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>; TEAD-LUC EC<sub>50</sub> = 2.4 Î¼M), and KX02 (an inhibitor of SRC family kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>; TEAD-LUC EC<sub>50</sub> = 3.7 Î¼M). Also identified as efficacious YAP activators were XL-999 (a pan RTK inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, TEAD-LUC EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.5 Î¼M) and CEP-1347 (a JNK family inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>; TEAD-LUC EC<sub>50</sub> = 2.5 Î¼M). Two inhibitors of the AGC family of kinases were also identified, namely GSK690693<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> (TEAD-LUC EC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 20 Î¼M) and AT13148<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> (TEAD-LUC EC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 20 Î¼M). Lastly, we identified two inhibitors of CLK and DYRK family kinases including SM04690<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> (TEAD-LUC EC<sub>50</sub> = 5.7 Î¼M) and SM04646<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> (TEAD-LUC EC<sub>50</sub> = 2.1 Î¼M), which had been initially described as agents which inhibit canonical Wnt signaling and induce differentiation of chondrocytes. Among these, we chose to further characterize SM04690, which is in clinical trials for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, as no association of its target kinases had previously been reported as related to Hippo pathway signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>SM04690 is a YAP activator</title>
<p>We first confirmed the YAP-stimulating activity of SM04690 in 384-well format using 293A-TEAD-LUC cells with fresh, commercially obtained material, finding that the compound dose-dependently increased TEAD-LUC reporter activity with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 1.2 nM, a value considerably more potent than that observed in the screening assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We next confirmed that SM04690 functionally activated a YAP driven transcriptional program, as SM04690 was found to significantly increase the levels of YAP-controlled transcripts <italic>ANKRD1</italic> and <italic>CTGF</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Likewise, SM04690 treatment markedly decreased phosphorylation of YAP, as SM04690 was found to decrease immunopositivity dose-dependently to anti-phospho-YAP in Western blotting experiments following 24-hour compound treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). We next knocked down YAP transcript using shRNA and found that 1 Î¼M compound treatment failed to increase <italic>ANKRD1</italic> and <italic>CTGF</italic> transcript levels in the absence of YAP, suggesting the compound activates a YAP dependent transcriptional program (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). We additionally observed by immunofluorescent imaging that YAP localized to the nucleus in MDCK cells treated with SM04690 (1 Î¼M, 24 hours), suggestive that compound treatment promotes nuclear translocation and activation of YAP. This is in comparison to diffuse plasma membrane and cytoplasm YAP localization in DMSO treated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E, F</xref>). Lastly, since pharmacological YAP activators have been shown to promote expansion of cells, we tested 0.2 nM SM04690 treatment in immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT) over 7 days and found treatment promoted clonal expansion, as seen with rhodamine B staining and increased nuclei counts (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A, B</xref>). Importantly, these proliferative effects occur at a non-cytotoxic concentration (under 0.5 nM) of SM04690 treatment (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>).</p>

<title>CLK2 is the relevant cellular target of SM04690</title>
<p>SM04690 was first described in the literature as an inhibitor of Wnt signaling capable of promoting differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to chondrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Following work defined SM04690 as an inhibitor of several subfamilies of related CMGC family protein kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, including Dual Specificity Tyrosine Phosphorylation Regulated Kinase (DYRK) and CDC Like Kinase (CLK) subfamilies (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). Specifically, SM04690 has been shown to inhibit CLK2, CLK3, DYRK1A and B, Homeodomain Interacting Protein Kinase 1 (HIPK1), and HIPK2 with over 90% inhibition at 500 nM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. As such, we hypothesized that inhibiting one of these targets was likely responsible for modulating YAP activity. Previously published transcript expression data from our lab indicated that among the targets of SM04690 only CLK2, DYRK1B, HIPK1, and HIPK2 are expressed in HEK293A cells, helping to narrow our search (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. We then treated 293A-TEAD-LUC cells with structurally distinct small molecule inhibitors of these putative targets to see if other treatment of cells with inhibitors to the potential target might recapitulate the YAP activating effect of SM04690. We found that only inhibitors targeting CLK2 (CC671, CLK-in-T3, and T025) elicited a dose-dependent increase in YAP activity (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref>). In contrast, inhibitors targeting DYRKs (Harmine, INDY, and Leucettine L41) and CLK4 (ML167, TG003) showed no activity at concentrations over multiple orders of magnitude (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2D</xref>). To confirm CLK2 as the relevant target of SM04690, we knocked down CLK2 by approximately 50% using three different targeting shRNAs, all of which increased YAP-controlled transcripts <italic>ANKRD1, CTGF</italic>, and <italic>CYR61</italic> to varying degrees (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). Collectively, these data strongly suggested that CLK2 was most likely the target of SM04690 responsible for activating YAP.</p>

<p>CLK2 is a protein kinase that phosphorylates serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins of the spliceosomal complex. SR proteins play an important role in exon selection with the spliceosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The phosphorylation states of SR proteins dictate their subcellular localization and interactions with pre-mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. When CLK2 is inhibited, SR proteins are not phosphorylated, leading to alternative splicing that is most often exon skipping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Previous work using pharmacological CLK2 inhibitors revealed that inhibiting SR phosphorylation had a marked transcriptome wide effect on altering alternative splicing. Interestingly, the third most skipped exon of the transcriptome in response to CLK2 inhibition corresponded to exon 5 of Angiomotin-like 2 (AMOTL2), as nearly 3,000 new junction reads between non-neighboring exons were observed in this study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). Exon 9 of AMOTL2 was also skipped but to a lesser extent with around 700 new junction reads. AMOTL2 is part of the AMOT family of proteins and is crucial to the tight junction localization of YAP through direct interaction with YAPâs WW domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Notably, knockdown of AMOTL2 decreases the content of tight junction-localized YAP, instead promoting YAP translocation to the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Given the central role that AMOTL2 plays in regulating YAP as well as the observation that no other canonical Hippo pathway member displayed alternative splicing in response to CLK2 inhibition, we hypothesized that SM04690 most likely increased YAP activity through modulating AMOTL2 splicing.</p>

<title>SM04690 induces alternative splicing of AMOTL2</title>
<p>We first confirmed that SM04690 treatment results in alternative splicing of AMOTL2. Consistent with reported literature, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) revealed that 24-hour SM04690 treatment at 1 Î¼M induces exon skipping for exon 5 by 61-fold and exon 9 by 14-fold when compared to untreated samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">S4A</xref>). Using semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR, in which primers are designed directly flanking an exon, we could visualize the presence of each splice isoform using gel electrophoresis. Exon 5, which is 93 base pairs long, has a PCR amplicon length of 132 base pairs when primer sequences are added on both ends (39 base pairs for both) (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>). Indeed, in the untreated samples, the amplicon ran through the gel to just over 100 base pairs. However, in the sample treated with 100 nM of SM04690, the PCR amplicon ran well under 100 base pairs, as only the sequences of the primers were amplified, indicating skipping of exon 5 (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C</xref>). Exon 9 is 180 base pairs long with a PCR amplicon length of 218 base pairs with the primer sequences, (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>) which we see in the untreated sample. Similar to exon 5, in the 100 nM SM04690 treated sample, the PCR amplicon ran under 100 base pairs, indicating the skipping of exon 9 (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C</xref>). This experiment thus confirmed that SM04690 treatment of HEK293A cells created exon skipping of exons as indicated by shorter PCR amplicons in treated samples differing from the untreated samples by exactly the length of the missing exon. The presence of exon skipped spliceoforms at the protein level was confirmed by anti-AMOTL2 Western blot using an antibody that can detect each possible spliceoform of AMOTL2. We found that with increasing SM04690 treatment in HEK293A cells for 24 hours, there was the appearance of broad lower molecular weight bands, consistent with the buildup of multiple forms of exon-skipped AMOTL2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). It is important to note that both the RT-qPCR and Western blot not only indicate the increase in alternative splicing but also an increase in the total AMOTL2 present with SM04690 treatment, as the relative transcript level of total AMOTL2 in SM04690 treated cells increased 1.7-fold in the RT-qPCR analysis and the Western blot showed increase band width.</p>

<title>Exon-skipped AMOTL2 activates YAP through a dominant mechanism</title>
<p>AMOTL2 interacts directly with YAP, helping to localize it to the plasma membrane. Accordingly, we next assessed if the exon-skipped gene products might interfere with the ability of AMOTL2 to bind YAP. Using FLAG-tagged transient overexpression constructs of wild-type AMOTL2 (WT), exon 5-skipped AMOTL2 (Î5), exon 9-skipped AMOTL2 (Î9), and double exon-skipped AMOTL2 (Î5Î9) (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4D</xref>), we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies with HA-tagged YAP at high cell density in HEK293T cells. We found that the three AMOTL2 spliceoforms retained a similar ability to bind YAP as the WT AMOTL2 transgene (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). As such, we next assessed if overexpression of the spliceoform transgenes themselves was sufficient to activate YAP. From experiments in HEK293A cells transiently overexpressing WT AMOLT2 or each of the three transgenes (AMOTL2 Î5, AMOTL2 Î9, AMOTL2 Î5Î9), AMOTL2 Î5Î9 uniquely displayed 1.5 to 2 times higher levels of YAP controlled transcripts in comparison to cell overexpressing WT AMOTL2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). In contrast, no transcriptional induction was observed by expression of AMOTL2 Î5 and only a minor induction of <italic>ANKRD1</italic> was observed for AMOTL2 Î9, suggesting the AMOTL2 Î5Î9 spliceoform likely has a stronger YAP activating effect than either skipped exon alone. Given expression of the AMOTL2 spliceoforms mimics the effects of SM04690 treatment, we sought to understand if overexpression of WT AMOTL2 might inhibit the ability of SM04690 to activate YAP. Indeed, overexpression of WT AMOTL2 was found to inhibit the upregulation of <italic>ANKRD1, CTGF, and CYR61</italic> in response to 20 nM compound treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>), indicating that inducing alternative splicing is essential to the mechanism of SM04690.</p>

<p>We next sought to understand if the change of AMOTL2 localization to the cytoplasm might be responsible for the mechanism of YAP activation by SM04690. AMOTL2 was originally discovered as an interactor of the membrane associated protein Membrane Associated Guanylate Kinase, WW and PDZ Domain Containing 1 (MAGI1), and it has also been shown to interact with tight junction associated proteins such as Protein Associated with LIN7, MAGUK p55 Family Member (PALS1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Through these interactions, AMOTL2 localizes YAP to tight junctions, where YAP is inactivated by phosphorylation. We hypothesized that AMOTL2 spliceoforms created after SM04690 treatment can likely no longer interact with these membrane-associated proteins, acting to sequester YAP away from inhibitory Hippo signaling. Indeed, co-immunofluorescent studies in MDCK cells plated at high density indicated that 1 Î¼M SM04690 treatment for 24 hours decreases co-localization of AMOTL2 with PALS1 and MAGI1 by approximately 2-fold (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, F</xref>, <xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">S7A, B</xref>). While cloning of these large membrane-associated proteins proved difficult, we were able to clone the WW domain regions of MAGI1, which are responsible for its interaction with AMOTL2. From co-immunoprecipitation with the FLAG-tagged AMOTL2 spliceoforms in HEK293T cells, we found that AMOTL2 Î9 and AMOTL2 Î5Î9 lost their ability to interact with the WW domain regions of MAGI1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that alternative splicing of AMOTL2 culminates in gene products less capable of plasma membrane localization, which results in decreased YAP phosphorylation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we set out to identify repurposed drugs that might activate YAP, an effort we hypothesized would yield new druggable mechanisms for inactivating the Hippo pathway. From a high-throughput screen of the ReFRAME library, we have identified several kinase inhibitors that activate YAP. We specifically examined SM04690 as a novel YAP activator and have demonstrated a connection between CLK2 inhibition and YAP activity. Specifically, CLK2 inhibition induces exon skipping of exons 5 and 9 of AMOTL2, a protein integral to Hippo pathway activity. We propose a working model in which the alternative splicing of AMOTL2 impedes its ability to interact with proteins at the plasma membrane, such as PALS1 and MAGI-1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The exon-skipped AMOTL2 gene product is therefore unable to shepherd YAP to tight junctions at the plasma membrane where it receives inhibitory phosphorylation. Consequently, unphosphorylated YAP is capable of translocating to nucleus, where it interacts with TEADs to promote transcription of genes related to proliferation and survival. While we focused our efforts on understanding the roles SM04690 and CLK2, we identified several other kinase inhibitors as efficacious activators of YAP. Several of the reported targets of these identified inhibitors corresponded to related kinase families, including JAK kinases and AGC kinases. Future investigation into these or other protein kinase-based mechanisms will likely reveal several other druggable kinase related mechanisms for regulating Hippo pathway activity.</p>

(B) Inhibition of CLK2 by SM04690 decreases phosphorylation of serine/arginine-rich splicing factors, leading to exon skipping of exons 5 and 9 of AMOTL2. AMOTL2 lacking exons 5 and 9 cannot interact with membrane and membrane-associated tight junction proteins. As such, AMOTL2 cannot localize YAP to tight junctions, and so YAP localizes to the nucleus, interacts with TEADs, and activates its transcripts.</p></caption>

<p>AMOTL2 serves a central role in regulating the Hippo pathway. Specifically, AMOTL2 has been shown to inhibit YAP, restraining it to the plasma membrane while concurrently stimulating the enzymatic activity of LATS1/2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. These functions are possible due to AMOTL2âs activity as a scaffolding protein, bringing LATS1/2 in close proximity to MST1/2 at the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. While most research indicates AMOTL2 plays a role in negatively regulating YAP activity, there remains some debate in the field as to whether AMOTL2, and more broadly the AMOT family of proteins, might also exert YAP stimulating activities in the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. The work presented here adds to the mounting evidence that AMOTL2 acts as a negative regulator of YAP, most prominently displayed through an attenuation of transcription of YAP-controlled genes when wild type AMOTL2 is overexpressed in the context of the YAP-activating compound SM04690 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). A lack of scaffolding functionality by AMOTL2 spliceoforms lacking exons 5 and/or 9 may also help to explain how this alternative splicing is able to activate YAP. It has been shown that the AMOTL2 related protein AMOT regulates Hippo pathway activity through the formation of biomolecular condensates, in contrast to traditional scaffolding proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. AMOT laden condensates have been shown to concentrate core Hippo pathway kinases, acting to potentially sequester YAP in the cytoplasm. Since there is considerable redundancy between AMOT and AMOTL2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, it is conceivable that AMOTL2 may also regulate YAP through biomolecular condensates. The exon-skipped AMOTL2 spliceoforms identified here could have impaired ability to phase separate into condensates or fail to incorporate core Hippo pathway kinases into these condensates. Future studies examining the capacity of AMOTL2 to phase separate and interact with Hippo pathway proteins could reveal exactly how the lack of tight junction localization of the AMOTL2:YAP complex leads to increased YAP activity. More generally, this study highlights the existing need to precisely define the specific roles for each AMOT family member (i.e., AMOT, AMOTL1, and AMOTL2), delineating which functions are redundant and which are unique to each family member.</p>
<p>Others have also shown that alternative splicing influences YAP activity. Indeed, several core Hippo pathway proteins have alternatively spliced isoforms. For example, tissue-specific alternative splicing of YAP itself can lead to eight different isoforms and has been shown to regulate its activity by altering the efficiency with which it interacts with LATS1/2 and TEADs, leading to cell-type specific effects on cellular proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. In addition, LATS1 and LATS2 exist as 7 and 2 spliceoforms in the cell, respectively, affecting their interactions with Hippo pathway scaffolding proteins Neurofibromin 2 (NF2) and MOB1 and modulating their catalytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. While the exon skipping observed in this study is derived from pharmacological perturbation, it is possible that similar processes exist endogenously, particularly in cell types or physiological scenarios with lower CLK2 activity. For example, several breast cancer cell lines have been found to display highly variable levels of CLK2 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. As YAP hyperactivity has been characterized as essential in several human tumor types, including breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, it follows that cancer cells lines with lower CLK2 activity may display increased aggressiveness by activating YAP through the splicing-based mechanism presented here.</p>
<p>One final consideration raised in this study concerns the use of alternative splicing modulators in the treatment of disease. SM04690 was initially reported in the literature as an inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling, displaying an EC<sub>50</sub> of 19.5 nM in reporter-based assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Here, we have shown that SM04690 activates YAP with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 1.2 nM in TEAD-LUC assays, suggesting that several transcriptional programs including YAP might be modulated by this compound at therapeutic doses. Indeed, while SM04690 has been used in a localized fashion to treat osteoarthritis of the knee<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, our work suggests that the use of broad acting modulators of alternative splicing should be met with caution, as inhibition of the CLK family of kinases induces alternative splicing in a large number of transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, which may lead to undesired off-target effects. Nevertheless, this work has identified that CLK2 inhibitors are novel pharmacological tools to study the processes governing the regulation of the Hippo pathway and it further underscores the utility of performing unbiased screens for identifying important cellular biological mechanisms.</p>

<caption><title>Inhibition of CLK2 by SM04690 causes alternative splicing of AMOTL2 exons 5 and 9.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic of primer design to determine the presence of exon skipping in AMOTL2 by RT-qPCR. Exon inclusion primers were designed with the forward primer within the exon and the reverse primer at the start of the next flanking exon. Exon skipping primers were designed with the forward primer spanning the junction between the two exons flanking the skipped exon and the reverse primer within the adjacent exon. (B) Schematic of primer design to determine exon skipping in AMOTL2 by semi-quantitative PCR. The forward primer resides in the exon preceding the skipped exon and the reverse primer resides in the exon following the skipped exon. (C) Agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR amplified products using exon-specific primer sets. The primers amplified differently sized PCR amplicons depending on whether the template included the variable exon. Exon-included samples appear in the gel at the size of the exon plus the size of the primers. Exon-skipped samples appear in the gel at the size of only the primers (â¼40 base pairs).

<p>This paper reports <bold>important</bold> findings on a potent activator of the YAP pathway, demonstrating its mechanism through alternative splicing changes. The authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence to support their claims, although more consistent inhibitor concentrations would have strengthened the study. This research is of interest to biologists studying alternative splicing or the Hippo pathway, with significant implications for medical research.</p>

<p>In order to find small molecules capable of enhancing regenerative repair, this study employed a high throughput YAP-activity screen method to query the ReFRAME library, identifying CLK2 inhibitor as one of the hits. Further studies showed that CLK2 inhibition leads to AMOTL2 exon skipping, rendering it unable to suppress YAP.</p>
<p>The novelty of the study is that it showed that inhibition of a kinase not previously associated with the HIPPO pathway can influence YAP activity through modification of mRNA splicing. The major arguments appear solid.</p>
<p>There are several noteworthy points when assessing the results. In Figure S1C, 100nM drug was toxic to cells at 72 hours and 1nM drug suppressed cell proliferation by 60%. Yet such concentrations were used in Figure 1B and C to argue CLK2 inhibition liberates YAP activity (which one would assume will increase cellular proliferation). In Figure 1C it appears that 1nM drug treatment led to some kind of cellular stress, as cells are visibly enlarged. In Figure 1D, 1nM drug, which would have suppressed cell growth by 60%, did not affect YAP phosphorylation. Taken together, it appears even though CLK2 inhibitor (at high concentrations) liberates YAP activity, its toxicity may override the potential use of this drug as a YAP-activator to salve tissue regenerative repair, which was one of the goals hinted in the background section.</p>
<p>In Figure 2D, at 100nM concentration, the drug did not appear to affect AMOTL2 splicing. Even though at higher concentrations it did, this potentially put into question whether YAP activity liberated by this drug at 1nM (Fig 2A), 10-50nM (Fig 2C) concentrations is caused by altered AMOTL2 splicing. Discussions should be provided on the difference in drug concentrations in these experiments. Does the drug decay very fast, and is that why later studies required higher dose?</p>
<p>Likely impact of the work on the field: this study presented a high throughput screen method for YAP activators and showed that such an approach works. The hit compound found from ReFRAME library, a CLK2 inhibitor, may not be actually useful as a YAP activator, given its clear toxicity. Applying this screen method on other large compound libraries may help find a YAP activator that helps regenerative repair. The finding that CLK2 inhibition could alter AMOTL2 splicing to affect HIPPO pathway could bring a new angle to understanding the regulation of HIPPO pathway.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors have screened the ReFRAME library and identified candidate small molecules that can activate YAP. The found that SM04690, an inhibitor of the WNT signaling pathway, could efficiently activate YAP through CLK2 kinase which has been shown to phosphorylate SR proteins to alter gene alternative splicing. They further demonstrated that SM04690 mediated alternative splicing of AMOTL2 and rendered it unlocalized on the membrane. Alternatively spliced AMOTL2 prevented YAP from anchoring to the cell membrane which results in decreased YAP phosphorylation and activated YAP. Previous findings showed that WNT signaling more or less activate YAP. The authors revealed that an inhibitor of WNT siganaling could activate YAP. Thus, these findings are potentially interesting and important. However, the present manuscript provided a lot of indirect data and lacked key experiments.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>
1. In Figure S3, since inhibition of CLK2 resulted in extensive changes in alternative splicing, why did the authors choose AMOTL2? How to exclude other factors such as EEF1A1 and HSPA5, do they affect YAP activation? Angiomotin-related AMOTL1 and AMOTL2 were identified as negative regulators of YAP and TAZ by preventing their nuclear translocation. It has been reported that high cell density promoted assembly of the Crumbs complex, which recruited AMOTL2 to tight junctions. Ubiquitination of AMOTL2 K347 and K408 served as a docking site for LATS2, which phosphorylated YAP to promote its cytoplasmic retention and degradation. How to determine that alternative splicing rather than ubiquitination of AMOTL2 affects YAP activity? Does AMOTL2 Î5 affect the ubiquitination of AMOTL2? Does overexpression of AMOTL2 Î5Î9 cause YAP and puncta to co-localize?</p>
<p>
2. The author proposed that AMOTL2 splicing isoform formed biomolecular condensates,.However, there was no relevant experimental data to support this conclusion. AMOTL2 is located not only on the cell membrane but also on the circulating endosome of the cell, and the puncta formed after AMOTL2 dissociation from the membrane is likely to be the localization of the circulating endosome. The author should co-stain AMOTL2 with markers of circulating endosomes, or conduct experiments to prove the liquidity of puncta to verify the phase separation of AMOTL2 splicing isoform.</p>
<p>
3. The localization of YAP in cells is regulated by cell density, and YAP usually translocates to the nucleus at low cell density. In Figure 2E, the cell densities of DMSO and SM04690-treated groups are inconsistent. In Figure 4A, the magnification of t DMSO and SM04690-treated groups is inconsistent, and the SM04690-treated group seems to have a higher magnification.</p>
<p>
4. There have been many reports that the WNT signaling pathway and the Hippo signaling pathway can crosstalk with each other. The authors should exclude the influence of the WNT signaling pathway by using SM04690.</p>

<p>This study on drug repurposing presents the identification of potent activators of the Hippo pathway. The authors successfully screen a drug library and identify two CLK kinase inhibitors as YAP activators, with SM04690 targeting specifically CLK2. They further investigate the molecular basis of SM04690-induced YAP activity and identify splicing events in AMOTL2 as strongly affected by CLK2 inhibition. Exon skipping within AMOTL2 decreases the interactions with membrane bound proteins and is sufficient to induce YAP target gene expression. Overall the study is well designed, the conclusions are supported by sufficient data and represent an exciting connection between alternative splicing and the HIPPO pathway. The specificity of the inhibitor towards CLK2 and the mode of action via AMOTL2 could be supported by further data:</p>
<p>1. The inconsistent inhibitor concentrations and varying results reported in the paper can be distracting. For instance, the response of endogenous targets to 100 nM concentration is described as a &gt;5-fold increase in Figure 2B, whereas it is reported as a 1-1.5-fold response to 1000 nM in Figure 2D. This inconsistency should be addressed and clarified to provide a more accurate and reliable representation of the findings.</p>
<p>
2. In the absence of a strong inhibitor induced YAP target gene expression (Figure 2D), it is difficult to conclude the dependency on YAP expression, as investigated by siRNA mediated knockdown. In a similar experiment, the dependency of the inhibitor on CLK2 expression could be confirmed</p>
<p>
3. To further support the conclusion that CLK2 is the direct target of SM04690, it would be informative to investigate the effects of CLK1/4 inhibition on AMOTL2 exons (for example within RNA-seq data). If CLK1/4 inhibitors do not induce changes in AMOTL2 exons, it would strengthen the evidence for CLK2's role as the direct target. Including the results in the discussion would enhance the comprehensiveness of the study.</p>
<p>
4. It would be important to determine the specific dose of SM04690 required to induce changes in AMOTL2 splicing. The authors observe that AMOTL2 protein levels appear unaffected at doses below 50 nM in Figure 3D, while YAP target genes are already affected at 20 nM in Figure 3G. Although Western blotting may not be the most sensitive method to detect minor changes in splicing, performing PCR experiments at lower doses could provide more insight into the splicing changes. Therefore, it is suggested that the authors include PCR experiments at lower doses to determine if changes in splicing are visible and to better establish the relationship between splicing and gene expression changes.</p>
