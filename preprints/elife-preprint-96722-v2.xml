<abstract>
<p>We investigated the role of the nucleolar protein Treacle in organizing and regulating the nucleolus in human cells. Our results support Treacle’s ability to form liquid-like phase condensates through electrostatic interactions among molecules. The formation of these biomolecular condensates is crucial for segregating nucleolar fibrillar centers from the dense fibrillar component and ensuring high levels of rRNA gene transcription and accurate rRNA processing. Both the central and C-terminal domains of Treacle are required to form liquid-like condensates. The initiation of phase separation is attributed to the C-terminal domain. The central domain is characterized by repeated stretches of alternatively charged amino-acid residues and is vital for condensate stability. Overexpression of mutant forms of Treacle that cannot form liquid-like phase condensates compromises the assembly of fibrillar centers, suppressing rRNA gene transcription and disrupting rRNA processing. These mutant forms also fail to recruit DNA topoisomerase II binding protein 1 (TOPBP1), suppressing the DNA damage response in the nucleolus.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>Below, we provide a concise summary of the key modifications and updates: FRAP experiments: We conducted additional FRAP experiments, including half-FRAP and full-FRAP analyses, which expanded the interpretation of our results on the dynamic behavior of Treacle in condensates. Treacle condensation experiments: We conducted the condensation experiments using a self-produced and purified recombinant fragment of Treacle. New chapter on Treacle partner interactions: We added a new section titled &quot;Treacle condensation is essential for its proper interaction with nucleolar subcompartments&quot;, which examines the interactions of Treacle and its mutant forms with partner proteins. This section expands our interpretation of the role of Treacle's interactions in its condensation and the formation of fibrillar centers (FCs). Additional cell lines: We included additional experiments with normal human skin fibroblasts (to validate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of Treacle) and in MCF7 cells (to validate the etoposide-mediated rDNA damage response). These additions enhance the generalizability of our findings. Terminology adjustments: We revised the terminology throughout the manuscript, replacing the terms &quot;liquid-phase&quot; and &quot;liquid&quot; with &quot;liquid-like&quot; where appropriate. Additionally, we replaced &quot;LLPS&quot; with terms such as &quot;condensation&quot; or &quot;coacervation&quot; to reflect the nuanced nature of our findings. Expanded supporting materials: We enhanced the supporting materials by adding additional videos and wide-field images of cell fields for most observed patterns. Key changes to figures: Figure 1: Panel C has been replaced, as supplementing the experiment with necessary controls required redoing the entire experiment. Figure 2 now includes condensation experiments with the recombinant fragment of Treacle. Partial FRAP experiments have been replaced with half-FRAP analysis. Figure 3: The original Figure 3 has been divided into two separate figures (Figures 3 and 4 in the revised MS). FRAP analysis diagrams have been replaced and recalculated with new normalization. Figure 4: Supplemented with the analysis of Treacle mutant lacking the SE-rich LCR central domain. Figure 5: Newly added figure to display results on partner interactions of Treacle and its mutants.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Applying polymer chemistry principles to biological molecules has significantly broadened our understanding of the functions of membraneless compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Mehta &amp; Zhang, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mittag &amp; Pappu, 2022</xref>). Multiple weak, cooperative, and dynamic interactions underlie the assembly of these self-organized structures, termed biomolecular condensates. Mechanistically, liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS)—a demixing process that yields a condensed protein-enriched phase and a dilute phase—can mediate the self-assembly of biomolecular condensates. In biological systems, phase separation is facilitated by a combination of multivalent interactions mediated by intrinsically disordered regions and site-specific interactions that drive percolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shin &amp; Brangwynne, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Uversky, 2019</xref>). Biomolecular condensates serve as functional hubs in diverse cellular processes such as transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sabari et al., 2020</xref>), microtubule nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Woodruff et al., 2017</xref>), and the adaptive stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Franzmann &amp; Alberti, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The nucleolus is a large and complex subnuclear compartment that can also be considered a multicomponent and multilayered biomolecular condensate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lafontaine et al., 2021</xref>). It is formed around arrays of ribosomal gene repeats (rDNA), which are transcribed by RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I) to produce ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cerqueira &amp; Lemos, 2019</xref>). In the nucleolus, RNAs and hundreds of different proteins are segregated into three immiscible phases: the fibrillar center (FC), which is the RNA Pol I transcription factory; the dense fibrillar component (DFC), which is the intermediate layer rich in fibrillarin (FBL); and the granular component (GC), which is the outer layer rich in nucleophosmin (NPM1/B23). The mechanisms underlying DFC and GC formation through phase separation are relatively well understood. Studies have demonstrated that a ternary mixture comprising the GC protein NPM1, a monomeric version of the DFC protein FBL, and generic rRNA is sufficient to form an FBL-enriched inner phase that coexists with an NPM-enriched outer phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Feric et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mitrea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mitrea et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, the mechanisms of FC formation and the role of LLPS in this process have received considerably less attention.</p>
<p>Previous studies on FC organization in living cells suggest that FC assembly may also occur via phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Falahati et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Falahati &amp; Wieschaus, 2017</xref>). Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. Firstly, FC components migrate to the nucleolar periphery and aggregate into large structures known as nucleolar caps when RNA Pol I transcription is inhibited by actinomycin D (AMD) or genotoxic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Harding et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Korsholm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Reynolds et al., 1964</xref>). This structural transformation is reminiscent of liquid droplet fusion. Secondly, high-speed molecular dynamics indicative of fluid-like behavior have been observed in nucleolar caps using single-molecule tracking of RNA Pol I and chromatin-bound upstream binding transcription factor (UBFT/UBF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ide et al., 2020</xref>). Thirdly, both UBF and its partner treacle ribosome biogenesis factor 1 (TCOF1/Treacle) demonstrated the ability to undergo condensation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jaberi-Lashkari et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">King et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that FC assembly and organization rely on LLPS, similar to other nucleolar subcompartments. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular determinants and biophysical properties underlying this process.</p>
<p>In this context, the nucleolar phosphoprotein Treacle is of particular interest. As previously mentioned, it directly interacts with UBF and RNA Pol I, colocalizing with them within the FC. In addition, Treacle exhibits both transcription-dependent and transcription-independent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gal et al., 2022</xref>). Its role in ribosome biogenesis is well-documented since it assists in the transcription and processing of rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gonzales et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lin &amp; Yeh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Valdez et al., 2004</xref>). It is also a master regulator of the DNA damage response (DDR) in the nucleolus, mediating the recruitment of repair factors to rDNA damaged by I-PpoI-induced breaks, replication stress, or R-loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ciccia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Korsholm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Larsen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mooser et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Velichko et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">2021</xref>). Therefore, it acts as a nucleolar hub with both transcriptional and DNA repair functions.</p>
<p>The multifunctionality of Treacle may be related to its ability to engage in multivalent interactions and undergo phase separation because of the presence of extended intrinsically disordered regions. In addition, Treacle’s partners in transcription (RNA Pol I, UBF) and DNA repair (DNA topoisomerase II binding protein 1 [TOPBP1]) also utilize phase separation as a functioning mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Frattini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ide et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">King et al., 2024</xref>). Transcription of rDNA can be regulated by phase separation of RNA Pol I, while TOPBP1 condensation can activate the ATR serine/threonine kinase (ATR) signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Frattini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ide et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering these observations, we conducted an in-depth study of Treacle’s condensation characteristics and their impact on the structural organization and functional dynamics of nucleoli. We found that Treacle can form biomolecular condensates and characterized its structural features regulating this process. Through its ability to condense, Treacle promotes the formation of nucleolar FCs by recruiting and concentrating transcription factors at rDNA and separating FC components from the DFC. Collectively, this segregates rRNA synthesis and subsequent processing in distinct compartments of the nucleolus. Impairing Treacle’s condensation ability results in the mixing of FC and DFC components, reducing the efficiency of both processes, equivalent to completed depleting endogenous Treacle. We also demonstrate that Treacle’s phase separation is critical for its interaction with TOPBP1 and activation of the DDR in rDNA during genotoxic stress. Our findings reveal the role of Treacle not only as a structural scaffold for FCs but also as a nucleolar hub integrating the functions of rDNA transcription, rRNA processing, and preserving rDNA integrity.</p>

<title>Treacle is a scaffold protein for nucleolar FCs and DFCs</title>
<p>First, we defined the role of Treacle in the structural organization of the nucleolus. We employed the CRISPR/Cas9 system to knock out the <italic>TCOF1</italic> gene encoding Treacle in HeLa cells to obtain a population of cells lacking Treacle signals (Treacle-negative cells; Fig. S1A). Immunocytochemical staining for UBF and RNA Pol I subunit A (POLR1A/RPA194; FC markers), FBL (DFC marker), and B23 and nucleolin (NCL; GC markers) revealed that Treacle-positive cells exhibited a classical tripartite nucleolar structure, with Treacle colocalizing with UBF1 and RPA194 in FCs, FBL in DFCs, and B23 and NCL surrounding DFCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Treacle depletion resulted in the disappearance of distinct FC and DFC structures, causing RPA194, UBF, and FBL to diffuse throughout the nucleolus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1B</xref>, S1A). This suggests a mixing of FC and DFC components (Fig. S1B). The organization of the GC component, however, was minimally affected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1B</xref>, S1C). Notably, Treacle depletion also partially redistributed RPA194, UBF, FBL, and NCL from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, likely reflecting disrupted ribosomal gene transcription (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1B</xref>, S1A). Similar effects were observed in normal human skin fibroblasts following Treacle depletion (Fig. S1D–E). These results indicated that Treacle plays a critical role in forming the integrated structure of FCs and DFCs.</p>

After 7-10 days after transfection, the cells were fixed and co-immunostained with Treacle and either RPA194, UBF, Fibrillarin, B23 or Nucleolin antibodies. DNA was stained with DAPI (gray). Cells were analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Representative images of Treacle-negative cells and nucleoli (magnified images) are shown. <bold>(C)</bold> HeLa cells were transfected with a construct coding CRISPR/Cas9 and sgRNA to the TCOF1 gene (<italic>experiment</italic>). After 7-10 days after transfection cell were fixed, immunostained with Treacle antibodies and subjected to cell sorting in the fluorescent analysis mode to obtain Treacle-negative populations. Intact HeLa cells (<italic>control</italic>) were fixed, immunostained with IgG antibodies, passed through all FACS-related procedure in the light scattering analysis mode and used as a control (Treacle-positive). The sorted cell fractions were used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis with either Treacle, RPA194 or UBF antibodies. ChIP was followed by qPCR using the d0, d1, d3, d5, d7 primers to the rRNA gene (positioned as indicated on the scheme). Data are represented relative to the input. Values are means ±SD from at least three independent replicates (**, p &lt; 0.01; *, p &lt; 0.1; by unpaired t test). <bold>(D)</bold> HeLa cells were transfected with a construct coding CRISPR/Cas9 and sgRNA to the TCOF1 gene. After 7-10 days after transfection the cells were pulsed with EU (100 μM for 2 hr), fixed and immunostained with Treacle antibodies. EU (green) was revealed by click chemistry. The DNA was stained with DAPI (gray). Representative images of Treacle-positive and Treacle-negative HeLa cells are shown. Quantification of EU fluorescence intensities in Treacle-positive and Treacle-negative HeLa cells are show in the right panel (**, p &lt; 0.01 by unpaired t test; n&gt;500). <bold>(E)</bold> HeLa cells were transfected with a construct coding CRISPR/Cas9 and sgRNA to the TCOF1 gene (<italic>experiment</italic>).

The sorted cell fractions were used for RNA extraction. RT-qPCR was performed; it shows levels of 47S pre-rRNA normalized to GAPDH mRNA. Normalized pre-rRNA level in Treacle-positive cells is set to 1. Values are mean ± SD. The calculation is presented for 5 biological replicates (**, p &lt; 0.01 by unpaired t test). <bold>(F)</bold> Hela cells were processed as described in (E). It shows levels of A’-site contained unprocessed rRNA normalized to GAPDH mRNA. Normalized unprocessed rRNA level in Treacle-positive cells is set to 1. Values are mean ± SD.

<p>Next, we investigated the impact of nucleolar FC disintegration on the efficiency of rDNA transcription and the recruitment of the RNA Pol I transcription machinery to rDNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (ChIP) of cells transfected with an anti-Treacle single guide RNA (sgRNA) revealed a decreased occupancy of UBF and RPA194 within the rDNA coding region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). In contrast, transfection with a mock sgRNA did not cause such an effect (Fig. S2A). These observations suggest that Treacle amplifies the recruitment rather than initiates the primary binding of the transcription machinery to rDNA. Depleting Treacle substantially suppressed rDNA transcription, although not completely, unlike the repression induced by AMD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1D–E</xref>, S2B). Furthermore, cells depleted of Treacle exhibited impaired 5′ external transcribed spacer processing, particularly in the cleavage of the A′ site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), which is one of the initial steps in 18S rRNA maturation.</p>
<p>In summary, Treacle functions as a scaffold protein in nucleolar FCs, and its depletion compromises both rRNA gene transcription and processing.</p>

<p>Currently, it has become evident that various scaffold proteins can self-organize by forming liquid-phase condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shin &amp; Brangwynne, 2017</xref>). According to protein structure predictors (e.g., AlphaFold, IUPred2, PONDR, and FuzDrop), Treacle is a fully intrinsically disordered protein (Fig. S3A). Nevertheless, Treacle can be broadly categorized into three distinct functional domains: the N-terminal domain (ND), the central domain, and the C-terminal domain (CD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gal et al., 2022</xref>). The ND of Treacle harbors a LisH motif and a nuclear localization signal (NLS). The central domain contains 15 low-complexity regions (LCRs) enriched in serine and glutamic acid residues (S/E-rich LCRs), which are interspersed with unstructured linker sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jaberi-Lashkari et al., 2023</xref>). The 11 linkers within the central domain and their adjacent S/E-rich LCRs exhibit high homology. Consequently, the central domain will be referred to as the repeating domain (RD) henceforth. The CD harbors additional NLSs, a UBF binding site, and a lysine-rich LCR (K-rich LCR) at the terminus, which also functions as a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>To evaluate the ability of Treacle to self-assemble into biomolecular condensates, we first investigated its condensation properties using an <italic>in vitro</italic> system. For this purpose, a fragment of the Treacle protein (amino acids 291–426), encompassing two S/E-rich LCRs and two linker regions, was purified from Escherichia coli. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments demonstrated that this recombinant fragment formed liquid-like condensates in the presence of 5% polyethylene glycol (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). These condensates exhibited a spherical morphology and frequently underwent fusion events (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate Treacle’s ability to self-organize into biomolecular condensates within cells, we generated fusion proteins by linking Treacle to FusionRed (a non-self-dimerizing fluorescent protein) and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> cryptochrome 2 (Cry2), which is known to oligomerize upon exposure to blue light, facilitating the formation of “optoDroplets” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shin &amp; Brangwynne, 2017</xref>). Expression of this opto–Treacle chimeric protein in HeLa cells revealed foci formation in nucleoli in the absence of blue light, consistent with Treacle’s natural tendency to occupy FCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>; see Fig. S3B for the controls). Under blue light, opto–Treacle formed multiple small foci throughout the nucleoplasm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we explored Treacle’s ability to form biomolecular condensates when overexpressed as a fusion with the far-red fluorescent protein Katushka2S (referred to as 2S; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Shcherbo et al., 2007</xref>) or green fluorescent protein (GFP). At low expression levels (16–24 hours post-transfection), Treacle’s fusion protein formed foci only in nucleoli, reflecting its natural occupation of FCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2E</xref> top panel, S3C). However, at increased expression levels (48–72 hours post-transfection), it began to form large spherical structures in the nucleoplasm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2E</xref> bottom panel, S3D). The formation of these structures could not be attributed to the oligomerization of 2S or GFP, as comparable large nuclear condensates were observed at high levels of Treacle expression, even in the absence of a fused fluorescent protein (Fig. S3E). Both intranucleolar and extranucleolar Treacle–2S foci, induced by low and high levels of fusion protein expression respectively, exhibited a spherical shape with an aspect ratio close to one, suggesting susceptibility to surface tension (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the internal homogeneity of Treacle condensates, showing circular structures with homogeneous protein content without any electron-dense or -light regions inside the condensates (Fig. S3F).</p>
<p>Like the <italic>in vitro</italic>-formed Treacle condensates, intracellular Treacle condensates demonstrated the ability to fuse. Our observations revealed that nucleolar caps form during AMD-induced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2F</xref>, S3G; Movie S1) or DNA damage-induced (Fig. S3H; Movie S2) rDNA transcriptional repression due to the fusion of intranucleolar Treacle–2S foci. Prolonged live-cell imaging further demonstrated that extranucleolar biomolecular condensates from highly overexpressed Treacle–2S frequently fuse, indicating dynamic clustering (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>; Movie S3).</p>
<p>Liquid condensates exhibit a high molecular exchange rate, often assessed through fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ganser &amp; Myong, 2020</xref>). To analyze the molecular dynamics of Treacle within its condensates, we employed a combination of full- and half-FRAP methods. Half-FRAP is a specific variation of partial FRAP, where half of the structure of interest is photobleached, unlike full-FRAP, which involves photobleaching the entire structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Muzzopappa et al., 2022</xref>). Half-FRAP analysis revealed an increase in signal intensity in the bleached half of Treacle-2S-formed FCs, accompanied by a proportional decrease in fluorescence in the non-bleached half (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H, I</xref>; Movie S4). Full-FRAP analysis of Treacle dynamics within FCs revealed a slow recovery rate (Fig. S4A), suggesting preferential internal mixing. This indicates that molecular exchange occurs between the two halves of the condensate without significant exchange across the boundary separating the condensate from the surrounding phase. Notably, fluorescence in the non-bleached region decreased to approximately half its initial value, suggesting near-complete internal mixing within the coacervate. Comparable full- and half-FRAP dynamics were observed for AMD-induced nucleolar caps (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2J, K</xref>, S4B; Movie S5) and extranucleolar condensates formed under elevated Treacle–2S expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2L, M</xref>, S4C; Movie S6). Furthermore, the largest extranucleolar condensates exhibited reduced Treacle molecular dynamics, suggesting more gel-like properties (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2L, M</xref>, S4D; Movie S7). Presumably, Treacle condensates undergo a liquid-to-gel phase transition over time or upon reaching a critical protein concentration within the condensate. Therefore, using diverse model systems, we illustrated that Treacle can generate biomolecular condensates with key features of structures formed through liquid-like phase separation.</p>

<title>Treacle’s phase separation is regulated by its central and C-terminal domains</title>
<p>Since we have shown that an RD containing two S/E-rich LCRs can form liquid-like condensates <italic>in vitro</italic>, we next sought to investigate to what extent this condensation ability of RD is exerted intracellularly and to determine the roles of the CD and ND in intracellular Treacle condensation. For this purpose, we generated Treacle mutants missing the ND (Δ1–83), RD (Δ83–1121), or CD (Δ1121–1488) and overexpressed them in HeLa cells. We then assessed the condensation ability of the overexpressed deletion mutants in wild-type cells using several intracellular condensate models: the formation of (i) FCs and (ii) nucleolar caps under low expression levels (24 hours post-transfection) and (iii) large extranucleolar condensates under high expression levels (48 hours post-transfection).</p>
<p>The Δ1–83 mutant demonstrated condensation properties indistinguishable from full-length Treacle: it concentrated in FCs, formed stable nucleolar caps during transcriptional repression, and, upon increased expression levels, generated numerous large extranucleolar condensates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A</xref>, S5A, D, E). Using partial FRAP analysis, we further demonstrated that, similar to full-length Treacle (Fig. S5B, C), the Δ1–83 mutant exhibited a high rate of molecular exchange in all types of model condensates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, C</xref>).</p>

<p>As expected, the Δ83–1121 mutant exhibited significantly compromised condensation properties. Under low expression levels, it failed to concentrate in FCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3D</xref>, S5F) and diffusely localized in the nucleolus while still maintaining a high molecular dynamics rate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E, F</xref>). During rDNA transcriptional repression, the Δ83–1121 mutant did not form classical nucleolar caps but partially redistributed between the nucleolar periphery and nucleoplasm, where it began to form condensates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3D</xref>, S5F). Surprisingly, such relocation was associated with a change in its molecular dynamics state. Partial FRAP analysis revealed that nucleoplasmic condensates of the Δ83–1121 mutant, formed due to nucleolar transcriptional repression, began to transition into a solid-like state (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E, F</xref>). A similar liquid-solid transition was observed for the Δ83–1121 mutant under high expression levels. In this case, it no longer formed distinct extranucleolar condensates but merged into a unified pan-nuclear solid network (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3D–F</xref>, S5F). This behavior suggests that the RD deletion alters Treacle’s interaction patterns, making its phase separation properties more reliant on rRNA and other nucleolar proteins.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the Δ1121–1488 mutant also failed to condense. When equipped with an artificial NLS from the SV40 virus, it successfully translocated into the nucleus; however, it remained diffusely distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, even under high expression conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3G</xref>, S5G). Therefore, without the CD, Treacle cannot undergo autonomous condensation, likely relying on the CD as a nucleation factor. Collectively, these results suggest that the intracellular Treacle condensation depends on a cooperative interaction between RD and CD.</p>
<p>To gain further insights into these phenomena, we investigated the nature of interactions driving Treacle protein condensation. We assessed the behavior of Treacle intracellular condensates after treatment with 1,6-hexanediol, which disrupts hydrophobic interactions, or high salt concentrations, which interfere with electrostatic interactions. Treatment with the cell-permeable salt ammonium acetate disrupted both FCs and extranucleolar condensates formed at low and high Treacle expression levels, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In contrast, treatment with 1,6-hexanediol did not affect the integrity of Treacle condensates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). These observations were further validated using a condensation model based on the recombinant fragment of Treacle’s RD <italic>in vitro</italic>. The efficiency of Treacle’s fragment condensation <italic>in vitro</italic> remained unchanged in the presence of 1,6-hexanediol, whereas increasing salt concentration prevented condensation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Additionally, condensation of the Treacle RD fragment <italic>in vitro</italic> was sensitive to changes in pH. The optimal efficiency of condensation was observed at pH 7.0, whereas acidification of the medium decreased condensation, and alkalization resulted in the generation of insoluble aggregates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Therefore, it is clear that Treacle condensation, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, is primarily governed by electrostatic interactions rather than hydrophobic forces.</p>

</fig>
<p>It is reasonable to hypothesize that electrostatic interactions within Treacle condensates are facilitated by the presence of negatively charged S/E-rich LCRs in the RD and positively charged K-rich LCR in the CD. To evaluate this hypothesis, we generated a Treacle mutant lacking the 13 S/E-rich LCRs in the RD (ΔSE) and a Treacle mutant missing the 1350–1488 region (ΔNoLS), which includes the K-rich LCR. The deletion of the S/E-rich LCRs significantly compromised Treacle’s condensation properties. Like the Δ83–1121 mutant, Treacle ΔSE could not form FCs or nucleolar caps (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4C</xref>, S6A), remained in a liquid state within the nucleolus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D, E</xref>), and underwent a liquid-solid phase transition during nucleolar transcriptional repression or high overexpression levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D, E</xref>). These findings indicate that the RD determines Treacle’s condensation properties through the S/E-rich LCRs. In turn, ΔNoLS mutant did not localize to the nucleolus but could form individual perinucleolar condensates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4F</xref>, S6B). Interestingly, the volume of these condensates increased significantly with the expression level of ΔNoLS, but their number did not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4F</xref>, S6B). This observation suggests that, in contrast to full-length Treacle, which forms a substantial number of extranucleolar condensates at high expression levels, ΔNoLS condensates exhibit a limited number of nucleation sites. This implies that the positively charged lysines in the K-rich LCR of the CD act as nucleation points for autonomous Treacle condensate formation. It is also noteworthy that all types of ΔNoLS condensates displayed high molecular dynamics (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G, H</xref>). In contrast to full-length Treacle condensates, molecular exchange within ΔNoLS condensates occurred across the boundary separating the coacervate from the surrounding phase, rather than through internal mixing (Fig. S6C, D). This finding reinforces the role of the K-rich LCR as both a nucleation element in Treacle condensate formation and a regulator of Treacle’s volumetric dynamics within these condensates.</p>
<p>The disruption of Treacle’s condensation properties following the deletion of the S/E-rich LCRs underscores the significance of the negative charge within the central domain for phase separation. However, as noted earlier, the S/E-rich LCRs in the RD are not clustered but rather dispersed throughout the RD, interspersed with linker regions. We propose that for Treacle to exhibit proper condensation behavior, it is not merely the presence of a negative charge in the RD that is critical, both the presence of a negative charge in the RD and its specific spatial distribution within the molecule are critical.. Indeed, an analysis of the charge distribution along the Treacle amino acid sequence demonstrated that each S/E-rich LCR, in conjunction with its adjacent linker, within the RD constitutes a strong diblock ampholyte, where a positively charged block (linker) is followed by a negatively charged block (S/E-rich LCR; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref> left panel). In order to determine the physiological importance of this charge distribution, a variant of Treacle (Treacle CS) was created with the same overall net charge but scrambled blocks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref> right panel). In Treacle CS, regions of opposite charge were removed while maintaining the same overall isoelectric point, amino acid composition, and positions of all other residues. As expected, scrambling the charges in the RD fully reproduced the condensation-defective phenotype observed in the Δ83–1121 and ΔSE mutants. Treacle CS failed to form FCs or nucleolar caps, instead assembling into a single pan-nuclear network at high overexpression levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>, S6E). These findings suggest that Treacle’s condensation properties depend not only on the net negative charge within the RD but are critically influenced by the specific distribution of charges within this region.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings demonstrate that the cooperative interaction between the RD and CD governs the phase separation properties of Treacle, whereas the ND plays a negligible role in this process. The positively charged K-rich LCR within the CD facilitates its role as a nucleation site for Treacle condensate formation, while the alternating charge blocks in the RD stabilize Treacle condensates, ensuring that Treacle behavior remains independent of subnuclear localization or nucleolar transcriptional activity.</p>

<title>Treacle condensation is essential for its proper interaction with nucleolar subcompartments</title>
<p>We next aimed to investigate the role of Treacle’s condensation properties in its functional interactions with the components of the FC, DFC, and GC within the nucleolus. First, we significantly downregulated endogenous Treacle expression (Treacle kd) using RNA interference (Fig. S7A) and then analyzed the structure organization of the FC, DFC, and GC within the nucleolus in the context of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-resistant full-length or condensation-defective (Δ83–1121 or CS) Treacle mutants.</p>
<p>The expressed full-length Treacle exhibited normal nucleolar localization, similar to endogenous Treacle. It co-localized within the FC with RPA194 and UBF, while FBL was localized in the DFC at the periphery of the FC, and NCL and B23 surrounded the DFC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). In contrast, expression of the Δ83–1121 or CS Treacle mutants led to the dispersal and mixing of FC and DFC components within the nucleolus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5B</xref>, S7B). Despite this, the Δ83–1121 or CS mutants still co-localized with UBF1, but to a significantly lesser extent with RPA194, suggesting a potential loss of their binding interaction. Interestingly, these mutants showed partial overlap with NCL, but not with B23 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5B</xref>, S7B). These observations suggest that disrupting Treacle’s condensation properties may alter its interaction preferences..</p>

<p>This hypothesis is further supported by the analysis of the localization of nucleolar components and condensation-defective Treacle forms following AMD-induced nucleolar transcriptional repression. After AMD treatment, full-length Treacle co-localized with UBF1 and RPA194 at the nucleolar caps (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). FBL partially merged with the caps, while NCL and B23 were completely displaced to the nucleolar rim and nucleoplasm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). In contrast, the AMD-induced perinucleolar or nucleoplasmic solid condensates formed by the Δ83–1121 or CS Treacle mutants still co-localized with UBF1, but to a significantly lesser extent with RPA194 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5D</xref>, S7C). Interestingly, these condensates exhibited behavior opposite to that of full-length Treacle condensates with respect to FBL and NCL: they displaced FBL and incorporated NCL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5D</xref>, S7C). The patterns of association between FC/DFC/GC proteins and the extranucleolar condensates of Δ83–1121 and CS Treacle mutants at high expression levels exhibited similar alterations when compared to those observed with full-length Treacle (Fig. S7D, E).</p>
<p>Thus, the disruption of Treacle’s condensation properties, either through RD deletion or charge scrambling, results in a shift in its interaction repertoire. Specifically, while interaction with UBF1 is preserved, interactions with RNA Pol I and FBL are notably diminished, whereas a new interaction with NCL is established. It is likely that the correct condensation of Treacle contributes to the formation of the cooperative FC/DFC structure by mediating functional interactions with partner proteins.</p>

<title>The condensation of Treacle regulates rRNA transcription and processing</title>
<p>In the above sections, we demonstrated that Treacle supports both rRNA transcription and processing. We hypothesized that this multifunctionality of Treacle could be related to its ability to condense and the formation of the cooperative FC/DFC structure. To test this hypothesis, we significantly downregulated endogenous Treacle expression (Treacle kd) using RNA interference and then analyzed rRNA transcription levels in the context of siRNA-resistant full-length or condensation-defective (Δ83– 1121 or CS) Treacle mutants. We found that the expression of condensation-defective Treacle mutants significantly reduced the transcription of rRNA compared to full-length Treacle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). This effect correlated with a reduced ability of condensation-defective Treacle mutants to maintain the association of partner proteins RPA194 and UBF1 at the rDNA promoter (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), along with diminished intrinsic binding of these mutants to rDNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>These observations suggest that the condensation properties of Treacle underlie its ability to concentrate components of the transcriptional machinery in the FC and separate them from the DFC. Moreover, such separation is likely required to maintain highly efficient transcription of rDNA. We hypothesized that the same principle could regulate the role of Treacle in rRNA processing. To test this assumption, we depleted the level of endogenous Treacle using RNA interference and then analyzed the spatial localization of newly synthesized 47S pre-rRNA and its processing level in cells expressing siRNA-resistant full-length or condensation-defective (Δ83–1121 or CS) Treacle mutants. Microscopy analyses with fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH)-labeled rRNA revealed that newly synthesized 47S pre-rRNA transcripts clustered at the periphery of FCs in full-length Treacle-expressing cells, reflecting the radial flow of rRNA from the FC to the GC (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Newly synthesized rRNA was also relocated to the periphery of large Treacle condensates formed at high expression levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). However, no apparent clustering of newly synthesized rRNA was observed in cells expressing condensation-defective Treacle mutants. Instead, the newly synthesized transcripts were diffusely mixed with Δ83–1121 and CS Treacle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Nascent rRNA transcripts were similarly mixed with delocalized UBF in cells depleted of endogenous Treacle (Treacle kn; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). Finally, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis confirmed that cells overexpressing condensation-defective Treacle mutants had impaired 5′ external transcribed spacer processing compared to cells overexpressing full-length Treacle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). Therefore, it can be concluded that the mixing of FC and DFC components due to the expression of condensation-defective Treacle or the depletion of endogenous Treacle disrupts the directional traffic of nascent rRNA from the FC to the DFC and further to the GC, potentially causing inefficient processing.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that Treacle’s condensation properties separate the FC and DFC, leading to the spatial segregation of rRNA synthesis and subsequent processing. The mixing of FC and DFC components due to the disruption of Treacle’s condensation ability reduces the efficiency of both processes, with equivalent effects to the complete depletion of endogenous Treacle.</p>

<title>The condensation of Treacle is essential for DDR activation in ribosomal genes under genotoxic stress</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that Treacle is critical for inducing the DDR in ribosomal genes under certain types of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Korsholm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Larsen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mooser et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Velichko et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">2021</xref>). Here, we aimed to investigate the contribution of Treacle’s condensation to rDNA damage response. We induced rDNA damage using the widely used chemotherapeutic drug etoposide (VP16), which acts as a topoisomerase II inhibitor, inducing double-strand breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bax et al., 2019</xref>). Treating cells with 90 µM VP16 for 30 minutes resulted in the rapid recruitment of TOPBP1 to nucleoli and its colocalization with Treacle in HeLa (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7A</xref>, S8A) and MCF7 cells (Fig. S8B). Furthermore, proximity ligation assay (PLA) analysis conducted after DNA damage induction provided evidence of a physical association between TOPBP1 and Treacle (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7B</xref>, S8C). Reducing endogenous Treacle levels, either through RNA interference (Treacle kd) or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated depletion (Treacle kn), effectively blocked the relocalization of TOPBP1 to nucleoli (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7D</xref>, S9A–B) and its occupancy of rDNA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Interestingly, with Treacle kd, a substantial amount of Treacle still remained in nucleoli (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). However, this amount was insufficient to facilitate its interaction with TOPBP1, likely due to the need for specific stoichiometric ratios for efficient interaction.</p>

<p>Next, we investigated whether the interaction between Treacle and TOPBP1 in Treacle kd cells could be restored by overexpressing different Treacle variants. Immunocytochemical analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies against TOPBP1 indicated that expressing (siRNA)-resistant full-length Treacle in Treacle kd cells effectively restored the VP16-induced interaction between Treacle and TOPBP1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7E</xref>, S10A), as well as the enrichment of TOPBP1 at the promoters of rDNA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). However, expressing (siRNA)-resistant condensation-defective forms of Treacle (Δ83–1121 or CS) did not lead to such restoration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7E–F</xref>, S10A).</p>
<p>The response to DNA damage involves the activation of various signaling kinases and the recruitment of different repair factors to the DNA break site. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by qPCR with antibodies against a panel of DNA repair proteins confirmed that VP16 induced DDR at the promoters of rDNA, including the activation of ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM) and ATR, phosphorylation of the H2A.X variant histone (H2AX), and recruitment of repair factors such as tumor protein p53 binding protein 1 (TP53BP1/53BP1) and BRCA1 DNA repair associated (BRCA1; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7G</xref>, S10C). As expected, nucleolar DDR was fully controlled by the interaction between Treacle and TOPBP1, as the knockdown of either of these proteins dramatically reduced VP16-induced repair signaling at rDNA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7G</xref>, S10B–C). Finally, it was confirmed that nucleolar DDR could be efficiently restored in Treacle kd cells by overexpressing (siRNA)-resistant full-length Treacle but not its condensation-defective mutants (Δ83–1121 or CS; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7H</xref>, S10D). Therefore, we can conclude that Treacle’s phase separation is crucial in facilitating its binding to TOPBP1 and activating the DDR in response to genotoxic damage to rDNA.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The nucleolus is a multicomponent phase condensate formed on the platform of rRNA, which is processed and incorporated into assembling ribosomes simultaneously with migration from FCs to DFCs and further to GCs. The constitutive components of DFCs and GCs are NCL and NPM1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Feric et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lafontaine et al., 2021</xref>). Which protein plays a comparable role in FCs continues to be debated. Our results suggest that the phosphoprotein Treacle serves as the scaffold protein for nucleolar FCs in human cells. This conclusion aligns entirely with the observation that the evolutionary emergence of Treacle correlates with the appearance of the three-partite nucleolus in amniotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jaberi-Lashkari et al., 2023</xref>). Introducing human Treacle into zebrafish, which lack a competent ortholog for FC formation, induced the reorganization of the nucleolar structure from bipartite to tripartite, accompanied by the formation of FC-like structures.</p>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that the condensation properties of Treacle are governed by the synergistic interplay between its RD and CD. While the RD can form liquid-like condensates alone <italic>in vitro</italic>, its condensation within the cellular environment requires the positively charged CD, which likely functions as a nucleation platform. Notably, the zebrafish ortholog of Treacle exhibits sequence homology with human Treacle exclusively within the RD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hill-Terán et al., 2024</xref>), lacking a homologous sequence in the CD. This structural difference likely accounts for its inability to undergo condensation and form FC-like structures.</p>
<p>Treacle functions as a block polyampholyte, with its condensation properties governed by the alternating charges of the CD and the strongly positive charge of the C-terminal domain. These properties suggest that its condensation is likely driven by coacervation or self-coacervation mechanisms. Complex coacervation refers to a phase transition process mediated by polyelectrolyte complexation, where oppositely charged macromolecules associate through electrostatic interactions and phase-separate from the surrounding solution to form dense, charge-balanced structures known as coacervates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Choi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sathyavageeswaran et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sing &amp; Perry, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pappu et al., 2023</xref>). The driving forces for complex coacervation can stem from homotypic or heterotypic interactions between charged polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>). Our experimental findings suggest that both mechanisms may be drivers of Treacle’s coacervation.</p>
<p>Homotypic coacervation of Treacle may occur through a two-step process: nucleation is facilitated by electrostatic interactions between the lysine (K)-rich low-complexity region (LCR) in the CD and the glutamic acid (E)-rich LCR in the RD, while fluidization is achieved via dynamic interactions between the E-rich LCR and K-rich linkers, primarily within the RD. Conversely, heterotypic coacervation of Treacle may involve interactions with other polyampholyte proteins enriched in the FCs, many of which are known Treacle partners and possess the ability to facilitate coacervation. For example, it is hypothesized that the CD of Treacle may promote nucleation through interactions with UBF, which contains extended aspartic acid (D)/glutamic acid (E) tracts and demonstrates autonomous condensation properties in the presence of rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">King et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lin &amp; Yeh, 2009</xref>). Additionally, Treacle interacts with RNA Pol I, whose subunits (e.g., POLR1F and POLR1G) are characterized by prominent K-rich regions and E-rich tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">King et al., 2024</xref>). These regions are likely to facilitate electrostatic interactions between RNA Pol I and Treacle, potentially modulating its condensation dynamics within the cellular environment. This hypothesis is further supported by our experimental observations showing that charge scrambling or deletion of Treacle’s RD partially disrupts its interaction with RNA Pol I subunit RPA194, reduces its recruitment to rDNA, and impairs its condensation properties. Together, these findings highlight the interplay of homotypic and heterotypic interactions in driving Treacle’s coacervation and its functional role within the nucleolus.</p>
<p>Endogenous Treacle may undergo post-translational modifications. Specifically, the RD of Treacle is known to be heavily phosphorylated and ubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mooser et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Werner et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">2018</xref>). Currently, the role of these modifications is primarily attributed to facilitating interactions with partner proteins such as the cullin 3 (CUL3), kelch repeat and BTB domain containing 8 (KBTBD8) complex or nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1 (NOLC1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Werner et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is known that phosphorylation can modulate phase separation, particularly by enhancing or reducing the polyampholytic properties of disordered regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yamazaki et al., 2022</xref>). We propose that post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, fine-tune the condensation properties of Treacle. These modifications may do so by modulating interactions with binding partners and altering the ampholytic properties of the RD through changes in its charge ratio.</p>
<p>The 47S pre-rRNA is synthesized at the FC/DFC boundary, while its primary processing begins in the DFC. DFC formation is mediated by the phase separation of FBL gathered on the rRNA scaffold and is maintained as long as there is a directed radial flow of rRNA from the FC to the DFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yao et al., 2019</xref>). While the role of Treacle in ensuring rRNA processing has been repeatedly described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Calo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gonzales et al., 2005</xref>), the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We demonstrated that the efficiency of rRNA processing is compromised not only by the complete depletion of endogenous Treacle but also by the expression of condensation-defective Treacle mutants. This impairment correlates with a loss of Treacle association with fibrillarin and, conversely, an increased association of Treacle with newly synthesized rRNA and nucleolin. This shift likely disrupts the cooperative organization of the FC/DFC and the mixing of their components. The resulting disorganization and mixing of FC and DFC components, driven by the loss of Treacle’s condensation properties, may compromise the radial flow of rRNA, thereby hindering its normal processing.</p>
<p>We also explored the role of Treacle’s phase separation in nucleolar DDR. Treacle’s well-known partner, TOPBP1, plays a crucial role in activating ATR during DNA replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Day et al., 2021</xref>). The interaction between TOPBP1 and Treacle is essential for nucleoli-specific DDR and replication stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mooser et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Velichko et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">2021</xref>). This interaction occurs via phosphoserines 1227 and 1228 in a conserved acidic motif in the CD of Treacle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mooser et al., 2020</xref>). However, we showed that Treacle with intact phosphoserines 1227/1228 but unable to undergo condensation loses the ability to interact with TOPBP1 during genotoxic stress. This observation implies that Treacle’s interaction with TOPBP1 and the subsequent activation of nucleolar DDR requires Treacle’s phase separation ability.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study revealed Treacle’s role not only as a structural scaffold for the FC/DFC but also as a nucleolar hub protein that integrates functions in rDNA transcription, rRNA processing, and rDNA repair.</p>

<title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP-seq analysis</title>
<p>Living cells were fixed for 15 min with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature, and crosslinking was quenched by adding 125 mM glycine for 5 min. Cell sorting was performed if needed. Cells were harvested in PBS, and nuclei were prepared by incubation in FL buffer (5 mM PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP40) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Bimake) and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Bimake) for 30 min on ice. Next, chromatin was sonicated in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) with a VirSonic 100 to an average length of 200-500 bp. Per ChIP reaction, 10–20 µg chromatin was incubated with 2–4 µg antibodies overnight at 4°C. The next day, Protein A/G Magnetic Beads (Thermo Scientific) were added to each sample and incubated for 4 h at 4°C. Immobilized complexes were washed two times for 10 min at 4°C in low salt buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100) and high salt buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100).

The DNA was eluted from the beads and de-crosslinked by proteinase K digestion for 4 h at 55°C and subsequent incubation at 65°C for 12 h. Next, DNA was purified using phenol/chloroform extraction and analyzed by qPCR. The qPCR primers used for ChIP analysis are listed in Supplementary Table 5. The sequencing libraries were then prepared with NEBNext Ultra II kit according manufacturer’s protocol. Final libraries were PCR amplificated and adapter dimers were cleaned with 1:1 MagPure magnetic beads (Magen Biotechnology). Resulted DNA was resuspended in 30 mkl 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer ph 8.0 and were sequenced on Illumina machine. Chip-seq reads were mapped to the reference human genome hg38 assembly using Bowtie v2.2.3 with the ‘–very-sensitive’ mode. Non-uniquely mapped reads, possible PCR and optical duplicates were filtered out using SAMtools v1.5.

<title>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis</title>
<p>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments were performed on a STELLARIS 5 Leica confocal microscope equipped with an HC PL APO 63x/1.40 oil CS2 objective and an incubation chamber that maintained a humidified atmosphere at 37°C with 5% CO₂. Live-cell experiments were performed using transfected cells cultured in phenol red-free DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Imaging was typically performed at a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels, with a scan speed of 200 ms per frame.</p>
<p>Typically, images were acquired at 512 × 512 pixels at a scan speed corresponding to 200 ms per image. Before photobleaching, 3 to 5 images were recorded. Bleaching parameters, i.e., laser intensity and scanning time, were chosen to reach approximate 50% of bleaching in the shortest possible time. The bleaching area was selected according to the type of experiment (full-, partial- or half-FRAP). In the case of half-FRAP, which relies on the analysis of the bleached and the non-bleached half, it is important to optimize the bleaching step (intensity and area of the bleaching spot) to minimize bleaching in the other (non-bleached) half. Half-FRAP experiments were conducted until the signals in both halves had converged to each other or until the signal in the non-bleached half had reached its initial pre-bleach value. FRAP data analysis was performed as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Muzzopappa et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study reveals that the nucleolar protein Treacle undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro and in vivo. It provides <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that the ability of Treacle to form phase-separated condensates is necessary for the proper formation of the fibrillar center of the nucleolus, rRNA transcription, and rDNA repair. These findings will be of interest to the communities studying biomolecular condensates, nucleolar organization, and ribosome biogenesis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Velichko et al. argues that the ability of nucleolar protein Treacles to form phase-separated condensates is necessary for its function in nucleolar organization, rRNA transcription, and rDNA repair. These findings may be of interest to the communities studying biomolecular condensates, nucleolar organization, and ribosome biogenesis. The authors propose that Treacle's ability to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation is the key to its role as a scaffold for the FC of the nucleolus. The experiments in this study were designed and performed well, particularly the overexpression studies, done in the absence of endogenous protein and accounted for the protein expression levels.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I am satisfied with the authors' revisions; my earlier concerns have been addressed thoroughly, and the manuscript is considerably improved. This study is important for our understanding of the role of Treacle in nucleolar organization and function, as well as general principles of cellular compartmentalization that involve biomolecular condensates.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Velichko, et al. investigate the role played by the long intrinsically disordered protein Trecle in nucleolar morphology and function, with an interest in its potential ability to undergo condensation. The authors explore Treacle's role in core functions of the nucleolus (rRNA biogenesis and DNA repair), which has been a subject of continual investigation since it was identified that truncation of Treacle is the primary genetic cause of Treacher-Collins syndrome. They show that knock out of Treacle leads to de-mixing of canonical markers of the FC (UBF, RPA194) and DFC (FBL) phases of the nucleolus. They also show that replacing Treacle with mutants that either remove the central region of Treacle (∆83-1121) or reduce the segregation of charged residues by scrambling them (CS- Charge Scrambled) results in different FRAP behavior of the condensates that result from Treacle over-expression. These data give new insight into the role played by the charge-segregated central region of Treacle in terms of having the potential to undergo condensation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The characterizations of changes to nuclear morphology upon Treacle knockout is the strength of this study. The authors characterized effects on the canonical markers of the FC and DFC phases support the idea that Treacle has a scaffolding function. While the effect of Treacle perturbations has been studied before, this has often been investigated in the context of organismal development or rRNA biogenesis and less often at the sub-cellular level, as the authors have carried out.</p>
<p>Another strength of this study is its characterization of the effects of the charge scramble mutant. The authors find that replacing endogenous Treacle with this mutant reduces the bulk dynamics of Treacle as assessed by FRAP, de-mixes FBL from the DFC, lowers pre-rRNA synthesis, and abolishes the recruitment of the DNA-damage response factor TOPBP1.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusion that Treacle is a core scaffold of the FC is weakly supported. Recombinant Treacle has intrinsic potential to condense, and its condensation is disrupted by the expected solution conditions (i.e., condensates fail to form at high salt but do form in the presence of an aliphatic alcohol). It should be kept in mind that all proteins will condense at sufficiently high concentrations and under crowding. The authors observed condensation at 100uM protein and 5% PEG8000.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study provides evidence that the protein Treacle plays an essential role in the structure and function of the fibrillar center (FC) of the nucleolus, which is surrounded by the dense fibrillar component (DFC) and the granular component (GC). The authors provide new evidence that, like the DFC and GC, the functional FC compartment involves a biomolecular condensate that contains Treacle as a key component. Treacle is essential to transcription of the rDNA as well as proper rRNA processing that the authors tie to a role in maintaining separation of FC components from the DFC. In vitro and in vivo experiments highlight that Treacle is itself capable of undergoing condensation in a manner that depends on concentration and charge-charge interactions, but is not affected by 1,6 hexanediol, which disrupts weak hydrophobic interactions. Attempting to generate separation-of-function mutants, the authors provide further evidence of complex interactions that drive proper condensation in the FC mediated by both the central repeat (low-complexity, likely driving the condensation) and C-terminal domain (which appears to target the specificity of the condensation to the proper location). Using mutant forms of Treacle defective in condensation, the authors provide evidence that these same protein forms are also disrupted in supporting Treacle's functions in rDNA transcription and rRNA processing. Last, the authors suggest that cells lacking Treacle are defective in the DNA damage response at the rDNA in response to VP16.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In general, the data are of high quality, the experiments are well-designed and the findings are carefully interpreted. The findings of the work complement prior high-impact studies of the DFC and GC that have identified constituent proteins as the lynchpins of the biomolecular condensates that organize the nucleolus into its canonical three concentric compartment structure and are therefore likely to be of broad interest. The attempts to generate separation-of-function mutants to dissect the contribution of condensation to Treacle function are ambitious and critical to demonstrating the relevance of this property to the biology of the FC. The complementarity of the methods applied to investigate Treacle function are appropriate and the findings integrate well towards a compelling narrative.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the separation of function mutants of Treacle are a major strength of the work, further studies will be required to fully explore the relevance of Treacle condensation to the stability of the rDNA repeats.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The interpretation of results obtained with opto-Treacle (related to Figure 2C) may be expanded.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful comment regarding the interpretation of the results obtained with opto-Treacle. We understand the concern that the difference in the size of the condensates formed by opto-Treacle (Figure 2C) compared to Treacle-2S or other constructs may raise questions about the role of tetramerization in driving condensate formation, as 2S is known to tetramerize while FusionRed is not susceptible to multimerization.</p>
<p>To address this concern, we emphasize that we have demonstrated that overexpressed Treacle forms large condensates even in the absence of any fluorescent protein, as included in the revised manuscript. This observation supports the conclusion that Treacle's ability to form condensates is intrinsic and does not depend on the multimerization capacity of the fluorescent tag.</p>
<p>We believe that the observed difference in condensate size between opto-Treacle and Treacle-2S, Treacle-GFP, or untagged Treacle arises primarily from the time available for condensate assembly. Opto-Treacle condensation occurs rapidly, within approximately 10 seconds of blue light illumination, whereas Treacle-2S, Treacle-GFP, or untagged Treacle undergo condensation over the extended period of 24–48 hours of protein overexpression. This temporal difference likely accounts for the disparity in condensate size, as longer assembly times allow for larger and more mature condensates to form.</p>
<p>Given this reasoning, we consider it unnecessary to further emphasize the size differences in the main text of the article, as we believe the underlying explanation is clear and supported by the data. Nonetheless, we are open to incorporating additional clarifications if the reviewer deems it necessary.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors might reconsider referring to Treacle as a scaffold. Ultimately, the scaffold for the nucleolus is the rDNA with its bound proteins. Scaffold proteins, by definition, bind multiple protein partners and facilitate the formation of multiprotein complexes, a role not really attributed to homotypic LLPS.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point regarding the use of the term &quot;scaffold&quot; in relation to Treacle. We fully acknowledge that rDNA, along with its associated protein complexes, serves as the primary structural scaffold for the nucleolus. However, we believe that referring to Treacle as a scaffold is appropriate and justified within the specific context of our study.</p>
<p>First, we emphasize that we describe Treacle as a scaffold specifically for nucleolar fibrillar centers (FCs), rather than for the nucleolus as a whole. This distinction is important, as our work focuses on the role of Treacle in organizing FC components, rather than the broader structural organization of the nucleolus.</p>
<p>Second, as the reviewer notes, scaffold proteins are defined by their ability to bind multiple protein partners and facilitate the formation of multiprotein complexes. Our findings demonstrate that Treacle's condensation properties promote the binding and retention of key rDNA-associated protein partners, including RPA194, UBF, and Fibrillarin, within the FCs. This activity aligns with the functional definition of a scaffold protein, as Treacle supports the spatial organization and cooperative interactions of FC components essential for rRNA transcription and processing. Therefore, while we appreciate the reviewer's observation regarding the central role of rDNA as a nucleolar scaffold, we maintain that the use of the term &quot;scaffold&quot; to describe Treacle's role in organizing FCs is consistent with its demonstrated functional properties.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>If authors decide to add the &quot;Ideas and Speculation&quot; subsection to their Discussion, it may be interesting to discuss the following outstanding questions: does Treacle undergo homotypic or heterotypic LLPS? Does its overexpression favor homotypic interactions? How does it segregate FC and DFC compartments -by exclusion? How does phase-separated Treacle interact with other proteins?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these insightful questions. While we believe that adding a dedicated &quot;Ideas and Speculation&quot; subsection would be redundant, we have already addressed the questions regarding Treacle’s homotypic or heterotypic LLPS and its interactions with other proteins in the revised &quot;Discussion&quot; section. Additionally, we have included a new section in the manuscript specifically focused on investigating the role of Treacle condensation in its interactions with protein partners, further expanding on these points.</p>

<p>In Materials and Methods, smFISH section -&quot;probes were designed as described (Yao et al, 2019) and labeled with FITS on the 3'ends&quot; - was it meant to say FITC (i.e. Fluorescein)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for catching this error. This was indeed a typo, and we have corrected it to &quot;FITC (i.e., Fluorescein)&quot; in the revised text.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Regarding recombinant Treacle, the main concern is that the authors may not be observing the condensation of Treacle itself. The quality of the purchased recombinant Treacle is unclear (this reviewer could not find Treacle listed on the vendor website despite using the supplied catalog number or vapors search terms). Furthermore, it is not clear if the condensates observed are Treacle or potentially the Dextran crowder. Only small percentages (&gt;1%-5%) of either Dextran or PEG are needed to induce phase separation in two-component mixtures of these polymers. PEG may be in the Treacle storage butter. In addition to clarifying the State of recombinant Treacle, these concerns could be further assuaged by direct visualizing of Treacle forming condensates (via fluorescent n-terminal tagging) and filling in more of the phase space to observe the loss of condensates at a threshold concentration of Treacle. In general, the gold standard for establishing condensation of a given protein is mapping the full binodal phase diagram diagram of the protein. Understanding that protein is a limited resource, most groups simply map the lower concentration arm of the binodal, and this is sufficient to characterize a protein as having intrinsic condensation behavior. A similar mapping effort of Treacle would be welcomed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful comments and for highlighting concerns regarding the interpretation of our experiments with commercial recombinant Treacle. We recognize the importance of ensuring that the observed condensation properties are intrinsic to Treacle and not influenced by potential contaminants, storage buffer components, or tags on the protein.</p>
<p>To address these concerns, we have re-evaluated the condensation properties of Treacle using a recombinant fragment independently purified in our laboratory. Specifically, we expressed and purified a Treacle fragment (amino acids 291–426), which includes two S/E-rich low-complexity regions (LCRs) and two linker regions, in E. coli. The protein was expressed as a TEV-cleavable maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion, purified under native conditions via amylose resin, and subjected to TEV cleavage. This was followed by ion-exchange chromatography and extensive dialysis to remove any remaining impurities. These additional steps ensured that the purified Treacle fragment was of high purity and free from confounding components, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). We have included detailed descriptions of this protocol in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Using this purified Treacle fragment, we confirmed its intrinsic condensation behavior in vitro. In the presence of 5% PEG8000 as a crowding agent, the fragment formed liquid-like condensates that exhibited spherical morphology and dynamic fusion events, key hallmarks of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Additionally, we demonstrated that the condensation of this Treacle fragment was sensitive to changes in pH and salt concentration but unaffected by 1,6-hexanediol treatment, suggesting that the condensates are stabilized predominantly by electrostatic interactions (Fig. 4B of the revised manuscript). Importantly, these findings provide robust evidence that Treacle possesses intrinsic phase-separation properties. All results from the commercial Treacle protein used in the initial version of the manuscript have been replaced with data obtained using this independently purified recombinant fragment.</p>
<p>We undestand that the condensation behavior of the fragment may not fully capture the behavior of full-length Treacle. Nevertheless, the in vitro experiments provide valuable mechanistic insights into the biophysical properties of Treacle. Furthermore, as emphasized in the revised manuscript, our study primarily focuses on understanding the condensation and functional role of Treacle in a cellular context, where we observe its critical involvement in organizing nucleolar structure and regulating rRNA transcription. These cellular experiments highlight the biological relevance of Treacle’s condensation behavior.</p>
<p>With regard to mapping the binodal phase diagram of Treacle, we concur with the reviewer that such an effort would be ideal for a more comprehensive characterization of Treacle’s condensation properties. However, the limited availability of purified protein currently precludes a detailed mapping effort. Despite this limitation, we believe the qualitative assessments of Treacle’s condensation under varying conditions, now included in the revised manuscript, sufficiently demonstrate its intrinsic ability to phase-separate.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we are grateful for the reviewer’s feedback, which has allowed us to refine our methodology and strengthen the evidence supporting the intrinsic condensation properties of Treacle. We are confident that the revised manuscript provides a robust and thorough characterization of Treacle’s phase-separation behavior and its functional role in the cell, addressing the reviewer’s concerns. Thank you for your constructive recommendations, which have significantly improved the quality of our work.</p>

<p>Replacing 'liquid-phase' and 'liquid' with 'liquid-like' would make the language consistent with other papers in the field and more accurately reflect the degree of material state analysis carried out in the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful recommendation. In response to the suggestion, we have revised the manuscript to replace the terms &quot;liquid-phase&quot; and &quot;liquid&quot; with &quot;liquid-like&quot; throughout the text. This change ensures consistency with terminology commonly used in the field and more accurately reflects the degree of material state analysis performed in our study. We believe this adjustment improves the clarity and precision of our findings, aligning the manuscript with standard practices in the field. Thank you for helping us enhance the quality of the presentation.</p>

<p>The 'unclear' nature of the condensation behavior of the FC phase of the nucleolus is listed as a motivation for carrying out the study in the introduction; the authors could note here two recent papers that have investigated the nature of FC condensation: Jaberi-Lashkari et al. 2023 and King et al. 2024. The reviewer notes that while these were both pre-printed in late 2022, they were only recently published.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for bringing these recent studies to our attention. In response to the suggestion, we have cited the papers by Jaberi-Lashkari et al. (2023) and King et al. (2024) in both the introduction and discussion sections of the revised manuscript. These references are highly relevant to the context of our study and provide valuable insights into the condensation behavior of the FC phase of the nucleolus. We agree that incorporating these works strengthens the framing of our study and situates it more effectively within the broader field. Thank you for this constructive recommendation.</p>

<p>The statement that Treacle is &quot;the main molecule present in the FC&quot; is a substantial claim that does not need to be made to promote the author's case, nor is it well supported by the provided reference (Gal et al., 2022).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this overstatement in our original manuscript. In response, we have revised the text to provide a more accurate and well-supported description. Specifically, we have replaced the claim that Treacle is &quot;the main molecule present in the FC&quot; with a statement highlighting its direct interactions with UBF and RNA Pol I, as well as its colocalization with these proteins within the FC. This revision ensures alignment with the provided references and more accurately reflects the current understanding of Treacle's role in the FC. We appreciate the reviewer's attention to this detail, which has helped us improve the clarity and accuracy of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The statement that &quot;Treacle is one of the most intrinsically disordered proteins&quot; is vague and unnecessarily grand. Treacle is a fully intrinsically disordered protein; these comprise 5% of the human proteome (Tsang et al. 2020), so Treacle is, indeed, unusual in that regard.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the vague and unnecessarily broad nature of the original statement. In response, we have revised the text to provide a more precise and accurate description of Treacle's structural properties. Specifically, we replaced the claim that &quot;Treacle is one of the most intrinsically disordered proteins&quot; with the statement that &quot;According to protein structure predictors (e.g., AlphaFold, IUPred2, PONDR, and FuzDrop), Treacle is a fully intrinsically disordered protein.&quot; This wording reflects the unique nature of Treacle while remaining scientifically accurate and supported by reliable computational predictions. We appreciate the reviewer's feedback, which has allowed us to improve the rigor and clarity of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A comment on the implications of the immobile pool of Treacle (which appears to be ~50% in WT and across a range of mutants) would be welcome. Additionally, the limitations of FRAP for interrogating material properties of condensed material in living systems are provided in Goetz and Mahamid, 2020. In this paper, the authors review instances where the ultrastructure of condensate is known and where FRAP data is available. They show that crystalline assemblies can recover faster than apparently liquid, spherical assemblies. A comment in the text about how these limitations apply to this study would be welcome.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comments regarding the interpretation of the immobile pool of Treacle and the limitations of FRAP for characterizing material properties in living systems. As noted in our response to the public review, we believe the ~50% recovery rate after photobleaching observed in our experiments is best explained by the redistribution of Treacle molecules within the condensate, rather than significant exchange with the surrounding phase. This interpretation is strongly supported by the full- and half-FRAP analyses included in the revised manuscript, which demonstrated internal mixing dynamics within the condensates.</p>

<p>There appears to be a typo in the following sentence: &quot;The highly positively charged CD serves as the nucleation center for RD but exhibits ambivalent phase properties, transitioning from LLPS to LSPS in the absence of rRNA.&quot; The LLPS to LSPS behavior was observed for mutants to the central domain (RD), not the c-terminal domain (CD).</p>
<p>Throughout the authors report single snapshots of representative cells and single line traces. Analysis of the key morphological feature across the population of cells would help the reader understand how widespread the observed phenotype is.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point regarding the representation of morphological features across the cell population. To address this concern, we have included widefield micrographs of cell fields in the revised figures to provide a more comprehensive view of the phenotypes observed.</p>

<p>The statement that &quot;The phase behavior of polymers is determined by interactions through associative motifs, referred to as stickers, separated by spacers, which are not the primary driving forces for phase separation&quot; could be improved by pointing out that this is potentially incomplete for describing the kind of condensation that highly charged polymers undergo. The high charge and charge segregation of Treacle suggest that it is a blocky polyampholyte and that it condenses by coacervation. Models of associative polymers can be useful for describing coacervation, however, the driving forces for coacervation are less understood and have been proposed to include an entropic component (see Sathyavageeswaran et al. 2024, Sing and Perry 2020 and work from their groups as well as the Obermayer (Columbia) and Terrell (U. Chicago) Groups).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important aspect of the phase behavior of charged polymers and for suggesting relevant references. In response, we have revised the discussion section of the manuscript to include a more nuanced explanation of the condensation mechanisms for highly charged polymers such as Treacle. Specifically, we now describe Treacle as a blocky polyampholyte, suggesting that its condensation behavior may be driven by coacervation mechanisms.The relevant references have been added to the discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition to the above, the authors may consider citing two recent publications from the Pappu group (King et al. Cell 2024 and King et al. Nucleus 2024) that directly investigate the condensation potential of K-rich and E/D-rich' grammars' on nucleolar proteins and show that, like the authors, the K-rich region is essential for localization and is conserved across nucleolar proteins.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for bringing these relevant publications to our attention. The suggested references from the Pappu group (King et al., Cell 2024, and King et al., Nucleus 2024) have been added to the introduction and discussion sections of the revised manuscript, and their findings have been appropriately integrated into our analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors could consider replacing the use of LLPS with a more generic term such as &quot;condensation&quot; or &quot;biomolecular condensation.&quot; LLPS of polymers is a segregative transition driven by its incompatibility with the surrounding solvent. As indicated, Treacle is likely to be undergoing some form of coacervation (which is predominantly an associative tradition), which can be genetically described as condensation. See Pappu et al. 2023 for more details.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful suggestion. Following the reviewer's recommendation, we have replaced the term &quot;LLPS&quot; with &quot;condensation&quot; or &quot;coacervation&quot; throughout the manuscript, where appropriate. Additionally, we have referenced Pappu et al. (2023) and other to provide further context and clarity regarding the distinctions between these terms.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The following comment is true but could be broadened to include examples of structured regions promoting biomolecular condensation. &quot;In biological systems, phase separation is mainly a characteristic of multivalent or intrinsically disordered proteins (Banani et al, 2017; Shin &amp; Brangwynne,2017; Uversky, 2019).&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have expanded the statement as recommended by the reviewer: &quot;In biological systems, phase separation is facilitated by a combination of multivalent interactions mediated by intrinsically disordered proteins and site-specific interactions that drive percolation.&quot;</p>

<p>Related to Figure 1.</p>
<p>The authors report Treacle-dependent EU incorporation (Figure 1D), but are there any changes more broadly to nucleolar number or size as a consequence? How do the authors interpret that the quantitative effect of AMD treatment is more extreme than Treacle depletion (Figure 1E).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising these important points. Regarding nucleolar number and morphology, we did not observe a change in the number of nucleoli upon Treacle depletion. However, nucleoli appeared more regularly rounded under these conditions, which we interpret as a consequence of the decreased rDNA transcription activity caused by Treacle depletion. A similar rounding of nucleoli is also observed upon actinomycin D (AMD) treatment, which is consistent with reduced transcriptional activity.</p>
<p>As for the more pronounced effect of AMD compared to Treacle depletion on EU incorporation, this can be explained by the fundamentally different mechanisms through which these conditions affect transcription. Treacle depletion reduces the local concentration of transcription factors at rDNA sites, thereby impairing transcription initiation and elongation to a certain extent. However, under Treacle depletion, RNA polymerase I still retains the ability to bind to the promoter and support a residual level of transcription. In contrast, AMD acts as a potent intercalator in GC-rich regions of rDNA, physically blocking the ability of RNA polymerase I to move along rDNA, resulting in near-complete cessation of rRNA synthesis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Related to Figure 2.</p>
<p>The authors observe that AMD leads to coalescence of individual Treacle-2S+ bodies (e.g. Figure 2E) - does this suggest that ongoing rRNA transcription is required to prevent such events?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your thoughtful question. Indeed, our observations strongly suggest that ongoing rRNA transcription is required to prevent the coalescence of Treacle-2S+ bodies, as observed upon AMD treatment. This interpretation aligns with the findings of Tetsuya Yamamoto et al., who demonstrated that nascent ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) acts as a surfactant to suppress the growth and fusion of fibrillar centers (FCs) in the nucleolus. Their work highlighted that nucleolar condensates formed via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) tend to grow to minimize surface energy, provided sufficient components are available. However, the transcription of prerRNA stabilizes FCs by maintaining multiple microphases, preventing coalescence unless transcription is inhibited.</p>
<p>According to Yamamoto et al., nascent pre-rRNAs tethered to FC surfaces by RNA Polymerase I generate lateral pressure that counteracts interfacial tensions, effectively suppressing FC fusion. This activity is analogous to the surfactant properties of molecules in physical systems. When transcription is inhibited (e.g., by AMD), the loss of nascent rRNA allows condensates to coalesce, consistent with the behavior we observe.</p>
<p>We further propose that the AMD-induced coalescence of Treacle-2S+ bodies reflects the loss of this surfactant-like effect, as transcriptional activity ceases. This theory is also supported by the observation that Treacle condensates in the nucleoplasm, where rRNA transcription is absent, form larger structures. Collectively, these insights highlight the critical role of ongoing rRNA transcription in maintaining the structural integrity and dynamic organization of nucleolar substructures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Related to Figure 3.</p>
<p>In the figure panels B-H the DAPI signal in gray obscures the Treacle localization, especially in Figure 3H. A non-merged image for each of these examples for the Treacle localization would be very helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this observation. To address this, we have included wide-field images without the DAPI overlay for the deletion mutant lacking the 1121-1488 region. These are now presented in Supplementary Figure S5G of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Related to Figure 5.</p>
<p>Only a single representative nucleus is shown in the PLA analysis presented in Figure 5B.</p>
<p>Quantification to assess the robustness of this response with the addition of VP16 is needed. The authors use ChIP and immunocytochemistry as orthogonal methods but it would be best to therefore show both for each manipulation that is performed - the immunostaining of TOPBP1 in the Treacle KD cells in S5A should be in the main Figure 5 to complement transformation of constructs as in Figure 5D.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. To address this, we performed a quantitative analysis of PLA fluorescence signals in control and etoposide-treated cells, and the results are now presented in Supplementary Figure S8C. Additionally, as recommended, we have transferred the results of the immunocytochemistry of TOPBP1 in Treacle KD and Treacle KN cells to the main figure, now included as Figures 7D-E in the revised manuscript.</p>
