<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), also known as winter depression, is characterized by the onset of depression in fall/winter months and spontaneous remission in the spring/summer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rosenthal et al., 1984</xref>). It is generally agreed that SAD is caused by lack of day light in the fall/winter months due to the short day length (or photoperiod), as bright light therapy is effective and most commonly used for treating the depression associated with SAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Golden et al., 2005</xref>). The prevalence of SAD is ∼1-10% world-wide, with symptoms lasting for approximately 40% of the year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kurlansik and Ibay, 2012</xref>). About 64-80% of SAD patients report a winter increase in sleep, ranging from 30 min to 2 h longer in duration compared to controls, which is considered to be a distinguishing symptom in the characterization and diagnosis of SAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wescott et al., 2020</xref>). Currently almost nothing is known regarding the underlying mechanism of this winter hypersomnolence.</p>
<p>This phenomenon of winter hypersomnolence in SAD patients implicates distinct mechanisms that regulate sleep under short winter-like photoperiods vs. longer non-winter-like photoperiods, as the sleep of these individuals appear to be selectively perturbed under short photoperiods. However, the mechanisms by which sleep duration is determined under different photoperiods have not been characterized. Since the circadian clock is believed to be important for adaptations to seasonal changes in the environment and in particular, seasonal changes of photoperiod, we hypothesize that the circadian clock may also participate in regulating sleep duration under different photoperiods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wood and Loudon, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>To address our hypothesis, we tested fruit flies mutant for different circadian clock genes under a range of photoperiods. We found that flies lacking the circadian photoreceptor CRYPTOCRHOME (CRY) display increased sleep duration specifically under short photoperiods, similar to the winter hypersomnolence in SAD. Genetic and pharmacological analysis identified that CRY is functioning in GABAergic neurons and acts upon GABA-A receptor to promote wakefulness. We further narrowed down the neural circuitry mediating the influences of CRY on sleep by demonstrating that <italic>cry</italic> deficiency increases the GABAergic tone and reduces calcium concentration in the wake-promoting large ventral lateral neurons (l-LNvs) which are known to be GABA-A+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hamasaka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Parisky et al., 2008</xref>). Consistently, inhibiting these neurons increases sleep while activating them blocks the effects of <italic>cry</italic> deficiency on sleep. CRY likely functions in part in the GABAergic small ventral lateral neurons (s-LNvs), and lack of <italic>cry</italic> increases GABA level and the activity of these cells while impairing their GABA transmission suppresses the sleep phenotype of <italic>cry</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Allada and Chung, 2010</xref>). In summary, here we identify a potential role for CRY in down-regulating the GABAergic signaling from the s-LNvs to the l-LNvs specifically under short photoperiod. This in turn enhances the neural activity of the wake-promoting l-LNvs, resulting in increased wakefulness during short winter-like days. These findings reveal a mechanism underlying how sleep duration is determined under winter-like photoperiod, while disruptions of this regulatory system may be related to the winter hypersomnolence associated with SAD.</p>

<title><italic>cry</italic> mutation increases sleep duration specifically under short photoperiods</title>
<p>We assessed the sleep of flies mutant for circadian clock gene <italic>period</italic> (<italic>per</italic><sup>0</sup>), <italic>timeless</italic> (<italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic>), <italic>clock</italic> (<italic>clk<sup>jrk</sup></italic>), <italic>cycle</italic> (<italic>cyc<sup>0</sup></italic>) and <italic>cry</italic> (<italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic>) under a range of photoperiods (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>)(Allada, 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Konopka and Benzer, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sehgal et al., 1994</xref>; Stanewsky, 1998). We found that <italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic>mutation, which is known to be a loss of function or severe hypomorphic allele, leads to increased sleep duration under 4 h light: 20 h dark condition (4L20D) and 8L16D but not under longer photoperiods (Stanewsky, 1998). Since this phenotype recapitulates the winter hypersomnolence of SAD patients, we further characterized the effects of <italic>cry</italic> deficiency on sleep. We focused on sleep under 4L20D, as the extent of sleep increase is slightly larger than that of 8L16D. We also demonstrated that <italic>cry</italic> mutation lengthens sleep duration in both male and female flies, while waking activity is not significantly reduced in the mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). This means the increased sleep in the mutants is not caused by defects of locomotor ability. We next examined the sleep architecture of these flies and found that <italic>cry</italic> mutation enhances sleep by extending the duration of average sleep bout rather than increasing sleep bout number, indicating that <italic>cry</italic> deficiency promotes sleep consolidation under short photoperiod (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Because CRY exerts influences on sleep/wakefulness in a gender-independent manner, we used male flies for the remainder of the study. In addition, we tested the effects of a <italic>cry</italic> knock-out allele (<italic>cry<sup>0</sup></italic>) on sleep under 4L20D and also observed significantly prolonged sleep duration, similar to <italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic> mutation (<xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dolezelova et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>CRY functions in GABAergic neurons and promotes wakefulness via GABA/GABA-A</title>
<p>Upon light activation, CRY binds to the clock protein TIM and results in its degradation, which is followed subsequently by degradation of CRY itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Busza et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ceriani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lin et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, we first tested whether the influences of CRY on sleep/wakefulness requires TIM. We monitored sleep in flies mutant for both <italic>cry</italic> and <italic>tim</italic>, and found that the sleep duration of these double mutants are comparable to that of <italic>cry</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates that CRY promotes wakefulness in a TIM-independent manner.</p>
<p>To identify anatomical substrates that mediate the effects of CRY on wakefulness, we employed the UAS/GAL4 system to knock down <italic>cry</italic> in different brain structures and cell types and verified that <italic>cry</italic> is indeed knocked down by assessing its mRNA level (<xref rid="fig2-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

<p>Since CRY appears to act in GABAergic neurons to promote wakefulness, we tested whether GABA is involved in this regulatory process. We first took a pharmacological approach and fed flies with drugs to inhibit GABA transaminase (ethanolamine-O-sulphate, EOS) or GABA transporter (nipecotic acid, NipA). Both of these treatments are known to increase GABA level, and indeed lengthens the sleep duration in WT flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ki and Lim, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Leal and Neckameyer, 2002</xref>). <italic>cry</italic> mutation fails to enhance sleep when treated with NipA, while the extent of sleep increase caused by <italic>cry</italic> mutation is smaller when treated with EOS compared to the control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref rid="fig2-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2-3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Similarly, knocking down <italic>cry</italic> in GABAergic neurons no longer lengthens sleep duration after NipA treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref rid="fig2-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E</xref>). For further validation, we adopted a genetic approach. We found that knocking down <italic>Gad1</italic>, the synthetic enzyme for GABA, suppresses the long sleep phenotype of <italic>cry</italic> RNAi flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref rid="fig2-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jackson et al., 1990</xref>). In addition, we knocked down <italic>VGAT</italic> which encodes an essential transporter responsible for packing GABA into synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Enell et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>cry</italic> deficiency fails to lengthen sleep duration when <italic>VGAT</italic> is knocked down (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G and H</xref>; <xref rid="fig2-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3G</xref> and <xref rid="fig2-3" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). We verified that <italic>Gad1</italic> and <italic>VGAT</italic> are indeed knocked down by measuring their mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>—figure supplement 3I and J). As a control for the genetic interaction experiments, we co-expressed a GFP RNAi and found this does not significantly alter the sleep duration of <italic>cry</italic> RNAi flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>—figure supplement 3K). These series of results indicate that CRY acts via GABA to promote wakefulness.</p>
<p>We next sought to identify GABA receptor that mediates the effects of CRY on sleep/wakefulness. We fed flies with agonists of GABA-A (THIP) and GABA-B receptor (SKF-97541) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ki and Lim, 2019</xref>). Both drugs enhance sleep in WT, while <italic>cry</italic> mutation can increase sleep in flies fed with SKF-97541 but not THIP, implicating that CRY acts through GABA-A to promote wake (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref>). Consistently, GABA-A receptor antagonist carbamezapine (CBZ) reduces sleep in WT flies while <italic>cry</italic> mutation fails to lengthen sleep duration after CBZ treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agosto et al., 2008</xref>). We also treated <italic>cry</italic> RNAi flies with THIP or CBZ and found this treatment abolished the long sleep phenotype as well (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-I</xref>). To validate that CRY modulates sleep/wakefulness by acting upon GABA-A receptor, we tested for genetic interaction between <italic>cry</italic> and <italic>Resistant to dieldrin</italic> (<italic>Rdl</italic>), the gene that encodes GABA-A receptor in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">ffrench-Constant et al., 1993</xref>). We found that <italic>Rdl</italic> mutation (<italic>Rdl<sup>MDRR</sup></italic>) blocks the sleep-enhancing effect of <italic>cry</italic> RNAi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J-L</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agosto et al., 2008</xref>). These findings demonstrate that GABA-A receptor mediates the wake-promoting function of CRY.</p>

<p>In short, pharmacological and genetic approaches reveal that CRY acts in GABAergic neurons and impinges on GABA/GABA-A signaling to promote wakefulness.</p>

<title>CRY acts upon l-LNvs to promote wakefulness</title>
<p>Previous studies reported that GABA enhances sleep at least in part by activating RDL on the l-LNvs, thus inhibiting the activities of these cells and reducing the release of the arousal-promoting neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Parisky et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether the l-LNvs mediate the effects of CRY on sleep/wakefulness. We first verified that the l-LNvs indeed receive projections from GABAergic neurons. We expressed a GFP-tagged synaptotagmin (<italic>syt</italic>-<italic>GFP</italic>) which labels axon terminals using <italic>Gad1</italic>GAL4, and GFP signal was observed at the l-LNv soma (<xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). We employed the GFP Across Synaptic Partners (GRASP) method with enhanced specificity (t-GRASP) to check for synaptic connections between GABAergic neurons and l-LNvs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shearin et al., 2018</xref>). Pre-mGRASP was expressed in the axon terminal of GABAergic neurons (using <italic>Gad1</italic>GAL4), whereas its t-GRASP partner post-mGRASP was expressed in the l-LNvs (using the driver <italic>Pdf</italic>LexA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shang et al., 2008</xref>). GFP signal can be detected at the l-LNv soma, which means GABAergic neurons send synaptic projections to the l-LNvs (<xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We further validated this connection using the <italic>trans</italic>-Tango technique which labels down-stream synaptic targets of GABAergic neurons with the HA tag, and we were able to observe HA expression in the l-LNvs (<xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Talay et al., 2017</xref>). All in all, these results demonstrate that GABAergic neurons project to the l-LNvs and form synaptic connections.</p>
<p>We next examined the effects of <italic>cry</italic> mutation on GABA level at the l-LNv soma by immunostaining. As expected, GABA signal is significantly increased in <italic>cry</italic> mutants under 4L20D but not 12L12D (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-D</xref>). Consistent with elevated GABA, GCaMP6m signal, an indicator of intracellular calcium concentration, is significantly reduced in the l-LNvs under 4L20D (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E and F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). This implies that the neural activity of these cells is down-regulated, possibly due to increased GABA signaling.</p>

<p>To test whether the long sleep phenotype in <italic>cry</italic> mutants is due to reduced activity of the l-LNvs, we electrically silenced these neurons by expressing an inward rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baines et al., 2001</xref>). This results in lengthened sleep duration under 4L20D, mimicking the sleep phenotype of <italic>cry</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>; <xref rid="fig4-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). On the other hand, activating the l-LNvs by expressing the temperature-gated depolarizing cation channel TrpA1 or the bacterial depolarization-activated sodium channel NachBac blocks the sleep enhancing effect of <italic>cry</italic> mutation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">I</xref>; <xref rid="fig4-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4-2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nitabach et al., 2006</xref>). These findings support the notion that <italic>cry</italic> mutation lengthens sleep duration by down-regulating the neural activity of the l-LNvs. Since it has been shown that the l-LNvs promote arousal by releasing PDF, we assessed whether PDF or its receptor PDFR is required by CRY to exert influence on sleep/wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Parisky et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>cry</italic> mutation fails to lengthen sleep duration on <italic>Pdf</italic> or <italic>Pdfr</italic> mutant background, indicating the necessity of PDF signaling in mediating the arousal-promoting function of CRY (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">K</xref>; <xref rid="fig4-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4-2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hyun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lear et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mertens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Renn et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>To summarize, these results strongly suggest that CRY promotes wakefulness by reducing GABA signaling and thus increasing the activity of the l-LNvs, which may in turn lead to increased release of PDF.</p>

<title>CRY acts in the s-LNvs to promote wakefulness</title>
<p>To identify the subset of GABAergic neurons in which CRY functions to regulate wakefulness, we first examined the expression pattern of <italic>Gad1</italic>GAL4 by labeling the GAL4+ cells with a nuclear GFP (nls-GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shiga et al., 1996</xref>). While the l-LNvs are not GFP+, we noticed that the s-LNvs which are close to the l-LNvs and also express PDF appear to be GFP+ (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Because the s-LNvs are known to express CRY, we suspected that CRY may be acting in these s-LNvs to regulate the activity of the l-LNvs via GABA signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Benito et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yoshii et al., 2008</xref>). To test this idea, we knocked down <italic>cry</italic> in the s-LNvs using R6GAL4 while over-expressing <italic>dicer2</italic> (<italic>dcr2</italic>) to enhance RNAi efficiency and observed a modest but significant lengthening of sleep duration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref rid="fig5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Helfrich-Forster et al., 2007</xref>). However, when we adopted a <italic>Pdf</italic>GAL80 to block the actions of GAL4 in the PDF neurons in <italic>Gad1</italic>GAL4/UAS<italic>cry</italic>RNAi, this does not alter the long-sleep phenotype (<xref rid="fig5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>). These series of results suggest that <italic>cry</italic> expression in the s-LNvs are necessary but not sufficient to maintain normal sleep/wakefulness. We were indeed able to detect GABA signal at the s-LNvs, while GABA intensity is enhanced in <italic>cry</italic> mutants under 4L20D but not 12L12D (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-G</xref>). To further validate that the s-LNvs are GABAergic, we knocked down <italic>VGAT</italic> in these cells and observed a decrease of GABA intensity (<xref rid="fig5-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5-2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we examined the effects of <italic>cry</italic> deficiency on the activity level of the s-LNvs. We found that <italic>cry</italic> mutation increases calcium concentration in these cells under 4L20D, in stark contrast to that of the l-LNvs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">I</xref>). This strongly suggests that <italic>cry</italic> deficiency leads to elevated neural activity in the s-LNvs. Consistently, we observed increased sleep when we activated these cells using TrpA1, similar to the long-sleep phenotype of <italic>cry</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>; <xref rid="fig5-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Because R6GAL4 is also expressed in several other cells in the brain, we combined <italic>Pdf</italic>GAL80 to verify that the sleep-enhancing effect is caused by over-activation of the s-LNvs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Helfrich-Forster et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, we no longer observed the long-sleep phenotype when GAL4 expression is inhibited in the PDF neurons by GAL80 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>; <xref rid="fig5-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Moreover, we found that <italic>cry</italic> mutation can no longer exert effects on sleep when the s-LNvs are activated, further validating that the s-LNvs mediate the influences of CRY on sleep (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>; <xref rid="fig5-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Because CRY has been shown to regulate membrane depolarization and input resistance together with the redox sensor of the voltage-gated potassium channel β-subunit HYPERKINETIC (HK), we tested whether CRY and HK also function together in the s-LNvs to regulate arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agrawal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fogle et al., 2015</xref>). We found that while over-expressing <italic>hk</italic> in the s-LNvs of WT flies does not alter sleep duration under 4L20D, over-expressing it in <italic>cry</italic> mutants significantly increases sleep (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5L</xref>; <xref rid="fig5-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>). This genetic interaction indicates that CRY and HK cooperate to regulate wakefulness, possibly by modulating the electric activity of the s-LNvs.</p>
<p>Next, we expressed syt-GFP in the s-LNvs and observed GFP signal at the soma of the l-LNvs, indicating that the s-LNvs send axonal terminals to the l-LNvs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). <italic>trans-</italic>Tango technique further demonstrated that the s-LNvs project to form synaptic connections with the l-LNvs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Moreover, when we disrupted GABA transmission in the s-LNvs by knocking down <italic>VGAT</italic> or <italic>Gad1</italic>, this reduced GABA intensity in the l-LNvs, implicating that the s-LNvs release GABA onto the l-LNvs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-E</xref>). At the behavioral level, these manipulations supress the long-sleep phenotype of <italic>cry</italic> mutation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F-I</xref>).</p>

<title>Short photoperiod reduces GABA level at the l-LNvs</title>
<p>Our findings thus far point to an inhibitory role of CRY on the GABAergic tone, and this in turn removes the inhibition on the neural activities of the l-LNvs. Since CRY is degraded by light, we hypothesized that CRY should exert a stronger effect on GABA under short photoperiod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Emery et al., 1998</xref>). Consistently, GABA intensity does appear to be down-regulated at the l-LNvs under 4L20D vs. 12L12D (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). On the other hand, GABA intensity does not exhibit photoperiod-dependent alteration in the s-LNvs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Presumably, this reduced GABA level at the l-LNvs under 4L20D can result in elevated activation of these cells and increased wakefulness. In line with this, WT flies display shortened sleep duration under 4L20D compared to 12L12D (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). This sleep reduction is a result of decreased sleep bout length but not bout number, while wake activity is not altered by photoperiod (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G-I</xref>). These observations indicate that short photoperiod hampers sleep maintenance, similar to the effects of CRY.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that CRY mediates light-induced electrical activity of the l-LNvs and acute arousal, which indicates that CRY can immediately act to promote wake and terminate sleep in response to light pulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fogle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sheeba et al., 2008</xref>). At the molecular level, this is believed to be accomplished by a direct coupling of light-activated CRY with HK in the l-LNvs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fogle et al., 2015</xref>). Here we found that CRY promotes extended wakefulness under short photoperiod by functioning as an inhibitor of GABAergic tone. In contrast to the previously characterized roles of CRY which are activated by light, we believe this novel function we identify here reflects a role for CRY in the dark. Under short photoperiods, CRY acts in the dark to inhibit GABA signaling and thus promote wakefulness, leading to reduced sleep during the dark phase compared to longer photoperiods. Indeed, CRY is an ideal signal for conveying photoperiodic information, for it is degraded by light and only accumulates during darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Emery et al., 1998</xref>). It can measure the length of the day/night and thus instruct downstream signaling components to modulate photoperiod-dependent processes. Consistent with this idea, the largest increases of sleep in <italic>cry</italic> mutants occur immediately after lights-off and prior to lights-on (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), indicating that CRY functions to promote wakefulness during these time windows which are exactly the time windows that would be affected by photoperiod changes (i.e. there will be light during these time windows under longer photoperiods). In other words, CRY appears to act at the time of the day that is most sensitive to photoperiodic changes, which fits perfectly with the idea that it serves as an instructive signal of day/night length.</p>
<p>While EOS and NipA treatment lengthen sleep duration as previously reported, we are somewhat surprised by the observation that knocking down <italic>Gad1</italic> or <italic>VGAT</italic> in GABAergic neurons also extends sleep duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ki and Lim, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Leal and Neckameyer, 2002</xref>). We reason this may be due to some sort of over-compensation induced by chronic GABA deficiency to maintain excitation/inhibition balance, as previous studies have reported that the amplitude of glutamatergic current is substantially down-regulated in <italic>Gad1</italic> mutant flies and increased in <italic>Gad1</italic> over-expression flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Featherstone et al., 2000</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Featherstone et al., 2002</xref>). Consistent with this idea, we noticed when <italic>cry</italic> is knocked down in <italic>Gad1/VGAT</italic> RNAi flies, sleep duration is shortened and comparable to that of the controls. This is probably because <italic>cry</italic> depletion enhances the GABAergic tone, thus normalizing GABA signaling in these flies which results in normal sleep duration.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that THIP treatment leads to prominent lengthening of sleep duration, and thus it is possible in this case <italic>cry</italic> deficiency no longer increases sleep duration due to a ceiling effect rather than epistatic interaction. Nonetheless, considering that CBZ and <italic>rdl</italic> mutation also block the effect of <italic>cry</italic> deficiency on sleep duration, it is highly likely that GABA-A receptor mediates the influences of CRY on sleep. One caveat is that the <italic>rdl<sup>MD-RR</sup></italic> mutation has been shown to diminish the desensitization of GABA-A receptor and is thus believed to be a gain-of-function allele, but here we found that it eliminates the effect of <italic>cry</italic> RNAi on sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>). Since treatment with GABA-A agonist THIP leads to substantially increased sleep while under the same condition <italic>rdl<sup>MD-RR</sup></italic> mutation does not appear to significantly alter sleep duration, we suspect that similar to <italic>Gad1/VGAT</italic> RNAi, chronic enhancement of GABA-A function associated with <italic>rdl<sup>MD-RR</sup></italic> mutation may also trigger some kind of compensatory mechanism that counteracts this increased GABA-A activity. Consequently, the influences of <italic>cry</italic> RNAi on sleep are blocked. Of course, a lot more in depth characterizations are required to elucidate these issues.</p>
<p>The s-LNvs have been reported to receive GABAergic inputs possibly via GABA-B receptors, but have not been shown to be able to synthesize GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dahdal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hamasaka et al., 2005</xref>). Here we observed that <italic>Gad1</italic>GAL4 is expressed in these cells, and their GABA intensity is reduced when we use R6GAL4 to knock down <italic>VGAT</italic> in these cells. R6GAL4 drives prominent expression in the s-LNvs with very little if any expression in the l-LNvs, and weaker (and not very consistent) expression in several other neurons in the protocerebrum, pars intercerebralis and subesophageal area which are all believed to lie outside of the circadian neuron network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Helfrich-Forster et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we reason that the alteration of GABA signal associated with knocking down <italic>VGAT</italic> should arise from VGAT deficiency within the s-LNvs. Taken together, these results suggest that the s-LNvs are GABAergic. Although knocking down <italic>VGAT</italic> or <italic>Gad1</italic> in these cells can suppress the long sleep phenotype of <italic>cry</italic> mutants, knocking down <italic>cry</italic> in these cells only lead to a modest lengthening of sleep duration. Moreover, inhibiting <italic>cry</italic> RNAi expression in PDF neurons does not eliminate the long-sleep phenotype of <italic>Gad1</italic>GAL4/UAS<italic>cry</italic>RNAi flies. Therefore, we suspect that <italic>cry</italic> deficiency in other GABAergic neurons are also required for the long-sleep phenotype. Given that the s-LNvs are known to express CRY and appear to be GABAergic based on our findings here, we believe that CRY acts at least in part in the s-LNvs to promote wakefulness under short photoperiod.</p>
<p>The molecular mechanism by which CRY down-regulates the GABAergic tone remains unclear. Besides conducting light-driven depolarization via HK, CRY has also been shown to act in synergy with HK to prevent membrane input resistance from falling to a low level in larval salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agrawal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fogle et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to previous studies, here we found that lack of CRY increases the activity of the s-LNvs. Instead of functioning in synergy with HK, CRY appears to act in the opposite direction of HK as over-expressing <italic>hk</italic> enhances the long-sleep phenotype caused by <italic>cry</italic> mutation. We reason that the coupling between CRY and HK as well as their influences on the electric activity in the s-LNvs may be different from that of the l-LNvs and larval salivary glands. Nonetheless, our results also support an interaction between CRY and HK to promote arousal. We suspect that CRY acts via HK to inhibit the activity of the s-LNvs, which results in decreased GABA release and dis-inhibition of the l-LNvs. Extensive further investigations will be needed to elucidate the mechanism by which CRY regulates the activity of the s-LNvs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, here we describe a CRY-controlled GABAergic circuitry involving the l-LNvs and the s-LNvs that adjusts sleep duration in adaptation to changes in day length and propose a mechanistic explanation regarding how this circuitry functions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7J</xref>). Under short photoperiods, more CRY accumulates and inhibits the activity of the GABAergic s-LNvs, leading to a dis-inhibition of the l-LNvs which can release more PDF and promote arousal. Under longer photoperiods, on the other hand, less CRY can accumulate and thus the s-LNvs will exert more inhibitory influences on the l-LNvs, leading to decreased release of PDF and wakefulness. Notably, almost all neurons in the mammalian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, are GABAergic, and GABA/GABA-A signaling have been shown to mediate neuronal coupling in response to photoperiod changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ono et al., 2021</xref>). We believe a similar GABAergic circuitry may exist in the mammalian system that adjusts sleep/wakefulness to photoperiodic changes.</p>

<title>Fly sleep monitoring and analysis</title>
<p>Flies were raised on standard cornmeal-yeast-sucrose medium and kept in 12L12D at 25°C until behavior monitoring. ∼3 to 4-day-old flies were entrained under different photoperiods at 25℃ for 4 days, and then their activities in the next 3 days were analyzed. Sleep is defined as 5 min consecutive inactivity. Sleep was analyzed with Counting Macro written in Excel (Microsoft) following previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pfeiffenberger et al., 2010</xref>). Flies were fed with agar-sucrose food (2% agar, 5% sucrose) during entire sleep monitoring. TrpA1 flies were raised at 21°C and baseline sleep was monitored at 21°C. Temperature was then raised at lights on to 29°C for further sleep monitoring.</p>

<title>Immunostaining</title>
<p>Male flies were entrained for 3 days under indicated photoperiod and collected on Day 4. flies were anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub> and dissected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS at the indicated time points. The brains were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes. Samples were washed with PBT (PBS with 0.3% TritonX-100) for 3 × 10min. Then samples were incubated in PBS with 1% TritonX-100 for 20 min at room temperature. Brain samples were then blocked in PBT with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) for 30 minutes and subsequently incubated with mouse anti-PDF (1:100, DSHB), rabbit anti-GABA (1:200, Sigma), and anti-HA (1:100, DSHB) for 2-4 days at 4℃ (4 days for anti-GABA and 2 days for the other antibodies). After PBT rinses for 3 times, the brains were incubated with donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-594 (1:1000, Life Technologies), donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-488 (1:1000, Abcam) and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-647 (1:1000, Abcam) overnight at 4℃. Then the brains were rinsed 3 times in PBS and mounted and imaged using Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope with a 60× objective lens. The intensity of GABA signal was quantified by ImageJ software. For each cell, the image slice with the strongest signal in the Z stack was selected and average intensity was quantified. A region on the same image slice was then selected as background and its intensity value was subtracted from the average intensity value of the cell. This subtracted value was subsequently normalized to the average intensity of the control group as indicated in figure legends.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this paper, Chen et al. identified a role for the circadian photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME (cry) in promoting wakefulness under short photoperiods. This research is potentially important as hypersomnolence is often seen in patients suffering from SAD during winter times. The mechanisms underlying these sleep effects are poorly known.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors clearly demonstrated that mutations in cry lead to elevated sleep under 4:20 Light-Dark (LD) cycles. Furthermore, using RNAi, they identified GABAergic neurons as a primary site of cry action to promote wakefulness under short photoperiods. They then provide genetic and pharmacological evidence demonstrating that cry acts on GABAergic transmission to modulate sleep under such conditions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors then went on to identify the neuronal location of this cry action on sleep. This is where this reviewer is much more circumspect about the data provided. The authors hypothesize that the l-LNvs which are known to be arousal-promoting may be involved in the phenotypes they are observing. To investigate this, they undertook several imaging and genetic experiments.</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>
1. Figure 2 A-B: The authors show that knocking down cry expression in GABAergic neurons mimics the sleep increase seen in cryb mutants under short photoperiod. However, they do not provide any other sleep parameters such as sleep bout numbers, sleep bout duration, and more importantly waking activity measurements. This is an essential parameter that is needed to rule out paralysis and/or motor defects as the cause of increased &quot;sleep&quot;. Any experiments looking at sleep need to include these parameters.</p>
<p>2. For all Figures displaying immunostaining and imaging data the resolution of the images is quite poor. This makes it difficult to assess whether the authors' conclusions are supported by the data or not.</p>
<p>3. In Figure 4-S1A it appears that the syt-GFP signal driven by Gad1-GAL4 is colabeling the l-LNvs. This would imply that the l-LNvs are GABAergic. The authors suggest that this experiment suggests that l-LNvs receive input from GABAergic neurons. I am not sure the data presented support this.</p>
<p>4. In Figure 4-S1B. The GRASP experiment is not very convincing. The resolution of the image is quite poor. In addition, the authors used Pdf-LexA to express the post t-GRASP construct in l-LNvs, but Pdf-LexA also labels the s-LNvs, so it is possible that the GRASP signal the authors observe is coming from the s-LNvs and not the l-LNvs. The authors could use a l-LNvs specific tool to do this experiment and remove any doubts. Altogether this reviewer is not convinced that the data presented supports the conclusion &quot;All in all, these results demonstrate that GABAergic neurons project to the l-LNvs and form synaptic connections.&quot; (Line 176). In addition, the authors could have downregulated the expression of Rdl specifically in l-LNvs to support their conclusions. The data they are providing supports a role for RDL but does not prove that RDL is involved in l-LNvs.</p>
<p>5. In Figures 4 A and C: it appears that GABA is expressed in the l-LNvs. Is this correct? Can the authors clarify this? Maybe the authors could do an experiment where they co-label using Gad1-GAL4 and Pdf-LexA to clearly demonstrate that l-LNvs are not GABAergic. Also, the choice of colors could be better. It is very difficult to see what GABA is and what is PDF.</p>
<p>6. Figure 4G: Pdf-GAL4 expresses in both s-LNvs and l-LNvs. So, in this experiment, the authors are silencing both groups, not only the l-LNvs. Why not use a l-LNvs specific tool?</p>
<p>7. Figure 4H-I: The C929-GAL4 driver expresses in many peptidergic neurons. This makes the interpretation of these data difficult. The effects could be due to peptidergic cells being different than the l-LNvs. Why not use a more specific l-LNvs specific tool? I am also confused as to why some experiments used Pdf-GAL4 and some others used C929-GAL4 in a view to specifically manipulate l-LNvs? This is confusing since both drivers are not specific to the l-LNvs.</p>
<p>8. Figure 5-S1B: Why does the pdf-GAL80 construct not block the sleep increase seen when reducing expression of cry in Gad1-GAL4 neurons? This suggests that there are GABAergic neurons that are not PDF expressing involved in the cry-mediated effect on sleep under short photoperiods.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is not clear that the authors demonstrated that they are looking at a cry-mediated effect on GABA in s-LNvs resulting in a modulation of the activity of the l-LNvs. Better images and more-suited genetic experiments could be used to address this.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The sleep patterns of animals are adaptable, with shorter sleep durations in the winter and longer sleep durations in the summer. Chen and colleagues conducted a study using Drosophila (fruit flies) and discovered that a circadian photoreceptor called cryptochrome (cry) plays a role in reducing sleep duration during day/night cycles resembling winter conditions. They also found that cry functions in specific GABAergic circadian pacemaker cells known as s-LNvs inhibit these neurons, thereby promoting wakefulness in the animals in the winter. They also identified l-LNvs, known as arousal-promoting cells, as the downstream neurons.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Detailed mapping of the neural circuits cry acts to mediate the shortened sleep in winter-like day/night cycles.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The supporting evidence for s-LNvs being GABAergic neurons is not particularly strong. Additionally, there is a lack of direct evidence regarding changes in neural activity for s-LNvs and l-LNvs under varying day/night cycles, as well as in cry mutant flies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In humans, short photoperiods are associated with hypersomnolence. The mechanisms underlying these effects are, however, unknown. Chen et al. use the fly Drosophila to determine the mechanisms regulating sleep under short photoperiods. They find that mutations in the circadian photoreceptor cryptochrome (cry) increase sleep specifically under short photoperiods (e.g. 4h light : 20 h dark). They go on to show that cry is required in GABAergic neurons. Further, they suggest that the relevant subset of GABAergic neurons are the well-studied small ventral lateral neurons that they suggest inhibit the arousal-promoting large ventral neurons via GABA signalling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Genetic analysis to show that cryptochrome (but not other core clock genes) mediates the increase in sleep in short photoperiods, and circuit analysis to localise cry function to GABAergic neurons.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors' conclusion that the sLNvs are GABAergic is not well supported by the data. Better immunostaining experiments and perhaps more specific genetic driver lines would help with this point (details below).</p>
<p>1. The sLNvs are well known as a key component of the circadian network. The finding that they are GABAergic would if true, be of great interest to the community. However, the data presented in support of this conclusion are not convincing. Much of the confocal images are of insufficient resolution to evaluate the paper's claims. The Anti-GABA immunostaining in Fig 4 and 5 seem to have a high background, and the GRASP experiments in Fig 4 supplement 1 low signal.</p>
<p>Transcriptomic datasets are available for the components of the circadian network (e.g. PMID 33438579, and PMID 19966839). It would be of interest to determine if transcripts for GAD or other GABA synthesis/transport components were detected in sLNvs. Further, there are also more specific driver lines for GAD, and the lLNvs, sLNVs that could be used.</p>
<p>2. The authors' model posits that in short photoperiods, cry functions to suppress GABA secretion from sLNvs thereby disinhibiting the lNVs. In Fig 4I they find that activating the lLNvs (and other peptidergic cells) by c929&gt;NaChBac in a cryb background reduces sleep compared to activating lLNVs in a wild-type background. It's not clear how this follows from the model. A similar trend is observable in Fig 4H with TRP-mediated activation of lNVs, although it is not clear from the figure if the difference b/w cryb vs wild-type background is significant.</p>
