<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Signatures of consciousness are found in spectral and temporal properties of neuronal activity. Among these, spatiotemporal complexity after a perturbation has recently emerged as a robust metric to infer levels of consciousness. Perturbation paradigms remain, however, difficult to perform routinely. To discover alternative paradigms and metrics, we systematically explore brain stimulation and resting-state activity in a whole-brain model. We find that perturbational complexity only occurs when the brain model operates within a specific dynamical regime, in which spontaneous activity produces a large degree of functional network reorganizations referred to as being fluid. The regime of high brain fluidity is characterized by a small battery of metrics drawn from dynamical systems theory and predicts the impact of consciousness-altering drugs (Xenon, Propofol, and Ketamine). We validate the predictions in a cohort of 15 subjects at various stages of consciousness and demonstrate their agreement with previously reported perturbational complexity, but in a more accessible paradigm. Beyond the facilitation in clinical use, the metrics highlight complexity properties of brain dynamics in support of the emergence of consciousness.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Wakefulness in healthy subjects is linked to motor behavior and consciousness. Under some pathological or physiological conditions, behavioral response might break down, but consciousness doesn’t necessarily vanish. Anesthetic drugs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>) are used to medically induce reversible states of unconsciousness of various depths, typically characterized by unresponsiveness. Common anesthetic drugs like Xenon or Propofol lead to an unresponsive and unconscious state resembling NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>). Others, such as Ketamine, can cause an unresponsive yet active state similar to REM sleep where conscious experience remains possible even without behavioral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hobson, 2009</xref>). These states of disconnected consciousness can arise following brain injury and pose challenges in clinical practice for consciousness assessment and prognosis evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Edlow et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Giacino et al., 2018</xref>). In an attempt to solve this problem, recent studies have developed a technique based on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Casali et al. (2013)</xref>), in which the brain is stimulated by TMS pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hallett, 2007</xref>) and evoked responses are recorded with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG). It is shown that the evoked response can qualitatively differ depending on the patient’s state (awake, REM, anesthesia, etc.), and is characterized by a simple scalar metric: the perturbational complexity index (PCI). PCI measures the complexity of the distributed spatiotemporal response in the brain, with values close to 1 when the complexity is high, and closer to 0 for simpler responses. Notably, increasing evidence suggests the PCI index as a reliable marker (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 b</xref>) to differentiate between awake individuals and those in NREM sleep or an anesthetic-induced unconsciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Casarotto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sarasso et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

    <caption><title>Conceptual framework of the study.</title>
        <p>(a) Consciousness is a continuum and can be explored with drug-induced coma of various depths (Xenon, Propofol &gt; Ketamine &gt; Wakefulness). We hypothesize a correspondence between the variations in complexity found with PCI and the dynamics of spontaneous activity across the spectrum of consciousness. (b) We sketch various patterns of spatio-temporal activity reflecting changes in perturbational complexity from left to right. In (c), we show the conceptual shapes of corresponding manifolds of brain activity responsible for different sizes of the functional repertoire (number of wells) and associated with consciousness. (d) The brain is modeled as a network of neural masses coupled by an empirical connectome. This whole-brain model serves as a platform to simulate resting state activity (bottom left) and cortical stimulation (top left, example of firing rate time series with applied stimulus). Dynamical properties of the simulations are studied and compared with data features of human empirical recordings of spontaneous activity (bottom right, EEG during wakefulness and under three anesthetics) and stimulation (top right, TMS-EEG protocol performed in the same conditions).</p></caption>

<p>Dynamical systems theory is becoming increasingly popular in neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Breakspear, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Breakspear and Jirsa, 2007</xref>) to study the evolution of spontaneous brain activity, i.e., <italic>resting state</italic>. Resting-state activity is highly organized and displays structured patterns of regional activations in large-scale recordings across imaging modalities. Some co-activation patterns are consistent across individuals and are known as functional brain networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Damoiseaux et al., 2006</xref>). Over time, these activation patterns can emerge and reappear, suggesting a rich temporal structure with unique characteristics across tasks and individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Peng et al., 2023</xref>). Functional Connectivity (FC) measures capture the topographic organization of these patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol, 2010</xref>) and are static views of the functional coordination between brain regions. Their temporal organization is estimated by dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC), generally measured by correlating FC patterns at distinct time windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hansen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Preti et al., 2017</xref>). In this context, data complexity relates to the range of activity patterns seen over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ghosh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jirsa and Sheheitli, 2022</xref>), defining a functional repertoire (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). A diverse functional repertoire, supporting complex dynamics, is characterized by the exploration of numerous brain states, found in specific dynamical regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hansen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Golos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sorrentino et al., 2021b</xref>). Further evidence suggests that the brain is self-regulating around the transition between ordered and disordered phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cocchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">O’Byrne and Jerbi, 2022</xref>), where a high fluidity results in a rich temporal structure. In this study, we aim to examine the connection between perturbational complexity and fluid dynamics near this transition.</p>
    <p>For that purpose, we use a large-scale brain network model – The Virtual Brain (TVB, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sanz Leon et al. (2013)</xref>) – to simulate non-invasive brain stimulation and spontaneous activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). Various dynamical regimes are explored by varying a global coupling parameter that scales the influence of the structural connections as compared to the local regional dynamics. Earlier studies indicated that a properly scaled global coupling parameter can produce phenomena of coactivations between brain regions, realistic FC patterns, and non-trivial dFC, as seen in fMRI experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rabuffo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lavanga et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we quantify the response to simulated TMS across dynamical regimes using the <italic>simulation</italic> PCI (<italic>s</italic>PCI) and connect it to dFC metrics. We hypothesize that simulations can only produce high <italic>s</italic>PCI and non-trivial dFC when the system is fine-tuned to a particular fluid regime. We then verify our findings by comparing empirical spontaneous and stimulation data of 15 subjects, each acquired during wakefulness and various states of consciousness (Propofol anesthesia (<italic>N</italic> = 5), Xenon anesthesia (<italic>N</italic> = 5), Ketamine anesthesia (<italic>N</italic> = 5)).</p>

<title>Large-scale brain model and dynamical regimes</title>
    <p>To explore the relationship between resting state dynamics and brain responsiveness, we used a large-scale brain network model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sanz-Leon et al., 2015</xref>). This model consists of 84 cortical and subcortical regions, each of them being conceptualized by a neural mass model (NMM). The NMM is composed of a set of stochastic nonlinear differential equations, which describes the evolution of both the average firing rate <italic>r</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and the average membrane potential <italic>V</italic> (<italic>t</italic>) of an ensemble of quadratic integrate and fire (QIF) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Montbrió et al., 2015</xref>). The equations ascribe the dynamics of the node to two fixed points. One is an oscillatory, high-firing state, the <italic>upstate</italic> (inward spiral), and the other is a low-firing rate <italic>downstate</italic> (stable fixed point). Every node is influenced by a stochastic noise component, allowing it to transition between these two states. When embedded into a brain network, the state of each node is also influenced by the afferent input from its neighbors through the connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sporns, 2011</xref>). The intensity of input any region receives is weighted by the size of the bundle of white fiber tracts, as estimated by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). For our study, due to the lack of subject-specific DWI data, we employed a generic connectome from a healthy subject obtained from the Human Connectome Project (HCP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Van Essen et al. (2013)</xref>).</p>
<p>Examining the system at the network level, spontaneous activity can present a variety of dynamics depending on two global parameters: the global coupling <italic>G</italic> (which scales the connectome) and noise intensity (white noise with zero mean and standard deviation <italic>σ</italic>). We highlight characteristic regimes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), showing a carpet plot of firing rate activity and the profile of cascades over time. The profile of cascades was computed as the instantaneous deviation from baseline activity (see Methods). In the low coupling regime (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>), regions of the network are weakly connected and mostly behave independently, driven by noise. Hence, when the noise is low (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, bottom), the activity is generally low and sparse, as most of the nodes are in the down state, with some rare and transient activations. As noise increases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, top), activations are more frequent, yet stochastic and non-coherent. In contrast, when global coupling is set to a high value (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>), brain regions are tightly connected, and the activity of each node is heavily entrained by the rest of the network. In this regime, most nodes tend to stay in the <italic>upstate</italic> due to high average input (proportional to <italic>G</italic>, since <italic>I</italic> (<italic>t</italic>) = <italic>f</italic> (<italic>G, W</italic>)). Only nodes that are weakly connected to the rest of the network will stay in the <italic>downstate</italic> despite high coupling. This behavior gives rise to a stable pattern of regional coactivations that involve characteristic subnetworks mirroring the structural connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rabuffo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pope et al., 2021</xref>) and resulting in stereotyped activity on a slow timescale. However, in between these two regimes, lies an intermediate regime, around a working point, (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>), where cascades of coactivations of different sizes and durations occur in a complex and unpredictable fashion. Yet these coactivation patterns are not purely stochastic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Battaglia et al., 2020</xref>). They are often repetitive, revisiting the same neighborhood in state space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fousek et al., 2024</xref>).</p>

<title>Modeling stimulation and spontaneous activity</title>
<p>Brain stimulation was modeled by adding a transient external current to the membrane potential, mimicking a single pulse stimulus to a cortical brain region. When perturbed, the entire system shifts from its current state as the stimulus propagates through the network, until it settles into a new stable state. In line with the PCI experimental protocol, we sampled from multiple initial conditions and stimulated regions, presenting the maximum sPCI for each regime (i.e., each {<italic>G, σ</italic>}). For each simulation, we measured the complexity of the activity of the whole network over a 10-second period post-stimulus. We then compared this to the complexity of the baseline (i.e. the same simulation without a stimulus) using a ratio (see Methods). This helped us determine the relationship between the current dynamical regime and the system’s ability to integrate a perturbation flexibly. We found that the maximum increase in complexity is reached when the global coupling is set around <italic>G</italic> = 0.55, and complexity itself can be increased five-fold with respect to baseline (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). If the system operates far from this working point, the stimulus has minimal impact on global activity, meaning no notable change in complexity. The visual inspection of stimulation time series (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>) across different regimes indicates that stimulation can trigger (or disrupt) coactivation cascades when the system is near maximum fluidity (<italic>G</italic> = 0.55). This behavior is responsible for a symmetry between minimum and maximum sPCI, as one can see that they share the same distribution in the parameter space. If sPCI is greater than one (lower than one), the trajectory of the system moves towards (away from) an attractor, thus triggering (destroying) a coactivation cascade. When sPCI is close to one, either stable attractors are absent, or it’s challenging to deviate from the attractor, but the resulting response won’t exceed the baseline activity’s complexity.</p>
<p>To compare responsiveness to resting state activity, we examined the fluidity of the system, defined by the variance of the upper triangular part of the dFC. Fluidity captures the recurring patterns of co-activation across time and, more specifically, the switches between highly correlated and non-correlated patterns. Even though direct evidence is sparse due to challenges in probing human brain activity’s manifold, fluidity is believed to reflect the complexity of the energy landscape and the number of attractors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hansen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fousek et al., 2024</xref>). The distribution of fluidity in the model’s parameter space (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>, top-left) shows a peak near the working point value, reflecting recurring cascades during simulation, and decreases monotonously as the regime is drawn away from it.</p>
<p>To highlight that fluidity is a property of the dynamics and is not just tied to a single metric, we investigate and present three additional metrics characterizing spontaneous activity. We first calculate the raw Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity of each regime after binarization of the time series. LZ complexity counts the number of unique patterns (sequences of bits) found in a binary string, allowing for patterns of different sizes. A simple fixed threshold was used to binarize each time series into a sequence of <italic>upstates</italic> and <italic>downstates</italic>. LZ complexity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>, bottom-right) is found to increase abruptly as global coupling crosses the working point separating a low complexity-low coupling regime from a high complexity-high coupling regime. Second, we extracted the size of the functional repertoire of the model by counting the number of unique patterns that the network takes over time. As for LZ complexity, there is a separation of the space around the working point by a sharp increase of the functional repertoire (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>, bottom-left), although this separation shifts towards lower coupling when noise increases and is lost for regimes with high noise. Lastly, we measured the Global Activation Potential (GAP) of the system. GAP aims at capturing the fastest change in global activity of the network, and it is computed as the maximum of the gradient of the residual sum of squares between sources (see Methods). Again, a similar pattern is seen with an increase around the working point (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>, top-right). These tight relationships between simulation features (on spontaneous and stimulated activity) and the tuning of global coupling suggest that the same fluid dynamical regime underpins both optimal brain responsiveness and optimal spontaneous activity. Under the assumption that the global coupling models a free parameter in the brain, which is subject to change upon internal and/or external states, global dynamical changes should be found for different brain states. Based on this reasoning, we sought to retrace the signatures of these same dynamical regimes in real data in spontaneous EEG recordings during wakefulness and anesthesia.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>To do so, we used previously published experimental data, provided by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sarasso et al., 2015</xref>). 15 healthy subjects underwent a TMS-EEG protocol and a spontaneous EEG during anesthesia (Xenon, Propofol, Ketamine) and wakefulness. These anesthetics were posited as empirical models of loss of consciousness. Reports upon awakening were used as a ground truth for conscious experience, and it was found that subjects under Xenon or Propofol had no recollection of conscious experience, whereas Ketamine induced anesthesia was always associated with reports of consciousness (i.e., dreaming). During the TMS-EEG protocol, multiple sessions of stimulation were performed, each consisting of multiple trials per stimulation site. A PCI value (across trials average) was obtained for each session, and the maximum PCI across sessions was retained. Only the maximum value of PCI for each subject and condition was available to us. A PCI at 0.31 was benchmarked as a threshold for consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Casarotto et al., 2016</xref>). As published previously, PCI successfully distinguishes conscious from unconscious states. Complexity measured with PCI is systematically higher during wakefulness than under anesthesia for Xenon and Propofol drugs, but not for Ketamine induced anesthesia, which is grouped with wakefulness (PCI <italic>&gt;</italic> 0.31). Based on modeling results linking perturbational complexity and spontaneous activity metrics to the same underlying dynamical regimes modulated by global coupling, we hypothesized that variations of complexity should also be found at rest and associated with consciousness. We then studied the four resting-state metrics described previously to demonstrate that consciousness is associated with more complex activity at rest. For all subjects, at least one metric can perfectly distinguish wakefulness from anesthesia. We first extracted fluidity of the recordings on a broadband spectrum (highpass filter at 0, 5<italic>Hz</italic> and lowpass at 60<italic>Hz</italic>). Dynamic functional connectivity was calculated using circular correlation between electrodes with a sliding window approach (1-second window, 100-ms step size) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Perdikis et al., 2025</xref>). Then, for each subject and recording, we used a boot-strap procedure to sample uniformly with replacement 50 segments of 1 minute. Complexity, the size of the functional repertoire, and GAP were also computed on each segment. When binarization was applied, we z-scored each electrode independently and thresholded at 3 standard deviations. This yielded a distribution of 50 points for each subject and condition (anesthesia or wakefulness). We present in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> the results, subject-wise, for the 4 resting state metrics we studied: fluidity, complexity, functional repertoire, and GAP between anesthesia and wake-fulness conditions. In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, we show classification results when grouping participants either on anesthesia (vs wakefulness) or conscious report (vs. no report). We cross-plot each metric against the PCI on the top and show classification accuracies of all metrics after fitting an SVM classifier with a linear kernel. For these last results, we computed complexity and the size of the functional repertoire on the full recordings and adjusted them by the length of the signal.</p>

    <p>According to our hypothesis and modeling results, we expected higher values of fluidity during wake-fulness than anesthesia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). The separation between conditions was perfect for Propofol and Xenon anesthesia. Ketamine results were inconsistent, with subject 2 showing a reversed pattern (higher fluidity during anesthesia). Based on the results obtained on perturbational complexity, we expected to find systematically more spontaneous complexity during wakefulness than anesthesia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>). For Propofol anesthesia, all subjects had a good separation, and for Xenon, 3 subjects were well classified but two had overlapping distributions of complexity. For Ketamine, subject 4 had overlapping distributions when the other 4 showed good separation, though the relationship was inverted for subjects 3 and 5, with less complexity found in wakefulness. In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rabuffo et al. (2021)</xref>, we hypothesized that GAP was associated with the flexibility of the brain to switch between distant functional states and expected this ability to be lost during anesthesia. The results for GAP were satisfying for the Xenon and Propofol conditions but poor for all subjects under Ketamine (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). As expected, when the separation occurs between wakefulness and anesthesia, the GAP is consistently higher during wakefulness. It is likely hinting at different mechanisms of action of the drugs on neural dynamics, in which the GAP is not altered by Ketamine. Lastly, as the size of the functional repertoire reflects the extent of explored functional patterns, we were expecting to find it associated with wakefulness, when the brain is more solicited and needs to reconfigure more often. Indeed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>), it is the metric that permits a perfect separation between wakefulness and anesthesia for all subjects and conditions. The number of states explored during the recordings was consistently larger during wakefulness than anesthesia for all drugs and subjects. Classification results using a linear SVM are reported in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. We report the crossplots of PCI and each of the resting-state metrics for all subjects and conditions in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>. Each point corresponds to the calculation of the given metric over the whole recording normalized by its duration. We find that for fluidity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>, third panel), there is a perfect linear separation between Propofol and Xenon anesthesia on the left side and Wakefulness and Ketamine anesthesia on the right side. This corresponds to the classification accuracy result of 100% for the consciousness class in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>, which is the same for PCI. As expected, PCI and fluidity behave poorly at classifying the presence of an anesthetic agent due to the confusion induced by Ketamine. However, the size of the functional repertoire performs an almost perfect classification for this grouping. Only one subject under Ketamine has a high functional repertoire (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>, left panel), but all other subjects in the anesthesia condition have a size of functional repertoire roughly under 100. Classification accuracies for complexity and GAP at the group level are less performant but are shown for completeness.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Understanding the neural substrates of consciousness stands as one of the most significant scientific challenges encompassing both philosophical and theoretical dimensions. This challenge also stems from clinical practice, such as the need to characterize disorders of consciousness and their prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Edlow et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Giacino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sanders et al., 2012</xref>). The detection of consciousness independently of sensory processing and motor behavior has recently improved with the development of the Perturbational Complexity Index that relies on the analysis of TMS-evoked potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Casarotto et al., 2016</xref>). Despite its remarkable performance, TMS-EEG can be challenging to implement in clinical practice as it requires complex equipment. In this work, we explored both the dynamics of spontaneous activity and responsiveness in a large-scale brain model and found strong evidence that common network-level factors govern the two. We demonstrate using a large-scale brain model that a similar dynamical regime of activity can cause perturbational complexity and complex (fluid) spontaneous activity. Using empirical data, we showed that spontaneous activity analyzed through appropriate metrics can be effective in assessing consciousness in wakefulness and anesthesia.</p>
    <p>A large body of evidence highlights a relationship between the complexity of brain signals and conscious experience, as recently reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sarasso et al., 2021</xref>). The first theoretical argument started from a phenomenological description of conscious experience that led to theorizing the expected properties of the underlying neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tononi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tononi et al., 1998</xref>). In this view, the two building blocks of consciousness are functional integration (each experience is unified as a whole) and functional differentiation (each experience is unique and separated from others). These theoretical findings lead to the development of metrics rooted in information theory to estimate these functional properties on neural data. Of all these metrics, the PCI (relying on Lempel-Ziv complexity and entropy) revealed an interpretable and practical link between the spatio-temporal complexity of the propagation of a perturbation in the brain and the level of consciousness. In parallel, a large literature is dedicated to understanding brain function from the perspective of dynamical systems theory. In this field, the brain is viewed as a complex open system far from equilibrium composed of a large number of coupled components (e.g., neurons at the microscale or neural masses at the mesoscale) whose interactions are responsible for the emergence of macroscopic patterns. In such systems, drastic changes such as phase transitions or bifurcations can occur spontaneously or under the influence of a global parameter, with major effects on the dynamics. Brain simulations like the one presented in this work support the idea that a rich dynamics is possible when the system’s parameters are fine-tuned around specific values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Golos et al., 2015</xref>). In fact, although debated, one prominent theory in neuroscience posits that the brain self-regulates near a critical regime, in the vicinity of a phase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cocchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">O’Byrne and Jerbi, 2022</xref>). Simply put, this property allows the brain to be flexible enough to reconfigure and adapt dynamically to a changing environment, all while being stable enough to engage in complex sustained activities. Among other things, the critical regime is known to maximize information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Beggs, 2008</xref>) or to be related to cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Xu et al., 2022</xref>), and criticality in the brain is also possibly linked to consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tagliazucchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tagliazucchi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Toker et al., 2022</xref>). Dynamical systems theory in neuroscience has also found a strong paradigm with the concept of manifolds. It’s been shown that a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system displays low-dimensional but nevertheless complex behavior, which is equivalent to being constrained to an attractive low-dimensional hypersurface (aka manifold). Low-dimensional manifolds have been present in nonlinear dynamics for a long time, but as concept for self-organization, it was first theorized in synergetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Haken, 1983</xref>), but restricted to systems living close to a bifurcation; and later generalized to systems close to symmetries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pillai and Jirsa, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jirsa and Sheheitli, 2022</xref>), notably symmetry breaking through large-scale connectivity in networks with time delays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Petkoski et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Petkoski and Jirsa, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">2022</xref>). Recent applications of this concept can be found in the domain of motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brennan and Proekt, 2019</xref>) or in sleep/wake studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chaudhuri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rué-Queralt et al., 2021</xref>). The link between dynamics and complexity is still under theoretical exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jirsa and Sheheitli, 2022</xref>), and here we bring an empirical argument in that direction. Indeed, by using a large-scale brain model, we were able to control the dynamical regimes of the network and show that fluidity and responsiveness are maximal within the same parameter range. Fluidity captures the complexity of the manifold of the brain activity (i.e., number of attractors) and responsiveness quantifies the complexity upon perturbation. It could be argued that the noise level is not similar in both settings, but noise is only present to ensure continuous exploration of the manifold without affecting its topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ghosh et al., 2008</xref>). Complexity had already been shown to vary across conscious states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hudetz et al., 2016</xref>), and the 1/f slope of the EEG spectrum was also correlated with PCI on the same data we used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Colombo et al., 2019</xref>). Our validation results are in line with previous work on spontaneous activity and consciousness. In addition, we demonstrate that it’s possible to distinguish ketamine induced unresponsiveness from wakefulness at the individual level with a single metric.</p>
<p>Several studies have employed computational modeling approaches to investigate the differences in brain dynamics across states of consciousness. These studies present varying degrees of physiological detail and focus on complementary aspects of unconsciousness. They start from simple abstract models (Ising model) addressing for example the increased correlation between stuctural and functional connectivity in anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Stramaglia et al., 2017</xref>), or oscillator-based models (Hopf model) capturing a brain state dependent response to simulated perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Deco et al., 2018</xref>). More neurobiologically realistic models (Dynamic Mean Field) have also been used to combine multimodal imaging data together with receptor density maps to address the macroscopic effects of general aneshesia and their relationship to spatially heterogeneous properties of the neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Luppi et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, using anatomically constrained parameters for brain regions has already been shown to increase the predictive value of brain network models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kong et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, employing biophysically grounded mean-field and spiking neuron models (AdEx) allows addressing phenomena propagating in effect across multiple scales of description such as the molecular effects of anesthetics targeting specific receptor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sacha et al., 2025</xref>). Related work has shown that adaptation successfully reproduces dynamical regimes coherent with NREM and wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cattani et al., 2023</xref>) with corresponding realistic PCI values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Goldman et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we don’t address these biological questions but rather give a proof of concept that large-scale brain models can help understand the dynamics related to brain function. We used a model derived from QIF neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Montbrió et al., 2015</xref>) that lacks biological parameters such as ion concentration or synaptic adaptation. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that even the symmetry breaking caused by the connectome is sufficient for setting the global working point of the brain, which then links the brain’s capacity for generating complex behavior in the different paradigms, that is, rest and stimulation.</p>
<p>One major limitation of our study lies in the algorithm we used to assess complexity in the model. The empirical PCI calculation is done on the average evoked response following stimulation that only lasts a few hundred milliseconds before returning to baseline activity. In the model, we spanned this calculation over ten seconds, thus capturing a slower dynamic than in real data. Nevertheless, we believe it doesn’t affect our statement, and in theory, the neural mass model we used doesn’t have a specific timescale. In future work, some caveats of our work could also be addressed and remedied. First, the imperfect separation of groups for some of the metrics could be improved by personalized brain modeling. The size of the functional repertoire, for instance, distinguishes wakefulness from anesthesia (including Ketamine) but lacks predictive power at the group level. This could be solved using a personalized model including structural information and parameter inference. Second and last, more realistic parameters could be included in the models, such as neuromodulatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Taylor et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kringelbach et al., 2020</xref>) to improve explanatory power.</p>

For each subject, a 60-channel EEG recorded spontaneous activity of the brain followed by a TMS-EEG session for PCI assessment, once before drug administration (wakefulness) and once under anesthesia. All subjects were unresponsive during anesthesia as measured by the Ramsay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ramsay et al., 1974</xref>) scale score of 6. Participants were asked to report any previous conscious experience upon awakening. Xenon and Propofol anesthesia led to no report of consciousness, while Ketamine allowed for retrospective conscious reports (vivid ketamine-dreams). We retrieved the spontaneous EEG recordings for every subject during wakefulness and during anesthesia, as well as the maximum PCI value from the TMS-EEG session and the absence/presence of conscious experience.

This algorithm, often used for data compression, scans through the sequence of binary elements and counts the number of unique patterns. For synthetic data, the bistable nature of the Montbrió (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Montbrió et al., 2015</xref>) model allowed us to binarize firing rate time series (both spontaneous activity and after stimulation) by simple thresholding. The threshold (<italic>r</italic> = 0.7) was determined empirically by visual inspection with the intent to limit false positive and false negative rates of <italic>upstate</italic> activity.

<title>Perturbational Complexity</title>
<p>To capture the complexity of the activity after stimulation we computed an index strongly inspired by Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI). PCI relies on a complex statistical procedure to threshold the deterministic evoked brain response following the perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Casali et al., 2013</xref>). This procedure is applied after source reconstruction of the EEG signal and yields a binary matrix of source activities over time. This binary matrix is then flattened and fed to the following formula:
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="537321v3_eqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
    where LZ<sub><italic>L</italic></sub> is the Lempel-Ziv complexity of a series of length <italic>L</italic> and <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> is the asymptotic Lempel-Ziv complexity for a random series of the same length <italic>L</italic>, which itself, is proportional to the source entropy that would have generated the data with the same average activity <italic>p</italic>. A high value of PCI corresponds to a complex propagation of the evoked signal in time and space across the brain. This procedure is repeated at several scalp locations and the maximum PCI value obtained is retained. In this work, the empirical (maximum) PCI for every participant was provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sarasso et al. (2015)</xref>.</p>

To distinguish the deterministic response of the system from the spontaneous activity, each of these <italic>s</italic>PCI<sub><italic>stim</italic></sub> value was matched with a baseline value:
<disp-formula id="eqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="537321v3_eqn7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
which corresponds to the complexity associated with the spontaneous activity of the realization of the exact same simulation (same parameters, same noise seed) but without the stimulus. The ratio of those two quantities was considered as the change in complexity due to the stimulus:

<graphic xlink:href="537321v3_eqn8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
A value of <italic>s</italic>PCI <italic>&gt;</italic> 1 (respectively <italic>s</italic>PCI <italic>&lt;</italic> 1) indicates an increase (respectively a decrease) in complexity in response to the stimulus. 17 nodes were randomly selected (for computational limitations) among the 68 cortical nodes and 140 trials were done for each node near the working point <italic>G</italic> ∈ [0.52, 0.57] and <italic>σ</italic> ∈ [0.022, 0.039], and 6 trials elsewhere. We then selected the maximum <italic>s</italic>PCI across time and nodes as the final <italic>s</italic>PCI:

<title>Fluidity</title>
<p>The extent of the repertoire of functional patterns explored spontaneously by a network is measured by fluidity defined as the variance of the upper triangle of the dynamic functional connectivity matrix (dFC). A sliding window (of length <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>win</italic></sub>) of functional connectivity (FC) is applied:
<disp-formula id="eqn10">
<graphic xlink:href="537321v3_eqn10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
so that <italic>F C</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) ∈ ℝ<italic>N</italic> ×<italic>N</italic>, for <italic>N</italic> sources (or electrodes in the network.</p>
<p>This yields a stream of FC matrices across the length of the signal <italic>s</italic>(<italic>t</italic>). Dynamic functional connectivity is then computed as the correlation between the upper triangular part of those FC matrices to extract recurrences of functional patterns across time:
<disp-formula id="eqn11">
<graphic xlink:href="537321v3_eqn11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
so that <italic>dF C</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) ∈ ℝ<sup><italic>M</italic> ×<italic>M</italic></sup>, for <italic>M</italic> windows.</p>
<p>To finish, fluidity corresponds to the variance of the upper triangle of the dFC matrix, after removal of overlapping windows:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="537321v3_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
In practice, the diagonal offset to compute fluidity is given by <italic>of</italic> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="537321v3_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, with <italic>n overlap</italic> the number of overlapping time points between two adjacent windows.</p>
<p>In synthetic data functional connectivity was based on the zero-lag Pearson correlation between the firing rate activity of every pair of nodes of the network:
<disp-formula id="eqn12">
<graphic xlink:href="537321v3_eqn12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
In empirical EEG recordings functional connectivity was assessed by the circular correlation coefficient among all pairs of electrodes (<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>con</italic></sub> = 1770 for 60 channels) over a sliding window of length <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>win</italic></sub> = 0.55<italic>s</italic>. We computed the Hilbert transform of each electrode to extract the instantaneous phase <italic>φ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and mean phase within each window on a broadband spectrum (0.5 − 60<italic>Hz</italic>). Then between for each pair of electrodes <italic>i, j</italic> we computed functional connectivity:
<disp-formula id="eqn13">
<graphic xlink:href="537321v3_eqn13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Fluidity is related to previously defined metrics such as functional connectivity variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Müller et al., 2020</xref>) that relied on a non-overlapping windowing procedure. We chose the term fluidity to convey a concept linked to dynamical systems in general and states exploration.</p>

<title>Functional Repertoire</title>
<p>To measure the size of the functional repertoire in empirical data we first extracted the avalanches. The procedure is to z-score and threshold the EEG recording to obtain a binarized time series of activations (1 if <italic>z</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>&gt;</italic> 3 <italic>s</italic>.<italic>d</italic>, 0 otherwise). An avalanche is a short-lived event that starts when an electrode is activated and ends when all electrodes return below the threshold. The method requires time to be binned and checking that the sequence of activation within an avalanche follows a branching process, by computing the branching ratio for each avalanche (<italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) and average it (geometrically) across avalanches (<italic>σ</italic>):
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="537321v3_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Where <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>bin</italic></sub> is the number of discrete time bin for the <italic>ith</italic> avalanche, <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>event</italic></sub> the number of sources activated during a given time bin and <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>aval</italic></sub> is the total number of avalanches in a recording. A branching ratio <italic>σ</italic> = 1 indicates a critical process and <italic>σ &lt;</italic> 1 or <italic>&gt;</italic> 1 a subcritical or supercritical process respectively. We selected a bin size of 1 for which <italic>σ</italic> = 1 for all recordings. An avalanche pattern is defined as the set of regions that were recruited in a particular avalanche. The functional repertoire consists of all the distinct patterns (i.e., discarding repetitions) that occurred over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sorrentino et al., 2021a</xref>). In synthetic data, avalanche extraction was not always possible, depending on the dynamical regime. Hence, we simplified the procedure by counting the number of unique patterns across all-time points after binarization.</p>

<title>Global Activation Potential</title>
<p>Various modalities have shown that structured brain patterns emerge in short-lived bursts of neuronal activations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Palva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zamani Esfahlani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Tagliazucchi et al., 2012</xref>). To capture these events in our data, we first z-score the data along time, and then perform the root-sum-square (RSS) across electrode:
<disp-formula id="eqn14">
<graphic xlink:href="537321v3_eqn14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) is the z-scored activity. The RSS profile has values described by a fat-tail distribution and presents a bursting or activation profile characterized by rare sudden jumps. Similar to the PCI, which measures the potential for the system to express complex responses by selecting the maximum of perturbational complexity across an array of stimulations, here we define the potential of spontaneous activation for the system by selecting the maximum variation of the RSS, which we dub Global Activation Potential (GAP):

<title>Classification</title>
<p>To test the classification accuracy of the resting state metrics we used a Support Vector machine algorithm with a linear kernel. Two different classifiers were evaluated. The first, grouping all participants in the <italic>wakefulness</italic> condition (N=15) against <italic>anesthesia</italic> condition (Ketamine N=5, Xenon N=5, and Propofol N=5). The second, grouping participants in <italic>conscious report</italic> (wakefulness N=15, and Ketamine anesthesia N=5) against <italic>no report</italic> (Xenon N=5, and Propofol N=5 anesthesia). Each classifier was trained using one feature at a time to find the optimal threshold for classification: PCI, fluidity, complexity, size of the functional repertoire, and GAP. All features were calculated on the full duration of each recording. Complexity and Functional repertoire features were normalized by the length in minutes.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study examined the complexity of emergent dynamics of large-scale neural network models after perturbation (perturbational complexity index, PCI) and used it as a measurement of consciousness to account for previous recordings of humans at various anesthetized levels. The evidence supporting the conclusion is <bold>convincing</bold> and constitutes a unified framework for different observations related to consciousness. There are many fields that would be interested in this study, including cognitive neuroscience, psychology, complex systems, neural networks, and neural dynamics.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper attempts to measure the complex changes of consciousness in the human brain as a whole. Inspired by the perturbational complexity index (PCI) from classic research, authors introduce simulation PCI (𝑠𝑃𝐶𝐼) of a time series of brain activity as a measure of consciousness. They first use large-scale brain network modeling to explore its relationship with the network coupling and input noise. Then the authors verify the measure with empirical data collected in previous research.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The conceptual idea of the work is novel. The authors measure the complexity of brain activity from the perspective of dynamical systems. They provide a comparison of the proposed measure with four other indexes. The text of this paper is very concise, supported by experimental data and theoretical model analysis.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The manuscript is in good shape after revision. I would suggest that the author open-source the code and data in this study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Breyton and colleagues analysed the emergent dynamics from a neural mass model, characterised the resultant complexity of the dynamics, and then related these signatures of complexity to datasets in which individuals had been anaesthetised with different pharmacological agents. The results provide a coherent explanation for observations associated with different time series metrics, and further help to reinforce the importance of modelling when integrating across scientific studies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>* The modelling approach was clear, well-reasoned and explicit, allowing for direct comparison to other work and potential elaboration in future studies through the augmentation with richer neurobiological detail.</p>
<p>* The results serve to provide a potential mechanistic basis for the observation that Perturbational Complexity Index changes as a function of consciousness state.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>* Coactivation cascades were visually identified, rather than observed through an algorithmic lens. Given that there are numerous tools for quantifying the presence/absence of cascades from neuroimaging data, the authors may benefit from formalising this notion.</p>
<p>* It was difficult to tell, graphically, where the model's operating regime lay. Visual clarity here will greatly benefit the reader.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed my concerns.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper attempts to measure the complex changes of consciousness in the human brain as a whole. Inspired by the perturbational complexity index (PCI) from classic research, authors introduce simulation PCI (_s_PCI) of a time series of brain activity as a measure of consciousness. They first use large-scale brain network modeling to explore its relationship with the network coupling and input noise. Then the authors verify the measure with empirical data collected in previous research.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The conceptual idea of the work is novel. The authors measure the complexity of brain activity from the perspective of dynamical systems. They provide a comparison of the proposed measure with four other indexes. The text of this paper is very concise, supported by experimental data and theoretical model analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for evaluation of our work and the positive feedback. In what follows we would like to clarify the ambiguities in our initial submission, and the respective changes to the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) Consciousness is a network phenomenon. The measure defined by the authors is to consider the maximal sPCI across the nodes stimulated. This measure is based on the time series of one node. The measure may be less effective in quantifying the ill relationship between nodes. This may contribute to the less predictive power of anesthesia (Figure 4b).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment, consciousness is indeed a network phenomenon. sPCI is in fact measured across the whole network: to compute sPCI we apply PCI to simulated activity of the whole network. The perturbation is applied to individual nodes of network (different node for each trial) and each time, the response to the stimulus is measured through sPCI in the whole network. To make this explicit, the relevant section now reads:</p>
<p>“In line with the PCI experimental protocol, we sampled from multiple initial conditions and stimulated regions, presenting the maximum sPCI for each regime (i.e., each {<italic>G,σ</italic>}). For each simulation, we measured the complexity of the activity of the whole network over a 10-second period post-stimulus.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) One of the focuses of the work is the use of a dynamic model of brain networks. The explanation of the model needs to be in more detail.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your feedback. We expanded the method section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The equations should be checked. For example, there should be no max on the left side of the first equation on page 13.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for spotting this typo, and we removed the max on the left side of this equation, and also checked all the other equations for correctness. The equation now reads:</p>
<disp-formula id="sa3equ1">
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-98920-sa3-equ1.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The quality of the figures should be improved.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We have made adjustments to several figures and we hope that they are clearer now...</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 4 should be discussed and analyzed more in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We added the following paragraph discussing the figure (now number 5) in the results section:</p>
<p>“Classification results using a linear SVM are reported in Fig. 5. We report the crossplots of PCI and each of the resting-state metrics for all subjects and conditions in Fig. 5a. Each point corresponds to the calculation of the given metric over the whole recording normalized by its duration. We find that for fluidity (Fig. 5a, third panel), there is a perfect linear separation between Propofol and Xenon anesthesia on the left side and Wakefulness and Ketamine anesthesia on the right side. This corresponds to the classification accuracy result of 100% for the consciousness class in Fig. 5b, which is the same for PCI. As expected, PCI and fluidity behave poorly at classifying the presence of an anesthetic agent due to the confusion induced by Ketamine. However, the size of the functional repertoire performs an almost perfect classification for this grouping. Only one subject under Ketamine has a high functional repertoire (Fig. 5a, left panel), but all other subjects in the anesthesia condition have a size of functional repertoire roughly under 100. Classification accuracies for complexity and GAP at the group level are less performant but are shown for completeness.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The usage of the terms PCI and sPCI should be distinguished.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out this ambiguity. The PCI metric had to be adapted for the synthetic data. We have now further emphasized this in the methods sections – “Perturbational Complexity”.</p>

The results provide a coherent explanation for observations associated with different time series metrics, and further help to reinforce the importance of modelling when integrating across scientific studies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The modelling approach was clear, well-reasoned, and explicit, allowing for direct comparison to other work and potential elaboration in future studies through the augmentation with richer neurobiological detail.</p>
<p>(2) The results serve to provide a potential mechanistic basis for the observation that the Perturbational Complexity Index changes as a function of the consciousness state.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for assessing our work, and the valuable feedback.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(3) Coactivation cascades were visually identified, rather than observed through an algorithmic lens. Given that there are numerous tools for quantifying the presence/absence of cascades from neuroimaging data, the authors may benefit from formalising this notion.</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We added a quantification of the cascades in Fig 2 and 3. We computed the absolute value of the mean signal across sources (following z-scoring) to obtain a cascade profile and calculated the area under the curve as quantification of the overall presence of cascades. As it can be seen in the two figures, the presence of cascades is the highest around the working point. We have also added the precise definition to the methods section, which now reads:</p>
<p>“Coactivation Cascades</p>
<p>The profile of cascades over time was computed, first by z-scoring each source activity, and second by averaging the absolute value of the activity across all sources. The quantification of cascades was then obtained by calculating numerically the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the profile of cascades.”</p>

<p>(4) It was difficult to tell, graphically, where the model’s operating regime lay. Visual clarity here will greatly benefit the reader.</p>

<p>Thank you for pointing out this ambiguity, we have marked the working point explicitly in the Figure 3.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) In the method section, the technical details of the other four indexes should be elaborated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your recommendation, we agree that the description in the submitted manuscript was too brief. We expanded the method section about the functional repertoire and the bursting potential.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer 2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors could more clearly label the ”working point” of their parameter space. Perhaps a label/arrow on Figure 2c that directs the readers’ eyes towards the location in state-space that you define as the working point?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this ambiguity, we updated the figure 3 to mark the working point precisely.</p>

<p>(2) While ’fluidity’ is quite an evocative term and does a great job of suggesting to the uninitiated reader the character of the time series in question, I wonder whether a more descriptive term might be better suited for this variable, even if as an adjunct to the term, fluidity. In the past, we (and others) have used the term dynamic functional connectivity variability (Mu¨ller et al., 2020 NeuroImage) to refer to this feature, as it links the measure directly to the technique from which it was estimated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your feedback. You are correct, dynamic functional connectivity variability could have been a wording of choice for some of our results. However the term “fluidity” was chosen to convey a broader theoretical concept linked to dynamical systems but not exclusive to the brain. Here, dynamic functional connectivity variability is merely a measure of the fluidity of the system. We added the following in the method section describing the metrics:</p>
<p>“[...] Fluidity is related to previously defined metrics such as functional connectivity variability [10] that relied on a non-overlapping windowing procedure. We chose the term fluidity to convey a cocept linked to dynamical systems in general and states exploration. [...]”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The term ”bursting potential” is also potentially problematic, as ”bursting” refers to a different concept at the cellular level (i.e., multiple action potentials in a short window of time) than it does in the context that the authors are presumably using it here (i.e., the capacity for the dynamics of the population to ”burst” into the fat-tail of their activity distribution). To avoid ambiguity, it could be worth considering altering this terminology, perhaps again by using a term that is descriptive of the technique used to estimate it, rather than the concept that it evokes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this ambiguity in the naming of the bursting potential. We have renamed it to “Global Activation Potential (GAP)” as we believe this term is a better description of the metric. We have switched to this term across the whole manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) There is a range of other modelling studies that have compared brain dynamics in the awake vs. anaesthetised patient. In my opinion, the reader would benefit from the ability to place this work into the broader context created by the literature, particularly as there are subtle (yet potentially important) differences in the models used in each case. Note - as this is a subjective opinion, I don’t view this as a crucial addition to the paper’s potential strength of evidence, though I do believe that it would have a positive effect on its potential impact.</p>

<p>We thank you for the suggestion. We have modified the before-to-last paragraph of the discussion to bring more context from the literature models of anethesia and wakefulness:</p>
<p>“Several studies have employed computational modeling approaches to investigate the differences in brain dynamics across states of consciousness. These studies present varying degrees of physiological detail and focus on complementary aspects of unconsciousness. They start from simple abstract models (Ising model) addressing for example the increased correlation between stuctural and functional connectivity in aneshesia [15], or oscillator-based models (Hopf model) capturing a brain state dependent response to simulated perturbation [4]. More neurobiologically realistic models (Dynamic Mean Field) have also been used to combine multimodal imaging data together with receptor density maps to address the macroscopic effects of general aneshesia and their relationship to spatially heterogeneous properties of the neuronal populations [8]. Similarly, using anatomically constrained parameters for brain regions has already been shown to increase the predictive value of brain network models [6, 18]. Furthermore, employing biophysically grounded mean-field and spiking neuron models (AdEx) allows addressing phenomena propagating in effect across multiple scales of description such as the molecular effects of anesthetics targeting specific receptor types [12]. Related work has shown that adaptation successfully reproduces dynamical regimes coherent with NREM and wakefulness [3] with corresponding realistic PCI values Goldman2021comprehensive. Here, we don’t address these biological questions but rather give a proof of concept that large-scale brain models can help understand the dynamics related to brain function. We used a model derived from QIF neurons Montbrio2015Macroscopic that lacks biological parameters such as ion concentration or synaptic adaptation. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that even the symmetry breaking caused by the connectome is sufficient for setting the global working point of the brain, which then links the brain’s capacity for generating complex behavior in the different paradigms, that is, rest and stimulation.”</p>

<p>(5) I saw the label ”digital brain twin” in the abstract but then did not find a location in the main text/methods wherein this aspect of the modelling was explained.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this discrepancy, we have removed the term “digital brain twin” and replaced it by “whole-brain model” everywhere.</p>
