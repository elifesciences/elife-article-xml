<title>Abstract</title><p>One primary metabolic manifestation of inflammation is the diversion of cis-aconitate within the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to synthesize the immunometabolite itaconate. Itaconate is well established to possess immunomodulatory and metabolic effects within myeloid cells and lymphocytes, however, its effects in other organ systems during sepsis remain less clear. Utilizing <italic>Irg1</italic> knockout mice that are deficient in synthesizing itaconate, we aimed at understanding the metabolic role of itaconate in the liver and systemically during sepsis. We find itaconate aids in lipid metabolism during sepsis. Specifically, <italic>Irg1</italic> KO mice develop a heightened level of hepatic steatosis when induced with polymicrobial sepsis. Proteomics analysis reveal enhanced expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation in following 4-ocytl itaconate (4-OI) treatment <italic>in vitro</italic>. Downstream analysis reveals itaconate stabilizes the expression of the mitochondrial fatty acid uptake enzyme CPT1a, mediated by its hypoubiquitination. Chemoproteomic analysis revealed itaconate interacts with proteins involved in protein ubiquitination as a potential mechanism underlying its stabilizing effect on CPT1a. From a systemic perspective, we find itaconate deficiency triggers a hypothermic response following endotoxin stimulation, potentially mediated by brown adipose tissue (BAT) dysfunction. Finally, by use of metabolic cage studies, we demonstrate <italic>Irg1</italic> KO mice rely more heavily on carbohydrates versus fatty acid sources for systemic fuel utilization in response to endotoxin treatment. Our data reveal a novel metabolic role of itaconate in modulating fatty acid oxidation during polymicrobial sepsis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sepsis is described as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Our understanding of sepsis has shifted to incorporate metabolic dysfunction as central component of its pathogenesis. Inflammation-driven metabolic reprogramming and its consequences in the immune compartment have been investigated extensively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. However, our understanding of metabolic derangements in central organs like the liver is limited. We have previously shown the liver is a target for profound transcriptional and metabolic remodeling in response to polymicrobial sepsis. Specifically, we observe an alteration in mitochondrial function, TCA cycle remodeling, and hepatic lipid accumulation following sepsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Additionally, we have extended these findings to show that hepatic metabolic dysregulation contributes to altered systemic metabolism during sepsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Our previous work is consistent with human studies indicating hepatic steatosis is induced during sepsis and an independent predictor of 30-day mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Furthermore, inhibition of the master lipid sensor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) within hepatocytes exacerbates sepsis-induced pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Collectively, these studies highlight the essential role of hepatic lipid metabolism in maintaining organismal adaptations to sepsis. However, molecular regulators coordinating hepatic metabolic responses to sepsis remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>Immune response and metabolic alterations are coupled during inflammation. Of particular interest, is the extensive reprogramming of mitochondrial metabolism in cells of myeloid lineage favoring the production of metabolites with immunomodulatory properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Itaconate is one such metabolite produced by the decarboxylation of cis-aconitate via aconitase decarboxylase 1 (Acod1), also known as immuno-responsive gene 1 (Irg1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Numerous studies have shown itaconate exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects via multiple mechanisms including the induction of Nrf2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and ATF3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, as well as inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, NLRP3 inflammasome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Additionally, the therapeutic potential of itaconate derivatives has shown promise in a variety of pre-clinical models of inflammatory diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While studies have focused on the role of itaconate’s within the immune compartment, its role in metabolically active tissues such as the liver is less defined. We have previously demonstrated sepsis elicits significant accumulation of itaconate within hepatocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Utilizing <italic>Irg1</italic> knockout mice we aimed to address the effects of itaconate on hepatic and systemic metabolism in response to polymicrobial sepsis.</p>

<title><italic>Irg1</italic> deficiency exacerbates hepatic lipid accumulation during sepsis</title>
<p>We have previously reported sepsis induces a state of hepatic steatosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Given itaconate accumulates within hepatocytes during sepsis and previous reports demonstrating the ability of itaconate to modulate lipid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, we sought to determine its role, if any, in altering the course of steatosis during sepsis. To achieve this, we subjected 8-10 weeks old male C57BL/6NJ (WT) and C57BL/6NJ-<italic>Acod1<sup>em1(IMPC)J</sup></italic>/J (<italic>Irg1</italic> KO) to sepsis via cecal slurry injection for 24 hours as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. To further investigate the role of itaconate in modulating hepatic lipid homeostasis during sepsis, we first evaluated the level of triglyceride accumulation. Consistent with our previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, we find sepsis induced hepatic lipid accumulation as shown by increased oil red O staining and quantification in WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-b</xref>). Remarkably, septic <italic>Irg1</italic> KO mice exhibited enhanced lipid droplet accumulation and significantly higher triglyceride levels compared to WT littermates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-b</xref>). Given the aberrant steatosis observed in response to <italic>Irg1</italic> deficiency in male mice, we next evaluated if inflammation drives the development of hepatic steatosis in a sex-dependent manner. Parallel to male mice, female <italic>Irg1</italic> KO mice injected with endotoxin exhibited a higher degree of lipid droplet accumulation compared to endotoxin treated WT littermates as demonstrated by enhanced BODIY staining in liver sections (Supplemental Fig. 1). Next, we determined if itaconate is directly modulating hepatocyte lipid metabolism or our observed phenotype is driven by secondary effects such as hyperinflammation as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. To achieve this, we employed an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of steatosis via oleate loading in AML12 cells and primary hepatocytes. Utilizing the cell-permeable itaconate derivative, 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI), we find that both primary hepatocytes and AML12 cells pretreated with 4-OI (250μM) demonstrate lower oleate-induced lipid droplet formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Taken together, our data demonstrate itaconate acts as an anti-steatotic metabolite within the liver both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>4-OI promotes mitochondrial fatty acid uptake and clearance</title>
<p>Our data has revealed anti-steatotic properties of itaconate, however, mechanisms conferring these actions are not resolved. To gain mechanistic insight into the anti-steatotic effects of itaconate, we performed discovery-based untargeted proteomic analysis of AML12 cells treated with 4-OI for 24 hours. Analysis of our proteomic data indicated significant regulation of several pathways related to lipid metabolism by 4-OI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Notably, we find enhanced expression of proteins involved with oxidative phosphorylation such as COX7A2L, ATPAF1, NDUFAB1, as well as the fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes ACSL3-5, CPT1a, CPT2, and ACAA2 following 4-OI stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Enhanced expression of CPT1a, CPT2, and SLC25a20 were verified in independent experiments via western blot analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Given the stimulatory effect of 4-OI on carnitine shuttle enzyme expression, we hypothesized loss of endogenous itaconate during inflammatory settings would result in impaired expression. Assessing the protein expression of these enzymes in endotoxin-treated WT and <italic>Irg1</italic> KO mice revealed loss of <italic>Irg1</italic> significantly decreased the expression of CPT1a, CPT2, and SLC25a20 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). These data reveal a stimulatory effect of 4-OI and endogenous itaconate on the expression of carnitine transport enzymes within hepatocytes. Lastly, we investigated whether the regulation of CPT1a by itaconate is linked to its anti-steatotic effects. We repeated the lipid loading experiment, however, this time we inhibited CPT1a via pharmacological inhibition with etomoxir. We find etomoxir treatment reverses the anti-steatotic effects of 4-OI resulting in lipid droplet formation similar to oleate-loaded control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Collectively, our data demonstrates upregulation of β-oxidation enzymes in response to itaconate, which affords, at least in part, its anti-steatotic effects.</p>

<title>4-OI stabilizes CPT1a protein expression</title>
<p>The upregulation of carnitine shuttle enzyme expression in response to itaconate stimulation, to our knowledge, has not been shown before. Therefore, we aimed to determine the mechanism underlying this upregulation. Initially, we assessed transcript levels of CPT1a, CPT2, and SLC25a20 in AML12 cells stimulated with 4-OI. We find very modest induction of these genes, however, not to the extent we observe at the protein level (Supplemental Fig. 2a). Furthermore, gene expression of these enzymes in liver lysates of endotoxin stimulated WT and <italic>Irg1</italic> KO mice do not support the repression we observe <italic>in vivo</italic> (Supplemental Fig. 2b). These data indicate itaconate may upregulate the expression of these enzymes at the post-translational level. Increased protein expression can be conferred through enhancing protein stability. Therefore, we first tested the stability of CPT1a in response to 4-OI stimulation in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). CPT1a displayed a prolonged half-life of about 24 hours in vehicle treated cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). In contrast, stimulation with 4-OI significantly extended the half-life of CPT1a protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). The stability of proteins is regulated at the post-translational level through activation of the ubiquitin system. Activation of E1-E3 ubiquitin ligases leads to ubiquitination of target substrates and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Given the extended half-life of CPT1a in the presence of 4-OI, we sought to determine if this is mediated via alterations in its ubiquitination status. To achieve this, we immunoprecipitated CPT1a in vehicle and 4-OI stimulated cells in the presence of proteasome inhibitor MG132. Immunoprecipitation of CPT1a and subsequent western blotting of ubiquitin revealed little to no ubiquitination in both vehicle and 4-OI treated groups in the absence of MG132 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). However, in the presence of MG132 we observe robust polyubiquitination of CPT1a in the vehicle treated group (Fig.3b). In contrast, 4-OI stimulation drastically reduced levels of CPT1a polyubiquitination (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate 4-OI interferes with CPT1a ubiquitination promoting its stabilization.</p>

<p>Alkylation of cysteine residues is a post-translational modification that regulate a vast array of cellular processes. Given the highly nucleophilcc nature of thiol sidechains, they can participate in Michael’s reaction and undergo conjugation with molecules like itaconate that have an electrophilic α,β−unsaturated carboxylic acid to form adducts. Given that itaconate and its derivatives have been shown to modulate biological function via the alkylation of numerous proteins, we next tested the hypothesis that itaconate interacts with CPT1a and hinders ubiquitination. This is based on previous reports in macrophages in which CPT1a was shown to interact with itaconate via the biorthogonal probe iTalk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. To determine initially if itaconate interacts with the hepatic proteome we labeled AML12 cells with iTalk for 4 hours followed by click reaction to an azide-rhodamine probe. In-gel fluorescence of both Raw Macrophages and AML12 cells treated with iTalk display a banding pattern compared to vehicle treated cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Additionally, pre-treatment with the competitive inhibitor 4-OI blocks this banding pattern, indicating the specificity of the iTalk probe for itaconation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). These data indicate that hepatic proteins are indeed subject to itaconation. Next, we performed iTalk labeling in AML12 cells followed by subsequent azide-agarose click reaction to allow for mass spectrometry identification of hepatic itaconated proteins. We identified 123 proteins that had ≥ 1.5-fold enrichment over vehicle treated cells. We initially surveyed the hepatic itaconated proteins to determine if CPT1a was enriched. Contrary to our hypothesis and previous reports, we did not identify CPT1a as a hepatic itaconation substrate. Therefore, we next performed pathway analysis to gain insight into biological pathways that may afford itaconate’s ability to stabilize CPT1a protein. Consistent with previous reports, we find enrichment in proteins involved in glutathionylation and NRF2 mediated oxidative signaling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Additionally, we found proteins involved in protein ubiquitination to show enrichment in the itaconation group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). These proteins range from E1-E3 ubiquitin ligases as well as various components of the proteasome and ubiquitin peptidases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Identification of these components involved in proteasomal turnover of proteins within the liver is the first to our knowledge to be demonstrated. We hypothesize itaconation of ubiquitin ligases and proteasome components may confer the stabilizing effects of itaconate on CPT1a.</p>

<title><italic>Irg1</italic> deficiency impairs the thermogenic program during sepsis</title>
<p>Apart from the liver, adipose tissues also play a central role in the maintenance of whole-body energy homeostasis. While white adipose tissues function to store excess energy in the form of triglycerides, brown adipose tissue (BAT) are metabolically active adipose depots which contribute to non-shivering thermogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. This is achieved, in part, through oxidation of fatty acids and activation of UCP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. A decrease in body temperature during sepsis is an independent predictor of mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Therefore, given the importance of thermogenesis during sepsis and our findings that <italic>Irg1</italic> deficiency impairs hepatic β-oxidation, we endeavored to determine if this has effects on BAT function. We assessed core body temperature in response to endotoxin challenge in WT and <italic>Irg1</italic> KO mice. WT display a significant drop in body temperature in response to LPS treatment, peaking at 12 hours and returning to near baseline by 24 hours (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). We find <italic>Irg1</italic> KO mice have a significantly more dramatic drop in body temperature following LPS treatment compared to their WT littermates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Next, we aimed to characterize potential mechanism underlying the hypothermic phenotype in <italic>Irg1</italic> KO mice. To this end, we assessed the protein expression of UCP1. We find impairment in UCP1 gene and protein levels in <italic>Irg1</italic> deficient mice following endotoxin treatment, independent of PGC1α expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b-d</xref>). Furthermore, the BAT of endotoxin challenged <italic>Irg1</italic> KO mice was larger in weight compared to LPS-injected WT septic mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4e</xref>). In summary, these data indicate an impairment in UCP1-driven thermogenesis in the BAT of <italic>Irg1</italic> deficient mice following an inflammatory challenge. Furthermore, our data indicate this could be mediated by impaired BAT fatty acid oxidation, as evidenced by the larger BAT depot in inflamed <italic>Irg1</italic> KO mice.</p>

<p>We have previously reported a global shift in systemic fuel preference from glucose to fatty acid oxidation in response to CLP-induced sepsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Our data thus far indicate itaconate deficiency impairs lipid metabolism during inflammation at the organ level. However, it remains unknown the systemic effects of <italic>Irg1</italic> KO on sepsis-induced shifts in fuel preference. However, it is known that <italic>Irg1</italic> KO mice favor glucose oxidation over fatty acids under baseline conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Given this, we next investigated the effects of itaconate deficiency on inflammation-induced metabolic flexibility. We first assessed energy expenditure in LPS-injected WT and <italic>Irg1</italic> KO mice by using indirect calorimetry-enabled metabolic cages. We observed a decrease in energy expenditure in both groups in response to LPS, however, no significant differences between the groups was appreciated, under both baseline and post-LPS injection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a-d</xref>). Next, we interrogated the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) as an indicator of systemic fuel preference. Consistent with our previous study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, WT septic mice demonstrated a shift in fuel preference indicated by a decrease in RER from about 1 to 0.7 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5e-h</xref>), signifying a higher reliance on fatty acid oxidation over glucose utilization. Interestingly, we found <italic>Irg1</italic> KO mice had a decrease in RER following LPS treatment, however, not to the same extent as their WT-type counterparts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g&amp;h</xref>), indicating itaconate deficiency leads to a subtle defect of systemic fat utilization.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our studies identify itaconate as a central modulator of lipid metabolism during the course of overt inflammation. Specifically, we show itaconate may enhance lipid clearing in the liver through the stabilization of mitochondrial fatty acid uptake enzyme CPT1a. Additionally, we have uncovered novel itaconate substrates involved in protein ubiquitination which may underlie the lipid clearing effects of itaconate. Lastly, we demonstrate systemic defects in lipid metabolism and thermogenesis in itaconate deficient mice following endotoxin challenge. These studies extend our understanding of itaconate as a metabolic regulator in response to inflammation.</p>
<p>Mitochondrial bioenergetics and metabolic reprogramming play a crucial role in promoting both immune and non-immune changes in response to inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Furthermore, metabolic dysregulation in the context of sepsis can profoundly contribute to impaired lipid metabolism, which can enhance sepsis severity and mortality <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. We previously demonstrated sepsis elicits a systemic increase in fatty acid mobilization and utilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, which supports a systemic shift in fuel preference from glucose to fatty acid oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Additionally, we have shown sepsis induces dyslipidemia, which in turn promotes the development of hepatic steatosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. While the exact mechanisms driving alterations of hepatic lipid metabolism during inflammation are not fully understood, dysregulation of hepatic PPARα signaling has been implicated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. These pre-clinical findings are consistent with human septic patients, which show the presence of hepatic steatosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Our data identifies itaconate as a novel pathway for the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism during sepsis.</p>
<p>The role of itaconate in modulating fatty acid oxidation is becoming more appreciated. Several previous studies have demonstrated itaconate promotes β-oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Our studies demonstrate itaconate protects against aberrant hepatic steatosis during sepsis. Furthermore, we identify the β-oxidation pathway as a target of itaconate. Interestingly, <italic>Irg1</italic> KO mice have been shown to have decreased fatty acid oxidation and enhanced glucose oxidation compared to wild-type mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Our data sheds insight into the mechanism by which this may be afforded. Specifically, the modulation of CPT1a and other carnitine shuttle enzymes underlies, at least in part, the regulatory role of itaconate on the β-oxidation pathway.</p>
<p>Previously, it has been reported that itaconate plays a role in regulating the β-oxidation of fatty acids to fuel OXPHOS. This has been observed in various cell types, including hepatocytes from mouse models of NAFDL, tissue-resident macrophages in peritoneal tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, macrophages from zebrafish <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> as well as T cell subsets Th17- and Treg-polarizing T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. This is in conjunction with our observations given significant upregulation in proteins governing the β-oxidation and OXPHOS pathway by itaconate. Interestingly, we also observed itaconate regulation of key steps within cholesterol biosynthesis in ALM12 cells when assessing pathways involved in cellular metabolism. We hypothesize this is due to the inactivation of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> by itaconyl-CoA, resulting from itaconate activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. This can cause impairment of methionine synthase activity, an enzyme dependent on vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, leading to dysregulation in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, and ultimately, alterations in the abundance of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a methyl donor in numerous biological and biochemical processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Interestingly deficiency in B<sub>12</sub> has been found to induce cholesterol biosynthesis by limiting SAM and modulating the methylation of SREBF1 and LDLR genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Additionally, alteration in intracellular SAM abundance and reduction in SAM/SAH ratio by itaconate was found to influence TH17/ Treg cell differentiation as a result of tri-methylation of histone H3 protein induced epigenetic reprogramming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. However, the exact mechanism by which itaconate regulates metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming to enhance hepatic cholesterol synthesis is not known and needs to be further investigated given the crucial role of cholesterol in maintaining cellular organization, steroid hormone, bile acids, and vitamin D synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Frieler et al. recently uncovered a protective role of endogenous itaconate in regulating adipocyte metabolism through altering glucose homeostasis, lipolysis, and adipogenesis during HFD-induced obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, they demonstrated endotoxin induces the expression of <italic>Irg1</italic> in brown adipose tissue (BAT). However, the biological function of inflammation induced <italic>Irg1</italic> in BAT was not studied. A previous study demonstrated improved body temperature and clinical scores in septic mice upon exogenous 4-OI administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, the role of endogenous itaconate in modulating body temperature in response to inflammation has yet to be investigated. Our study begins to fill this gap by showing a pro-thermogenic effect of itaconate during endotoxin challenge. While the mechanism underlying these effects were not investigated in the current study, we show a defect in the primary thermogenic mediator UCP1. Research has demonstrated that inter-organ crosstalk between BAT and the liver is essential to elicit non-shivering thermogenesis. Specifically, BAT utilizes hepatic derived acylcarnitines released in response to cold stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, Intriguingly, these studies demonstrated a reliance on hepatic CPT1 function to mediate cold stress induced acylcarnitine secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Our data demonstrates impaired CPT1a expression in the liver of endotoxin challenged <italic>Irg1</italic> KO mice. These findings in conjunction with previous literature may provide a potential physiological mechanism by which itaconate deficiency hinders hepatic acylcarnitine production due to impairment in CPT1a expression. Future studies targeting hepatic CPT1a expression in <italic>Irg1</italic> KO mice would uncover causal links between hepatic fatty acid oxidation and thermogenesis in response to endotoxin. This is important, as clinically and in murine models of sepsis, the onset of hypothermia is observed and considered a predictor of mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Given its electrophilic properties and its ability to directly alkylate cysteine residues, we initially hypothesized regulation of FAO was driven by enhancement of CPT1a due to its itaconation. Contrary to our hypothesis, proteomic profiling of ITalk substrates in AML12 cells did not reveal CPT1a as a target of itaconation. However, proteomic analysis revealed enrichment of the protein ubiquitination pathway by ITalk. We found this of interest, as this may explain the stabilizing effects of itaconate on CPT1a protein expression. The regulation of protein ubiquitination by itaconate is a mechanism that has been implicated in numerous models of inflammation. The first is the classical upregulation of NRF2 due to the alkylation of cysteine residues of KEAP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, which functions as an adaptor of the Cul3-based ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. This covalent modification promotes the dissociation of KEAP1 from CUL3 to inhibit the conjugation of ubiquitin onto the N-terminal domain of NRF2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Additionally, 4-OI has been shown to negatively regulate osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory response by suppressing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase HRD1 to activate Nrf2 signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism underlying the inhibition of HRD1 by itaconate was not investigated or discussed. Our data extends these findings and indicate an interaction between itaconate and multiple components involved in proteasomal turnover of proteins. Future studies aimed at dissecting the regulatory role of these enzymes in the proteasomal turnover of CPT1a and the anti-steatotic effect of itaconate are warranted.</p>
<p>Accumulation of itaconate in the mouse liver during sepsis has highlighted the necessity to understand its functional role within this compartment. By endeavoring to uncover the biological role of itaconate in hepatocytes, we have uncovered a novel function of itaconate within the liver and systemically, to aid in fatty acid processing in the face of inflammation. Furthermore, our work identifies a potentially new mechanism of action via the stabilization of CPT1a. Finally, our work has uncovered systemic effects of endogenous itaconate on metabolic flexibility and thermogenesis in response to inflammation. Overall, these findings suggest that interventions aimed at regulating the <italic>Irg1</italic>/itaconate axis may hold potential therapeutic advantages in regulating dyslipidemia at both the local and systemic levels observed during sepsis. Future work is necessary to understand cellular sources of itaconate, and the role of this immunometabolite in coordinating interorgan crosstalk during sepsis.</p>

<p>This work describes a connection between inflammation and metabolism, in which itaconate stabilizes the mitochondrial fatty acid uptake enzyme Cpt1a to enhance fatty acid oxidation. The mechanism for itaconate action may be generalizable to other protein targets. This is an <bold>important</bold> advance, which is supported by <bold>solid</bold> experimental data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Mainali and colleagues provide evidence for Itaconate stabilising Cpt1a via a decrease in ubiquitination. This in turn likely regulates fatty acid oxidation which in turn would appear to be involved in thermoregulation in the context of sepsis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>These findings add to our knowledge of the role of Itaconate in sepsis and its rather complex effects on metabolism, specifically lipid metabolism.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. This is a complex paper and would benefit from a schematic depicting the key findings.</p>
<p>2. The paper would benefit from additional supporting evidence. Would it be possible to measure fatty acid oxidation by metabolic tracing here, in IRG-deficient cells or in response to 4-OI? Although changes in protein level for Cpt1A are seen, this is correlated with fatty acid oxidation rather than direct demonstration. This may be challenging but would strengthen the manuscript.</p>
<p>3. The aspect concerning body temperature regulation is confusing. Would Itaconate not promote fatty acid oxidation to increase or maintain body temperature? Itaconate must therefore not be involved in the hypothermic response? Bringing UCP1 into the finding is confusing and needs to be better explained. Again a diagram would help, but enhanced BAT fatty acid oxidation and UCP1 expression appear linked here, with both being affected by Itaconate. This needs clarifying.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript provides important new findings regarding the connection between inflammation and metabolism. It also identifies a new type of post-translational modification and its connection to protein stability. This finding is expected to be generalizable to other protein targets. In vitro evidence is solid. In vivo evidence needs some additional controls.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A new connection between inflammation and metabolism.</p>
<p>A novel type of PTM was identified.</p>
<p>Findings would be of broad interest and the mechanisms are likely generalizable to related control systems.</p>
<p>In vitro data are well-supported.</p>
<p>The authors successfully demonstrated that treatment with 4-octyl Itaconate (4-OI), a prodrug form of itaconate, reduces neutral lipid accumulation in the AML12 cell line and primary hepatocytes. They show that 4-OI promotes fatty acid beta-oxidation through increased stability of CPT1a protein, the rate-limiting step in this process.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some conclusions involving the Irg1 knockout mice require important controls and clarifications to be fully convincing and some controls are missing.</p>

<p>This comment is appreciated. Unfortunately, due to time restraints, the authors were not able to graphically depict our findings.</p>

<p>This is a great comment. While we did not directly measure fatty acid flux in our manuscript, Weiss et al. Nature Metabolism 2023 did these studies in primary hepatocytes. They showed an increased palmitate incorporation into citrate.</p>

<p>We appreciate this comment. The rationale is that if itaconate is stabilizing fatty acid oxidation, it would be necessary to fuel thermogenesis, a process dependent on fatty acid utilization. Our data support a role for itaconate in stabilizing body temperature following inflammation, potentially through enhanced fatty acid oxidation. This is evidenced by the hypothermic response to LPS in Acod1 KO mice. Furthermore, Mills et al. Nature 2018 show 4-OI injection boosts body temperature following LPS stimulation.</p>

<p>Some conclusions involving the Irg1 knockout mice require important controls and clarifications to be fully convincing and some controls are missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the needs for appropriate controls. Negative controls were omitted when baseline phenotypes were not observed. Due to time and resource limitations we were unable to repeat the experiments.</p>
