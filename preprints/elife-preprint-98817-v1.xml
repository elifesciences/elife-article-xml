<title>Abstract</title><p>Parallel processing is a fundamental organizing principle in the nervous system, and understanding how parallel neural circuits generate distinct outputs from common inputs is a key goal of neuroscience. In the mammalian retina, divergence of cone signals into multiple feed-forward bipolar cell pathways forms the initial basis for parallel retinal circuits dedicated to specific visual functions. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology, electron microscopy and two photon imaging of a fluorescent glutamate sensor to examine how kinetically distinct responses arise in transient versus sustained ON alpha RGCs (ON-T and ON-S RGCs) of the mouse retina. We directly compared the visual response properties of these RGCs with their presynaptic bipolar cell partners, which we identified using 3D electron microscopy reconstruction. Different ON bipolar cell subtypes (type 5i, type 6 and type 7) had indistinguishable light-driven responses whereas extracellular glutamate signals around RGC dendrites and postsynaptic excitatory currents measured in ON-T and ON-S RGCs in response to the identical stimuli used to probe bipolar cells were kinetically distinct. Anatomical examination of the bipolar cell axon terminals presynaptic to ON-T and ON-S RGCs suggests bipolar subtype-specific differences in the size of synaptic ribbon-associated vesicle pools may contribute to transient versus sustained kinetics. Our findings indicate bipolar cell synapses are a primary point of divergence in kinetically distinct visual pathways.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Divergence into parallel pathways allows neural circuits to generate diverse outputs from a common set of inputs. This functional diversity can be quite striking; in vision, for example, light inputs initially encoded by the same collection of cone photoreceptors mediate sensitivity to several kinds of motion, to color and to spatial structure, all in the same region of space. These diverse functional sensitivities arise through parallel processing of light inputs, first in the retina and subsequently in downstream visual areas. Here we focus on the mechanisms producing transient and sustained responses – a key differentiating characteristic of retinal output cells across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bae et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cleland et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ikeda and Wright, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Roska and Werblin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Werblin, 1970</xref>).</p>
<p>The retina provides a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms that differentiate signals in parallel pathways. We have a near-complete list of retinal cell types and substantial information about which of these cell types participate in specific parallel pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Masland, 2012</xref>). Under daylight conditions, retinal processing starts with cone photoreceptors transducing light inputs and providing divergent output to ∼13 types of bipolar cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Euler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Greene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Shekhar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tsukamoto and Omi, 2017</xref>). The resulting bipolar cell signals are transmitted to ∼20-40 retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bae et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Goetz et al., 2022</xref>). RGC inputs are strongly shaped by the activity of a large and diverse collection of amacrine cells that receive input from bipolar cells and provide presynaptic inhibition to bipolar cells and postsynaptic inhibition to RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Diamond, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>This circuitry produces highly distinct responses across RGC types - with cells that sample inputs on a variety of spatial and temporal scales, cells with distinct chromatic properties, cells that sense the direction of moving objects, and cells that separate local from global motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gollisch and Meister, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kerschensteiner, 2022</xref>). Several mechanisms contribute to these functional differences, starting with the division of signals into ON and OFF pathways at the cone-to-bipolar synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Euler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Slaughter and Miller, 1981</xref>). Temporal properties of responses of different bipolar cells can also differ for some stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Awatramani and Slaughter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Euler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Euler and Masland, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ichinose et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ichinose and Hellmer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wu et al., 2000</xref>). In the inner retina, integration of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs produces directionally-selective responses in specific RGC types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Taylor and Vaney, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Vaney et al., 2012</xref>) and differences in spatial weighting functions in other RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cafaro and Rieke, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Roska and Werblin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Properties of dendritic integration and RGC spike generation also differentiate responses of some RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Margolis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ran et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wienbar and Schwartz, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>A fundamental difference among RGCs is whether their responses are sustained or transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bae et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cleland et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ikeda and Wright, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Roska and Werblin, 2001</xref>). Cone photoreceptors respond to changes in light intensity with graded potentials that have both a transient and sustained component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Angueyra and Rieke, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cangiano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Szikra et al., 2014</xref>). Both kinetic components of the cone response are maintained in the firing rates of sustained cells, which track the prevailing contrast. However, only the initial component of the cone response is preserved in the spiking response of transient cells, which therefore respond primarily to changes in contrast. Where and how these differences originate is not clear. Here, we show that the distinct kinetics of responses of ON-sustained alpha and ON-transient alpha RGCs (1) persist for stimuli that elicit near-identical responses among the relevant bipolar cells, (2) do not depend on amacrine cell-mediated inhibition and, (3) are correlated with anatomical differences in output synapses of bipolar cell subtypes that are presynaptic to these RGCs. Together, these findings indicate that bipolar cell synapses are an important point of divergence in kinetically distinct visual pathways.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We focused on two ON RGC cell types, ON-transient alpha (ON-T) and ON-sustained alpha (ON-S) RGCs, that could be readily identified in a flat-mount preparation of the isolated mouse retina (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) by their characteristic spiking response to a step increment in light intensity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bae et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Goetz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Krieger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kuo et al., 2016</xref>). Based on their light response, dendritic field size and stratification pattern in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) (see below; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>), the ON-T RGCs we studied here likely correspond to the 6sw RGC type of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bae et al.

<p>We characterized the temporal spiking response properties of ON-T and ON-S RGCs by using an extracellular cell-attached patch electrode to measure action potential firing from either cell type while presenting a spatially uniform, randomly fluctuating light stimulus (Gaussian noise) that allowed us to efficiently probe a variety of stimulus contrasts and temporal frequencies. These and all subsequent physiological recordings were conducted using a photopic mean background light level (∼3300 R*/rod/s; ∼2000 P*/Scone/s) to suppress rod photoreceptor responses and therefore focus on cone-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Grimes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ke et al., 2014</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> shows the spiking response of example ON-T and ON-S RGCs when we presented multiple repetitions of the same random stimulus contrast sequence; these RGC types clearly responded differently to temporally modulated light input. In particular, noise-evoked ON-T RGC spike responses were comprised primarily of large amplitude, less frequent spike bursts whereas ON-S RGC responses consisted of a more even distribution of small to large amplitude events (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1A</xref>).</p>
<p>We summarized the response of each ON-T and ON-S RGC by computing the average stimulus preceding each recorded spike (the spike-triggered average or STA stimulus) when presenting a non-repeated Gaussian noise stimulus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chichilnisky, 2001</xref>) and we quantified response kinetics from these STA waveforms by measuring the time of zero-crossing (between trough and peak) as well as the ratio of amplitudes of the trough and peak (biphasic index). ON-T RGC STAs were significantly more biphasic (biphasic index = 0.63 ± 0.07; mean ± S.D.; n = 15) than those measured for ON-S RGCs (biphasic index = 0.43 ± 0.11; mean ± S.D.; n = 13) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, right), consistent with their more transient response kinetics that are apparent with step stimuli (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). ON-T RGC responses were also slightly delayed (zero-cross time = - 0.080 ± 0.0063 sec; mean ± S.D.; n = 15) relative to those of ON-S RGCs (zero-cross time = −0.072 ± 0.0052 sec; mean ± S.D.; n = 13) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, bottom and 1E, left). We used the STA to quantify spiking behavior because it provides a convenient model of RGC temporal response properties. However, it should be noted that the STA alone does not capture all differences between the RGC spike responses – e.g. the discreteness of the ON-T responses in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Bipolar cell to RGC synapses are an important site of signal diversification in ON pathways</title>
<p>A variety of mechanisms could potentially contribute to the distinct temporal response characteristics of ON-T versus ON-S RGCs, including differences in excitatory and/or inhibitory input conveyed by presynaptic circuits. Parallel visual channels are initially established by the divergence of cone signals to different cone bipolar cell subtypes, which have axons that terminate at distinct depths within the IPL and can correspondingly contact distinct RGC types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Euler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wässle et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore sought to understand to what extent kinetic differences in bipolar cell-mediated excitatory synaptic input could account for transient versus sustained responses in these RGCs.</p>
<p>To do this, we used somatic whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings to measure excitatory synaptic currents from both RGC types while stimulating the retina with the same spatially uniform Gaussian noise stimulus we used when measuring RGC spike output (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We used these measurements to construct linear-nonlinear (LN) models comprised of a linear temporal filter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>) and a time-invariant (static) nonlinearity (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>) that provide a simple estimate of the transformation between visual input and excitatory synaptic input to each RGC type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kim and Rieke, 2001</xref>). LN models for each RGC type accurately predicted measured responses to noise stimuli that were not used to construct the models, although LN models of ON-S RGC responses performed better than those for ON-T RGCs (correlation coefficient between average response to repeated noise stimulus and model prediction: 0.61 ± 0.057 (ON-S, n = 9) and 0.50 ± 0.13 (ON-T, n =11), mean ± S.D.; p = 0.028 Wilcoxan rank-sum test). This may in part be because ON-T stimulus-evoked excitatory currents were biased towards large amplitude events compared to those of ON-S RGCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>), similar to the distinct amplitude distributions of spike events in these cell types noted above (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). The linear filter captures the kinetics of the RGC response and is analogous to the time-reversed STA derived from spike responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chichilnisky, 2001</xref>). As with the STAs in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, excitatory linear filters were slower and more biphasic in ON-T (zero-cross time = 0.10 ± 0.013 s; biphasic ind. = 0.45 ± 0.090; mean ± S.D.; n = 13) compared to ON-S RGCs (zero-cross time = 0.083 ± 0.0074 s; biphasic ind. = 0.31 ± 0.10; mean ± S.D.; n = 15) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). This latter difference is consistent with more transient light-evoked excitatory synaptic input to ON-T RGCs. Indeed, light step-evoked excitatory currents to ON-T RGCs decayed rapidly to baseline levels within a few hundred milliseconds, even in the continued presence of light input, whereas excitatory inputs to ON-S RGCs had a sustained component that persisted for the duration of the light step (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-E</xref>).</p>

<p>These results show that transient versus sustained kinetics are already present in the excitatory pathways that provide input to ON-T and ON-S RGCs. These findings do not rule out additional contributions to the distinct spiking behavior of these RGC types from amacrine cell-mediated inhibitory synaptic input to the RGCs or from different intrinsic spiking properties. However, the clear differences we observed in excitatory synaptic input between ON-T and ON-S RGCs indicates that bipolar cell pathways have a central role in establishing transient versus sustained kinetics.</p>

<title>ON-T and ON-S RGCs receive input from distinct bipolar types</title>
<p>In general, retinal circuits dedicated to transient versus sustained signaling are located at the center and borders of the IPL, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bae et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Franke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Roska and Werblin, 2001</xref>). We compared stratification patterns of ON-T and ON-S RGCs in a subset of whole-cell recordings by filling cells with a fluorescent dye and imaging the dendrites of physiologically-characterized RGCs using two-photon microscopy. We assessed IPL depth in live tissue by using retinas from a transgenic mouse line in which type 5 bipolar cells strongly express EGFP (<italic>Gjd2-EGFP</italic> mice). These EGFP+ bipolar cells have axons that occupy a narrow band just above and overlapping with the dendrites of ON starburst amacrine cells (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>) and express calcium binding protein 5 (CaBP5) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B-D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ghosh et al., 2004</xref>). Based on the regular spacing of their somas, these cells likely correspond to one of the three subtypes of type 5 bipolar cells previously identified in mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Greene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Rodieck, 1991</xref>) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3E-F</xref>). Imaging of RGCs together with EGFP+ axon terminals in <italic>Gjd2-EGFP</italic> mice revealed that ON-T and ON-S RGC dendrites occupy distinct, mostly non-overlapping regions of the IPL (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
<p>The distinct IPL stratification of ON-T and ON-S RGCs indicates they receive input from different bipolar cell populations. A recent connectomic analysis that used a published electron microscopy data set from mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ding et al., 2016</xref>) found that type 6 and type 7 bipolar cells account for ∼50% and 46% of the excitatory synapses formed upon ON-S RGC dendrites, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sabbah et al., 2018</xref>). However, the bipolar cell subtype(s) presynaptic to ON-T RGCs have not previously been identified. Our observation that ON-T RGC dendrites occupy a narrow band in the IPL that very closely matches the stratification pattern of EGFP+ type 5 bipolar cell axons in <italic>Gjd2-EGFP</italic> mice (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>) suggests that these bipolar cells likely provide a substantial fraction of the excitatory input to ON-T RGCs. To test this possibility, we transfected retinas from <italic>Gjd2-EGFP</italic> mice with a plasmid encoding PSD-95 fused to the red fluorescent reporter mCherry to label postsynaptic sites of excitatory input (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). We quantified the fraction of putative synapses, defined as sites with overlapping PSD-95 and EGFP fluorescent signals, that arose from <italic>Gjd2-EGFP+</italic> axon terminals using confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>). From this analysis, we concluded that the labeled type 5 bipolar cells in <italic>Gjd2-EGFP</italic> mice provide ∼40% of the ribbon synaptic input to ON-T RGCs (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5D</xref>).</p>
<p>We next performed correlative fluorescence imaging and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM) to identify which type 5 bipolar subtype is labeled in Gjd2-EGFP mice and to further characterize what other bipolar cell types provide the remaining input to ON-T RGCs. We first used 2P microscopy to image the dendritic morphology of two dye-filled ON-T RGCs that were identified from their light-evoked spike responses in flat-mounted retina from <italic>Gjd2-EGFP</italic> transgenic mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). After 2P imaging, we fixed the retina and used the near infrared branding (NIRB) technique to create fiducial marks in the tissue around the dye-filled ON-T RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bishop et al., 2011</xref>). After acquiring the SBFSEM volume, we located the somas of the two ON-T RGCs using these fiducial marks and reconstructed the dendritic arbors of both cells (e.g. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The dendritic morphologies from our EM reconstruction matched those from the light microscopy images. This suggests that we successfully identified the two ON-T RGCs recorded physiologically in our EM volume. We chose the two longest dendritic arbors from the RGC soma to the dendritic tip and identified all the synapses from bipolar cells along these dendrites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). We then reconstructed all the presynaptic bipolar cells and classified them according to their axon morphology and stratification (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Careful examination of axonal tiling among type 5i, 5o and 5t subtypes provided additional confirmation of the classification of these type 5 bipolar cells (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Greene et al., 2016</xref>).

<p>Results from the SBFSEM reconstructions agreed closely with those from the light microscopy approach described above. Type 5i bipolar cell axon terminals provided the largest fraction of synapses onto the two ON-T RGCs within our SBFSEM volume (∼30-35%). Other inputs arose from type 5o (∼10%), type 5t (∼5-15%), XBC (∼15-30%), and, somewhat surprisingly given the differences in stratification, from type 6 (∼20%) bipolar cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). We confirmed this connectivity pattern by additionally analyzing bipolar cell synaptic inputs to a putative ON-T RGC (RGC7089) in the same publicly available SBFSEM volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ding et al., 2016</xref>) that was used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sabbah et al., (2018)</xref> to map inputs to ON-S RGCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>

<title>Bipolar cell light responses differ minimally across types</title>
<p>Are transient versus sustained excitatory inputs inherited from the response properties of the different bipolar cells presynaptic to ON-T and ON-S RGCs? Or is the distinct excitatory synaptic input these RGCs receive primarily due to differences at the bipolar cell to RGC synapse? To answer these questions, we compared the light-driven response properties of the bipolar cell subtypes that comprise most of the excitatory input to ON-T or ON-S RGCs. We made targeted electrophysiological recordings from type 5i, type 6 and type 7 bipolar cells in retinal slices from three transgenic mouse lines in which these different bipolar cell subtypes express fluorescent proteins (see Methods). In these experiments, we used somatic whole-cell perforated-patch recordings to limit perturbation of the G-protein signaling cascade that mediates ON bipolar cell light responses.</p>
<p>Somatic resting membrane potentials did not differ significantly among these bipolar cell types (mean ± S.D. V<sub>rest</sub>: −38 ± 6.3 mV in type 5i (n= 11); −33.7 ± 6.3 mV in type 6 (n= 7); - 36.5 ± 4.7 mV in type 7 (n=6); Kruskal-Wallis test, p= 0.35). We characterized light responses using the same spatially uniform Gaussian noise stimulus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) and linear-nonlinear model analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>) as in RGC recordings to facilitate direct comparison of results from bipolar cells and RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kim and Rieke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rieke, 2001</xref>). LN models of bipolar cell responses accurately predicted responses to noise stimuli (correlation coefficient between average response to repeated noise stimulus and LN model prediction = 0.75 ± 0.15 for n = 18 bipolar cells (n = 13 type 5; n = 3 type 6; n = 2 type 7)). Unlike for ON-T and ON-S RGCs, temporal characteristics of type 5i, type 6 and type 7 bipolar cell linear filters were indistinguishable from each other under our recording conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B-D</xref>). Although there was some variability in the temporal response properties across the population of bipolar cells we recorded, these differences were not associated with morphologically and molecularly defined bipolar cell types. Rather, we observed variability in response kinetics within each bipolar cell subtype and temporal responses thus overlapped substantially across different type 5i, type 6 and type 7 bipolar cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>).</p>

<p>Responses to light steps measured in a subset of type 5i and type 6 bipolar cell recordings confirmed our conclusion from Gaussian noise stimuli that different bipolar cell types exhibit nearly identical light response kinetics under our recording conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-F</xref>). Unlike the clear differences in light step-evoked excitatory currents we measured in ON-T and ON-S RGCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-E</xref>), type 5i and type 6 bipolar cells both had sustained responses to light steps. These findings indicate that mechanisms upstream of the generation of the cone bipolar cell voltage response, such as synaptic transmission from cones to cone bipolar cells and intrinsic response properties of the cone bipolar cells, cannot explain the kinetically distinct responses in parallel ON channels mediated by type 5i, type 6 or type 7 bipolar cells.</p>

<title>Presynaptic inhibition does not establish kinetic differences in bipolar cell-mediated excitation</title>
<p>Bipolar cells participate in diverse inhibitory circuits with amacrine cells, which are comprised of &gt;40 morphologically and functionally distinct cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Diamond, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</xref>). Recent work suggests that amacrine cell-mediated presynaptic inhibition is critical to bipolar cell subtype-specific patterns of light-evoked glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Franke et al., 2017</xref>). Our bipolar cell voltage recordings, which should reflect a combination of light-evoked excitatory and inhibitory input, argue against the involvement of presynaptic inhibition in generating differential bipolar cell synaptic output between type 5i, type 6 and type 7 bipolar cells. However, the slicing procedure we used to prepare tissue for bipolar cell recordings may damage some inhibitory connections, especially long-range amacrine cell inputs. Distance-dependent attenuation of voltage signals between bipolar cell axon terminals and the somatic recording site could also limit our ability to accurately measure the influence of presynaptic inhibition in these recordings. We therefore performed additional anatomical and pharmacological experiments to investigate a possible role for presynaptic inhibition in generating kinetically distinct excitation to ON-T and ON-S RGCs.</p>
<p>Many bipolar cell output synapses are organized into a “dyad” arrangement in which a bipolar cell ribbon synapse releases glutamate onto the processes of two different postsynaptic cells. At dyads, bipolar cell output synapses can be presynaptic to the processes of two amacrine cells, two RGCs, or an amacrine cell and a RGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cohen and Sterling, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dowling and Boycott, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">McGuire et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yu et al., 2023</xref>). Dyad synapses comprised of an amacrine cell and a RGC may shape bipolar cell glutamate release dynamics onto the RGC partner because glutamatergic excitation of the postsynaptic amacrine cell can elicit release of inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA or glycine) from the amacrine cell processes that feed back onto the bipolar cell axon terminal. This form of inhibitory feedback control of bipolar cell output, termed reciprocal inhibition, could potentially contribute to differences in glutamate release onto ON-T and ON-S RGCs.</p>
<p>We analyzed bipolar cell dyads with postsynaptic amacrine cell processes and either ON-T or ON-S RGC dendrites in SBFSEM volumes to examine whether reciprocal inhibition is likely to generate more transient glutamate release onto ON-T RGCs. We defined putative reciprocal synapses as bipolar cell/amacrine cell/RGC dyads in which we observed clustered vesicles within the amacrine cell process that were within close proximity of the bipolar cell ribbon synapse (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Our ultrastructural analysis revealed that the prevalence of reciprocal synapses was similar at dyad synapses with postsynaptic ON-T versus ON-S RGCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-B</xref>). This finding is not consistent with an important role for feedback/reciprocal inhibition in generating differential bipolar cell output onto the different RGC types.</p>

<p>We also performed pharmacological experiments to further examine what role, if any, inhibition may have in establishing transient glutamate release onto ON-T RGC dendrites. We used ACSF in place of Ames solution for the dissection and maintenance of tissue for these experiments. ACSF is often used in retina experiments, including the glutamate release measurements describe below, and we wanted to check that our results generalized across conditions. Light step-evoked currents in both ON-T and ON-S RGCs were more sustained than responses measured using Ames’ solution (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8A-B</xref>). Nonetheless, the relative differences between RGC types appear to be maintained across different experimental conditions.</p>
<p>Blockade of GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors via bath co-application of SR95531 and TPMPA enhanced both the initial transient component and the sustained component of light step-evoked excitatory synaptic currents in ON-T RGCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). The strong enhancement of the initial phase of the response we observed is consistent with prior work showing that GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor-mediated inhibition limits multivesicular release from bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sagdullaev et al., 2006</xref>). On average, block of GABA receptors did not significantly change in the ratio of sustained versus transient components of excitatory inputs to ON-T RGCs compared to control conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). If anything, these drugs tended to make excitatory currents more transient, which is the opposite effect expected if presynaptic GABA receptors contribute to generating transient responses in these cells. Thus, GABAergic inhibition appears to control response gain but not kinetics of bipolar cell synaptic output to ON-T RGCs. Similarly, we found that glycinergic inhibition is not likely to contribute importantly to more transient glutamate release from bipolar cells presynaptic to ON-T RGCs; bath application of the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine did not significantly alter the kinetics of light step-evoked excitatory currents in these cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E-F</xref>). Taken together with our ultrastructural analysis, these results show that amacrine cell-mediated inhibition of bipolar cell axon terminals does not contribute to kinetic differences in excitatory synaptic input to ON-T and ON-S RGCs.</p>

<title>Bipolar cell glutamate release differs across types</title>
<p>Taken together, the bipolar cell and RGC recordings in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> indicate that bipolar cell synapses have a key role in the separation of visual signals into transient or sustained channels within ON pathways in the retina. Presynaptic and/or postsynaptic mechanisms could contribute to the distinct kinetics of bipolar cell-mediated excitatory input to ON-T and ON-S RGCs. To investigate whether presynaptic differences in glutamate release from bipolar cell axon terminals shape RGC response kinetics, we expressed the fluorescent glutamate reporter iGluSnFR on the dendrites of ON-T and ON-S RGCs. Using two-photon glutamate sensor imaging, we found that light-evoked glutamate signals had significantly faster kinetics at ON-T RGC dendrites (steady-state amplitude as % of peak amplitude = 21 ± 13; mean ± S.D.; n = 224 ROIs) compared to those associated with ON-S RGC dendrites (steady-state amp. (% of peak amp.) = 44 ± 12; mean ± S.D.; n = 307 ROIs) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). These results show that differences in glutamate release from presynaptic bipolar cells contribute to transient versus sustained ON RGC responses.

<p>Although whole-cell excitatory currents in ON-T and ON-S RGCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>) and iGluSnFR signals measured from ON-T and ON-S RGC dendrites (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) both exhibited clear kinetic differences between the RGC types, there were quantitative differences in the response to light steps between the different measurement approaches. As described above, these differences appear to arise from differences in the external solution (Ames vs ACSF). The iGluSnFR experiments used an ACSF solution, like the patch-clamp experiments in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">S8</xref>. Both iGluSnFR responses and excitatory synaptic inputs measured in ACSF showed a larger sustained component of the step response at both ON-T and ON-S dendrites compared to currents measured in Ames (compare <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-E</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8A-B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-C</xref>). This observation highlights the importance of comparing responses between different RGC types, as well as between RGCs and bipolar cells, under identical recording conditions.</p>
<p>Importantly, the kinetics of glutamate release measured using iGluSnFR are much more similar to the excitatory synaptic inputs to ON-T and ON-S RGCs than they are to the relevant bipolar voltage responses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). This indicates that the difference between the ON-T and ON-S responses originates at least in part in the conversion of bipolar voltage to glutamate release.</p>

<title>Ribbon size and vesicle replenishment</title>
<p>Prior work has shown that bipolar cells can exhibit profound short-term depression of glutamate release due to use-dependent depletion of the readily-releasable pool of synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Burrone and Lagnado, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Singer and Diamond, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">von Gersdorff and Matthews, 1997</xref>). Strong vesicle depletion at the cone bipolar cell synapses onto ON-T RGCs could generate more transient responses in these cells compared to ON-S RGCs. To examine this possibility, we used a paired flash stimulus paradigm, in which two brief light flashes separated by varying time intervals were presented while measuring excitatory synaptic currents in ON-T or ON-S RGCs. As in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, we used Ames’ medium for tissue preparation and maintenance in these experiments.</p>
<p>Flash-evoked excitatory synaptic currents were suppressed in both RGC types at short inter-flash intervals, consistent with incomplete recovery from vesicle depletion at the time of the second flash (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref> top/middle, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). However, the extent of suppression was much stronger for currents measured in ON-T RGCs compared to ON-S RGCs. We quantified the extent of suppression using a paired flash ratio, which was calculated as the peak amplitude of the response to the second flash divided by the peak amplitude of the response to the first flash. At the shortest interval we tested (50 ms), the response to a second flash was almost completely suppressed in ON-T RGCs (paired flash ratio = 0.04 ± 0.01; mean ± SEM) whereas the response to a second flash in ON-S was suppressed considerably less (paired flash ratio = 0.29 ± 0.04). To rule out the possibility that a reduction in bipolar cell voltage response to the second flash could account for the strong paired flash suppression of excitatory input to RGCs, we also measured type 5i bipolar cell responses to the paired flash stimuli. The amplitude of flash-evoked voltage responses in type 5i bipolar cells was unchanged by a preceding flash at all time intervals (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref> bottom, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">C</xref>), which argues that paired flash suppression arises at the bipolar cell synaptic terminal. These results are consistent with the idea that differences in the extent of stimulus-evoked vesicle pool depletion in bipolar cells could underlie transient versus sustained excitatory input to ON-T and ON-S RGCs.</p>

<p>We found that ribbon size of several ON bipolar cell types is strongly correlated with the total number of vesicles that are in close contact with the synaptic ribbon across different bipolar cell types (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E-F</xref>). Ribbon-associated vesicles are thought to correspond to the releasable pool of vesicles, comprised of both a readily-releasable pool that are docked at the presynaptic active zone as well as a reserve pool of vesicles that are bound to the ribbon at more distal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lagnado and Schmitz, 2015</xref>). These two vesicle pools exhibit distinct release kinetics, with the readily-releasable pool corresponding to the fastest phase of glutamate release and the reserve pool contributing to slower glutamate release that occurs with prolonged stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mennerick and Matthews, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Neves and Lagnado, 1999</xref>). Our observations that the average excitatory synaptic input to ON-T RGCs is smaller and that most excitatory input to ON-T cells originates from bipolar synapses with fewer ribbon-associated vesicles are consistent with a role for vesicle depletion in establishing transient glutamate release onto these RGCs. The larger pool of ribbon-associated vesicles in type 6 bipolar cell terminals, which comprise ∼ 55% of the synaptic input to ON-S RGCs, may support sustained synaptic transmission onto these RGCs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we sought to understand how kinetically distinct visual pathways are established in the retina by directly comparing the visual response properties of transient and sustained ON RGCs with their presynaptic bipolar cells. Our results show that bipolar cell synapses have a key role in establishing different temporal channels in ON circuits of the retina. Further, amacrine cell-mediated presynaptic inhibition does not appear to account for transient versus sustained bipolar cell synaptic output. Rather, bipolar cell subtype-specific differences in synaptic release properties likely generate kinetically distinct output to postsynaptic targets. Our anatomical analysis suggests that these differences may at least in part be due to differences in synaptic vesicle pool size.</p>
<p>A key aspect of our work is that we measured RGC and bipolar cell responses using identical stimuli and under the same experimental recording conditions. To our knowledge, a direct comparison of RGC responses with those of their presynaptic bipolar cells has not previously been reported. The importance of measuring RGC and bipolar cell responses under the same conditions is highlighted by our observation that excitatory synaptic currents measured in ON alpha RGCs exhibited quantitatively different kinetics, although relative differences between types were preserved, when measurements were made from retinas maintained in ACSF versus Ames’ bath solution (compare <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> (Ames’) and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">S8</xref> (ACSF)).</p>
<p>We found that the bipolar cell subtypes that provide the major input to ON-T (type 5i) or ON-S RGCs (types 6 and 7) had indistinguishable light-evoked voltage responses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). This was not entirely surprising given that most or all ON cone bipolar cell subtypes are indirectly coupled to other nearby ON cone bipolar cells via electrical synapses between bipolar cell axon terminals and the distal processes of AII amacrine cells. These electrical synapses form the basis for the primary rod pathway that mediates vision under dim light conditions, but lateral signals can also flow among neighboring bipolar cells under conditions where cone signaling dominates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Demb and Singer, 2012</xref>). Indeed, a substantial fraction (∼30-50%) of light-evoked responses in the bipolar cell types we investigated here can be attributed to lateral signals that arrive via electrical synapses at photopic light levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kuo et al., 2016</xref>). Each AII amacrine cell is electrically coupled to multiple ON cone bipolar subtypes as well as to other AII amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Marc et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tsukamoto and Omi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Veruki and Hartveit, 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">2002b</xref>). Different ON cone bipolar cell subtypes may also be directly coupled via gap junctions to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sigulinsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tsukamoto and Omi, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Direct or indirect (via AII) coupling may limit the extent to which different bipolar cells can generate subtype-specific voltage responses. However, our findings differ from a previous study that found some differences among mouse ON cone bipolar cell subtypes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ichinose et al., (2014)</xref> reported that a subset of type 5 bipolar cells, which the authors termed type 5f, and type 7 bipolar cells had more transient responses than type 6 bipolar cells. Methodological differences may account for the discrepancy between our results and the previous work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ichinose et al., (2014)</xref>. For example, the previous study measured bipolar cell responses using whole-cell recordings and included inhibitory receptor antagonists in their experimental solutions whereas we used gramicidin perforated-patch recordings and left inhibitory signaling intact.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reasons for the different findings, our observation that bipolar cell subtypes exhibited similar responses under the same experimental conditions for which we observed obvious differences among postsynaptic RGCs argues that mechanisms upstream of bipolar cell glutamate release (e.g. cone to bipolar cell synapses or intrinsic voltage response properties of bipolar cells) are unlikely to have a major role in shaping RGC type-specific responses for the stimuli we used here.</p>
<p>A limitation of our work is that we did not record from every one of the bipolar cell subtypes that are presynaptic to ON-T RGCs. Instead, we measured responses from type 5i and type 6 bipolar cells, which together comprise &gt;∼50% of the synaptic input to ON-T RGC dendrites. It is possible that the other presynaptic bipolar cell types (type 5o, type 5t and XBC) may have more transient light-evoked voltage responses that could contribute to the transient excitation measured in ON-T RGCs. In fact, a previous study in mouse retina found that XBCs and a subset of type 5 bipolar cells express voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hellmer et al., 2016</xref>). These channels may enhance response transience or might even contribute to the generation of light-driven all-or-none spiking responses in these bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ichinose et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Puthussery et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Saszik and DeVries, 2012</xref>). Despite the possibility that intrinsic response properties of the bipolar cell types we did not record from could contribute to the generation of transient responses in ON-T RGCS, we consider it unlikely that this alone could not account for the kinetics of the excitatory synaptic currents we measured in these RGCs. Type 5i and type 6 bipolar cells have a significant sustained component of their light step-evoked voltage response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-F</xref>), whereas excitatory currents measured for the same stimulus and under the same conditions in ON-T RGCs had little to no sustained component (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-E</xref>). Even if the synapses formed by type 5o, type 5t and XBC provide a major fraction of the functional synaptic input to ON-T RGCs (despite our anatomical estimate that together they comprise &lt;50% of the total ribbon input), we would still expect to observe some sustained excitatory input if type 5i and type 6 bipolar cell synaptic output follows the voltage response of these cells. Thus, a marked transformation of the sustained bipolar cell membrane voltage response to a transient synaptic current must take place. Our measurements of extracellular glutamate at ON-T and ON-S dendrites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) suggest much of this transformation occurs at the level of bipolar cell glutamate release. It is interesting to note in this context that ON-T and ON-S RGCs both receive input from type 6 bipolar cells (comprising ∼20% and ∼50% of total synaptic input, respectively). Due to differences in dendrite stratification, type 6 bipolar cell synapses onto ON-T RGCs arise from a region of the axon that is located more proximal to the bipolar cell soma than the synapses formed onto ON-S RGCs, which are found within the distal axon lobules. However, we did not observe any differences in ribbon size at distal versus proximal locations in type 6 bipolar cell axons (not shown). Whether postsynaptic target-specific synapse function, as has previously been reported in salamander retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Asari and Meister, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">2012</xref>), contributes to signal diversification in circuits involving type 6 bipolar cells will require further investigation.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that amacrine cell-mediated inhibition at bipolar cell synaptic terminals is not necessary for generating transient glutamate release kinetics onto ON-T RGC dendrites. This is seemingly at odds with prior work that has noted an essential role for surround inhibition in establishing type-specific bipolar cell glutamate release dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Franke et al., 2017</xref>). However, we note that our analysis here focused only on whether presynaptic inhibition shapes the kinetics of excitatory inputs to ON-T RGCs. Our anatomical and pharmacological experiments together argue that presynaptic inhibition is not an important factor in the transformation from sustained bipolar cell voltage responses to transient excitatory synaptic currents in ON-T RGCs. This is not to say that amacrine cell-mediated inhibition does not have a role in generating subtype-specific response properties for other aspects of bipolar cell function. Indeed, inhibition does have in important role in establishing differential spatial tuning of excitatory inputs to the RGC types we studied; excitatory synaptic currents in ON-T RGCs exhibit stronger surround inhibition than ON-S RGCs, and this surround inhibition is reduced by bath application of GABA receptor antagonists (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8C</xref>).</p>
<p>We conclude that transient versus sustained excitatory inputs to ON-T and ON-S RGCs most likely arise from bipolar cell subtype-specific differences in synaptic release properties. Excitatory inputs to ON-T RGCs exhibited stronger paired flash depression than those to ON-S RGCs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), which indicates distinct vesicle cycling dynamics at the bipolar cell axon terminals presynaptic to the different RGC types. Our ultrastructural analysis suggests that bipolar subtype-dependent differences in ribbon-associated vesicle pool size could be a factor in establishing transient versus sustained glutamate release kinetics (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). This finding is consistent with the idea that sustained transmission from ribbon synapses is determined by the rate of replenishment of the readily-releasable pool of synaptic vesicles following exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lagnado and Schmitz, 2015</xref>). It is important to note, however, that type 7 bipolar cells (∼45% of excitatory input to ON-S RGCs) have small synaptic ribbons, yet iGluSnFR imaging of type 7 bipolar cell axon terminals found that these cells exhibit sustained glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Srivastava et al., 2022</xref>). Additional related mechanisms that we did not directly investigate here may contribute as well. For example, presynaptic resting potential has a strong effect on steady-state vesicle release and thus stimulus-evoked release dynamics. Exocytosis that occurs when bipolar cells rest at voltages near release threshold can lead to a depletion of readily-releasable vesicles that limits the amount of release that occurs upon further light-induced depolarizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Grimes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jarsky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Oesch and Diamond, 2011</xref>). Thus, an initial phasic component of release can be reduced by depolarized resting potentials whereas hyperpolarized potentials can facilitate greater occupancy of vesicles in the releasable pool, which can enhance response transience. Bipolar subtype-dependent differences in release threshold due to differential Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel expression/regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pangrsic et al., 2018</xref>) and/or coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity and vesicle release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Burrone et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Burrone and Lagnado, 2000</xref>) could also impact release dynamics. Several aspects of excitatory synaptic currents in the two RGC types we studied here are consistent with a situation in which bipolar cell inputs to ON-T RGCs have a higher threshold for glutamate release compared to those at ON-S RGCs; ON-T RGCs receive less spontaneous excitatory synaptic input than ON-S RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kuo et al., 2016</xref>) and stimulus-evoked EPSCs are slower, sparser and more biased towards larger amplitude events in ON-T RGCs compared to those in ON-S RGCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). Further investigation will be required to determine whether this is due to differences in axon terminal resting potential and/or other presynaptic factors. We did not find evidence for subtype-specific differences in resting membrane potential among type 5i, type 6 and type 7 bipolar cells, but our somatic voltage recordings likely have limited ability to resolve small voltage differences at the bipolar cell axon terminals.</p>
<p>Our results do not rule out additional roles for postsynaptic mechanisms in establishing transient versus sustained RGC spike output. For example, delayed amacrine cell-mediated inhibitory synaptic input to RGC dendrites could truncate spiking responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Nirenberg and Meister, 1997</xref>). RGC cell-intrinsic mechanisms, such as RGC subtype-specific differences in voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channel properties and/or expression pattern could also contribute to distinct response kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brombas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Werginz et al., 2020</xref>). While a combination of pre- and postsynaptic factors may ultimately act in concert to generate transient versus sustained RGC spike output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Warwick et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Werginz et al., 2020</xref>), our results establish a fundamental role for bipolar cell synapses in the segregation of visual input into kinetically distinct channels in ON pathways of the retina.</p>

<p>During recordings, retinal tissue was continuously perfused (∼6-8 mL/min) with oxygenated, bicarbonate-buffered Ames’ solution maintained at 30-34 °C.

Tissue from <italic>Grm6-tdTomato</italic> mice, in which a sparse subset of ON bipolar cell types (type 6, 7 and 8) express tdTomato was used to target recordings to type 6 bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>).

Type 5i bipolar cells were targeted in retinas from <italic>Gjd2-EGFP</italic> mice, which we found express EGFP selectively in these bipolar cells (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>) as well as less robustly in an uncharacterized amacrine cell type (not shown). For bipolar cell recordings, we minimized light exposure from the 2P laser by restricting scan regions to the inner retina, away from photoreceptors, and by keeping laser exposure brief (&lt;∼30 sec/scan region; &lt;2 mW post-objective laser power) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kuo et al., 2016</xref>). After identification of fluorescent cell bodies, we acquired recordings using infrared differential interference contrast microscopy. Bipolar recordings used an internal solution containing 123 mM K-aspartate, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM EGTA, 4 mM Mg-ATP, 0.5 mM Tris-GTP, 100 µM Alexa Fluor 594-hydrazide and 25-30 µg/mL gramicidin D (280 mOsm/L; pH 7.2). Pipettes (∼7-9 Ω tip resistance) were front-filled with gramicidin-free internal solution to facilitate formation of high resistance (&gt;1 GΩ) seals between patch pipettes and the cell membrane. After seal formation, series resistance (R<sub>s</sub>) was monitored in voltage-clamp mode by applying a 10 mV voltage step across the pipette tip. Experiments were initiated once R<sub>s</sub> declined to &lt;50 MΩ, which typically took 20-30 min. During recordings, we occasionally confirmed the integrity of the cell membrane under the recording electrode by monitoring Alexa Fluor 594 fluorescence using 2P excitation; if any dye was visible in the cell body, we abandoned the recording. No holding current was applied during current-clamp recordings from bipolar cells. At the conclusion of each bipolar cell recording, the membrane under the patch pipette was intentionally ruptured and fluorescence images of Alexa Fluor 594-filled cells were acquired using 2P microscopy to confirm bipolar cell subtype identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wässle et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

For LN model construction, the linear filter was calculated by computing the cross-correlation of the light stimulus with the measured voltage (bipolar cell) or current (RGC) response and dividing the result by the power spectrum of the stimulus. The static nonlinearity was constructed from a point-by-point comparison of the predicted filter output with the measured response and binning the result along the prediction axis. In almost all cases, the linear filter had a biphasic shape with initial and secondary lobes that are opposite polarity. A small number of bipolar cells had triphasic filters (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>). We quantified the kinetics of each STA or linear filter by measuring the time at which the STA/filter waveform crossed zero (“zero-cross time”; e.g. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, left) between the first and second lobes of the filter (e.g. between peak and trough of STA waveforms) and by calculating a biphasic index = |A| / |B|, where |B| is the absolute peak amplitude of the initial lobe of the filter and |A| is the amplitude of the peak amplitude of the secondary lobe (e.g. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, right). We quantified the kinetics of responses to light step stimuli by calculating the time between light step onset and the peak amplitude response (“time to peak”; e.g. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, left) and dividing the mean steady-state response (calculated from the last 100 ms light step increment) by the peak amplitude initial response at step onset (and multiplying by 100) (e.g. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, right).

Primary antibody used in the study were: goat anti-ChAT diluted 1:1000 Chemicon AB144P, mouse anti-CaBP5 diluted 1:1000 courtesy of Dr. Haeseleer, mouse anti-myc diluted at 1:1000, chicken anti-GFP diluted at 1:1000. Secondary antibody were donkey anti-goat IgG Dylight-568 diluted 1:1000, donkey anti-mouse Dylight-647 diluted 1:1000, donkey anti-mouse Dylight-405 diluted at 1:1000, donkey anti-chicken Alexa 488, the nuclear dye TOPRO3 (diluted 1:200, Thermo-Fisher).</p>

<title>Near-infrared branding (NIRB) and serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM)</title>
<p>Two neighboring ON-T RGCs were physiologically identified in <italic>Gjd2-EGFP</italic> mice. After identifying ON-T RGCs via their characteristic step-evoked extracellular spike response (e.g. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), they were filled with Alexa 488 or Alexa 555. Dendritic arbors and T5i-BC axonal arbors were imaged using a confocal microscope. The retina was then fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT). The retina was washed with 0.1M Na+ Cacodylate buffer for three times and flat-mounted with 0.1M Na+ Cacodylate buffer. To relocate the two RGCs under electron microscopy, we applied the near-infrared branding (NIRB) technique previously published to burn fiducial markers in the retina (Bishop et al.). After NIRBing, the retina tissue was unmounted and fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde overnight. The retina was processed for SBFSEM subsequently according to the protocol described previously (Glumi paper). Briefly, the tissue was initially treated with reduced osmium for 1 hour in the refrigerator. Subsequently, after washing with double-distilled H2O (ddH2O), the tissue was placed in a freshly prepared thiocarbohydrazide solution for 20 minutes at RT. Following another round of ddH2O rinsing, the tissue was incubated in 2% osmium tetroxide for 30 minutes at RT. After rinsing, the sample was incubated in 1% uranyl acetate at 4°C overnight. Post-wash, the tissue was stained with Walton’s lead aspartate for 30 minutes at 60°C. Following another wash, the retinal piece underwent dehydration using a graded alcohol series (20%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 100%, 100%), each step lasting 5 minutes, followed by two changes of 100% propylene oxide at RT for 10 minutes each. Finally, the tissue was embedded in Epon. The resulting block was then trimmed and mounted in the SBEM microscope (GATAN/Zeiss SIGMA, 3View), and image stacks were acquired at a voxel size of 5 x 5 x 50 nm.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the retina, parallel processing of cone photoreceptor output under bright light conditions dissects critical features of our visual environment and is fundamental to visual function. Cone photoreceptor signals are sampled by several types of bipolar cells and passed onto the ganglion cells. At the output of retinal processing, retinal ganglion cells send about 40 different codes of the visual scene to the brain for further processing. In this study, the authors focus on whether subtype-specific differences in the size of synaptic ribbon-associated vesicle pools of bipolar cells contribute to different retinal ganglion cell (RGC) responses. Specifically, inputs to ON alpha RGCs producing transient versus sustained kinetics (ON-S vs. ON-T, respectively) are compared. The authors first demonstrate that ON-S vs. ON-T RGCs are readily identifiable in a whole mount preparation and respond differently to both static and to a spatially uniform, randomly fluctuating (Gaussian noise) light stimulus. Liner-nonlinear (LN) models were used to estimate the transformation between visual input and excitatory synaptic input for each RGCs; these models suggested the presence of transient versus sustained kinetics already in the excitatory inputs to ON-T and ON-S RGCs. Indeed, the authors show that (glutamatergic) excitatory inputs to ON-S vs. ON-T RGCs are of distinct kinetics. The subtypes of bipolar cells providing input to ON-S are known (i.e., type 6 and 7), but the source of excitatory bipolar inputs to ON-T RGCs needed to be determined. In a tedious process, it is elegantly shown here that ON-T RGCs receive most of their excitatory inputs from type 5 and 6 bipolars. Interestingly, the temporal properties of light-evoked responses of type 5, 6, and 7 bipolars recorded from the somas were indistinguishable and rather sustained, suggesting that the origin of transient kinetics of excitatory inputs to ON-T RGCs suggested by the LN model might be found in the processing of visual signals at the bipolar cell axon terminal. Blocking GABA- or glycinergic inhibitory inputs did not alter the light-evoked excitatory input kinetics to ON-T and ON-S RGCs. Two-photon glutamate sensor imaging revealed significantly faster kinetics of light-evoked glutamate signals at ON-T versus ON-S RGCs. Detailed EM analysis of bipolar cell ribbon synapses onto ON-T and ON-S RGCs revealed fewer ribbon-associated vesicles at ON-T synapses, which is consistent with stronger paired-flash depression of light-evoked excitatory currents in ON-T RGCS versus ON-S RGCs. This study suggests that bipolar subtype-specific differences in the size of synaptic ribbon-associated vesicle pools contribute to transient versus sustained kinetics in RGCs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of multiple, state-of-the-art tools and approaches to address the kinetics of bipolar to ganglion cell synapse in an identified circuit.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>For the most part, the data in the paper support the conclusions, and the authors were careful to try to address questions in multiple ways. Two-photon glutamate sensor imaging experiment showing that blocking GABA- and glycinergic inhibition does not change the kinetics of light-evoked glutamate signals at ON-T RGCs would strengthen the conclusion that bipolar subtype-specific differences in the size of synaptic ribbon-associated vesicle pools contribute to transient versus sustained kinetics in RGCs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Goal of the study. The authors tried to pinpoint the origins of transient and sustained responses measured at retinal ganglion cells (rgcs), which is the output layer of the retina. Response characteristics of rgcs are used to group them into different types. The diversity of rgc types represents the ability of the retina to transform visual inputs into distinct output channels. They find that the physical dimensions of bipolar cell's synaptic ribbons (specialized release sites/active zones) vary across the different types of cone on-bpcs, in ways that they argue could facilitate transient or sustained release. This diversity of release output is what they argue underlies the differences in on-rgcs response characteristics, and ultimately represents a mechanism for creating parallel cone-driven channels.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strengths of the study are the anatomical approaches employed and the use of the &quot;glutamate sniffer&quot; to assay synaptic glutamate levels. The outline of the study is elegant and reflects the strengths of the authors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness is that the ambitious outline is not matched with a complete set of results, and the set of physiological protocols is disjointed, not sufficient to bridge the systems-level question with the presynaptic release question.</p>
<p>Major comments on the results and suggestions.</p>
<p>The ribbon model of release has been explored for decades and needs to be further adapted to systems-level work. The study under consideration by Kuo et al. takes on this task. Unfortunately, the experimental design does not permit a level of control over presynaptic/bpc behavior that is comparable to earlier studies, nor do they manipulate release in ways that test the ribbon model (i.e., paired recordings or Ribeye-ko). Furthermore, the data needs additional evaluation, and the presentation and interpretations should draw on published biophysical and molecular studies.</p>
<p>To build a ribbon-centric context, consider recent literature that supports the assertion that ribbons play a role in forming AZ release sites and facilitating exocytosis. Reference Ribeye-ko studies. For example, ribbonless bpcs show an 80% reduction in release (Maxeiner et al EMBO J 2016), the ribbonless retina exhibits signaling deficits at the output layer (Okawa et al ...Rieke, ..Wong Nat Comm 2019), and ribbonless rods show an 80% reduction the readily releasable pool (RRP) of SVs (Grabner Moser, elife 2021). In addition, the authors could refer to whole-cell membrane capacitance studies on mammalian rods, cones, and bpcs, because the size of the RRP of SVs scales with the dimensions and numbers of ribbons (total ribbon footprint). For comparison, bipolars see the review by Wan and Heidelberger 2011. For a comparison of mammalian rods and cones, see, rods: Grabner and Moser (2021 eLife), Mueller.. Regus Leidig et al. (2019; J Neurosci) and cones Grabner ...DeVries (Nat Comm 2023). A comparison of cell types shows that the extent of release is (1) proportional to the total size of the ribbon footprint, and (2) less release is witnessed when ribbons are deleted (also see photo ablation studies by Snellman.... And Mehta..Zenisek, Nat Neurosci and Neuron).</p>
<p>Ribbon morphology may change in an activity-dependent manner. The rod ribbon AZ has been reported to lengthen in the dark (Dembla et al 2020), and deletion of the ribbon shortens the length of the AZ (defined by Cav1,4 or RIM2); in addition, the Ribeye-ko AZs fail to change in size with light and dark conditioning. Furthermore, EM studies on rod and cone AZs in light and dark argue that the number of SVs at the base of the ribbon increases in the dark, when PRs are depolarized (see Figure 10, Babai et al 2016 JNeurosci). Lastly, using goldfish Mb1 on-bipolars, Hull et al (2006, J Neurophysio) correlated an increase in release efficiency with an increase in ribbon numbers, which accompanied daylight. &gt;&gt; When release activity is high, ribbon AZ length increases (Dembla, rods), the number of docked SVs increases (Babai, rods cones), and the number of ribbons increases (Hull, diurnal Mb1s).</p>
<p>The results under review, Kuo et al., were attained with SBF-SEM, which has the benefit of addressing large-volume questions as required here, yet it achieves lower spatial resolution than what is attained with TEM tomography and FIB-EM. Ideally, the EM description would include SV size, and the density of ribbon-tethered SVs that are docked at the plasma membrane, because this is where the SVs fuse (additional non-ribbon release sites may also exist? Mehta ... Singer 2014 J Neurosci). Studies by Graydon et al 2011 and 2014 (both in J Neurosci), and Jean ... Moser et al 2018 (eLife) are good examples of quantitative estimates of SVs docking sites at ribbons. SBF-SEM does not allow for an assessment of SVs within 5 nm of the PM, but if the authors can identify the number of SVs that appear within the limit of resolution (10 to 15 nm) from the PM, then this data would be useful. Also, what dimension(s) of the large ribbons make them larger? Typically, ribbons are fixed in height (at least in the outer retina, 200 to 250 nm), but their length varies and the number ribbons per terminal varies. Is the larger ribbon size observed in type 6 bpcs do to longer ribbons, or taller ribbons? A longer ribbon likely has more docked SVs. An additional possibility is that more SVs are about the ribbon-PM footprint, either more densely packed and/or expanding laterally (see definitions in Jean....Moser, elife 2018).</p>
<p>The ribbon literature given above makes the argument that ribbons increase exocytotic output, and morphological studies suggest that release activity enhances 1) ribbon length (Dembla) and 2) the density of SVs near the PM (Babai). These findings could lead one to propose that type 6 bpcs (inputs to On-sustained) are more active than type 5i (feed into On-transient). Here Kuo et al. show that the bpcs have similar Vm (measured from the soma) in response to light stimulation. Does Vm predict release? Not entirely as the authors acknowledge, because: Cav channel properties, SV availability, and negative feedback are all downstream of bpc Vm. The only experiment performed to test downstream factors focused on negative feedback from amacrines. The data presented in Figures 5C-F led me to conclude the opposite of what the authors concluded. My impression is that the T-ON rgc exhibits strong disinhibition when GABA-blockers are applied (the initial phase is greatly increased in amplitude and broadened with the drug), which contrasts with the S-On rgc responses that show a change in the amplitude of the initial phase but not its width (taus would be nice). Here and in many places the authors refer to changes in release kinetics, without implementing a useful description of kinetics. For instance, take the cumulative current (charge) in Figure 5C and fit the control and drug traces to arrive at taus, and their respective amplitudes, and use these values to describe kinetic phases. One final point, the summary in Figure 5D has a p: 0.06, very close to the cutoff for significance, which begs for more than an n = 5. Given that previous studies have shown that bpc output is shaped by immediate msec GABA feedback, in ways that influence kinetic phases of release (..Mb1 bipolars, see Vigh et al 2005 Neuron), more attention to this matter is needed before the authors rule out feedback inhibition in favor of ribbon size. If by chance, type 5i bpcs are under uniquely strong feedback inhibition, then ribbon size may result from less activity, not less output resulting from smaller ribbons.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the behavior of Cav channels is important here. This is difficult to address with voltage clamps from the soma, especially in the Vm range relevant to this study. Given that it has previously been modeled that the rod bpc to AII pathway adapts to prolonged depolarization of rbcs through downregulating Cav channel-mediated Ca2+ influx (Grimes ....Rieke 2014 Neuron), it seems important for Kou et al to test if there is a difference in Cav regulation between type 6 and 5i bpcs. Ca2+ imaging with a GCaMP strategy (Baden....Lagnado Current Biology, 2011) or filling the presynapse with Ca dyes (see inner hair cells: Ozcete and Moser, EMBO J 2020) would allow for the correlation of [Ca]intra with GluSnf signals (both local readouts).</p>
<p>Stimulation protocol and presentation of Glutamate Sniffer data in Figure 6. In all of your figures where you state steady st as a % of pk amplitude, please indicate in the figure where you estimate steady state. Alternatively, if you take the cumulative dF/F signal, then you can fit the different kinetic phases. From the appearance of the data, the Sustained Glu signals look like square waves (Figure 6B ROI1-4), without a transient at onset, which is not predicted in your ribbon model that assumes different kinetic phases (1. depletion of docked SVs, and 2. refilling and repriming). The Transient responses (Figure 6B ROI5-8) are transient and more compatible with a depressing ribbon scheme. If you take the cumulative, for all of the On-S and compare it to all of the On-T responses, my guess is the cumulative dF/F will be 10 to 20 larger for the S-On. Would you conclude that bpc inputs to On-S (type 6) release 20-fold more SVs per 4 seconds on a per ribbon basis, and does the surface area of the type 6 bpcs account for this difference? From Figures 8B and D, the volume of the ribbon is ~2 fold greater for type 6 vs 5i, but the Surface Area (both faces of ribbon) is more relevant to your model that claims ribbon size is the pivotal factor. If making cumulative traces, and comparisons on an absolute scale is unfounded, then we need to know how to compare different observations. The classic ribbon models always have a conversion factor such as the capacitance of an SV or q size that is used to derive SV numbers from total dCm or Qcontent. See Kim ....et al von Gersdorff, 2023, Cell Reports. Why not use the Gaussian noise stimulus in Fig 6 as in Figure 1 and 2?</p>
<p>Figure 7. What is the recovery time for mammalian cones derived from ribbon-based models? There are estimates from membrane capacitance studies. Ground squirrel cones take 0.7 to 1 sec to recover the ultrafast, primed pool of SVs when probed with a paired-pulse protocol (Grabner ...DeVries 2016, Neuron). Their off-bpcs take anywhere from under 0.2 sec to a second to recover, which is a combination of many synaptic factors (Grabner ...DeVries Nat Comm 2023). Rod On bpcs take over a second (Singer Diamond 2006, reviewed Wan and Heidelberger 2011). In Figure 7B, the recovery time is ~150 ms for the responses measured at rgcs. This brief recovery time is incompatible with existing ribbon models of release. Whole-cell membrane capacitance measurements would be helpful here.</p>
<p>Experimental Suggestion: Add GABA blockers and see if type 5i bpc responds with more release (GluSniff) and prolonged [Ca2+] intra (GCaMP). Compare this to type 6 bpc behavior with GABA/gly blockers. This will rule in or out whether feedback inhibition is involved.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Different types of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) have different temporal properties - most prominently a distinction between sustained vs. transient responses to contrast. This has been well established in multiple species, including mice. In general, RGCs with dendrites that stratify close to the ganglion cell layer (GCL) are sustained; whereas those that stratify near the middle of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) are transient. This difference in RGC spiking responses aligns with similar differences in excitatory synaptic currents as well as with differences in glutamate release in the respective layers - shown previously and here, with a glutamate sensor (iGluSnFR) expressed in the RGCs of interest. Differences in glutamate release were not explained by differences in the distinct presynaptic bipolar cells' voltage responses, which were quite similar to one another. Rather, the difference in transient vs. sustained responses seems to emerge at the bipolar cell axon terminals in the form of glutamate release. This difference in the temporal pattern of glutamate release was correlated with differences in the size of synaptic ribbons (larger in the bipolar cells with more sustained responses), which also correlated with a greater number of vesicles in the vicinity of the larger ribbons.</p>
<p>The main conclusion of the study relates to a correlation (because it is difficult to manipulate ribbon size or vesicle density experimentally): the bipolar cells with increased ribbon size/vesicle number would have a greater possibility of sustained release, which would be reflected in the postsynaptic RGC synaptic currents and RGC firing rates. This model proposes a mechanism for temporal channels that is independent of synaptic inhibition. Indeed, some experiments in the paper suggest that inhibition cannot explain the transient nature of glutamate release onto one of the RGC types. Still, it is surprising that such a diverse set of inhibitory interneurons in the retina would not play some role in diversifying the temporal properties of RGC responses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study uses a systematic approach to evaluating temporal properties of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) spiking outputs, excitatory synaptic inputs, presynaptic voltage responses, and presynaptic glutamate release. The combination of these experiments demonstrates an important step in the conversion from voltage to glutamate release in shaping response dynamics in RGCs.</p>
<p>(2) The study uses a combination of electrophysiology, two-photon imaging, and scanning block-face EM to build a quantitative and coherent story about specific retinal circuits and their functional properties.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) There were some interesting aspects of the study that were not completely resolved, and resolving some of these issues may go beyond the current study. For example, it was interesting that different extracellular media (Ames medium vs. ACSF) generated different degrees of transient vs. sustained responses in RGCs, but it was unclear how these media might have impacted ion channels at different levels of the circuit that could explain the effects on temporal tuning.</p>
<p>(2) It was surprising that inhibition played such a small role in generating temporal tuning. At the same time, there were some gaps in the investigation of inhibition (e.g., IPSCs were not measured in either of the RGC types; pharmacology was used to investigate responses only in the transient RGCs).</p>
<p>(3) There could be additional discussion and references to the literature describing several topics, including: temporal dynamics of glutamate release at different levels of the IPL; previous evidence that release sites from a single presynaptic neuron can differ in their temporal properties depending on the postsynaptic target; previous investigations of the role of inhibition in temporal tuning within retinal circuitry.</p>
