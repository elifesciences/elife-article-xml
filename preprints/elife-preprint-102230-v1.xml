<title>Abstract</title><p>Orienting behaviors provide a continuous stream of information about an organism’s sensory experiences and plans. Thus, to study the links between sensation and action, it is useful to identify the neurons in the brain that control orienting behaviors. Here we describe descending neurons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain that predict and influence orientation (heading) during walking. We show that these cells have specialized functions: whereas one cell type predicts sustained low-gain steering, the other predicts transient high-gain steering. These latter cells integrate internally-directed steering signals from the head direction system with stimulus-directed steering signals from multimodal sensory pathways. The inputs to these cells are organized to produce “see-saw” steering commands, so that increasing output from one brain hemisphere is accompanied by decreasing output from the other hemisphere. Together, our results show that internal and external drives are integrated to produce descending motor commands with different timescales, for flexible and precise control of an organism’s orientation in space.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Orienting behaviors provide basic clues about an organism’s perceptions and memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Schöne, 2014</xref>). For example, animals will often orient readily toward novel or attractive stimuli, so orientation can provide information about perceived salience or valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Simion and Shimojo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sokolov, 1960</xref>). Animals also actively stabilize their orientation relative to the environment, and the dynamics of this behavior provide clues about mechanisms of sensorimotor integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Götz, 1972</xref>). Animals can estimate their orientation over time by keeping track of their rotational movements, providing a way to study mechanisms of working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Goodridge et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015</xref>). Finally, animals can orient toward a remembered target in the environment, and so orientation can provide insights into spatial learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Summerfield et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Ideally, we would like to study these behaviors by identifying the neurons in the brain that generate orienting movements. In principle, this would allow us to work backward from these neurons to understand the convergence of upstream orienting cues from sensory regions, as well as regions involved in higher cognition. Recent work has identified descending neurons in the mammalian brainstem that influence orienting during locomotion (“steering”): these cells are active when the animal is executing a locomotor turn, and their unilateral activation can drive turning during locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cregg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Usseglio et al., 2020</xref>). These brainstem descending neurons respond to perturbations of striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cregg et al., 2024</xref>), but we still do not fully understand how brain dynamics generate locomotor dynamics, in part because of the anatomical complexity of the mammalian brain, and the challenges involved in obtaining neurophysiological data with high temporal and spatial resolution.</p>
<p>Some of these experimental challenges are easier to overcome in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. In particular, the advent of large-scale <italic>Drosophila</italic> connectomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cheong et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dorkenwald et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Eckstein et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Phelps et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Schlegel et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>) has made it easier to identify descending neurons (DNs) that might be involved in specific behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Simpson, 2024</xref>). Moreover, it is possible to perform targeted <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiological recordings from specific cells in these connectomes, and to relate these recordings to ongoing locomotor behaviors or brain dynamics. Several recent studies have linked specific <italic>Drosophila</italic> DNs to escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lima and Miesenböck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">von Reyn et al., 2014</xref>), backward walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bidaye et al., 2014</xref>), grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Guo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>), flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Suver et al., 2016</xref>), and landing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ache et al., 2019</xref>). A recent imaging study also found that multiple DNs are active when a walking fly executes voluntary turns, but technical limitations prevented most of these DNs from being matched with cells in the connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aymanns et al., 2022</xref>). We therefore set out to identify DNs in the connectome with clear functional roles in steering.</p>
<p>Here we describe two DN types in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain that predict steering during walking. Using targeted <italic>in vivo</italic> single-cell electrophysiological recordings in walking flies, we find that one type (DNa02) predicts high-gain steering, while the other (DNa01) predicts low-gain steering. DNa02 is recruited first, on average, and its activity is more transient. DNa02 lies two synapses downstream from head direction neurons, and we demonstrate that these DNs are recruited during memory-directed steering that is guided by the head direction system. DNa02 also receives multimodal sensory input from reinforcement learning centers, and we show that this DN is recruited by multimodal sensory inputs with differing valence. Using dual recordings from both copies of DNa02, we show that the fly’s turning velocity is linearly related to the right-left difference in DNa02 activity; then, through analysis of large-scale connectome data, we show how the feedforward inputs to this cell from the head direction system and from sensory pathways suggests a “see-saw” model of steering control, where excitation of one DN copy is accompanied by inhibition of the contralateral copy. Together, our results show how a motor control problem (steering) can be re-framed as a problem of generating a specific pattern of brain activity via converging sensory and cognitive pathways.</p>

<title>Two descending neuron types that predict different features of steering</title>
<p>DNa01 and DNa02 project to all three leg neuromeres in the ventral nerve cord (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), where they form selective connections onto leg-control networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Braun et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cheong et al., 2023</xref>). These DNs are anatomically similar to cricket neurons that are active during turning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brodfuehrer and Hoy, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Staudacher and Schildberger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Zorović and Hedwig, 2011</xref>), and a calcium imaging study reported that DNa01 is asymmetrically active in the ventral nerve cord when flies are turning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, an optogenetic perturbation study reported that bilateral activation of DNa01 or DNa02 drives a global increase in walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cande et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these observations suggested a role in locomotor control, but the specific functions of these cells were unclear. In analyzing the ventral nerve cord connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cheong et al., 2023</xref>), we noticed that DNa02 makes more direct synaptic connections onto motor neurons, as compared to DNa01 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Moreover, very few of the postsynaptic cells targeted by these two DN types are shared in common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cheong et al., 2023</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). These connectome analyses suggested that, if both DNs are involved in locomotor control, their functions are likely distinct.</p>

</fig>
<p>To investigate this idea, we made genetically targeted whole-cell recordings from both DN types in flies walking on a spherical treadmill. We made single-cell recordings as well as dual recordings from these DNs, to understand their correlation with behavior, and with each other (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). To perform dual recordings, we used a combination of transgenes that targets both cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
<p>To begin, for both DN types, we computed the linear filters that describe the relationship between firing rate and behavioral dynamics. These filters tell us how behavior changes after a brief increase in firing rate – i.e., a firing rate “impulse”. To compute these filters, we cross-correlated firing rate with the fly’s rotational velocity, sideways velocity, or forward velocity. We then normalized each filter by the autocorrelation in the cell’s firing rate (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). These filters showed that DNa01 and DNa02 firing rate increases were typically followed by relatively large changes in rotational and sideways velocity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E,F</xref>). It should be noted that rotational and sideways velocity are themselves strongly correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">DeAngelis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Katsov et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). DNa01 and DNa02 firing rate increases were not consistently followed by large changes in forward velocity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1G</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>).</p>
<p>We also found several interesting functional differences between DNa01 and DNa02. First, steering filters (i.e., rotational and sideways velocity filters) were larger for DNa02 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E,F</xref>). This means that an impulse change in firing rate predicts a larger change in steering for this neuron. In other words, this result suggests that DNa02 operates with higher gain. This may be related to the fact that DNa02 makes more direct output synapses onto motor neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, we found that DNa02 steering filters were biphasic, whereas DNa01 steering filters were monophasic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E,F</xref>). A biphasic filter converts a sustained input into a transient output, while a monophasic filter converts a sustained input into a sustained output. This result suggests that DNa02 produces more transient changes in steering, as compared to DNa01. This may be related to the fact that DNa02 and DNa01 target largely non-overlapping populations of postsynaptic cells in the ventral nerve cord (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Finally, we found that steering filters for DNa02 were more accurately predictive of behavior – i.e., when we convolved each filter with the cell’s spike train, the DNa02 filters produced a better prediction of the fly’s subsequent steering, as compared to the DNa01 filters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). This might also be attributable to the fact that DNa02 makes more direct output synapses onto motor neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>These linear filters tell us how steering behavior changes (on average) after each DN impulse, but they do not tell us about the temporal pattern of firing rate changes in these DNs. To address this issue directly, we looked closely at the timing of each cell’s recruitment in our dual recordings, and found that spike rate fluctuations in DNa02 typically preceded the spike rate fluctuations in DNa02 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Moreover, DNa02 had more transient fluctuations, as compared to DNa01 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). Recall that, even if we normalize for the firing rate dynamics of each cell type, the behavioral impulse response is also more transient for DNa02 than for DNa01 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E,F</xref>). In other words, each DNa02 impulse predicts a relatively transient change in behavior, and <italic>also</italic> DNa02 impulses arrive in relatively transient packets; for both these reasons, DNa02 is associated with more transient steering events, as compared to DNa01.</p>

</fig>
<p>To make this explicit, we computed rotational velocity filters for each cell in our DNa01/DNa02 dual recordings, and we convolved each cell’s firing rate with its filter to obtain the rotational velocity prediction for each cell. We found that DNa02 generally predicted the large, transient fluctuations in rotational velocity, whereas DNa01 generally predicted the smaller, more sustained changes in rotational velocity in the same experiment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). This finding further supports the idea that increases in DNa02 firing rates are associated with transient, high-gain steering, whereas increases in DNa01 firing rates are associated with sustained, low-gain steering.</p>
<p>To complement these analyses of cellular and behavioral dynamics, we also looked at how the average firing rate of each cell related to the fly’s average rotational velocity, for a fixed neuron-behavior time lag. Specifically, we compared neural activity with behavior 150 ms later, to account for the average lag between neural activity and behavior (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>); this lag may reflect a biological delay and/or the inertia of the spherical treadmill. We observed that rotational velocity was a relatively steep function of DNa02 activity, but a comparatively shallower function of DNa01 activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-E</xref>). This analysis supports the conclusion that there is a higher-gain relationship between DNa02 activity and steering.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Right-left differences in descending neuron activity predict rotational velocity</title>
<p>Next, to determine how steering depends on DNa02 neurons on both sides of the brain, we made dual recordings from DNa02 on the right and left (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We found that rotational velocity was consistently related to the difference in right-left firing rates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). This relationship was essentially linear through its entire dynamic range, and was consistent across paired recordings (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). It was also consistent during backward walking, as well as forward walking (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). We obtained similar results in dual recordings from DNa01 neurons (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="024703v3_fig3.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>We also extended our linear filter analysis to our dual DNa02 recordings. Specifically, we computed each cell’s linear filter, and we then convolved each filter with the cell’s spike train to predict the fly’s rotational velocity. By adding the predictions from simultaneously recorded right-left pair, we found that we could accurately predict turns in both directions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D,E</xref>).</p>
<p>To summarize, these dual recordings demonstrate that steering is consistently predicted by right-left differences in DNa02 firing rate. This means that, in principle, turning could be driven by either ipsilateral excitation or contralateral inhibition. As we will see, the neural networks in the brain presynaptic to these DNs are organized so as to recruit both ipsilateral excitation and contralateral inhibition.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Steering toward internal goals</title>
<p>Having identified steering-related DNs, we proceeded to investigate the brain circuits that provide input to these DNs. Here we decided to focus on DNa02, as this cell’s activity is predictive of larger steering maneuvers. First, we asked whether DNa02 responds to changes in perceived head direction relative to an internal goal. Head direction neurons (EPG neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015</xref>) can influence steering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Giraldo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Green et al., 2019</xref>) via central complex neurons that compare head direction signals with internal goal signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Beetz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Martin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mussells Pires et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Shiozaki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Westeinde et al., 2024</xref>). The central complex itself contains no DNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hulse et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Namiki et al., 2018</xref>), but there are strong anatomical pathways from the central complex to DNa02 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hulse et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mussells Pires et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Rayshubskiy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Westeinde et al., 2024</xref>). This motivated our hypothesis that DNa02 participates in steering toward internal goals.</p>
<p>To investigate the functional coupling between the head direction system and steering system, we made whole-cell recordings from DNa02 while monitoring and manipulating EPG neurons. To track the dynamics of the head direction system in real time, we imaged GCaMP6f in the entire EPG ensemble. Meanwhile, we micro-stimulated central complex neurons called PEN1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Green et al., 2019</xref>) by expressing the ionotropic ATP receptor P2X<sub>2</sub> in PEN1 neurons under Gal4/UAS control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lima and Miesenböck, 2005</xref>) and puffing ATP onto their dendrites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). PEN1 neurons relay information about the fly’s angular velocity to EPG neurons, and so micro-stimulating PEN1 neurons causes the head direction system to register a fictive behavioral turn.</p>

</fig>
<p>As expected from previous work, we found that there is a single bump of activity in the EPG ensemble which rotates as the fly steers in darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>). The position of the EPG bump constitutes a working memory of the fly’s heading direction. Again consistent with previous work, we found that briefly micro-stimulating PEN1 neurons causes this bump to “jump” to a new location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Green et al., 2019</xref>). As a negative control, we confirmed that bump jumps rarely follow ATP injection when the Gal4 transgene is omitted (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). We only analyzed trials where the EPG bump was relatively stable prior to ATP injection, implying that fly is trying to steer toward an internal goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Green et al., 2019</xref>). During epochs of goal-directed steering, the EPG bump jump should create a mismatch (error) between the fly’s internal goal and its perceived head direction. Accordingly, we find that the fly typically executes a compensatory behavioral turn shortly after the EPG bump jump, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Green et al., 2019</xref>). This compensatory turn brought the EPG bump back to its initial location in 40% of trials, thereby re-orienting the fly toward its inferred internal goal. Notably, in trials where the ATP injection caused the bump to jump clockwise, the behavioral turn was typically rightward, which causes the bump to flow counter-clockwise (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C,D</xref>). Conversely, on trials where the injection caused the bump to jump counter-clockwise, the average behavioral turn was leftward, which causes the bump to flow clockwise (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C,D</xref>). Thus, the compensatory turn was in the correct direction to return the bump to its original location via the shortest path. This implies that the mechanism that triggers the compensatory turn is sensitive to the direction of the error (positive or negative). These results are consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Green et al., 2019</xref>) except that we observed a more variable delay between the bump jump and the compensatory turn.</p>
<p>Throughout each experiment, we performed a whole-cell recording from DNa02. Notably, we found that DNa02 cells often fired a burst of spikes just before the fly performed its compensatory behavioral turn to bring the EPG bump back to its initial location (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). To quantify this effect, we identified the time point in each trial where the bump’s return speed was maximal. We used this time point to align the data across trials to account for the fact that the bump’s return had different latencies on different trials (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C,E</xref>). Because we always recorded from DNa02 cells on the left, we focused on the trials where we expect a leftward behavioral turn – i.e., trials where the bump returned via a clockwise path. In these trials, we found that the bump jump was typically followed by increased DNa02 firing on the left, and then a leftward steering maneuver, and then a clockwise return of the bump (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Moreover, we found that DNa02 could predict much of the trial-to-trial variability in the magnitude of compensatory behavioral turns (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>).</p>
<p>Trials where the bump returned in the opposite direction (counter-clockwise) provide a negative control. In these trials, the fly’s behavioral turn was typically rightward rather than leftward (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E,H</xref>). Accordingly, we found no DNa02 firing rate increase on the left side (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). This shows that DNa02 is not activated bilaterally and thus nonspecifically. Rather, DNa02 is recruited specifically on the side that predicts the direction of the behavioral turn.</p>
<p>In summary, our results show that DNa02 activity can predict the magnitude and direction of steering maneuvers guided by the head direction system. This finding argues that the pathways from head direction system to DNa02 are functionally strong, and they are recruited at the appropriate time to mediate steering commands issuing from the central complex.</p>

<title>Stimulus-directed steering</title>
<p>Next, we asked whether DNa02 is functionally engaged in stimulus-directed steering, which we define as steering channelrhodopsin variant CsChrimson in olfactory receptor neurons under the control of an <italic>Orco-LexA</italic> transgene. We then stimulated the right or left antennae independently using two thin optical fibers. This fictive odor stimulus produced steering toward the stimulated antenna (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), consistent with previous studies showing that flies often turn toward a lateralized odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Borst and Heisenberg, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gaudry et al., 2013</xref>). We found that these lateralized stimuli also produced asymmetric responses in DNa02, with higher firing rates on the ipsilateral side (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). We also confirmed there was no neural or behavioral response when the <italic>LexA</italic> transgene was omitted (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>), as expected.</p>

<p>To generate an aversive stimulus, we expressed CsChrimson in the antennal thermoreceptor neurons that are excited by heat, under the control <italic>Gr28b.d-LexA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Frank et al., 2015</xref>). As before, we stimulated the right or left antenna independently. These fictive warm stimuli drove flies to steer away from the stimulated antenna (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). These stimuli again produced responses in DNa02, but now with higher firing rates on the side contralateral to the stimulus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Thus, DNa02 activity was higher on the side ipsilateral to the attractive stimulus, but contralateral to the aversive stimulus. In other words, DNa02 encoded the laterality of the stimulus-evoked action, not the laterality of the stimulus itself.</p>
<p>On average, DNa02 was activated about 150 ms before the stimulus-evoked turn (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Moreover, DNa02 could predict much of the trial-to-trial variability in the magnitude of stimulus-evoked turns (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that DNa02 participates in reorienting the body in response to a lateralized stimulus. We obtained similar results for DNa01 neurons (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>), supporting the idea that DNa01 and DNa02 often function together.</p>
<p>Although DNa02 hyperpolarized whenever the fly stopped walking (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A,B</xref>), it continued responding to lateralized odors even when the fly was stopped. Indeed, during immobility, the stimulus-evoked change in DNa02 firing rate was similar to what we observed during walking (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C,D</xref>). Thus, DNa02 contains information about latent steering drives, even in a quiescent behavioral state where these drives produce no measurable motor consequences.</p>

<title>Converging brain pathways onto DNa02</title>
<p>Our results thus far indicate that DNa02 integrates several different types of steering signals. Specifically, it receives internal goal-directed steering signals from the central complex, as well as stimulus-directed steering signals from the olfactory system and the thermosensory system. It also receives locomotor state signals that make the cell more depolarized when the fly is walking. These results motivated us to examine the full-brain connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dorkenwald et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lin et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>) for clues as to how these signals are integrated.</p>
<p>First, we identified DNa02 in the full brain FAFB dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dorkenwald et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Schlegel et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>); we then proofread all the presynaptic inputs to DNa02, while also matching each cell type with its equivalent in the hemibrain connectome data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). We contributed all this information (proofreading and cell type names) to the FlyWire community platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dorkenwald et al., 2022</xref>) as this study progressed. The identification of DNa01 is now reported in a comprehensive study of all DNs in the FAFB-FlyWire dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Stürner et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that the inputs to DNa02 are largely non-overlapping with those of DNa01 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). This provides an explanation for why DNa02 generally recruited before DNa01, and it also has a more transient pattern of activity. Both cell types receive substantial input from central brain intrinsic neurons; however, only DNa02 receives direct input from PFL3 cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). PFL3 cells compare head direction signals with internal goal signals, and they produce directional steering commands if there is a mismatch between these angular values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dan et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Goulard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hulse et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Matheson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mussells Pires et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Rayshubskiy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Westeinde et al., 2024</xref>). PFL3 neurons are therefore the likely origin of the turning signals we see in DNa02 when we chemogenetically inject an error signal into the head direction system (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="024703v3_fig7.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Notably, however, we found that PFL3 neurons also send many strong indirect projections to DNa02. Specifically, PFL3 neurons project to two cells (DNa03 and LAL010) that make strong excitatory ipsilateral connections onto DNa02 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). These indirect connections should amplify the influence of central complex steering signals. Moreover, PFL3 neurons also project to several cell types that are positioned to inhibit the contralateral copies of DNa02, DNa03, and LAL010 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Contralateral suppression should increase the right-left difference in DNa02 activity, thereby increasing rotational velocity. In short, central complex projections are wired to have opposite effects on the two copies of DNa02. This architecture suggests a “see-saw” model of steering (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>).</p>
<p>That said, some indirect connections onto DNa02 are actually bilaterally symmetric. For example, DNa03 and LAL010 both receive strong bilaterally symmetric projections from another excitatory central complex output cell type, PFL2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). PFL2 neurons are recruited when the fly is oriented away from its internal goal, and direct activation of PFL2 neurons increases the overall gain of steering commands, without specifying the direction of turning(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Westeinde et al., 2024</xref>). Moreover, both DNa03 and LAL010 also receive substantial bilateral input from a large inhibitory cell (VES041) whose direct activation suppresses steering in flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Ros et al., 2024</xref>); this pattern suggests that VES041 also suppresses steering during walking (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). Together, these results point to DNa03 and LAL010 as key nodes in the bidirectional control of steering gain.</p>
<p>Outside the central complex, there are many pathways for stimulus-directed steering. For example, there are multiple pathways connecting olfactory and thermosensory peripheral cells to DNa02. However, the shortest pathways involve the mushroom body output neuron MBON32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Li et al., 2020</xref>). We found that MBON32 projections onto DNa02 are also organized to produce see-saw steering: excitation onto one DN is generally accompanied by inhibition onto the other DN (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). Interestingly, MBON32 projections could drive turning toward an appetitive stimulus, as well as turning away from an aversive stimulus (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G,H</xref>). This idea derives from the fact there are generally two parallel pathways connecting any set of antennal lobe projection neurons to MBON32: a plastic excitatory pathway, and a fixed inhibitory pathway. In principle, depression of the excitatory pathway (via Kenyon Cells, or KCs) could therefore unmask inhibition. Depression of KC→MBON32 synapses should be driven by aversive stimuli, via the dopamine neuron PPL103 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hige et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Jacob and Waddell, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, a stimulus with appetitive associations, such as an appetitive odor, should produce excitation of MBON32, because the active KC→MBON synapses should be strong (not depressed); this would then drive ipsiversive turning. Conversely, a stimulus with aversive associations, such as aversive heat, should produce inhibition of MBON32, because the active KC→MBON synapses should be weak (depressed), which would drive contraversive turning.</p>
<p>Finally, connectome data shows that DNa02 receives abundant visual input. Some of this input comes from a large set of visual projection neurons, which project directly from the optic lobe to DNa02 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>) as well as DNa03 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Another major source of input comes from projection neurons in the anterior optic tubercle, downstream from LC10 cells. LC10 cells are small object motion detectors that mediate steering toward visual objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hindmarsh Sten et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ribeiro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Schretter et al., 2024</xref>). Some visual signals arrive via MBON32, which receives visual input in addition to olfactory and thermo/hygrosensory input (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, DNa02 is a site of integration for many steering control pathways. These pathways tend to be arranged for see-saw steering control: when one copy of DNa02 is excited, the other is inhibited. Many of these pathways involve parallel excitation and inhibition, which could provide a mechanism to specify steering direction based on excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. When one pathway is plastic, the change in E/I balance could provide a way to convert memory recall into a bidirectional behavioral readout.</p>

<title>Contributions of single descending neuron types to steering behavior</title>
<p>Finally, we asked whether individual DNs can make measurable contributions to steering behavior.

<p>In the flies with unilateral expression, we found that light evoked a small average steering bias in the ipsilateral direction – i.e., the direction of the ReaChR+ neuron (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). To determine if this steering bias was significant, we used control sibling flies with bilateral ReaChR expression in DNa02. Specifically, each fly with bilateral expression was randomly assigned a label (“right expression” or “left expression”). Using these flies, we then computed the average rotational velocity in the “ipsilateral” direction, just as we did for the flies with true unilateral expression. This simulation was repeated independently for 1000 bootstrap replicates (resampling with replacement) to obtain the 95% confidence interval of the mean, under the null hypothesis that there is only a random relationship between DNa02 expression and steering behavior. We found that the mean of the data (with unilateral expression) was outside the 95% confidence interval of the simulation outcomes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B,C</xref>). Thus, in flies with unilateral expression, the turning bias was significantly larger than we would expect by chance.</p>
<p>In these experiments, symmetric illumination from above also caused changes in forward velocity. These effects were likely due to visual startle, because they were indistinguishable in flies with unilateral expression, bilateral expression, and no expression (data not shown). Due to the confounding effect of visual startle, we could not use this dataset to investigate how optogenetic activation of DNa02 affects the fly’s forward velocity. Next, to investigate the effect of bilateral DN inhibition, we expressed an inhibitory opsin (GtACR1) in either DNa01 neurons or DNa02 neurons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). As a genetic control, we also used an “empty” split-Gal4 line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). As each fly walked in a small arena, we switched an overhead light on and off periodically (2 min on, 2 min off). We analyzed behavior as a function of genotype (Gal4/control) and light (on/off) using a set of two-factor ANOVAs, corrected for multiple comparisons. A significant (genotype×light) interaction would be evidence for a behavioral effect of DN inhibition.</p>
<p>First, we analyzed the body movements that are correlated with DNa01 and DNa02 activity – namely, rotational and sideways movements (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). When DNa01 neurons were inhibited, sideways speed was significantly reduced. Surprisingly, however, rotational speed was unchanged when either DNa01 or DNa02 neurons were inhibited. Recall that DNa01 and DNa02 predict rotational movements about as well as they predict sideways movements (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Moreover, unilateral activation of DNa02 influences ipsilateral rotational movements (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B,C</xref>). Why, then, is the body’s rotational movement unaltered when these DNs are bilaterally inhibited? In freely walking flies, body rotation can be achieved via many different leg maneuvers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">DeAngelis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Katsov et al., 2017</xref>). For example, in some body-rotation events, the stance duration of the inner back leg is prolonged relative to the other legs – in essence, the fly pivots on its inner back leg – whereas this maneuver is absent in other body-rotation events (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). This raised the possibility that DN hyperpolarization interferes with a specific leg maneuver, rather than body rotation <italic>per se</italic>.</p>
<p>To investigate this idea, we identified five leg maneuvers that often accompany body rotations in freely walking control flies (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>). We then examined whether each leg maneuver was altered by DN inhibition. We found that inhibiting DNa01 produced a significant defect in stance prolongation in the inner back leg – i.e., it reduced the fly’s tendency to pivot on the inner back leg during a body rotation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8G</xref>). We observed the same trend when we inhibited</p>
<p>DNa02, although here the trend fell short of statistical significance. These results suggest that inhibiting DNa01 (and possibly DNa02) causes a defect in inner-back-leg-stance-prolongation, but this defect is evidently compensated via other mechanisms to achieve a normal rotational movement of the body in freely moving flies.</p>
<p>Finally, we noticed that inhibiting either DNa01 or DNa02 altered the fly’s normal leg movement rhythm, regardless of whether the fly was walking straight or turning. Specifically, step frequency decreased, while leg swing distance increased (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8H</xref>). Inhibiting DNa01 also decreased the fly’s forward velocity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Ensemble codes for steering</title>
<p>In this study, we showed that DNa01 and DNa02 are both recruited during turning bouts in walking flies. However, connectome data shows these two DNs receive largely non-overlapping inputs in the brain, and they have largely non-overlapping outputs in the ventral nerve cord, suggesting that they represent parallel and largely independent pathways for steering control. Importantly, our electrophysiological results in this study support this hypothesis: these two DN types have distinct functional profiles. We demonstrate that DNa02 predicts large, rapid steering events, while DNa01 predicts smaller and slower steering events. Moreover, DNa02 predicts more transient changes in steering, as compared to DNa01. At the onset of a steering bout, DNa02 is recruited earlier, and its firing rate fluctuations are more transient than those of DNa01. All these results argue that these two DNs play specialized roles.</p>
<p>It should be emphasized that other DNs also participate in steering during walking. This is consistent with our finding that optogenetically inhibiting DNa01 produced only small defects in steering, and inhibiting DNa02 did not produce statistically significant effects on steering. Indeed, while this study was in revision, a follow-up study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Yang et al., 2023</xref>) used a calcium imaging screen to identify DNg13, DNb05, and DNb06 as additional steering-correlated DNs, while also confirming the role of DNa02. Meanwhile, another follow-up study identified DNa11, DNae003, DNa03, and DNae014 as additional steering-related DNs, while again confirming the role of DNa02 in steering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Feng et al., 2024</xref>). Together, these follow-up studies provide strong support for our general conclusion that individual steering DNs play specialized functional roles.</p>
<p>Both follow-up studies also confirmed some of our key results. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Yang et al. (2023)</xref> tested the effect of unilateral optogenetic perturbations DNa02 (using a different genetic strategy), and found that unilateral excitation of DNa02 was sufficient to produce ipsilateral body rotation; meanwhile, unilateral inhibition of DNa02 had no measurable effect on body rotation, but it significantly increased ipsilateral leg movements; all these results support our conclusions. As an aside, we note that there are small differences in the leg kinematic phenotype associated with DNa02 perturbation in this study versus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Yang et al. (2023)</xref>; this may be due to the fact that the latter study focus on flies walking a spherical treadmill, whereas our perturbation experiments focused on more naturalistic leg movements in freely walking flies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Yang et al. (2023)</xref> found that perturbing DNa02 mainly affected ipsilateral leg movements, but DNa02 activity was actually correlated with both ipsi- and contra legs, with opposite changes in the step cycle on the two sides of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Yang et al., 2023</xref>). Our brain connectome analyses in this study actually predict this effect: we show that the brain inputs onto DN02 are arranged so as to produce concurrent excitation of one copy and inhibition of the other copy, a see-saw arrangement that should generate opposite leg movement changes on the two sides of the body. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Feng et al. (2024)</xref> also reported that unilateral optogenetic activation of DNa02 produced a significant increase in ipsiversive rotational velocity, again confirming our results. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Feng et al. (2024)</xref> confirmed that bilateral ablation of DNa02 significantly reduced the velocity of corrective turning maneuvers induced by errors in the head direction system, and this finding supports our conclusion that DNa02 is recruited by the central complex for control of head direction.</p>
<p>Could these “steering DNs” also play a role in the control of the fly’s forward motion during straight-line walking? A previous study reported that optogenetic activation of either DNa01 or DNa02 increases global locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cande et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we found that bilaterally optogenetically inhibiting DNa01 decreased the fly’s forward velocity. However, our electrophysiological results show that DNa01 and DNa02 are only weakly correlated with forward velocity during normal locomotion. In short, it seems that DNa01 and DNa02 are normally recruited by the brain for steering control, but bilateral perturbations can nonetheless produce forward velocity changes. It is perhaps not surprising that bilaterally perturbing these DNs can change forward velocity, as these DNs can only drive steering via laterally asymmetric changes in the step cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cheong et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">DeAngelis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Feng et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Strauss and Heisenberg, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Yang et al., 2023</xref>), and any imposed bilateral change in the step cycle will almost inevitably affect the fly’s forward velocity. That said, it remains possible that DNa01 and DNa02 contribute to modulations of forward velocity during straight-line locomotion under some specific conditions.</p>

<title>Behavioral state and latent motor commands</title>
<p>The DNs that target the wings and the legs are largely distinct populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Namiki et al., 2018</xref>), and the DNs currently implicated in steering during flight are distinct from those we have identified here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Ros et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schnell et al., 2017</xref>). However, DNa02 does have indirect connectivity onto wing motor neurons, suggesting it contributes to steering during flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cheong et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, a follow-up study to this work reported that DNa03 activation can cause turning in flight, as well as turning during walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Feng et al., 2024</xref>). Interestingly, the GABAergic cell VES041 can suppress steering during flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Ros et al., 2024</xref>), and we predict that it has a similar role during walking, based on its connectivity upstream from DNa02. It will be interesting to learn how much upstream brain circuitry is shared for flight control and walking control, and what happens to each of these systems during the behavioral state when they are not currently in use.</p>
<p>In this regard, it is notable that we observed clear responses to lateralized sensory stimuli in steering DNs even when the fly was not walking. Similarly, a recent study found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> DNs that evoke landing during flight are still responsive to visual stimuli when the fly is not flying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ache et al., 2019</xref>). We might think of these residual DN responses as a latent bias toward action, or a preparation for an action that never ultimately occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kien, 1990</xref>). In this regard, it is relevant that mammalian corticospinal neurons can be active in the absence of movement, either in the period preceding a movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Tanji and Evarts, 1976</xref>) or when a movement is being simply observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kraskov et al., 2014</xref>). These latent corticospinal signals may represent movement preparation, which may additionally involve neurons which are not actually active during movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>), and they may be responsible for driving latent activity in spinal neurons in the absence of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Prut and Fetz, 1999</xref>). The discovery of latent motor activity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain provides a potential starting point for future mechanistic investigations of brain dynamics during motor preparation.</p>
<p>Behavioral state transitions may be organized, at least in part, via the network of cells presynaptic to DNs (“pre-DNs”) in the lateral accessory lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Namiki and Kanzaki, 2016</xref>). Our analyses highlight the anatomical features of several pre-DNs, most notably DNa03 and LAL010, which both receive bilateral input from cell types known to exert high-level premotor control, namely PFL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Westeinde et al., 2024</xref>) and VES041 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Ros et al., 2024</xref>). Another pre-DN with similar connectivity (LAL013) has recently been shown to play an important role in modulating steering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Feng et al., 2024</xref>).</p>

<title>From flies to vertebrates</title>
<p>Our work shows that steering is driven by combinations of DNs with distinct functional roles, recruited by distinct parallel pathways in the brain, and targeting largely nonoverlapping sets of cells in the ventral cord. These results are relevant to vertebrates, because any walking or running organism faces the same basic physical constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dickinson et al., 2000</xref>), and so it is likely that evolution has found a common set of solutions to these basic problems. In vertebrates, recent work has begun to identify the DNs that influence steering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cregg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Usseglio et al., 2020</xref>). Based on our results, we would predict that vertebrate steering DNs should also be diverse and specialized.</p>
<p>In all species, orienting behaviors are fundamental and ubiquitous indicators of an organism’s perceptions and intentions. As such, they provide a useful window into perception and cognition. Once we fully understand the specializations of the DNs that control steering and orienting, we should be able to re-frame the problem of controlling an organism’s orientation as a more concrete problem of generating a specific pattern of DN dynamics. This motor-centric perspective then allows us to understand sensory and cognitive computations as solutions to specific problems of dynamical system control.</p>

<caption><title>Leg movements associated with body rotation</title><p>A) We selected 5 leg-kinematic variables likely to be associated with body rotation. In control flies, we computed the mean value of each variable, for each leg, binned by rotational velocity (for directional variables) or rotational speed (for nondirectional variables).</p><p>B) We defined 5 multi-leg metrics, each based on one leg-kinematic variable. For each metric, the relevant legs are labeled and color-coded. Gray legs were not used because, for these legs, the variable in question did not show a reliable correlation with the fly’s rotational movement (A). Gray legs in (B) are shown faded in (A).</p><p>C) We plotted each metric versus rotational velocity or rotational speed, to verify that the expected relationship was observed. We refined our definitions in order to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of this relationship. Each datapoint is a time window (with n values in italics near the origin of each plot). Thick lines show LOWESS fits; thin lines show 95% confidence intervals; only a small number of datapoints have rotational speeds &gt;120°/s, so fits are not shown above this ceiling. Importantly, we fixed the number of metrics we tested, and also the definitions of those metrics, based purely on data from control flies, before we examined any of these metrics in our experimental genotypes.</p><p>D) Finally, we asked how these metrics change when DNa01 or DNa02 neurons are silenced. We identified all body rotation events in every experiment by searching forward in time for moments when rotational speed crosses a threshold of 20 °/s. We extracted a 500-ms time window around each threshold-crossing. Events were constrained to be non-overlapping. Body rotation events were tabulated separately for light-on and light-off. The number of time windows in each distribution is shown in italics. To determine if any metric was changed when DNa01 neurons were silenced, we performed 5 two-factor ANOVAs and looked for a significant interaction between genotype (control/DNa01) and light (on/off); these p-values were Bonferroni-Holm corrected to avoid type 1 errors (m=5 tests). Then, to determine if any metric was changed when DNa02 neurons were silenced, we performed 5 two-factor ANOVAs and looked for a significant interaction between genotype (control/DNa02) and light (on/off); these p-values were again Bonferroni-Holm corrected (m=5 tests); nonsignificant p-values are not shown. In cases where these p-values were significant (D4, p=0.02, DNa01 vs control) or nearly significant (D4, p=0.505, DNa02 vs control), we followed up by performing a post hoc Tukey test to determine if there was a significant difference between light on/off in each genotype. Interestingly, the only metric to show an effect was the stance duration metric (D4). In control flies, a prolonged stance duration is observed in some but not all body rotation events (C4). This implies that body rotation can be driven by an inner-back-leg pivoting maneuver, but body rotation does not absolutely require this maneuver. This idea is consistent with our finding that rotational speeds are overall unchanged when DNa01 or DNa02 is silenced (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>).</p><p>Note that the data for the stance duration metric (A4-D4) are reproduced in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F,G</xref>, where this metric is called “inner back leg stance duration (normalized)”, i.e. iB pivoting.</p></caption>

<title>Fly husbandry and genotypes</title>
<p>We used female flies 1-2 days post-eclosion, except where specified below. We used virgins to minimize egg-laying, which tended to stop movement of the spherical treadmill. Flies were housed in a 25° incubator at 50-70% relative humidity. Unless otherwise noted, flies were cultured on molasses food (B7 recipe, Archon Scientific) and kept on a 12/12 light/dark cycle. Flies used in optogenetic experiments were cultured on molasses food and then transferred 0-1 days after eclosion onto a vial of standard cornmeal agar fly food supplemented with rehydrated potato flakes (Formula 4-24, Carolina Biological Supply) and 100 µL of all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinal (35 mM in ethanol; R2500, Sigma-Aldrich).

<title>Fly mounting and dissection for electrophysiology and calcium imaging</title>
<p>On the day of the experiment, a fly was cold-anesthetized and then inserted into the hole of a machine milled (Harvard Medical School Research Instrumentation Core) or photoetched (Etchit) platform made of stainless steel shim stock (McMaster-Carr). We secured the fly to the platform using UV-curable glue (AA3972 Loctite) applied on the thorax and eyes.</p>
<p>We then extended the proboscis with forceps and waxed it in place to prevent brain motion (Electra Waxer, Almore); prior to this step, a manual manipulator (MX160R Siskiyou) was used to lower a shield over the legs to protect them from the tip of the waxer. We then covered the brain with extracellular saline composed of: 103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 5 mM TES, 8 mM trehalose, 10 mM glucose, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO4, 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (osmolarity 270-275 mOsm). The saline was bubbled during the dissection with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and reached an equilibrium pH of 7.3. The top of the cuticle was removed, followed by air sacs and fat globules around the patching site. Muscle 16 was severed to prevent brain motion. The frontal head air sac, which extends ventrally under the brain, was also removed to improve illumination from below the brain. Finally, we mechanically removed the peri-neural sheath over the patching site. (For behavior-only experiments in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figs. 8</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>, all these dissection steps were omitted.)</p>
<p>Finally, we transferred the fly to the spherical treadmill, where we used a motorized three-axis manipulator (MT3-Z8, Thorlabs) to adjust the fly relative to the ball. Two cameras (BFLY-PGE-13E4M, FLIR) were used to visualize the fly during this adjustment.</p>

<title>Spherical treadmill and behavioral measurements</title>
<p>We used a sensor-based setup for tracking the movements of the spherical treadmill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Seelig et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, a hollow HDPE sphere (6.35 mm diameter) was floated on pressurized air, in a plenum mounted on a manipulator to allow alignment of the center of the ball with two motion sensors located at a distance from the ball. The ball was painted with a random dot pattern to make it easier for motion sensors to detect movement. We positioned two cameras 90° apart to track the motion of the ball in three dimensions (rotational, sideways, forward velocity), and we took the fly’s fictive movements in each direction as equal and opposite to the ball’s movements. These motion cameras were custom built by housing the motion sensor array (ADNS-9800, JACK Enterprises) in a custom housing with a lens (M2514-MP2, Computar). Data from the sensor was read out and translated into an analog signal using a digital-to-analog converter (MCP4725, SparkFun) and an Arduino device (Due, Arduino). Analog data were digitized at 10 kHz with a multi-channel NI DAQ board (PCIe-6353, National Instruments), controlled via the Matlab Data Acquisition Toolbox interface (MathWorks). Analog data were then smoothed using a 2nd-order lowpass Butterworth filter and downsampled to 100 Hz. Motion sensor outputs were calibrated to obtain the conversion from sensor outputs to ball velocities. We performed this calibration by rotating a ball using a planetary gear motor with an encoder (Actobotics, Part 3638298). The motor was rotated at 6 different speeds in all 3 axes of motion, and linear regression was used to calculate the mapping between the output of the motion sensors and the rotation of the ball.</p>
<p>We noticed that steering responses to sensory stimuli were larger and more consistent in intact flies, as compared to flies used for electrophysiology experiments (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). The reduced performance of flies used for electrophysiology experiments is likely due to local removal of the peri-neural sheath and/or local disruption of the neuropil surrounding the targeted somata. Nonetheless, the qualitative features of behavior are comparable in intact flies (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>) versus flies used for electrophysiology (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>For patch clamp experiments, we illuminated the brain with an infrared fiber (SXF30-850, Smart Vision Lights) mounted under the fly tethering platform in a sagittal plane at ∼20° from the horizontal and a we visualized the brain with a camera (BFLY-PGE-13E4M, Point Gray) mounted on a fluorescence microscope (BX51, Olympus).</p>
<p>Before attempting to obtain seals, we first used a large-diameter glass pipette filled with extracellular saline (4-5 MΩ), to clear the area around the soma of interest by applying positive pressure and also gently sucking away any cells lying on top of the soma of interest. Patch pipettes (9-11 MΩ) were pulled the day of the recording and filled with internal solution containing 140 mM KOH, 140 mM aspartic acid, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM KCl, 4 mM MgATP, 0.5 mM Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, and 13 mM biocytin hydrazide (pH adjusted to 7.2 ± 0.1, osmolarity adjusted to 265 ± 3 mOsm). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed from fluorescently labeled somata in current-clamp mode using an Axopatch 200B amplifier. Data were low-pass filtered at 5 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz by a 16 bit A/D converter (National Instruments, BNC 2090-A), and acquired using the Matlab Data Acquisition Toolbox (MathWorks). Recordings were stable for at least 15 min and up to 2 hrs.</p>
<p>We always recorded from the neuron in the left hemisphere, except when we recorded from the same cell type bilaterally. For bilateral recordings, we performed the cleaning and air-sac clearing steps on both sides of the brain. For dual recording experiments of DNa01 and DNa02, we performed recordings on the left side of the brain.</p>
<p>We targeted DNa01 using <italic>SS00731</italic>, and we targeted DNa02 using <italic>SS00730</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Namiki et al., 2018</xref>); the only exception was that, in dual DNa01 and DNa02 recordings, we targeted DNa01 using the <italic>SS00731</italic>, and we targeted DNa02 using <italic>R75C10-Gal4</italic>. In these flies, we could identify DNa01 and DNa02 based on the depths of their somata (DNa02 is more superficial), the sizes of their somata (DNa02 is larger), and their spike waveforms (DNa02 spikes are larger). Finally, to confirm the discriminability of DNa02 and DNa01 spikes, we quantified the performance of automated spike waveform classification (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Calcium imaging and electrophysiology during central complex stimulation</title>
<p>In the experiments for <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, the pitch angle of fly’s head was carefully adjusted during the dissection procedure. This allowed patch-pipette access to the anterior side of the brain (where DNa02 somata reside) as well as pressure-pipette access to the protocerebral bridge on the posterior side of the brain (where PEN1 dendrites reside).</p>
<p>To position the pressure-ejection pipette in the protocerebral bridge, and to obtain a patch recording from an DNa02 somata, we visualized the brain and the patch pipette using an infrared fiber (SXF30-850, Smart Vision Lights) mounted under the tethering platform in a sagittal plane at ∼20° from the horizontal and a near-infrared camera (GS-U3-41C6NIR FLIR) mounted on the widefield viewing port of a 2-photon microscope (Bergamo II, Thorlabs).</p>
<p>To obtain a recording from DNa02, we needed to fluorescently label DNa02 somata. However, we needed to label DNa02 without also labeling PEN1 neurons (which also expressed Gal4), because PEN1 labeling could have contaminated our GCaMP6f signal in the ellipsoid body. We therefore used a chemogenetic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sutcliffe et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, we drove an expression of HaloTag under <italic>Gal4</italic>/<italic>UAS</italic> control, and we then applied SiR110-HaloTag dye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>) (a gift from Luke Lavis) to the preparation. The dye was prepared as a stock solution (500 µM in DMSO), and then 1 μL of the stock was dissolved in 500 μL of extracellular saline. Most of the saline in the recording chamber was removed and the dye solution was added to the chamber. After a 15 min incubation, the chamber was rinsed and re-filled with regular extracellular saline. We used a TexasRed filter cube (49017, Chroma) to visualize labeled DNa02 somata. Because the perineural sheath was removed selectively in the vicinity of DNa02 somata, the bath-applied SiR110-HaloTag dye bound mainly to DNa02 somata, with essentially no binding to the ellipsoid body neuropil.</p>
<p>For GCaMP6f imaging of EPG neuron dendrites in the ellipsoid body, we used a volumetric, galvo-resonant scanning 2-photon microscope (Bergamo II, Thorlabs) equipped with a 20×, 1.0 n.a. objective (XLUMPLFLN20XW, Olympus) and GaAsP detectors (Hamamatsu). We used ScanImage 2018 software (Vidrio Technologies) to control the microscope. Two-photon excitation was provided by a Chameleon Ultra II Ti:Sapphire femtosecond pulsed laser with pre-compensation (Vision-S, Coherent). To image GCaMP6f, we tuned the laser to 940 nm. The objective was translated vertically using a scanner with a 400-μm travel range (P-725KHDS PIFOC, Physik Instrumente). The ellipsoid body was volumetrically imaged with 12 <italic>z</italic>-planes of 256×64 pixels separated by 4-5 μm. We acquired ∼12 volumes/s.</p>
<p>For PEN1 stimulation, we followed a published procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Green et al., 2019</xref>). We prepared a solution of ATP (A7699, Sigma, 0.5 mM) and Alexa594 dye (A33082, FisherScientific, 20 μM,) in extracellular saline. This solution was used to fill a glass pipette slightly smaller than a patch pipette. We used a red emission filter cube (49017, Chroma) to visually locate the pipette via the microscope eyepieces. The tip of the pipette was placed into the protocerebral bridge, where the dendrites of PEN1 neurons are located, generally close to glomerulus 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>). To eject ATP and dye, we delivered a 50-100 ms pulse of pressure to the back of the pipette (10-20 p.s.i.) using a pneumatic device gated by a voltage pulse (PV820; World Precision Instruments). We confirmed ejection by observing a bolus of dye appear in the center of the protocerebral bridge neuropil, and the resulting stimulus-locked rotation of the EPG bump in the ellipsoid body.</p>
<p>In a given experiment, we noticed that the bump tended to jump to the same location in every trial. We used that fact to try to obtain large bump jumps. Specifically, we manually timed the ATP injection in each trial to maximize the size of the resulting bump jump. We ejected ATP every 15-25 s for a total of 87 ± 10 stimulations per fly.</p>
<p>As a negative control, we performed the same type of experiment in flies lacking the PEN1 Gal4 line, and we confirmed that the ATP puff only rarely preceded bump jumps in this genotype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). This negative result demonstrates that the bump jump in the experimental genotype is primarily driven by P2X2 expression in PEN1 neurons. Bump jumps in control flies are likely coincidental, as the bump is often moving in a typical EPG imaging experiment. In control flies, in the few trials where the bump jumped, the bump returned to its initial location 35% of the time. These returns are not unexpected, because the bump’s location is thought to be continuously compared to an internal goal location stored downstream from EPG neurons, and any deviation from the fly’s angular goal is corrected via compensatory turning maneuvers.</p>
<p>Note that, in these experiments, EPG neurons expressed GCaMP6f (under the control of <italic>60D05-LexA</italic>), PEN1 neurons expressed P2X<sub>2</sub> and HaloTag (under the control of <italic>VT032906-Gal4</italic>), and DNa02 neurons also expressed P2X<sub>2</sub> and HaloTag (under the control of <italic>SS00730</italic>). We took several steps to verify that ATP directly stimulated PEN1 neurons but not DNa02 neurons. First, we used dye to check that the ATP bolus was confined to the protocerebral bridge. Second, we confirmed that DNa02 neurons were not depolarized during the period when PEN1 neurons were depolarized and the bump therefore jumped, i.e. in the first 0.5 s after ATP ejection (mean DNa02 voltage change in the 0.5 s after ATP ejection was 0.12 ± 0.27 mV in experimental flies and 0.14 ± 0.27 mV in genetic controls lacking the PEN1 Gal4 driver). Rather, DNa02 neurons were only excited just before the fly made a compensatory steering maneuver, which usually occurred 1.0-1.5 s after the bump jump. Third, we verified that DNa02 was only recruited when the bump returned to its initial location via a clockwise path; if ATP had been directly exciting DNa02, then the side where DNa02 was active should not be contingent on the bump’s path.</p>

Next, we confirmed that this neuron bore an excellent resemblance to skeletons we traced from two 3D confocal images of the DNa02-specific split-Gal4 line (<italic>SS00730</italic>) driving CD8::GFP expression. The first of these images was provided to us by Gwyneth Card (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Namiki et al., 2018</xref>).

<title>Data analysis – spherical treadmill data preprocessing</title>
<p>Kinematic data used in computing linear filters, signal autocorrelations, LOWESS-fit scatter-plots, and event-triggered analysis were processed as follows. First, the zero-point of each kinematic signal was corrected for small artifactual offsets by finding the median of periods of inactivity, defined as regions with instantaneous difference of less than 0.025°/s. The offset value during these periods was largely consistent throughout the entire experiment, so a global subtraction was used to remove this offset for each experiment.</p>
<p>We then lightly smoothed each kinematic variable by convolving with a 50-ms Gaussian kernel bounded from -3.5 <italic>σ</italic> to +3.5 <italic>σ</italic>, and re-normalized. In order to remove remaining high frequency noise while preserving large signal excursions, we then used Gaussian process smoothing. This smoothed the data by fitting the time series to a Gaussian random walk process and taking the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate for each time point, as found with the L-BFGS-B optimizer. The model was implemented with PyMC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Salvatier et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, the model is as follows:

All variables except α were fit using the approximate inference software; µ was given a large initial prior standard deviation (100000, or 5-6 times the largest value present in the data) and it quickly converged to a stable value. We set α to 0.2 to assign 20% of signal variance to noise and the remaining 80% to the random walk. All time series were scrutinized to ensure proper baseline correction and smoothing.</p>
<p>Total speed was calculated by taking the absolute value of rotational velocity (<italic>v<sub>r</sub></italic>) sideways velocity (<italic>v<sub>s</sub></italic>), and (<italic>v<sub>f</sub></italic>) forward velocity (<italic>v<sub>f</sub></italic>), and then summing these values:

We then counted spikes in 10-ms non-overlapping bins, and smoothed them with an exponential filter using the smoothts function in Matlab with a 30-ms window size to generate a continuous waveform of firing rate versus time.</p>
<p>For <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>, and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D,E</xref> (and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figs. S2</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4C</xref>), firing rate was calculated as follows. First, data were conservatively band-pass zero-phase filtered using a first-order Butterworth filter with natural (3 dB) frequency of 100 Hz. Filtered time series were then normalized to a 500-ms rolling estimate of the median absolute deviation (MAD). MAD is defined as the median of absolute deviations from the median of the entire dataset. We used a corrected version of this estimate to maintain asymptotically Normal consistency by multiplying by 1.4826. This aids spike detection when firing rates are high. Spikes were then detected using the relative prominence metric in the find_peaks function in the SciPy Python library, where the prominence of a given spike was defined over a 10-s period. Prominence values were selected for each experiment and neuron. While requiring threshold tuning for some experiments, this method was robust in all DNa01 and DNa02 recordings. To estimate the firing rate, detected spikes were then binned at 1.25 ms and smoothed by convolving with a 2.5-ms Gaussian kernel as described above. All steps of firing rate calculation were scrutinized to ensure proper behavior by plotting periods known to be difficult or easy to estimate (i.e. small inter-spike-interval or high MAD).</p>
<p>To compute autocorrelations (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>) and linear filters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D,E</xref>, and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>), and for event-triggered analysis (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C</xref>), we processed electrophysiology data as follows. We first estimate an initial “offset” by taking the median of the first 30-60 s. We then median-filtered the entire time series using a kernel length of 35 ms. This window length was empirically selected to optimally preserve low-frequency voltage modulations while excluding most of the spike waveform. We then removed high frequency artifacts remaining after median filtering by convolving with a 5-ms Gaussian kernel (bounded from -3.5<italic>σ</italic> to +3.5<italic>σ</italic> and re-normalized). The resulting time series was then detrended by subtracting the average of linear fits to voltage data over every 30 s and 120 s, and then adding back the initial offset. All time series were scrutinized to ensure that median filtering and detrending were successful.</p>
<p>To compute neuron-behavior relationships, firing rates and membrane voltage values were downsampled to the same sampling rate as the spherical treadmill data. This was done by applying an upsampling by a factor of 4, applying a linear-phase finite impulse response filter, and then downsampling.</p>

We calculated these linear filters by treating one signal as input and the other as output. We found the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of 1-sample overlapping 4-s windows of both input and output, and then computed
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="024703v3_eqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>input</italic>* represents the complex conjugate of <italic>input</italic>. The denominator of this equation is the input power spectrum, and the numerator is the cross-correlation between input and output in the frequency domain. We then applied the inverse of the fast Fourier transform to <italic>F</italic> to yield the linear filter relationship between input and output. For filter analyses, all behavioral variables were represented in units of °/s (i.e., sideways velocity and forward velocity were not converted from °/s to mm/s). This was done so that all filters had the same units (°/s in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B-F</xref>, or s/° in <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2H-L</xref>), allowing direct comparison of different filter amplitudes.</p>
<p>Our input and output signals have little high-frequency content, and so division in the frequency domain introduces some noise into the linear filter. Moreover, each class of input-output relationship has its own characteristic frequency content. For this reason, we low-pass filtered the linear filters to remove this noise differently for each class. Behavior→Neuron filters were filtered with a 0<sup>th</sup> order Slepian window of 6 Hz bandwidth, whereas Neuron→Behavior filters were low pass filtered using a 0<sup>th</sup> order Slepian window of 15 Hz. These windows maximize energy in the central lobe and were empirically selected to avoid distortion of spectral content within the window.</p>
<p>To generate behavioral predictions, we convolved each cell’s firing rate estimate with its Neuron→Behavior filters. To find the variance explained by each filter, we linearly regressed the predicted output against the actual output and took the R<sup>2</sup> value. Since each experiment differed in signal-to-noise, and low pass filtering was applied globally, the length of filter used in prediction was optimized within valid bounds for each neuron (100 ms to 4 s). In general, we found that a shorter filter was optimal for rotational velocity and sideways velocity, whereas a longer filter was optimal for forward velocity and total speed, consistent with the differing timescales of the autocorrelograms of these variables (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). For generating a two-cell behavioral prediction from DNa02 dual recordings, we simply summed the predictions of both filters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D,E</xref>).</p>

<p>We estimated the position of the bump of activity in EPG neurons by computing a population vector average (PVA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015</xref>). Our experimental design required that we focus on trials where the bump was clearly visible and stable, jumped after the ATP puff, and then returned to its initial position; our goal was to study DNa02 neuron responses during this sequence of events. We therefore discarded trials where the bump amplitude faded during the trial – specifically, where PVA magnitude dropped below the 7th percentile (for that experiment) for more than 1 s during the trial. We then discarded trials where the bump was already moving during the 1 s prior to the ATP puff, meaning that the standard deviation of the bump’s position during that period was &gt;1.5 sectors. At this point, we computed the “initial position” of the bump in each trial as its mean position during the 1 s prior to the ATP puff. Next, we discarded trials where the bump did not jump in response to the ATP puff, i.e. where the bump’s position did not move by at least 0.5 sectors. We also discarded trials where the bump did not return to dwell within 0.5 sectors of its initial position (i.e., its position before the bump jump) for at least 0.5 s. Our results were not especially sensitive to the precise values of any of these data inclusion criteria.</p>
<p>We defined the bump’s return period as the time window beginning with the maximum excursion of the bump (from its initial position) and ending with the bump’s return to a position within 0.5 sectors of its initial position. We found the time point during each trial where the bump’s return speed was maximal. We then aligned trials by this time point before averaging data across trials and experiments.

Training was performed on 95% of this 1300-frame dataset, and the remaining 5% was used to visually evaluate model performance by comparing the locations of manually labeled points and auto-labeled points. When the model mislabeled frames, it was generally because of an unusual walking angle or lighting condition, and so we added frames with these conditions to our training set and recomputed the detection model to improve performance in these situations. We also excluded stretches of data when the fly was grooming, jumping, or walking on the ceiling of the arena, because all these events reduced the model’s performance.

Our goal was to identify leg-kinematic features associated with body rotation in control flies, in order to subsequently determine if any of these features were altered when DNs were silenced. To analyze leg-kinematic features associated with body rotation, our first step was to detect body-rotation events by searching forward in time for moments where the fly’s rotational speed exceeded a threshold of 20°/s and stayed above that threshold for at least 0.1 s. We then extracted a 500-ms window of data starting 100 ms prior to the threshold crossing. (We explored several window sizes, and chose 500 ms because it produced the strongest relationship between the multi-leg metrics and rotational movement, considering all five metrics taken together.) Next, for each leg, we detected every complete swing epoch and every complete stance epoch in the window. Then, in each window, we computed the following metrics (iF = inner front, iM = inner middle, iB = inner back, oF = outer front, oM = outer middle, oB = outer back):</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Stance direction</italic> (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>, row 1): The vector pointing backward along the body’s long axis was taken as 0°. We measured each leg’s movement direction (in body-centric coordinates) during each stance. When the fly is walking forward, leg stance directions are close to 0° (i.e., every leg is moving almost straight in the backward direction relative to the body). During left turns, the legs in stance tend to move rightward (0° &lt; θ &lt; 180°), while conversely, during right turns, the legs in stance tend to move leftward (0° &gt; θ &gt; -180°); see <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8B1</xref>. The stance direction metric was defined as the mean of the stance directions of the oF, iF, and iM legs (averaged over all epochs in the window).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Swing direction</italic> (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>, row 2) The vector pointing forward along the body’s long axis was taken as 0°. We measured each leg’s movement direction (in body-centric coordinates) during each swing. When the fly is walking forward, leg swing directions are close to 0° (i.e., every leg is moving almost straight in the forward direction relative to the body). During left turns, the legs tend to swing leftward (0° &lt; θ &lt; -180°), while conversely, during right turns, the legs tend to swing rightward (0° &gt; θ &gt; 180°); see <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8B2</xref>. The swing direction metric was defined as the mean of the stance directions of the oF, iF, and iM legs (averaged over all epochs in the window).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Swing distance</italic> (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>, row 3) We measured the distance each leg moved during its swing epochs. The swing distance metric was defined as the mean of the swing distances of the OF and OM legs (averaged across swing epochs), divided by the mean swing distances of the iM and iB legs (averaged across epochs in the window).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Stance duration</italic> <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>, row 4 and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F,G</xref>) We measured the time each leg spent in each of its stance epochs. The stance duration metric was defined as the stance duration of the iB leg (averaged over stance epochs), divided by the mean stance durations of the iF, oF, oM, and oB legs (averaged across epochs in the window).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Swing duration</italic> (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>, row 5) We measured the time each leg spent in each of its swing epochs. The swing duration metric was defined as the mean swing duration of the iM and iB legs (averaged across epochs in the window).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To determine whether there was a significant effect of DNa01 silencing on any metric, we performed a two-factor ANOVA with genotypes (DNa01/control) and light (on/off) as factors, and we examined the p-values associated with genotype×light interaction, after p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni-Holm correction, m=5 tests). We used the same procedure to determine whether there was a significant effect of DNa02 silencing.</p>

<title>Step frequency, step length, and forward velocity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8H</xref>)</title>
<p>We divided each video chunk into non-overlapping 500-ms windows. We discarded windows where the fly’s time-averaged forward velocity was &lt;2.0 mm/s. Step frequency was defined as the mean frequency of stance onset for all six legs, averaged across all complete stride epochs within that window, for all legs. Step length was defined as the mean stride distance of all six legs, averaged across all complete stride epochs within that window, for all legs. Forward velocity was defined as the velocity of the vector connecting the abdomen tip to the head, in the direction of that vector, for each frame, and then averaged over the window. To determine whether there was a significant effect of DNa01 silencing on any of these three variables (step frequency, step length, forward velocity), we performed a two-factor ANOVA with genotypes (DNa01/control) and light (on/off) as factors, and we examined the p-values associated with genotype×light interaction, after p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni-Holm correction, m=3 tests). We used the same procedure to determine whether there was a significant effect of DNa02 silencing.</p>
<p>For the leg-centric metrics above, if any leg included in a given metric did not complete at least one of the relevant epochs during a particular time window, then that window was omitted. Moreover, for the ANOVAs described above, if a fly did not contribute at least 5 time windows to the dataset for that particular metric, then the fly was omitted. The number of flies that contributed data to each panel was as follows (control/DNa01/DNa02 genotypes): <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref> (7/11/6); <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F,G</xref> (5/8/6); <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8H</xref> – step frequency (6/8/6), step length (6/10/6), forward velocity (7/11/6). For <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>, the values are: row 1 (6/9/6); row 2 (6/9/6); row 3 (6/9/6); row 4 (5/8/6); row 5 (6/9/6).</p>

<title>Post hoc statistical tests</title>
<p>When any ANOVA yielded a significant genotype×light interaction, we followed up by performing a post hoc Tukey test to determine whether, for each genotype, there was a significant effect of light on/off. Finally, to confirm that it was reasonable to treat each time window as an independent datapoint, we performed a separate two-factor ANOVA with fly ID and light as factors, and we verified that variance due to fly ID is much smaller than total variance.</p>

<title>Data inclusion</title>
<p>In analysis of electrophysiology experiments, we excluded cells where the recording lasted &lt;=15 minutes. Late in a recording, the membrane voltage sometimes became depolarized, which we interpret as a sign of poor recording quality; we therefore discarded any extended epoch where the membrane voltage was more depolarized than -33 mV.</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> (and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figs. S6</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>), flies were excluded that displayed highly asymmetric stimulus-evoked steering behavior. For example, we excluded a fly if on average, she displayed significant stimulation-evoked turns to the right but not to the left. These cases are likely due to asymmetric positioning of the fiber optic filaments near the antennae. This excluded 2/6 flies for fictive odor experiments and 3/7 flies for fictive warming experiments.</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, flies were excluded if there were &lt;6 trials that passed the checks described above (see <italic>Data analysis – central complex stimulation</italic>). This excluded 4 of 8 recordings.</p>
<p>In single-cell recordings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figs. S2</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>), we excluded 1 DNa01 cell (out of 8 total) and 1 DNa02 cell (out of 11 total) where the recording quality fluctuated substantially over time.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> work investigates how orientation signals detected in higher brain areas may be transformed into motor responses in behaving animals. The authors characterize two types of descending neurons (DNs) that connect the brain to motor units and are involved in different aspects of turning control. They further show that orientation signals act by preferentially increasing relative stimulation onto left- or right-turn-inducing DNs. These <bold>convincing</bold> results, together with the independent work that they have inspired, represent significant progress in our understanding of mechanisms of animal navigation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper addresses the knowledge gap between the representation of goal direction in the central complex and how motor systems stabilize movement toward that goal. The authors focused on two descending neurons, DNa01 and 02, and showed that they play different roles in steering the fly toward a goal. They also explored the connectome data to propose a model to explain how these DNs could mediate response to lateralized sensory inputs. They finally used lateralized optogenetic activation/inactivation experiments to test the roles of these neurons in mediating turnings in freely walking flies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments are well-designed and controlled. The experiment in Figure 4 is elegant, and the authors put a lot of effort into ensuring that ATP puffs do not accidentally activate the DNs. They also have explained complex experiments well. I only have minor comments for the authors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) I do not fully understand how the authors extracted the correlation functions from the population data in Figure 1. Since the ipsilateral DNs are anti-correlated with the contralateral ones, I expected that the average will drop to zero when they are pooled together (e.g., 1E-G). Of course, this will not be the case if all the data in Figure 1 are collected from the same brain hemisphere. It would be helpful if the authors could explain this.</p>
<p>(2) What constitutes the goal directions in Figures 1-3 and 8, as the authors could not use EPG activity as a proxy for goal directions? If these experiments were done in the dark, without landmarks, one would expect the fly's heading to drift randomly at times, and they would not engage the DNa01/02 for turning. Do the walking trajectories in these experiments qualify as menotactic bouts?</p>
<p>(3) In Figure 2B, the authors mentioned that DNa02 overpredicts and 01 underpredicts rapid turning and provided single examples. It would be nice to see more population-level quantification to support this claim.</p>

<p>The data is largely electrophysiological recordings coupled with behavioral measurements (technically impressive) and some gain-of-function experiments in freely walking flies. Loss-of-function was tested but had minimal effect, which is not surprising in a system with partially redundant control mechanisms. The data is also consistent with/complementary to subsequent manuscripts (Yang 2023, Feng 2024, and Ros 2024) showing additional descending neurons with contributions to steering in walking and flying.</p>
<p>The experiments are well executed, the results interesting, and the description clear. Some hypotheses based on connectome anatomy are tested: the insights on the pre-synaptic side - how sensory and central complex heading circuits converge onto these DNs are stronger than the suggestions about biomechanical mechanisms for how turning happens on the motor side.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is the idea that different sensory cues can converge on a common motor program. The turn-toward or turn-away mechanism is initiated by valence rather than whether the stimulus was odor or temperature or memory of heading. The idea that animals choose a direction based on external sensory information and then maintain that direction as a heading through a more internal, goal-based memory mechanism, is interesting but it is hard to separate conclusively.</p>
<p>The &quot;see-saw&quot;, where left-right symmetry is broken to allow a turn, presumably by excitation on one side and inhibition of the other leg motor modules, is interesting but not well explained here. How hyperpolarization affects motor outputs is not clear.</p>
<p>The statement near Figure 5B that &quot;DNa02 activity was higher on the side ipsilateral to the attractive stimulus, but contralateral to the aversive stimulus&quot; is really important - and only possible to see because of the dual recordings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Rayshubskiy et al. performed whole-cell recordings from descending neurons (DNs) of fruit flies to characterize their role in steering. Two DNs implicated in &quot;walking control&quot; and &quot;steering control&quot; by previous studies (Namiki et al., 2018, Cande et al., 2018, Chen et al., 2018) were chosen by the authors for further characterization. In-vivo whole-cell recordings from DNa01 and DNa02 showed that their activity predicts spontaneous ipsilateral turning events. The recordings also showed that while DNa02 predicts transient turns DNa01 predicts slow sustained turns. However, optogenetic activation or inactivation showed relatively subtle phenotypes for both neurons (consistent with data in other recent preprints, Yang et al 2023 and Feng et al 2024). The authors also further characterized DNa02 with respect to its inputs and showed a functional connection with olfactory and thermosensory inputs as well as with the head-direction system. DNa01 is not characterized to this extent.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) In-vivo recordings and especially dual recordings are extremely challenging in Drosophila and provide a much higher resolution DN characterization than other recent studies that have relied on behavior or calcium imaging. Especially impressive are the simultaneous recordings from bilateral DNs (Figure 3). These bilateral recordings show clearly that DNa02 cells not only fire more during ipsilateral turning events but that they get inhibited during contralateral turns. In line with this observation, the difference between left and right DNa02 neuronal activity is a much better predictor of turning events compared to individual DNa02 activity.</p>
<p>(2) Another technical feat in this work is driving local excitation in the head-direction neuronal ensemble (PEN-1 neurons), while simultaneously imaging its activity and performing whole-cell recordings from DNa02 (Figure 4). This impressive approach provided a way to causally relate changes in the head-direction system to DNa02 activity. Indeed, DNa02 activity could predict the rate at which an artificially triggered bump in the PEN-1 ring attractor returns to its previous stable point.</p>
<p>(3) The authors also support the above observations with connectomics analysis and provide circuit motifs that can explain how the head direction system (as well as external olfactory/thermal stimuli) communicated with DNa02. All these results unequivocally put DNa02 as an essential DN in steering control, both during exploratory navigation as well as stimulus-directed turns.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) I understand that the first version of this preprint was already on biorxiv in 2020, and some of the &quot;weaknesses&quot; I list are likely a reflection of the fact that I'm tasked to review this manuscript in late 2024 (more than 4 years later). But given this is a 2024 updated version it suffers from laying out the results in contemporary terms. For instance, the manuscript lacks any reference to the DNp09 circuit implicated in object-directed turning and upstream to DNa02 even though the authors cite one of the papers where this was analyzed (Braun et al, 2024). More importantly, these studies (both Braun et al 2024 and Sapkal et al 2024) along with recent work from the authors' lab (Yang et al 2023) and other labs (Feng et al 2024) provide a view that the entire suite of leg kinematics changes required for turning are orchestrated by populations of heterogeneous interconnected DNs. Moreover, these studies also show that this DN-DN network has some degree of hierarchy with some DNs being upstream to other DNs. In this contemporary view of steering control, DNa02 (like DNg13 from Yang et al 2023) is a downstream DN that is recruited by hierarchically upstream DNs like DNa03, DNp09, etc. In this view, DNa02 is likely to be involved in most turning events, but by itself unable to drive all the motor outputs required for the said events. This reasoning could be used while discussing the lack of major phenotypes with DNa02 activation or inactivation observed in the current study, which is in stark contrast to strong phenotypes observed in the case of hierarchically upstream DNs like DNp09 or DNa03. In the section, &quot;Contributions of single descending neuron types to steering behavior&quot;: the authors start off by asking if individual DNs can make measurable contributions to steering behavior. Once more, any citations to DNp09 or DNa03 - two DNs that are clearly shown to drive strong turning-on activation (Bidaye et al, 2020, Feng et al 2024) - are lacking. Besides misleading the reader, such statements also digress the results away from contemporary knowledge in the field. I appreciate that the brief discussion in the section titled &quot;Ensemble codes for steering&quot; tries to cover these recent updates. However, I think this would serve a better purpose in the introduction and help guide the results.</p>
<p>(2) The second major weakness is the lack of any immunohistochemistry (IHC) images quantifying the expression of the genetic tools used in these studies. Even though the main split-Gal4 tools for DNa01 and DNa02 were previously reported by Namiki et al, 2018, it is important to document the expression with the effectors used in this work and explicitly mention the expression in any ectopic neurons. Similarly, for any experiments where drivers were combined together (double recordings, functional connectivity) or modified for stochastic expression (Figure 8), IHC images are absolutely necessary. Without this evidence, it is difficult to trust many of the results (especially in the case of behavioral experiments in Figure 8). For example, the DNa01 genetic driver used by the authors is also expressed in some neurons in the nerve cord (as shown on the Flylight webpage of Janelia Research Campus). One wonders if all or part of the results described in Figure 8 are due to DNa01 manipulation or manipulation of the nerve cord neurons. The same applies for optic lobe neurons in the DNa02 driver.</p>
<p>(3) The paper starts off with a comparative analysis of the roles of DNa01 and DNa02 during steering. Unfortunately, after this initial analysis, DNa01 is largely ignored for further characterization (e.g. with respect to inputs, connectomics, etc.), only to return in the final figure for behavioral characterization where DNa01 seems to have a stronger silencing phenotype compared to DNa02. I couldn't find an explanation for this imbalance in the characterization of DNa01 versus DNa02. Is this due to technical reasons? Or was it an informed decision due to some results? In addition to being a biased characterization, this also results in the manuscript lacking a coherent thread, which in turn makes it a bit inaccessible to the non-specialist.</p>
<p>(4) There seems to be a discrepancy with regard to what is emphasized in the main text and what is shown in Figures S3/S4 in relation to the role of these DNs in backward walking. There are only two sentences in the main text where these figures are cited.</p>
<p>
a) &quot;DNa01 and DNa02 firing rate increases were not consistently followed by large changes in forward velocity (Figs. 1G and S3).&quot;</p>
<p>
b) &quot;We found that rotational velocity was consistently related to the difference in right-left firing rates (Fig. 3B). This relationship was essentially linear through its entire dynamic range, and was consistent across paired recordings (Fig. 3C). It was also consistent during backward walking, as well as forward walking (Fig. S4).&quot;</p>
<p>
These main text sentences imply the role of the difference between left and right DNa02 in turning. However, the actual plots in the Figures S3 and S4 and their respective legends seem to imply a role in &quot;backward walking&quot;. For instance, see this sentence from the legend of Figure S3 &quot;When (ΔvoltageDNa02&gt;&gt;ΔvoltageDNa01), the fly is typically moving backward. When (firing rateDNa02&gt;&gt;firing rateDNa01), the fly is also often moving backward, but forward movement is still more common overall, and so the net effect is that forward velocity is small but still positive when (firing rateDNa02&gt;&gt;firing rateDNa01). Note that when we condition our analysis on behavior rather than neural activity, we do see that backward walking is associated with a large firing rate differential (Fig. S4).&quot; This sort of discrepancy in what is emphasized in the text, versus what is emphasized in the figures, ends up confusing the reader. More importantly, I do not agree with any of these conclusions regarding the implication of backward walking. Both Figures S3 and S4 are riddled with caveats, misinterpretations, and small sample sizes. As a result, I actually support the authors' decision to not infer too much from these figures in the &quot;main text&quot;. In fact, I would recommend going one step further and removing/modifying these figures to focus on the role of &quot;rotational velocity&quot;. Please find my concerns about these two figures below:</p>
<p>
a) In Figures S3 and S4, every heat map has a different scale for the same parameter: forward velocity. S3A is -10 to +10mm/s. S3B is -6 to +6 S4B (left) is -12 to +12 and S4B (right) is -4 to +4. Since the authors are trying to depict results based on the color-coding this is highly problematic.</p>
<p>
b) Figure S3A legend &quot;When (ΔvoltageDNa02&gt;&gt;ΔvoltageDNa01), the fly is typically moving backward.&quot; There are also several instances when ΔvoltageDNa02= ΔvoltageDNa01 and both are low (lower left quadrant) when the fly is typically moving backwards. So in my opinion, this figure in fact suggests DNa02 has no role in backward velocity control.</p>
<p>
c) Based on the example traces in S4A, every time the fly walks backwards it is also turning. Based on this it is important to show absolute rotational velocity in Figure S4C. It could be that the fly is turning around the backward peak which would change the interpretation from Figure S4C. Also, it is important to note that the backward velocities in S4A are unprecedentedly high. No previous reports show flies walking backwards at such high velocities (for example see Chen et al 2018, Nat Comm. for backward walking velocities on a similar setup).</p>
<p>
d) In my opinion, Figure S4D showing that right-left DNa02 correlates with rotational velocity, regardless of whether the fly is in a forward or backward walking state, is the only important and conclusive result in Figures S3/S4. These figures should be rearranged to only emphasize this panel.</p>
<p>(5) Figure 3 shows a really nice analysis of the bilateral DNa02 recordings data. While Figure S5 shows that authors have a similar dataset for DNa01, a similar level analysis (Figures 3D, E) is not done for DNa01 data. Is there a reason why this is not done?</p>
<p>(6) In Figure 4 since the authors have trials where bump-jump led to turning in the opposite direction to the DNa02 being recorded, I wonder if the authors could quantify hyperpolarization in DNa02 as is predicted from connectomics data in Figure 7.</p>
<p>(7) Figure 6 suggests that DNa02 contains information about latent steering drives. This is really interesting. However, in order to unequivocally claim this, a higher-resolution postural analysis might be needed. Especially given that DNa02 activation does not reliably evoke ipsilateral turning, these &quot;latent&quot; steering events could actually contain significant postural changes driven by DNa02 (making them &quot;not latent&quot;). Without this information, at least the authors need to explicitly mention this caveat.</p>
<p>(8) Figure 7 would really benefit from connectome data with synapse numbers (or weighted arrows) and a corresponding analysis of DNa01.</p>
<p>(9) In Figure 8E, the most obvious neuronal silencing phenotype is decreased sideways velocity in the case of DNa01 optogenetic silencing. In Figure S2, the inverse filter for sideways velocity for DNa01 had a higher amplitude than the rotational velocity filter. Taken together, does this point at some role for DNa01 in sideways velocity specifically?</p>
<p>(10) In Figure 8G, the effect on inner hind leg stance prolongation is very weak, and given the huge sample size, hard to interpret. Also, it is not clear how this fits with the role of DNa01 in slow sustained turning based on recordings.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their feedback. We are currently revising the manuscript to address their questions and concerns. Here we briefly summarize our planned revisions.</p>
<p>Reviewer 1 requested clarification on three points. We will clarify all these points with text edits. One point is brief enough to be addressed here: in cases when we pooled data from the left and right hemispheres, the reviewer wants to know how this was done. Simply put, we defined the “ipsi” side of the body as the side where the recorded DN resided, and we defined “contra” as the other side.</p>
<p>Reviewer 2 requested clarification on two minor points. We will clarify these points with text edits and with an additional analysis.</p>
<p>Reviewer 3 had a number of substantive concerns. Briefly:</p>
<p>(1) The reviewer asks us to improve its discussion of some relevant literature. We will provide updated information on the DN steering network, and in particular, we will cite Bidaye et al. 2020 and Sapkal et al. 2024. We apologize for the oversight.</p>
<p>(2) The reviewer asks us for immunofluorescent images documenting the expression patterns of our effector transgenes. With regard to GtACR1::eYPF expression, we will include these images in our resubmission. With regard to ReachR expression, we expressed this reagent stochastically under hs-FLP control, and so different brains had different expression patterns; however, we carefully documented the number of DNa02 cells that expressed ReachR in each brain. With regard to GFP expression, these expression patterns are available online from the FlyLight documentation associated with Namiki et al. eLife 2018 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://splitgal4.janelia.org/precomputed/Descending%20Neurons%202018.html">https://splitgal4.janelia.org/precomputed/Descending%20Neurons%202018.html</ext-link>). The UAS-GFP transgene used by Namiki et al. 2018 (<italic>pJFRC200-10XUASIVS-myr::smGFP-HA in attP18</italic>) is different from the UAS-GFP transgene we used (<italic>10XUAS-IVS-mCD8::GFP(su(Hw)attP8)</italic>, and so there may be minor differences in expression pattern. However, it should be noted that we only used GFP expression to target somata for patch clamp recording, and DNa01 and DNa02 somata have a distinctive location and a distinctive size; when we performed these recordings, we only targeted a soma in this location, and we verified that there were no “distractor” somata in this vicinity with similar size and appearance. The same applies to patch clamp recordings targeted via Halo7 expression (SiR110-HaloTag fluorescence). In paired recordings from both DNa02 and DN01, we verified the identity of each cell as described in Fig. S1.</p>
<p>(3) The reviewer asks why we focused on DNa02 in the latter part of the manuscript, rather than DNa01. We made this decision because DNa02 is more highly predictive of steering behavior, as compared to DNa01 (Fig. 1H). Also, an impulse of DNa02 activity is followed by a relatively large turning maneuver, on average, whereas an impulse of DNa01 activity is followed by a relatively small turning maneuver (Fig. 1E-F). Moreover, DNa02 has many more synaptic inputs in the brain (Fig. 7A), and it has many more direct synaptic connections onto motor neurons (Fig. 1B).</p>
<p>(4) The reviewer highlights difficulties in interpreting DN activity during backward movement (Figs. S3/S4). We included this material in the spirit of completeness, but we agree with the reviewer that it is difficult to interpret. In our revision, we will omit Fig. S3C and Fig. S4A-B, and we will revise these legends to improve clarity.</p>
<p>(5) The reviewer asks why do a systematic analysis of paired DNa01 recordings, as we did for DNa02. It is difficult to get paired right/left recordings from two DNs of the same type in the same fly, while the fly is walking vigorously, and we were only able to get two such paired recordings from DNa01. We did not feel this was a sufficiently large sample size to support a systematic analysis. We chose not to invest more time in getting more paired DNa01 recordings because we thought that DNa02 was more important, for the reasons noted above.</p>
<p>(6) The reviewer asks for an analysis of trials where bump-jump led to turning in the opposite direction to the DNa02 being recorded. We will provide this analysis in the revision.</p>
<p>(7) The reviewer points out that “latent” steering drives might not be latent, as they might produce small postural changes we are not capturing. This is a fair point, and we will note this in our revision.</p>
<p>(8) The reviewer asks for a systematic analysis of DNa01 inputs in Figure 7, similar to our analysis of DNa02 inputs. Here we would prefer to focus on DNa02, for three reasons. First, we think DNa02 is likely more important, for the reasons noted above. Second, there has been some uncertainty as to the identity of DNa01 in connectome data; indeed, in the hemibrain data set, the cell recently identified as DNa01 was annotated as VES006 (Schlegel et al. <italic>Nature</italic> 634: 139-152). Third, the cell now identified as DNa01 does not receive direct input from either the central complex or the mushroom body, and for this reason, we felt that the inputs to DNa01 might be less interesting to a general audience.</p>
<p>(9) The reviewer wonders whether DNa01 is more involved in sideways movement, rather than rotational movement. Our data do not support this conclusion: rather, our data show that DNa01 is only weakly correlated with sideways movement. Thus, the forward filter (Fig. 1F) shows that an impulse of DNa01 activity is (on average) followed by a relatively small amount of sideways movement. Conversely, the reverse filter (in Fig. S2I) shows that an impulse of sideways movement is (on average) preceded by a relatively large amount of DNa01 activity.</p>
<p>(10) The reviewer points out that the phenotype associated with optogenetic suppression in Fig. 8G is weak. We will highlight this point and discuss potential reasons for this weak phenotype in the revision.</p>
