<title>Abstract</title><p>Since the trabecular meshwork (TM) is central to intraocular pressure (IOP) regulation and glaucoma, a deeper understanding of its genomic landscape is needed. We present a multimodal, single-cell resolution analysis of mouse limbal cells (includes TM). In total, we sequenced 9,394 wild-type TM cell transcriptomes. We discovered three TM cell subtypes with characteristic signature genes validated by immunofluorescence on tissue sections and whole-mounts. The subtypes are robust, being detected in datasets for two diverse mouse strains and in independent data from two institutions. Results show compartmentalized enrichment of critical pathways in specific TM cell subtypes. Distinctive signatures include increased expression of genes responsible for 1) extracellular matrix structure and metabolism (TM1 subtype), 2) secreted ligand signaling to support Schlemm’s canal cells (TM2), and 3) contractile and mitochondrial/metabolic activity (TM3). ATAC-sequencing data identified active transcription factors in TM cells, including LMX1B. Mutations in <italic>LMX1B</italic> cause high IOP and glaucoma. LMX1B is emerging as a key transcription factor for normal mitochondrial function and its expression is much higher in TM3 cells than other limbal cells. To understand the role of LMX1B in TM function and glaucoma, we single-cell sequenced limbal cells from <italic>Lmx1b<sup>V265D/+</sup></italic> mutant mice. In <italic>V265D/+</italic> mice, TM3 cells were uniquely affected by pronounced mitochondrial pathway changes. This supports a primary role of mitochondrial dysfunction within TM3 cells in initiating the IOP elevation that causes glaucoma in these mice. Importantly, treatment with vitamin B<sub>3</sub> (nicotinamide), to enhance mitochondrial function and metabolic resilience, significantly protected <italic>Lmx1b</italic> mutant mice from IOP elevation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aqueous humor (AH) dynamics and pressure homeostasis are important for proper ocular inflation and vision. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a key risk factor for glaucoma, a serious blinding disorder that affects 80 million people worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Quigley and Broman, 2006</xref>). IOP is controlled by continually adjusting resistance to drainage (outflow) of AH through the trabecular meshwork (TM) and Schlemm’s canal (SC), the primary route of AH outflow from the eye. AH percolates through the TM before exiting the eye through SC and then entering the venous circulation. As the most abundant constituent of the conventional outflow pathway, TM cells are central in regulating AH drainage and IOP. Despite significant advances over the past few decades, a much deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing TM cell health and function, as well as the pathological alterations responsible for increased outflow resistance, elevated IOP, and increased glaucoma risk are still needed.</p>
<p>The TM is located at the inner aspect of the wall of the eye at the iridocorneal angle just anterior to where the iris and cornea meet (i.e. the limbus). In humans, the TM is morphologically separated into distinct zones, including the uveal, corneoscleral, and juxtacanalicular trabecular meshwork (JCT), which lies adjacent to the SC. AH first drains through the uveal and corneoscleral meshwork whose TM cells have endothelial-like properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Buffault et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Keller and Peters, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Stamer and Clark, 2017</xref>). In these regions, the TM consists of beams and plates made of various extracellular matrix (ECM) components including fibrillar collagens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Abu-Hassan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Acott and Kelley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Fuchshofer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Vittal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Yue, 1996</xref>). The beams and plates are covered with monolayers of TM cells. AH drains through a tortuous series of intertrabecular spaces, which run between the beams, ensuring interaction with TM cells. Next, AH flows into the less structured JCT region before entering the SC. The JCT consists of TM cells that are fibroblast-like extending their processes onto neighboring JCT and SC cells. JCT TM cells are embedded within a diffuse ECM ground substance (including glycosaminoglycans, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Johnson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Keller and Acott, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Stamer and Clark, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Vranka et al., 2015</xref>) and have contractile smooth muscle-like properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Stamer and Clark, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Tian et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, cells in the JCT region impose critical resistance to AH outflow with a major site of resistance to outflow being located in the tissue where the JCT and SC meet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Acott and Kelley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Johnson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Overby et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Tamm, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Regulation of AH outflow resistance and IOP homeostasis by TM cells is complicated. AH outflow is modulated by: 1) The physical properties (shape/volume and contractility) of the TM cells. For example, some TM cells have smooth muscle-like properties that adjust outflow resistance and thus IOP by controlling cellular contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Rao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Syriani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Thieme et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Tian and Kaufman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Zhang and Rao, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Rao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). 2) The effects of different TM cell types on both the composition and abundance of ECM in the JCT due to ECM synthesis/ metabolism and phagocytic activity. 3) The paracrine or physical effects of TM cells on SC and possibly the vasculature just distal to SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Balasubramanian et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Kizhatil et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Stamer and Acott, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Thomson et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to their importance, a more detailed molecular characterization of TM cells is still required. The degree to which specific pathways and modulatory roles are compartmentalized or shared by specific TM cell subtypes and how specific subtypes influence each other and the SC are not known. In fact, the number of molecularly distinct subtypes is currently unknown as is the role of the &gt; 120 genes associated with elevated IOP within these subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Gharahkhani et al., 2021</xref>). Although the TM has fewer beams and a narrower drainage path in mice, developmental, functional and anatomical similarities between human and mouse TM make mice a valuable model for studying the molecular characteristics, heterogeneity, subtypes and distribution of TM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Smith et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Single-cell resolution transcriptomic profiling is revolutionizing the molecular characterization of cell types and cellular heterogeneity (single-cell RNA sequencing, scRNA-seq; and single-nucleus, snRNA-seq). Initial single-cell-level studies have characterized cell types of the ocular anterior segment, including TM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Balasubramanian et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Patel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Thomson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">van Zyl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">van Zyl et al., 2022</xref>), but further depth, validation, and more uniform molecular consensus/ naming of cell types are needed. This is especially true for TM cells. Currently, reports differ in the naming and definition of TM cell subtypes and offer limited validation by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or immunofluorescence (IF) on tissue sections or flat mounts.</p>
<p>Here we more deeply characterized the mouse TM and validated findings by immunostaining tissue sections and flat mounts and by in situ hybridization (ISH). We independently isolated and sequenced limbal cells of mice at 2 institutions and characterized the same 3 TM cell subtypes at both. Additionally, single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC-seq) identified LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 beta (LMX1B) as one of the most active transcription factors in TM cells. Variants in <italic>LMX1B</italic> cause IOP elevation and glaucoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Choquet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Gharahkhani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Khawaja et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">MacGregor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Shiga et al., 2018</xref>). By analyzing <italic>Lmx1b<sup>V265D/+</sup></italic> mutant mice (develop elevated IOP and glaucoma, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Cross et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Tolman et al., 2021</xref>), we show that mitochondrial pathways are primarily disturbed in the TM3 cell subtype, which most strongly expresses <italic>Lmx1b</italic>. Treatment with nicotinamide lessened IOP elevation in <italic>Lmx1b<sup>V265D/+</sup></italic> mutants supporting testing of therapeutics that boost mitochondrial health and function in human patients.</p>

<title>Three molecularly distinct TM cell subtypes</title>
<p>Using scRNA-seq, we sequenced 17,914 cells from dissected limbal tissue (contains drainage structures) of 2-month-old mice. The dataset included 13,251 cells from strain C57BL/6J (B6) and 4,663 cells from strain 129/Sj (129). The data for both strains were integrated (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). Computational analysis revealed six distinct clusters of cells that were TM-containing, epithelia, pigmented epithelia (iris and ciliary body), endothelial, immune and neuron (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The identity of each of these cell clusters was based on various well-characterized marker genes (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Balasubramanian et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Thomson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">van Zyl et al., 2020</xref>). There were no major differences in the distributions of strain B6 and strain 129 cells within the relevant cell-type clusters (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A-C</xref>). Therefore, to improve statistical power, downstream analyses used the integrated dual-strain dataset.</p>

All diagrams based on marker gene expression in the cells that were clustered together. Despite some naming differences, matches for the 3 TM cell types that we identify in the current paper are evident in the previous studies. Although previous studies named additional TM subtypes, we did not subcluster to the same degree to ensure that subtype differences are robust. Previous studies had limited if any validation for some cell types. Based on our current characterization and immunofluorescent localization studies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>, S6, S8, &amp; S9) some of the cells previously labeled TM beam cells are scleral (possibly fibroblasts). The marker gene expression for these previously named TM beam cells is highest in ‘Fibroblasts’ rather than TM cells in human scRNA-seq data, further supporting a scleral identity. In addition, cells previously named as uveal cells are a TM cell type. The cells are color-coded based on their molecular identities to match the current study. Current study subcluster identity numbers are shown. <bold>(B)</bold> Dot plot of TM cell subtype markers identified in the present study (left) using the dataset and cell type assignments (bottom) of Van Zyl et al.

Unbiased sub-clustering of Cluster 1 revealed 10 distinct sub-clusters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), which included three TM cell clusters based on signature gene expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref>).

<p>Next, we integrated an additional limbal tissue scRNA-seq dataset (14,912 cells, Duke University) from 3 months old C57BL/6J mice with our initial 2 months old C57BL/6J dataset. Due to batch effects most likely based on differences in cell isolation techniques and environment (Columbia University vs. Duke University, see Methods), TM cells from these datasets occupied adjacent, partially overlapping, but not identical UMAP space (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>). Individual analysis of the Duke dataset also identified 3 TM cell subtypes with the same marker gene expression and enriched molecular pathways compared to the Columbia University data (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B-E</xref>, Table S1). In datasets from previous mouse limbal scRNA-seq studies, there was also a high degree of overlap of marker gene expression with our 3 TM cell clusters (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A-B</xref>, Table S2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Thomson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Ujiie et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">van Zyl et al., 2020</xref>). However, some TM subtype clusters reported in previous studies expressed genes that overlapped with both of our TM2 and scleral cell clusters. (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Thomson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">van Zyl et al., 2020</xref>). To resolve this discrepancy, we performed IF for two of the discordantly annotated markers previously reported to be expressed in TM cells but present in our scleral cluster (CD34 and LY6C1). This immunolabeling showed that these markers are expressed in scleral but not TM cells (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A-B</xref>). In addition, in previous studies, cells with markers matching TM3 (e.g. <italic>Lypd1</italic>) were named uveal cells without IF confirmation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Thomson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Ujiie et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">van Zyl et al., 2020</xref>). IF revealed that our TM3 cells are neither located in the uvea nor abundant in the uveal adjacent TM but primarily reside in the anterior TM closer to the cornea (see below).</p>

<title>TM subtypes differentially occupy TM zones</title>
<p>To further explore the sub-anatomical localization of the TM cell subtypes, we used a combination of IF and ISH to identify subtype markers. Each TM cell subtype had a higher percentage of cells expressing, and an increased average expression of, its respective subtype markers (all P &lt; 1E-100) compared to other TM cells, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7A</xref>). To analyze the distribution of subtypes, we first divided the TM into zones along its anterior/posterior and inner/outer axes (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7B-E</xref>). The total area of TM occupied by each individual subtype marker was assessed in each zone on more than 150 tissue sections. This detected biases for the subtypes to be differentially localized in specific TM zones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-F</xref>). For instance, TM1 cells were significantly more frequent in the posterior and outer TM zones, while TM3 cells were overrepresented in the anterior and inner zones (all P &lt; 0.01). The different marker molecules that were assessed for each TM cell subtype gave highly consistent results regarding zonal occupancy (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8A-B</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9</xref>). In addition, we confirmed the localization biases in 3D whole mounts of the mouse limbus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Kizhatil et al., 2014</xref>, for TM1: MYOC and TM3: α-SMA markers; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G-H</xref>).

The area of the TM that was positive for each marker within each region was calculated as a percentage of the total area occupied by that marker in the entire TM on each section.

This typically aligned with the most anterior portion of SC. The outer boundary of the TM was immediately internal to the inner wall of SC. The inner-most TM was where the TM cells end abutting the anterior chamber. Using these boundaries, the anterior-posterior and inner-outer axis of the TM were measured. Based on these measurements for each eye, the TM was divided in half along both the inner-outer and anterior-posterior axes. (<bold>F</bold>) For more refined analysis, the anterior-posterior distance was then divided into thirds to generate posterior, central, and anterior regions.

<p>To better understand the location of TM cell subtypes, we analyzed marker expression patterns in 50-60 exceptionally high-quality sections for each marker of each TM cell subtype (see Methods). For this analysis, the TM was divided into eight regions (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7F</xref>). Not only did this refine the localization bias of TM1 and TM3 cells, but it discovered that TM2 cells are most concentrated in the mid-posterior two-thirds of the TM (mid regarding inner-outer axis, all P &lt; 0.01, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I-K</xref>). Despite their biased distributions, some cells of each TM subtype were detected in most TM regions.</p>

<title>Molecular comparison of TM cell subtypes</title>
<p>To determine the molecular functions of TM cells, we first conducted gene ontology (GO) analysis using genes that were differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in all TM cells as a group compared to other sequenced cells (Table S3). Additionally, we used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to assess whether these GO pathways are relatively enriched or underrepresented in TM cells. Compared to other cells, TM cells were enriched for pathways associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) structure and function, including signaling associated with collagens, proteases, integrins, and glycosaminoglycans (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Figure S10A</xref>, Table S4). TM cells were also enriched for growth factor signaling. Conversely, underrepresented pathways in TM cells were associated with desmosomes, peroxisomes, and certain cytoskeletal and plasma membrane elements. These pathways help define TM cells relative to other cells in the region.</p>

Both TM1 and TM2 cells have enriched expression of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-C</xref>, <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Figure S10B-C</xref>). GAGs in the JCT and intertrabecular spaces form a gel-like consistency and changes in GAG abundance correlate with altered AH outflow resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Knepper et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Knepper et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Knepper and McLone, 1985</xref>). TM2 cells are uniquely enriched for the laminin complex, a key component of basement membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Aumailley, 2013</xref>). Pathways related to clearing debris and monitoring the extracellular environment including phagocytic vesicles, antigen presentation, and lysosomal function are also enhanced in TM2 cells. In contrast, TM3 cells are underrepresented for ECM-related pathways compared to other TM cells but are enriched for pathways related to actin binding and mitochondrial metabolism (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Figure S10D</xref>).

<p>We next compared growth factor signaling and ligand-target interactions between TM cells subtypes and other cells.

<title>Comparison to human TM cells</title>
<p>We next worked to relate our findings to human data. We compared marker genes for each of our TM cell subtypes to sequenced human TM cells from two previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Patel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">van Zyl et al., 2020</xref>). These previous studies differed in the number of human TM cell subtypes that they reported and in the identities of their clusters. Van Zyl et al. identified three TM cell subtypes that they called JCT, beam A, and beam B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">van Zyl et al., 2020</xref>), whereas Patel et al. identified two subtypes that they called fibroblast-like and myofibroblast-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Patel et al., 2020</xref>). TM1 marker genes were most enriched in Van Zyl et al’s human JCT cells (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Figure S12A</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Dcn</italic> was expressed in mouse TM1 cells and was localized to fibroblast-like TM cells adjacent to SC by Patel et al. TM1 cell nuclei were typically shorter with greater sphericity than the elongated endothelial-like nuclei of TM3 cells (<xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Figure S13A-D</xref>). This nuclear morphology was more consistent with a JCT than beam cell identity. Together, these data support a JCT identity for TM1 cells. TM2 cells were more closely related to human beam A and beam B cells than to the JCT cells reported by Van Zyl et al (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Figure S12B</xref>). TM2 cells also shared expression of the <italic>RSPO2</italic> marker gene with the human myofibroblast-like cells reported by Patel et al. Together, this suggests that TM2 cells are myofibroblast-like beam cells. TM3 cells also shared marker genes with Patel et al’s myofibroblast-like cells (<italic>TAGLN</italic> and <italic>ACTA2</italic>), suggesting TM3 cells are also beam cells. There was relatively equal TM3 marker gene enrichment across all human TM cell subtypes of Van Zyl et al (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Figure S12C</xref>). Nuclei immediately adjacent to TM2 and TM3 cell marker staining had an elongated, endothelial-like shape (<xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Figure S13A-C</xref>). This nuclear morphology was also consistent with the location of TM2 and TM3 cells on beams and analogous to the endothelial-like morphology of human beam cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Stamer and Clark, 2017</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we evaluated the expression of genes implicated in elevated IOP and glaucoma by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). TM1 and TM2 cells had similar expression levels of GWAS genes associated with IOP elevation and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) respectively (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Figure S14A</xref>). TM3 cells had slightly less expression of these GWAS genes compared to TM1 and TM2. To better understand the genes driving GWAS gene enrichment in different TM subtypes, we studied pathways that are significantly enriched for GWAS genes (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Figure S14B-C</xref>, see Table S6 for complete list). TM1 cells were the most enriched for genes involved in ECM organization, cell-substrate adhesion, and growth factor stimulus (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Figure S14D</xref>). All 3 TM subtypes had similar expression of GWAS genes associated with hormone stimulus, <italic>Vegf</italic> signaling, and <italic>Rho</italic> kinase signaling.

<title>Regulation of TM cell gene expression</title>
<p>To better understand the overlap and differences in transcriptional control of TM cell gene expression, we performed single-cell resolution multiome sequencing. Using limbal strip tissue isolated from a separate cohort of mice than those used for scRNA-seq, we simultaneously performed both single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and snATAC-seq. We thus captured both gene expression and open chromatin data throughout the genome in the same cell. Using the snRNA-seq data, we clustered cells into various cell types. The generated clusters and their marker genes closely agreed with our scRNA-seq analyses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref>, <xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Figure S15A</xref>).

This included an increase in chromatin accessibility at the promoters of marker genes in their respective TM cell subtypes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-E</xref>).

<p>Our findings implicated perturbed metabolism within TM3 cells as responsible for IOP elevation in an <italic>Lmx1b</italic> glaucoma model. Nicotinamide (NAM) is known to boost nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), supporting healthy metabolism/ mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Schondorf et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Williams et al., 2017b</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that the metabolic abnormalities in TM3 cells underlie the IOP elevation that causes glaucoma, and that NAM treatment may protect the <italic>Lmx1b</italic> mutant TM. Beyond <italic>LMX1B</italic>, this hypothesis is relevant more commonly to POAG treatment because metabolism-relevant genes are implicated by GWAS (and their expression is enriched in TM3 cells, <xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Figure S14E</xref>). To test our hypothesis, we treated mice by adding NAM to their drinking water starting at postnatal day 2 and continuing into adulthood. Results showed that NAM supplementation significantly protected against anterior chamber deepening (ACD, a symptom of IOP elevation, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-B</xref>) and IOP elevation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C-D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study provides a comprehensive multimodal analysis of mouse limbal cells that focuses on the TM. We defined three TM cell subtypes with unique marker panels that can be used for their identification across different strains, laboratories, and processing methods. We validated key marker gene expression by IF and ISH, discovering biases for specific TM subtypes to reside in different parts of the TM. For example, TM1 cells have a location bias for the outer, posterior TM while TM3 cells are more abundant in the inner, anterior TM. Importantly, our pathway analyses suggest that the different TM subtypes have overlapping roles. All 3 TM subtypes are enriched in ECM synthesis and ECM metabolism compared to other limbal subtypes. However, there is also compartmentalized enrichment of some processes to specific subtypes. For example, ECM production and turnover, secreted ligand signaling, debris removal, immune surveillance, actin-associated cell contraction and increased metabolic gene activity (as discussed below) are enriched in specific cell-subtypes. Using ATAC-seq data, we discovered key transcription factors controlling gene expression in TM cells, including LMX1B. Importantly, we implicate LMX1B in metabolic control in TM cells. More specifically, we demonstrate that <italic>Lmx1b</italic> is most active in TM3 cells, while mutation of <italic>Lmx1b</italic> induces prominent mitochondrial defects in TM3 cells. Finally, we show that therapeutically targeting TM3 dysfunction with a mitochondrial/ metabolism supporting nutrient (nicotinamide) protects from IOP elevation in the <italic>Lmx1b</italic> glaucoma model. We also suggest that a TM3-like cell is generally relevant to metabolic pathways in human glaucoma based on enriched expression of human glaucoma GWAS gene in TM3 cells. Together these data provide a wealth of new molecular information about TM cells and suggest a new approach for preventing IOP elevation.</p>

<title>Mouse trabecular meshwork subtype classification</title>
<p>Here we provide evidence for three TM cell subtypes in mice that are robust across datasets from different institutions, using different tissue processing and sequencing protocols. Although others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Thomson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Ujiie et al., 2023</xref>) subdivided TM cell subtypes beyond the three defined in the present study, at this point we decided against further subdivision (See <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>) for the following reasons. We lacked confidence in the higher resolution clustering, as it was not consistent across datasets, did not produce unique marker gene sets, and could have resulted in over-clustering due to stochastic or stress-induced differences between subpopulations of cells. Moreover, the number of reported mouse TM cell clusters in previous studies were inconsistent. Although three TM subtypes were reported by Van Zyl et al. and Ujiie et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Ujiie et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">van Zyl et al., 2020</xref>), the molecular features of cells in these clusters were not the same across these studies. Differences between studies may be due to batch effects, different computational methods and possibly over-clustering. Most importantly, there was very limited validation by IF, IHC, or other methods in previous studies. Only the JCT type of TM cell in these previous studies was assessed by means other than scRNA-seq (IF and ISH, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">van Zyl et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, Thompson et al. treated cells with Y27632, a ROCK inhibitor, which could alter TM cell transcriptomes. It is also important to point out that both Thompson et al. and Van Zyl et al. used albino mouse strains, which can impact TM cell development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Libby et al., 2003</xref>). Finally, Ujiie et al. sequenced TM cells at 3-4 weeks, which is prior to full maturation of the TM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Smith et al., 2001</xref>), while our ongoing developmental studies show substantial molecular maturation of TM cells between P21 and P60.</p>
<p>As Van Zyl et al’s data is deposited in the Broad Institute’s single-cell portal, we further compared their data with ours. Although both Van Zyl et al. and our current paper identified 3 TM subtypes, our work does not fully agree. Some of the cells named beam A and beam Y by Van Zyl et al. express markers present in our TM2 cell subtype, while others express markers that are absent in TM2 cells but present in our scleral cells. Our IF studies confirm that these discordant markers are not expressed in TM cells, but instead show that they are in fact scleral cells. These scleral cells highly express fibroblast markers including <italic>Mfap5</italic>, <italic>Clec3b</italic>, and <italic>Tnxb</italic>, suggesting they are scleral fibroblasts. Cells initially named uveal cells by Van Zyl et al. (and subsequently by Ujiie et al. and Thompson et al.) express markers of our TM3 cells. Consistent with our gene expression data, our IF shows that these Van Zyl markers are expressed by cells that are primarily located in the TM region that is closer to the cornea and not in the uvea or the TM region adjacent to the uvea. Thus, our current study resolves some previous inconsistencies in classifying mouse TM cell subtypes. It lays a firmer foundation for continued understanding of TM cell types and their biology. Moving ahead, sequencing cells at greater depths will enhance TM cell characterization and improve comparisons between datasets.</p>

<title>Differential roles of specific mouse TM cell subtypes and comparison to human</title>
<p>As a group, all TM cells share various molecular properties that distinguish them from other ocular cells. Our analyses determine the expression of IOP, and glaucoma genes identified by GWAS in TM cell subtypes as well as in other limbal cells. Pathways enriched across all TM cell subtypes based on RNA-seq are largely related to ECM (including collagens, integrins, and glycosaminoglycan pathways), cell-cell signaling, and growth factor signaling. This fits with an essential role of the TM in both ECM synthesis/turnover and in signaling to the SC to maintain IOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Balasubramanian et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Fuchshofer and Tamm, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Keller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Stamer and Acott, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Thomson et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, genes associated with intermediate filaments, which function in determining cell shape and structure and can also act as mechanical stress absorbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Herrmann et al., 2007</xref>), are underrepresented in TM cells. Lower levels of intermediate filaments may enable TM cells to alter their shape to respond to changes in IOP.</p>
<p>Mouse TM1 cells closely resemble sequenced human JCT cells. Like human JCT cells, the majority of TM1 cells are located nearest to the SC inner wall, particularly adjacent to the posterior of the mouse SC. Human JCT cells are generally accepted to be embedded in a more diffuse ECM and to not cover the collagenous trabecular beams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Keller and Acott, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Stamer and Clark, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Vranka et al., 2015</xref>). In vivo, a proportion of TM1 cells have a shorter, more spherical nuclear morphology, consistent with JCT cell identity. Importantly, the JCT region is critical in determining resistance to AH outflow and in regulating IOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Acott and Kelley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ethier, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Johnson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Stamer and Acott, 2012</xref>). JCT cells have fibroblast-like properties, including the secretion of ECM proteins and degradation enzymes to support continuous ECM remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Acott et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Keller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Stamer and Clark, 2017</xref>). The subset of TM1 cells that lie distant from SC have more beam cell-like, elongated nuclear morphology. This suggests that either our TM1 cluster contains more than 1 TM cell subtype or that the morphology of a single TM1 cell subtype is influenced by local environment. This needs to be resolved by future studies. Compared to the other TM cell subtypes, TM1 cell pathways are enriched in both ECM structural molecules, such as collagens and integrins, and TGF-β signaling, which increases ECM production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Munger and Sheppard, 2011</xref>). Notably, excessive TGF-β signaling and ECM production can lead to fibrosis and elevate IOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Biernacka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Frangogiannis, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Meng et al., 2016</xref>). These data suggest that TM1 cells play an important role in the constant remodeling of the ECM. However, dysregulation of these pathways can be pathogenic.</p>
<p>TM2 cells molecularly resemble previously sequenced human TM beam cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Patel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">van Zyl et al., 2020</xref>). This includes overlap of expression of top TM2 signature gene expression with sequenced human beam cells. Consistent with a beam cell identity, TM2 cells are located more towards the mid and inner TM than most TM1 cells. TM2 cells have an elongated nuclear morphology, consistent with the previously established beam cell morphology of cells in the regions they occupy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Overby et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Smith et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Stamer and Clark, 2017</xref>). Beam cells have endothelial-like properties, such as maintaining the patency of the AH outflow tract through the production of antithrombotic molecules. Proteases and molecules classically known as antithrombotic and thrombolytic maintain fluid flow through the TM by preventing build-up of protein aggregates to maintain fluid drainage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Acott and Kelley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Stamer and Acott, 2012</xref>). Such molecules include glycosaminoglycans, like heparin, the serine protease tPA and matrix metalloprotease that are all highly expressed in TM2 cells. Beam cells are also phagocytic and this activity along with turnover of ECM further cleans the TM (called filtering) to enhance fluid drainage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Stamer and Clark, 2017</xref>). Human Beam cells also participate in antigen presentation and modulation of inflammation through cytokines and major histocompatibility proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Shifera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Stamer and Clark, 2017</xref>), consistent with TM2 cells being enriched for these immune pathways/ molecules. Additionally, our data suggest that signaling from TM2 cells to SC endothelial cells is mediated by soluble molecules including <italic>Vegfa</italic>, <italic>Edn3</italic>, and <italic>Angpt1</italic>, which are critical for SC maintenance and function. This links TM2 cells to ocular development and glaucoma. VEGF receptor and ANGPT signaling genes modulate SC development/ function as well as contribute to developmental and primary open-angle glaucoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Aspelund et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Kabra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Khawaja et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Kizhatil et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">MacGregor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Souma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Thomson et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>TM3 cells also have a location and elongated nuclear morphology resembling beam cells with enriched localization in the inner, anterior TM. TM3 cell-enriched processes include actin binding, and modulation of the actomyosin system, which is known to modulate outflow resistance and IOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Rao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). As such, TM3 cells express a large percentage of glaucoma-associated genes involved in actin binding at a high level. Importantly, TM3 cells are enriched for various mitochondrial metabolic and antioxidant pathways, including those associated with IOP elevation and glaucoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aboobakar et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Khawaja et al., 2016</xref>). Inhibiting metabolic pathways alters AH outflow resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Reina-Torres et al., 2020</xref>). Since maintaining contractile tone is an energy-intensive process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">DeWane et al., 2021</xref>), this could explain the enrichment of energy metabolism pathways in TM3 cells compared to other TM cells.</p>

<title>TM3 cells have a unique susceptibility to mitochondrial dysfunction</title>
<p>In addition to being enriched in mitochondrial/ energy metabolism processes, TM3 cells express <italic>Lmx1b</italic> at significantly higher levels than both the other TM cell subtypes and other limbal cells. Importantly, in heterozygous mutant <italic>V265D/+</italic> mice, TM3 cells had pronounced gene expression changes that implicate mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, but that were absent or much lower in other cells including TM1 and TM2. Together, these data suggest that mutation of <italic>Lmx1b</italic> has a primary effect on metabolism and oxidative stress in TM3 cells that subsequently leads to IOP elevation and then glaucoma. Relevantly, homozygous conditional knockout of both <italic>Lmx1b</italic> and <italic>Lmx1a</italic> as well as siRNA knockdown of <italic>Lmx1b</italic> alone impact mitochondrial functions in neurons and may contribute to Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bergman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Doucet-Beaupre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Jimenez-Moreno et al., 2023</xref>). Our data extend these published findings by showing that inheritance of a single dominant mutation in <italic>Lmx1b</italic> similarly affects metabolism in TM3 cells. In addition to modulating mitochondria, LMX1B was recently identified as a transcription factor that regulates responses to cell stress. This includes promotion of autophagy under stress conditions to enable recycling of cellular resources to maintain cellular functions and enable survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Jimenez-Moreno et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, mutation of <italic>Lmx1b</italic> may also result in a deficiency of the beneficial autophagic response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Jimenez-Moreno et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Although further experiments are needed, dysfunctional autophagy may further prolong and exacerbate TM cell stress, resulting in more extensive depletion of cellular resources, exacerbated cellular dysfunction, and IOP elevation. Other consequences of the <italic>Lmx1b</italic> mutation that were evident in the <italic>V265D/+</italic> cells may also contribute to IOP elevation, including the overexpression of genes associated with ribosomes and calcium signaling, and depletion of genes involved with ECM synthesis and metabolism. However, these processes were not limited to TM3 cells or even to cell types that express detectable <italic>Lmx1b</italic>, suggesting that they are secondary damaging processes that are subsequent to the initiating, <italic>Lmx1b</italic>-induced, metabolic disturbances and cell stress in TM3 cells. Thus, we hypothesize that mitochondrial abnormalities in TM3 cells are of primary importance to IOP elevation in <italic>V265D/+</italic> glaucomatous mice.</p>

<title>Nicotinamide protects against IOP elevation in <italic>Lmx1b<sup>V265D</sup></italic>-mutant mice</title>
<p>Based on our findings in TM3 cells, we tested if mitochondrial and metabolic disturbances are important in IOP elevation by administering nicotinamide (NAM). NAM is a form of vitamin B3 that is well-established to boost NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, promote mitochondrial health and energy metabolism, relieve oxidative stress and thus promote cellular resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Gomes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Imai and Guarente, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Mouchiroud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Verdin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Williams et al., 2017b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Kang and Hwang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Song et al., 2021</xref>).

Thus, treatments that support normal metabolism may protect from IOP elevation in individuals with <italic>LMX1B</italic> variants including both developmental glaucoma and POAG patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Choquet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Choquet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Gharahkhani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Khawaja et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">MacGregor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Sweeney et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Vollrath et al., 1998</xref>).

As mitochondrial defects are becoming broadly associated with glaucoma risk and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abu-Amero et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Lo Faro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Petriti et al., 2024</xref>), these treatments could have wide-ranging potential to complement and augment existing IOP-lowering therapeutics through a completely distinct mechanism.</p>
<p>Our results provide a thorough molecular characterization of mouse TM cells, providing much needed molecular information on subtype specializations in regulating IOP and the roles of specific subtypes in glaucoma. This comprehensive TM atlas provides a new foundation to guide development of new glaucoma treatments. We validate its utility by implicating metabolic changes in a single TM cell subtype in both mouse and human glaucoma, with success of a metabolic treatment targeting this subtype in a glaucoma model.</p>

The sections were then incubated with primary antibodies (see Table S7) in 200 µl blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. The sections were then washed three times for 5 m with 1× PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies were detected with the appropriate species-specific secondary antibody (all Alexa 488, 594, or 647 at 1∶1000 dilution, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) diluted in 1× PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature. The secondary detection solution also had DAPI at 1:1000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) to label nuclei. The immunostained sections were washed three times for 5 m in 1× PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100. Sections were then cover-slipped using Flouromount (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).</p>

<title>Tyramide signal amplification (TSA)</title>
<p>We performed a TSA reaction for a subtype of antibodies (See Table S7). TSA was performed on slides containing serial transverse cryosections of enucleated mouse eyes using the Akoya Biosciences TSA Plus Cyanine 3 detection kit (NEL744001KT). Freshly cut sections were allowed to come to room temperature and were then quenched for 10 minutes in a 1% hydrogen peroxide, 10% methanol in 0.01M phosphate buffered saline solution (1X PBS). The slides were rinsed in 1X PBS and allowed to block for 1 hour at room temperature in a blocking solution of 10% donkey serum, 0.3% Triton-X 100 in 1X PBS. Primaries for TSA were diluted 1:100 in blocking solution and approximately 200 microliters were added to the slides overnight at 4 degrees Celsius. The slides were then rinsed using a 0.3% Triton-X 100 in 1X PBS solution before being blocked in Tris-NaCl-blocking (TNB) buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. Approximately 200 microliters of Horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondaries diluted 1:200 in TNB buffer were applied to the slides for 2 hours at room temperature. The slides were subsequently rinsed in Tris-NaCl-Tween (TNT) buffer. TSA Plus Working Solution was made by diluting the TSA Plus Stock Solution 1:50 in 1X Amplification Diluent. The TSA Plus Working Solution was added at a volume of 200 microliters for 7 minutes at room temperature. The slides were then washed in TNT buffer and approximately 200 microliters of non-amplified primaries for counterstaining diluted 1:200 in 10% donkey serum, 0.3% Triton-X 100 in 1X PBS blocking solution was applied overnight at 4 degrees Celsius. Secondary antibody detection and mounting were performed as above.</p>

<title><italic>in situ</italic> hybridization</title>
<p>We used the RNAscope® Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2-Mm (Advanced Cell Diagnostics a Bio Techne Brand, Newark, CA). Probes for mouse <italic>Lypd1</italic> (#318361-C2), <italic>Inmt</italic> (#486371-C2), <italic>Edn3</italic> (#505841-C1), <italic>Acta2</italic> (α-SMA) (#319531-C3), and <italic>Myoc</italic> (#460981-C1) (also purchased from ACD Bio) were used. Fluorescent dyes Opal 690 (FP1497001KT) and Opal 620 (FP1495001KT) (Akoya Biosciences, Marlborough, MA) were used with each of these probes. Briefly, eyes from 3-month-old C57BL/6J were enucleated and fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h at 4°C. A window was made to the back of the eye cup, lens removed, and the anterior cup placed in 30% sucrose overnight at 4°C. Tissue was cryopreserved in OCT and placed at −80°C. Sections were cut at 12 μm thickness using SuperFrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH).. RNAscope® was performed over two days as per manufacturer’s protocol.</p>

<title>Whole mounts</title>
<p>Enucleated eyes were fixed for 2 hours at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA) prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (1× PBS, 137 mM NaCl, 10 mM phosphate, 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4). The postnatal eyes were dissected out following fixation. The anterior part of the eye was cut just posterior to the limbus (transition zone between cornea and sclera) as described in Kizhatil et al. Briefly, the iris, lens, ciliary body, and thin strip of retina were carefully removed to obtain the anterior eye cup. The anterior cup includes the cornea, limbus, and a small portion of retinal pigmented epithelium. Four centripetal cuts were made to relax the eye-cup and facilitate eventual mounting onto a slide after immunofluorescence.</p>
<p>Anterior eye cups were rinsed multiple times with 1× PBS. The eye cups were incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin and 1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS (blocking buffer) at room temperature for 1 h in 2 ml glass vials to block nonspecific binding of antibody and to permeabilize the tissue. The anterior cups were then incubated with primary antibodies (see Table S7) in 200 µl blocking buffer for 2 days, with rocking, at 4°C. The anterior cups were then washed three times over a 3-h period with 1× PBS. The primary antibodies were detected with the appropriate species-specific secondary antibody (all Alexa 488, 594, or 647 at 1∶1,000 dilution, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) diluted in blocking buffer, which also had DAPI to label nuclei. The immunostained eye cups were washed three times over a 3-h period in 1× PBS. Eye cups were then whole-mounted on slides in Fluoromount (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).</p>

<title>Microscopy of drainage structures</title>
<p>Sections: Microscopy of sectioned postnatal eye slides was performed using an LSM SP8 confocal microscope (Leica) and 40×1.1 NA water immersion objective.</p>
<p><italic>In situ</italic>: Images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse 90i confocal laser-scanning microscope (Melville). Z-stack images of 1 µm thickness, using the 40X objective lens, were taken of each section and converted into maximum projection images that were used for analysis.</p>
<p>Whole mounts: Microscopy was performed using an LSM SP8 confocal microscope (Leica) using a 63×1.4 NA glycerol immersion objective. The Mark and Find mode was used to automate collection of images, generating a folder full of Z stacks (Z = 0.3 µm) at various individual overlapping positions around the limbus. We examined n = 6 eyes total. We imaged a certain distance around the ocular circumference, with an equal representation from each ocular quadrant (1.5-2.5 mm total).</p>

<sec id="s4j">
<title>Postprocessing of whole-mount images</title>
<p>3D rendering: We followed the guidelines detailed in Kizhatil et al for visualizing SC and TM in 3D. Individual confocal Z stacks (.lsm files) were processed directly using Imaris 9.5 (Oxford Instruments, Carteret, NJ). The maximum intensity projection setting in Surpass mode of Imaris was used for 3D rendering. Controls and experimental image sets were treated identically. Images were oriented so that structures of interest were visible. For whole-mounted eyes, multiposition Z stacks generated using the Mark and Find setting on the confocal microscope were first imported into Imaris and converted into Imaris files (.ims files). The resulting Imaris files were then stitched to generate a comprehensive Z stack encompassing the limbus using ImarisStitcher 9.5 (BitPlane AG, Zurich, Switzerland). The stitch was exported as an Imaris file and processed appropriately. For sections, images were taken in the Z-plane in focus. When making figures, the snapshot feature of Imaris was used to collect images at high resolution (1024×1024 pixels, 300 dpi).</p>

<title>TM marker location analysis</title>
<p>We defined the TM as the region between the inner wall of Schlemm’s canal (SC, outer TM) and the anterior chamber (inner TM), extending from the anterior edge of the pars plana (posterior TM) to the posterior edge of Descemet’s membrane of the corneal endothelium (anterior TM). The SC was defined using a panel of validated markers that varied to allow for different antibody species and different secondary antibodies to be used in conjunction with the SC markers (See Table S7 for list of antibodies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Kizhatil et al., 2014</xref>). Sections were only included in the scoring analysis if they met the following criteria:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Absence of obvious sectioning artifacts or abnormalities in the SC or TM region.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Distinguishability of all landmarks defining the TM.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Acceptably low background signal and absence of staining for non-specific or non-biological entities within the section.</p></list-item>
</list>
For each section, the TM was segmented and analyzed in two separate ways. The anterior-posterior distance was measured, and the TM was divided in half along this axis at the midway point (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7C-D</xref>). Using the surface feature in Imaris, the area of individual marker staining was measured, and the total area in both the anterior and posterior zones was calculated. Because markers are expressed at different levels, we normalized across markers by calculating the percent of individual marker expression in the anterior and posterior halves within each section. These percentage values in anterior and posterior halves were compared both within markers and across all markers of a given TM cell subtype by Student’s t-test. The same analysis was repeated for the inner-outer halves by measuring the inner-outer TM distance at the midpoint of the TM (anterior-posterior axis) and dividing the TM in half at this value. A total of 130-160 sections were examined for markers of each individual TM cell subtype (see Table S8 for breakdown across markers). These sections were from 10-12 individual eyes per cluster. All eyes were from WT mice of C57BL/6J background and between 3-6 months of age.</p>
<p>Additional analysis was performed by selecting a subset of examined sections with staining for select markers (TM1: MYOC antibody, TM2: CRYM antibody, <italic>Inmt in situ</italic>, TM3: α-SMA antibody). These sections were of exceptionally high quality and had: 1) Anterior-posterior TM length between 125-200 µm. 2) Inner-outer TM distance is between 15-30 µm.</p>
<p>With these selected sections, we subdivided the TM into eight different zones along both inner/outer and anterior/posterior axes (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7F</xref>). For each individual section, we used Imaris to measure the anterior-posterior distance and divide the TM into three equal sectors (anterior, central, and posterior. Within each sector, the average depth of the TM was measured in Imaris. This calculation was used to divide the central and posterior sectors into three zones each (inner, intermediate, and outer). Because the anterior TM depth is thinner, we divided the anterior sector into two zones (inner and outer). In total, there were eight distinct zones.</p>
<p>The percent of total marker area was calculated for each of the eight zones for each individual section as described above. Percent of marker area in each zone was compared as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s honestly significant difference test.</p>

<title>Scleral cell marker analysis</title>
<p>For CD34 and LY6C1 expression, we examined greater than 60 sections from 4 eyes (CD34) and 3 eyes (LY6C1) respectively. The observed locations of these markers within the iridocorneal angle are described.</p>

<sec id="s4m">
<title>Whole mount marker location analysis</title>
<p>To analyze the expression of markers within the TM, we segmented the TM based on anatomy. Because various anatomical features including the pars plana were removed during the whole mount process, we used the SC (marked by PECAM) as the major anterior-posterior landmark. The TM was defined as the group of cells inner to the SC and not outside the anterior or posterior boundary of the SC.</p>

<sec id="s4n">
<title>Nuclear morphology</title>
<p>Anterior segment whole-mounts were used to examine nuclear morphology in 3D (TM1: MYOC, TM3: α-SMA, all antibodies). The TM was segmented as described above and the ‘Surface’ feature in Imaris used to demarcate TM cell nuclei. Nuclei that were analyzed were immediately adjacent to the immunolabeled TM marker and had to be well spaced from other nuclei. To ensure accuracy we used manual inspection to exclude: 1) Nuclei that were very close to other nuclei or groups of nuclei and 2) nuclei of cells that were labeled with a Schlemm’s canal endothelial cell marker (PECAM) and/ or that projected into the lumen of SC. The ‘Sphericity’ tool was used to determine the degree of sphericity in Imaris. For each cell subtype, we assessed a total 60 nuclei from 6 eyes, assessing the first 10 randomly selected nuclei that met our inclusion criteria in each eye. Groups were compared by Student’s t-test.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study provides a comprehensive single-cell and multiomic characterization of trabecular meshwork (TM) cells in the mouse eye, a structure critical to intraocular pressure (IOP) regulation and glaucoma pathogenesis. Using scRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, immunofluorescence, and in situ hybridization, the authors identify three transcriptionally and spatially distinct TM cell subtypes. The study further demonstrates that mitochondrial dysfunction, specifically in one subtype (TM3), contributes to elevated IOP in a genetic mouse model of glaucoma carrying a mutation in the transcription factor Lmx1b. Importantly, treatment with nicotinamide (vitamin B3), known to support mitochondrial health, prevents IOP elevation in this model. The authors also link their findings to human datasets, suggesting the existence of analogous TM3-like cells with potential relevance to human glaucoma.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is methodologically rigorous, integrating single-cell transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling with spatial validation and in vivo functional testing. The identification of TM subtypes is consistent across mouse strains and institutions, providing robust evidence of conserved TM cell heterogeneity. The use of a glaucoma model to show subtype-specific vulnerability, combined with a therapeutic intervention-gives the study strong mechanistic and translational significance. The inclusion of chromatin accessibility data adds further depth by implicating active transcription factors such as LMX1B, a gene known to be associated with glaucoma risk. The integration with human single-cell datasets enhances the potential relevance of the findings to human disease.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the LMX1B transcription factor is implicated as a key regulator in TM3 cells, its role in directly controlling mitochondrial gene expression is not fully explored. Additional analysis of motif accessibility or binding enrichment near relevant target genes could substantiate this mechanistic link. The therapeutic effect of vitamin B3 is clearly demonstrated phenotypically, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain somewhat underdeveloped - for instance, changes in mitochondrial function, oxidative stress markers, or NAD+ levels are not directly measured. While the human relevance of TM3 cells is suggested through marker overlap, more quantitative approaches, such as cell identity mapping or gene signature scoring in human datasets, would strengthen the translational connection.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a compelling and carefully executed study that offers significant advances in our understanding of TM cell biology and its role in glaucoma. The integration of multimodal data, disease modeling, and therapeutic testing represents a valuable contribution to the field. With additional mechanistic depth, the study has the potential to become a foundational resource for future research into IOP regulation and glaucoma treatment.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This elegant study by Tolman and colleagues provides fundamental findings that substantially advance our knowledge of the major cell types within the limbus of the mouse eye, focusing on the aqueous humor outflow pathway. The authors used single-cell and single-nuclei RNAseq to very clearly identify 3 subtypes of the trabecular meshwork (TM) cells in the mouse eye, with each subtype having unique markers and proposed functions. The U. Columbia results are strengthened by an independent replication in a different mouse strain at a separate laboratory (Duke). Bioinformatics analyses of these expression data were used to identify cellular compartments, molecular functions, and biological processes. Although there were some common pathways among the 3 subtypes of TM cells (e.g., ECM metabolism), there also were distinct functions. For example:</p>
<p>• TM1 cell expression supports heavy engagement in ECM metabolism and structure, as well as TGF2 signaling.</p>
<p>• TM2 cells were enriched in laminin and pathways involved in phagocytosis, lysosomal function, and antigen expression, as well as End3/VEGF/angiopoietin signaling.</p>
<p>• TM3 cells were enriched in actin binding and mitochondrial metabolism.</p>
<p>They used high-resolution immunostaining and in situ hybridization to show that these 3 TM subtypes express distinct markers and occupy distinct locations within the TM tissue. The authors compared their expression data with other published scRNAseq studies of the mouse as well as the human aqueous outflow pathway. They used ATAC-seq to map open chromatin regions in order to predict transcription factor binding sites. Their results were also evaluated in the context of human IOP and glaucoma risk alleles from published GWAS data, with interesting and meaningful correlations. Although not discussed in their manuscript, their expression data support other signaling pathways/ proteins/ genes that have been implicated in glaucoma, including: TGF2, BMP signaling (including involvement of ID proteins), MYOC, actin cytoskeleton (CLANs), WNT signaling, etc.</p>
<p>In addition to these very impressive data, the authors used scRNAseq to examine changes in TM cell gene expression in the mouse glaucoma model of mutant Lmxb1-induced ocular hypertension. In man, LMX1B is associated with Nail-Patella syndrome, which can include the development of glaucoma, demonstrating the clinical relevance of this mouse model. Among the gene expression changes detected, TM3 cells had altered expression of genes associated with mitochondrial metabolism. The authors used their previous experience using nicotinamide to metabolically protect DBA2/J mice from glaucomatous damage, and they hypothesized that nicotinamide supplementation of mutant Lmx1b mice would help restore normal mitochondrial metabolism in the TM and prevent Lmx1b-mediated ocular hypertension. Adding nicotinamide to the drinking water significantly prevented Lmxb1 mutant mice from developing high intraocular pressure. This is a laudable example of dissecting the molecular pathogenic mechanisms responsible for a disease (glaucoma) and then discovering and testing a potential therapy that directly intervenes in the disease process and thereby protects from the disease.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
There are numerous strengths in this comprehensive study including:</p>
<p>
• Deep scRNA sequencing that was confirmed by an independent dataset in another mouse strain at another university.</p>
<p>
• Identification and validation of molecular markers for each mouse TM cell subset along with localization of these subsets within the mouse aqueous outflow pathway.</p>
<p>
• Rigorous bioinformatics analysis of these data as well as comparison of the current data with previously published mouse and human scRNAseq data.</p>
<p>
• Correlating their current data with GWAS glaucoma and IOP &quot;hits&quot;.</p>
<p>
• Discovering gene expression changes in the 3 TM subgroups in the mouse mutant Lmx1b model of glaucoma.</p>
<p>
• Further pursuing the indication of dysfunctional mitochondrial metabolism in TM3 cells from Lmx1b mutant mice to test the efficacy of dietary supplementation with nicotinamide. The authors nicely demonstrate the disease modifying efficacy of nicotinamide in preventing IOP elevation in these Lmx1b mutant mice, preventing the development of glaucoma. These results have clinical implications for new glaucoma therapies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
• Occasional over-interpretation of data. The authors have used changes in gene expression (RNAseq) to implicate functions and signaling pathways. For example: they have not directly measured &quot;changes in metabolism&quot;, &quot;mitochondrial dysfunction&quot; or &quot;activity of Lmx1b&quot;.</p>
<p>
• In their very thorough data set, there is enrichment of or changes in gene expression that support other pathways that have been previously reported to be associated with glaucoma (such as TGF2, BMP signaling, actin cytoskeletal organization (CLANs), WNT signaling, ossification, etc. that appears to be a lost opportunity to further enhance the significance of this work.</p>

<p>Summary:In this study, the authors perform multimodal single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of 9,394 mouse TM cells, identifying three transcriptionally distinct TM subtypes with validated molecular signatures. TM1 cells are enriched for extracellular matrix genes, TM2 for secreted ligands supporting Schlemm's canal, and TM3 for contractile and mitochondrial/metabolic functions. The transcription factor LMX1B, previously linked to glaucoma, shows the highest expression in TM3 cells and appears to regulate mitochondrial pathways. In Lmx1bV265D mutant mice, TM3 cells exhibit transcriptional signs of mitochondrial dysfunction associated with elevated IOP. Notably, vitamin B3 treatment significantly mitigates IOP elevation, suggesting a potential therapeutic avenue.</p>
<p>This is an excellent and collaborative study involving investigators from two institutions, offering the most detailed single-cell transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling of the mouse limbal tissues-including both TM and Schlemm's canal (SC), from wild-type and Lmx1bV265D mutant mice. The study defines three TM subtypes and characterizes their distinct molecular signatures, associated pathways, and transcriptional regulators. The authors also compare their dataset with previously published murine and human studies, including those by Van Zyl et al., providing valuable cross-species insights.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Comprehensive dataset with high single-cell resolution</p>
<p>
(2) Use of multiple bioinformatic and cross-comparative approaches</p>
<p>
(3) Integration of 3D imaging of TM and SC for anatomical context</p>
<p>
(4) Convincing identification and validation of three TM subtypes using molecular markers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Insufficient evidence linking mitochondrial dysfunction to TM3 cells in Lmx1bV265D mice: While the identification of TM3 cells as metabolically specialized and Lmx1b-enriched is compelling, the proposed link between Lmx1b mutation and mitochondrial dysfunction remains underdeveloped. It is unclear whether mitochondrial defects are a primary consequence of Lmx1b-mediated transcriptional dysregulation or a secondary response to elevated IOP. Additional evidence is needed to clarify whether Lmx1b directly regulates mitochondrial genes (e.g., via ChIP-seq, motif analysis, or ATAC-seq), or whether mitochondrial changes are downstream effects.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the protective effects of nicotinamide (NAM) are interpreted as evidence of mitochondrial involvement, but no direct mitochondrial measurements (e.g., immunostaining, electron microscopy, OCR assays) are provided. It is essential to validate mitochondrial dysfunction in TM3 cells using in vivo functional assays to support the central conclusion of the paper. Without this, the claim that mitochondrial dysfunction drives IOP elevation in Lmx1bV265D mice remains speculative. Alternatively, authors should consider revising their claims that mitochondrial dysfunction in these mice is a central driver of TM dysfunction.</p>
<p>(2) Mechanism of NAM-mediated protection is unclear: The manuscript states that NAM treatment prevents IOP elevation in Lmx1bV265D mice via metabolic support, yet no data are shown to confirm that NAM specifically rescues mitochondrial function. Do NAM-treated TM3 cells show improved mitochondrial integrity? Are reactive oxygen species (ROS) reduced? Does NAM also protect RGCs from glaucomatous damage? Addressing these points would clarify whether the therapeutic effects of NAM are indeed mitochondrial.</p>
<p>(3) Lack of direct evidence that LMX1B regulates mitochondrial genes: While transcriptomic and motif accessibility analyses suggest that LMX1B is enriched in TM3 cells and may influence mitochondrial function, no mechanistic data are provided to demonstrate direct regulation of mitochondrial genes. Including ChIP-seq data, motif enrichment at mitochondrial gene loci, or perturbation studies (e.g., Lmx1b knockout or overexpression in TM3 cells) would greatly strengthen this central claim.</p>
<p>(4)Focus on LMX1B in Fig. 5F lacks broader context: Figure 5F shows that several transcription factors (TFs)-including Tcf21, Foxs1, Arid3b, Myc, Gli2, Patz1, Plag1, Npas2, Nr1h4, and Nfatc2-exhibit stronger positive correlations or motif accessibility changes than LMX1B. Yet the manuscript focuses almost exclusively on LMX1B. The rationale for this focus should be clarified, especially given LMX1B's relatively lower ranking in the correlation analysis. Were the functions of these other highly ranked TFs examined or considered in the context of TM biology or glaucoma? Discussing their potential roles would enhance the interpretation of the transcriptional regulatory landscape and demonstrate the broader relevance of the findings.</p>
<p>Other weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) In abstract, they say a number of 9,394 wild-type TM cell transcriptomes. The number of Lmx1bV265D/+ TM cell transcriptomes analyzed is not provided. This information is essential for evaluating the comparative analysis and should be clearly stated in the Abstract and again in the main text (e.g., lines 121-123). Including both wild-type and mutant cell counts will help readers assess the balance and robustness of the dataset.</p>
<p>(2) Did the authors monitor mouse weight or other health parameters to assess potential systemic effects of treatment? It is known that the taste of compounds in drinking water can alter fluid or food intake, which may influence general health. Also, does Lmx1bV265D/+ have mice exhibit non-ocular phenotypes, and if so, does nicotinamide confer protection in those tissues as well? Additionally, starting the dose of the nicotinamide at postnatal day 2, how long the mice were treated with water containing nicotinamide, and after how many days or weeks IOP was reduced, and how long the decrease in the IOP was sustained.</p>
<p>
(3) While the IOP reduction observed in NAM-treated Lmx1bV265D/+ mice appears statistically significant, it is unclear whether this reflects meaningful biological protection. Several untreated mice exhibit very high IOP values, which may skew the analysis. The authors should report the mean values for IOP in both untreated and NAM-treated groups to clarify the magnitude and variability of the response.</p>
<p>
(4) Additionally, since NAM has been shown to protect RGCs in other glaucoma models directly, the authors should assess whether RGCs are preserved in NAM-treated Lmx1b V265D/+ mice. Demonstrating RGC protection would support a synergistic effect of NAM through both IOP reduction and direct neuroprotection, strengthening the translational relevance of the treatment.</p>
<p>
(5) Can the authors add any other functional validation studies to explore to understand the pathways enriched in all the subtypes of TM1, TM2, and TM3 cells, in addition to the ICH/IF/RNAscope validation?</p>
<p>
(6) The authors should include a representative image of the limbal dissection. While Figure S1 provides a schematic, mouse eyes are very small, and dissecting unfixed limbal tissue is technically challenging. It is also difficult to reconcile the claim that the majority of cells in the limbal region are TM and endothelium. As shown in Figure S6, DAPI staining suggests a much higher abundance of scleral cells compared to TM cells within the limbal strip. Additional clarification or visual evidence would help validate the dissection strategy and cellular composition of the captured region.</p>
