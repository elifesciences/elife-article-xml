<title>Abstract</title><p>Organizing the continuous stream of visual input into categories like places or faces is important for everyday function and social interactions. However, it is unknown when neural representations of these and other visual categories emerge. Here we used steady state evoked potential electroencephalography to measure cortical responses in infants at 3-4 months, 4-6 months, 6-8 months, and 12-15 months, when they viewed controlled, gray-level images of faces, limbs, corridors, characters, and cars. We found that distinct responses to these categories emerge at different ages. Reliable brain responses to faces emerge first, at 4-6 months, followed by limbs and places around 6-8 months. Between 6-15 months response patterns become more distinct, such that a classifier can decode what an infant is looking at from their brain responses. These findings, have important implications for assessing typical and atypical cortical development as they not only suggest that category representations are learned, but also that representations of categories that may have innate substrates emerge at different times during infancy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Visual categorization is important for everyday activities and is amazingly rapid: adults categorize the visual input in about one-tenth of a second<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. In adults and school-age children, this key behavior is supported by both clustered and distributed responses to visual categories in high-level visual cortex in ventral and lateral temporal cortex (VTC and LOTC, respectively)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. A visual category consists of items that share common visual features and configurations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>; e.g., corridors share features of floors, walls, and ceilings, with a typical spatial relationship. Clustered regions in VTC and LOTC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> respond more strongly to items of ecologically-relevant categories (faces, bodies, places, words) than other stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and distributed neural responses across VTC and LOTC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> are reliable across items of a category but distinct across items of different categories. However, it is unknown when these visual category representations emerge in infants’ brains.</p>
<p>Behaviorally, infants can perform some level of visual categorization within the first year of life. Measurements of infants’ looking preferences and looking times suggest that visual saliency impacts young infants’ viewing patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> : between 4-10 months of age, infants can behaviorally distinguish between faces and objects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and between different animals like cats and dogs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Later on, between 10-19 months, infants behaviorally distinguish broader-level animate versus inanimate categories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Neurally, electroencephalographic (EEG) studies have found stronger responses to images of faces vs. objects or textures in 4-12-month-olds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and that stimulus category can be decoded from distributed responses slightly but significantly above chance in 6-15-month-olds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have found stronger responses to videos of faces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, bodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, and places<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> vs. objects in clustered regions in VTC and LOTC of 2-10-month-olds. However, because prior studies used different types of stimuli and age ranges, it is unknown when representations to various categories emerge during the first year of life. To address this key open question, we examined when neural representations to different visual categories emerge during infancy using EEG in infants of 4 age groups spanning 3-15 months of age.</p>
<p>We considered two main hypotheses regarding the developmental trajectories of category representations. One possibility is that representations to multiple categories emerge together because infants need to organize the barrage of visual input to understand what they see. Supporting this hypothesis are findings of (i) selective responses to faces, places, and body parts in VTC and LOTC of 2-10- month-olds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, and (ii) above chance classification of distributed EEG responses to toys, bodies, faces, houses in 6-8 month-olds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> as well as animals and body parts in 12-15-month-olds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that representations of different categories may emerge at different times during infancy. This may be due to two reasons. First, representations of ecologically-relevant categories like faces, body parts, and places may be innate because of their evolutionary importance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, whereas representations for other categories, may develop later only with learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Supporting this hypothesis are findings that newborns and young infants tend to orient to faces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> and face-like stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, as well as have cortical responses to face-like stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, but word representations only emerge in childhood with the onset of reading instruction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Second, even if visual experience is necessary for the development category representations (including faces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>) categories that are seen more frequently earlier in infancy may develop before others. Measurements using head mounted cameras suggest that infants’ visual diet (composition of visual input) varies across categories and age: The visual diet of 0-3- month-olds contains ∼25% faces and &lt;10% hands, that of 12-15-month-olds contains ∼20% faces and ∼20% hands <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, and that of 24-month-olds contains ∼10% faces, and ∼25% hands. Thus, looking behavior in infants predicts that representations of faces may emerge before that of limbs.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>45 infants from four age groups: 3-4 months (n = 17, 7 females), 4-6 months (n = 14, 7 females), 6-8 months (n = 15, 6 females), and 12-15 months (n = 15, 4 females) participated in EEG experiments. Twelve participants were part of an ongoing longitudinal study and came for several sessions spanning at least 3 months apart. Infants viewed gray-scale images from five visual categories present in infants’ environments (faces, limbs, corridors, characters, and cars) while EEG was recorded. Different from prior infant studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, we used images that have been widely used in fMRI studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and are largely controlled for low-level properties such as luminance, contrast, similarity, and spatial frequency (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">supplementary Table S3</xref>). We use a Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> (SSVEP) paradigm: In each 70-s sequence, images from five categories were shown every 0.233-s; one of the categories was the target, so different images from that category appeared every 1.167-s, and the rest of the images were drawn from the other four categories in a random order (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Images of all categories appeared at equal probability and no images were repeated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Infants participants in 5 conditions, which varied by the target category. We used the EEG-SSVEP approach because: (i) it affords a high signal-to-noise ratio with short acquisitions making it effective for infants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, (ii) it has been successfully used to study responses to faces in infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, and (iii) it enables measuring both general visual response to images by examining responses at the image presentation frequency (4.286 Hz), as well as category-selective responses by examining responses at the category frequency (0.857 Hz, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Example segments of presentation sequences in which faces (top panel) and limbs (bottom panel) were the target category. Images spanning 12° containing gray-level images of items from different categories on a phase scrambled background appeared for 233 ms (frequency: 4.286 Hz). A different exemplar from a single category appeared every 5th image (frequency: 0.857 Hz). Between the target category images, randomly drawn images from the other four categories were presented. Sequences consisted of 20% images from each of the five categories and no images were repeated. Each category condition lasted for 14-s and contained 12 such cycles. Participants viewed in random order 5 category conditions: faces, limbs, corridors, characters, and cars forming a 70-s presentation sequence.

<p>As the EEG-SSVEP paradigm is novel and we are restricted in the amount of data we can obtain in infants, we first tested if we can use this paradigm and a similar amount of data to detect category- selective responses in adults. Results show that in adults we can (i) reliably measure category-selective responses (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs S1</xref>–<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>) and (ii) decode category information from distributed spatiotemporal response patterns (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs S3</xref>) with the same amount of data that we obtained in infants. This validates the SSVEP paradigm for measuring category-selectivity. As infants have lower cortical visual acuity, we also tested if the stimuli are distinguishable to infants. Thus, we simulated how they may look to infants by filtering the images to match the cortical acuity of 3-month-olds <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig S4</xref>). Despite being blurry, images of different categories are readily distinguishable by adults (Supplementary Movies 1-5), suggesting that there is sufficient visual information in the lower spatial frequencies of the stimuli for infants to distinguish visual categories.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Robust visual responses in occipital regions to visual stimuli in all infant age groups</title>
<p>We first tested if there are significant visual responses to our stimuli in infants’ brains by evaluating the amplitude of responses at the image presentation frequency (4.286 Hz) and its first three harmonics. We found that in all age groups, visual responses were concentrated spatially over occipital electrodes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A-D, left panel</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). Quantification of the mean visual response amplitude over a region of interest (ROI) spanning 9 electrodes over early visual cortex revealed significant responses in all infant age groups at the image frequency and its first 3 harmonics (response amplitudes significantly above zero with FDR corrected at 4 levels; except for the first harmonic at 8.571 Hz in 6-8-month-olds; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A-D&gt;, right panel</xref>). We also tested if experimental noise varied across age groups. Noise level was estimated in the occipital electrodes by measuring the amplitude of response in frequencies up to 8.571 Hz excluding image presentation frequencies (4.286 Hz and harmonics) and category frequencies (0.857 Hz and harmonics) as this frequency range includes the relevant main harmonics. We found no significant difference in noise across age groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). These analyses indicate that infants were looking at the stimuli as there are significant visual responses even in the youngest 3-4 months-old infants’ and there are no significant differences in noise levels across infants of different ages.</p>

<p>Prior EEG data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> suggest that the timing and waveform of visual responses may vary across development. To complement the frequency domain analysis, we transformed the responses at image frequency and its harmonics to the time domain using an inverse Fourier transformation for two reasons. First, the time-domain provides access to information about response timing and waveform that is not directly accessible from an analysis of responses of individual harmonics. Second the total visual response is better reflected in the time-domain as the individual harmonic amplitudes can sum constructively.</p>
<p>We observed that during the 233-ms image presentation, temporal waveforms had two deflections in 3-4-month-olds (one negativity and one positivity, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>) and four deflections for infants older than 4 months (two minima and two maxima, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). To evaluate developmental effects, we examined the latency and amplitude of the peak visual response during two time windows related to the first deflection (60-90 ms), and second deflection (90-160 ms for 3-4-month-olds, and 90-110 ms for other age groups). In general, we find that the latency of the peak deflection decreased from 3 to 15 months (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G, H</xref>). As data includes both cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements and we observed larger development earlier than later in infancy, we used a linear mixed model (LMM) to model peak latency as a function of the logarithm of age (see Methods). Results reveal that the latency of the peak deflection significantly and differentially decreased with age in the two time-windows (βage x time window = -45.78, 95% CI: -58.39 – -33.17, <italic>t(118)</italic> = -7.19, <italic>p</italic> = 6.39 × 10<sup>-11</sup>; LMM with age and time window as fixed effects, and participant as a random effect, all stats in <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S4</xref>-<xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">S5</xref>). There were larger decreases in the peak latency in the second than first time window (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G, H</xref>, first: βage = -7.44, 95% CI: -13.82 – -1.06, <italic>t(118)</italic> = -2.33, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .05; second: βage = -46.91, 95% CI: -56.56 – -37.27, <italic>t(59)</italic> = -9.73, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .001). Peak amplitude also differentially develops across the two windows (βage x time window = -4.90, 95% CI: -8.66 – -1.14, <italic>t(118)</italic> = -2.58, <italic>p</italic> = .01, <xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S6</xref>-<xref rid="tbls7" ref-type="table">S7</xref>).

These data suggest that the temporal dynamics of visual responses over occipital cortex develop from 3 to 15 months of age.</p>

<p>We found significant group-level category responses to some but not all categories and a differential development of category-selective responses during infancy. The largest and earliest developing category- selective responses were to faces. In contrast to visual responses, which were centered over occipital electrodes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A-D</xref>, left panel), significant categorical responses to faces (at 0.857 Hz and its first harmonic, 1.714 Hz) were observed over lateral occipitotemporal electrodes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A-D</xref>, left panel). Notably, there were significant responses to faces over bilateral occipitotemporal electrodes in 4-6- month-olds at 0.857 Hz (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, response amplitudes significantly above zero with Hotelling’s T2 statistic, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .05, FDR corrected over 2 levels: the category frequency and its first harmonic), as well as 6-8- month-olds and 12-15-month-olds at the category frequency and its first harmonic (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C,D</xref>, both <italic>pFDR</italic></p>
<p>&lt; .05). However, there were no significant responses to faces in 3-4-month-olds at either the category frequency or its harmonics (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A, right panel</xref>). These data suggest that face-selective responses start to reliably emerge over lateral occipitotemporal cortex between 4 and 6 months of age.</p>
<p>We did not find significant group-level category-selective responses that survived FDR correction to any of the other categories before 6 months of age (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig S8</xref>, except for a weak but statistically significant response for cars in the right occipitotemporal ROI in 3-4-month-olds). Instead, we found significant category-selective responses that survived FDR correction for (i) limbs in 6-8-month-olds in the right occipitotemporal ROI (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig S5</xref>), (ii) corridors in 6-8-month-olds and 12-15 months-old in the left occipitotemporal ROI (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig S6</xref>), and (iii) characters in 6-8-month-olds in the right occipitotemporal ROI, and in 12-15-month-olds in bilateral occipitotemporal ROI (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig S7</xref>).</p>
<p>We evaluated the temporal dynamics of category-selective waveforms by transforming the data at the category frequency and its harmonics to the time domain. This analysis was done separately for each of the left and right occipitotemporal ROIs for each category and age group. Consistent with frequency domain analyses, average temporal waveforms over lateral-occipital ROIs show significant responses to faces that emerge at ∼4 months of age (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, significant responses relative to zero, cluster-based nonparametric permutation 10,000 times, two-tailed t-test, at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The temporal waveforms of responses to faces in infants show an initial positive deflection peaking ∼500 ms after stimulus onset followed by a negative deflection peaking at ∼900 ms. Notably, mean waveforms associated with limbs, corridors, and characters in lateral occipital-ROIs, are different from faces: there is only a single negative defection which peaks at ∼500 ms after stimulus onset, which is significant only in 6-8 and 12-15-month- olds (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B-D</xref>). There was no significant category response to cars in infants except for a late (∼1000 ms) positive response in 4-6-month-olds (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). These results show that both the timing and waveform differ across categories, which suggests that there might be additional category information in the distributed spatiotemporal response.</p>

<title>Are spatiotemporal patterns of responses to visual categories consistent across infants?</title>
<p>As we observed different mean waveforms over the lateral occipital ROIs for the five categories (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>), we asked whether the distributed spatiotemporal patterns of brain responses evoked by each category are unique and reliable across infants. We reasoned that if different categories generated consistent distributed spatiotemporal responses, an independent classifier would be able to predict the category an infant was viewing from their distributed spatiotemporal pattern of response. Thus, we used a leave-one- out-cross-validation (LOOCV) approach (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>) and tested if a classifier can decode the category a left- out infant viewed based on the similarity of their distributed spatiotemporal response to the mean response to each of the categories in the remaining N-1 infants. We calculated for each infant the mean category-waveform (same as <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>) across the occipital and lateral occipitotemporal ROIs and concatenated the waveforms across the three ROIs to generate the distributed spatiotemporal response to a category (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). The classifier was trained and tested separately for each age group.</p>

<p>(A) An illustration of winner-takes-all leave-one-out-cross validation (LOOCV) classifier from mean spatiotemporal response patterns of each category. Spatiotemporal patterns of response for each category are generated by concatenating the mean time courses from N-1 infants from three ROIs: left occipitotemporal (LOT), occipital (OCC), and right occipitotemporal (ROT). At each iteration, we train the classifier with the mean spatiotemporal patterns of each category from N-1 infants, and test how well it predicts the category the left-out infant is viewing from their spatiotemporal brain response. The winner-take-all (WTA) classifier determines the category based on the training vector that has highest pairwise correlation with the and test vectors.

</fig>
<p>Results reveal two main findings. First, the LOOCV classifier decoded category information from brain responses significantly above the 20% chance level in infants aged 6 months and older but not in younger infants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>, 6-8-month-olds, significant above chance: <italic>t(14)</italic> = 4.1, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .01, one-tailed, FDR corrected over 4 age groups; 12-15-month-olds, <italic>t(14)</italic> = 3.4, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .01). This suggests that spatiotemporal patterns of responses to different categories become reliable across infants after 6 months of age. Second, examination of classification by category, shows that the LOOCV classifier successfully determined from spatiotemporal responses when infants were viewing faces in 64% of 4-6-month-olds, in 93% of 6-8- month-olds, and 87% of 12-15-month-olds (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). In contrast, classification performance was numerically lower for the other categories (successful classification in less than 40% of the infants). This suggests that a reliable spatiotemporal response to faces that is consistent across infants develops after 4 months of age and dominates classification performance.</p>

<title>What is the nature of categorical spatiotemporal patterns in individual infants?</title>
<p>While the prior analyses leverage the power of averaging across electrodes and infants, this averaging does not provide insight to fine-grained neural representations within individual infants. To examine the finer-grain representation of category information within each infant’s brain, we examined the distributed spatiotemporal responses to each category across the 23 electrodes spanning the left and right occipitotemporal cortex in each infant. We tested: (i) if categorical representations in an infant’s brain are reliable across different images of a category, and (ii) if category representations become more distinct during the first year of life. We predicted that if representations become more similar across items of a category and more dissimilar between items of different categories then category distinctiveness (defined as the difference between mean within and between category similarity) would increase from 3 to 15 months of age.</p>
<p>To examine the representational structure, we calculated representation similarity matrices across odd/even split-halves of the data in each infant. Each cell in the RSM quantifies the similarity between two spatiotemporal patterns: On-diagonal cells of the RSM quantify the similarity of distributed spatiotemporal responses to different images from the same category and off-diagonal cells quantify the similarity of spatiotemporal responses to images from different categories. Categorical structure will manifest in RSMs as positive on diagonal values indicating reliable within-category spatiotemporal responses which are higher than off-diagonal between category similarity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig S3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Examination of mean RSMs in each age group reveals no reliable category information in individuals at 3-4-month-olds or 4-6-month-olds, as within-category similarity is not significantly above zero (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>, 3-4-month-olds: on-diagonal, -0.03 ± 0.06, <italic>p</italic> = .96, one-tailed; 4-6-month-olds: on diagonal: 0.009 ± 0.11, <italic>p</italic> = .38). However, starting around 6 months some category structure emerges in the RSMs. In particular, distributed responses to faces become reliable as within category similarity for faces is significantly above zero in 6-8-month-olds (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>, 0.31 ± 0.24, <italic>t(14)</italic> = 5.1, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .05, FDR corrected over 5 category levels), and stays reliable in 12-15-month-olds (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>, 0.26 ± 0.24, <italic>t(14)</italic> = 4.18, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .05). Distributed responses to limbs become reliable later on as within category similarity for limbs is significantly above zero in 12- 15-months-olds (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>, 0.11 ± 0.21, <italic>t(14)</italic> = 1.98, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03, but not surviving FDR correction at 5 levels).</p>
<p>Next, we evaluated the development of category distinctiveness, which was calculated for each category and infant. Individual infants’ category distinctiveness is shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref> (infants ordered by age) and in the scatterplots in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>. In infants younger than 4 months (120 days) category distinctiveness is largely close to zero or even negative, suggesting no differences between spatiotemporal responses to one category vs another. Category distinctiveness increases with age and becomes more positive from 84 to 445 days of age (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B,C</xref>). The biggest increase is for faces where after ∼6 months of age (194 days) face distinctiveness is consistently positive in individual infants (13/15 infants aged 194-364 days and 12/15 infants aged 365-445 days). The increase in distinctiveness is more modest for other categories and appears later in development. For example, positive distinctiveness for limbs and cars in individual infants is consistently observed after 12 months of age (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B,C</xref>; limbs: 9/15 infants aged 365-445 days vs 5/15 infants aged 194-364 days; cars: 12/15 365-445 days vs 7/15 194-364 days).</p>
<p>Using LMMs we determined if distinctiveness significantly changed with age (log transformed) and category (participant, random factor). Results indicate that category distinctiveness significantly increased from 3 to 15 months of age (βage = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.54 –1.00, <italic>t(301)</italic> = 6.62, <italic>p</italic> = 1.67×10<sup>-10</sup>), and further that development significantly varies across categories (βage x category = -0.13, 95% CI: -0.2 – -0.06, <italic>t(301)</italic> = -3.61, <italic>p</italic> = 3.5×10<sup>-4</sup>; main effect of category, βcategory = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.11 – 0.43, <italic>t(301)</italic> = 3.38, <italic>p</italic> = 8.2×10<sup>-4</sup>). Post- hoc analyses for each category (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>) reveal that distinctiveness significantly increased with age for faces (βage = 0.9, 95% CI: 0.6 – 1.1, <italic>t(59)</italic> = 6.8, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .001), limbs (βage = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2 – 0.6, <italic>t(59)</italic> = 5.0, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .001), characters (βage = 0.2, 95% CI: 0.02 – 0.3, <italic>t(59)</italic> = 2.2, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .05), and cars (βage = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2 – 0.5, <italic>t(59)</italic> = 3.7, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .001). Post-hoc t-tests show that for faces, the category distinctiveness is significantly above zero after 6 months of age (6-8-month-olds, <italic>t(14)</italic> = 6.73, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .05; 12-15-month-olds, <italic>t(14)</italic> = 5.30, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .05) and for limbs and cars at 12-15 months of age (limbs: <italic>t(14)</italic> = 2.19, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .05; cars: <italic>t(14)</italic> = 4.53, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>This suggests that category distinctiveness slowly emerges in the visual cortex of infants from 3 to 15 months of age, with the largest and fastest development for faces.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We find that both selective responses to items of a category over others across lateral occipital ROIs and the distinctiveness of distributed visual category representations progressively develop from 3 to 15 months of age. Notably, we find a differential development of category-selective responses (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>), whereby responses to faces emerge the earliest, at 4-6 months of age and continue to develop through the first year of life. Category-selective responses to limbs, corridors, and characters follow, emerging at 6-8 months of age. Our analysis of the distinctiveness of the distributed spatiotemporal patterns to each category also find that distributed representations to faces become more robust in 6-8-month-olds and remain robust in 12-15-month-olds. While the distinctiveness of distributed patterns to limbs and cars only become reliable at 12-15 months of age. Together these data suggest a rethinking of the development of category representations during infancy as they not only suggest that category representations are learned, but also that representations of categories that may have innate substrates such as faces, bodies, and places emerge at different times during infancy.</p>

<title>Reliable category representations start to emerge at 4 months of age</title>
<p>While 3-4 months old infants have significant and reliable evoked visual responses over early visual cortex, we find no reliable category representations of faces, limbs, corridors, or characters in these young infants. Both analyses of average responses across lateral occipital ROIs and analyses of distributed spatiotemporal responses across visual cortex find no reliable category representations in 3-4-month-olds, either when examining mean response across an ROI or in distributed spatiotemporal patterns across visual cortex. The earliest categorical responses we find are for faces, and they emerge at 4-6 months of age.</p>
<p>Is it possible that there are some category representations in 3-4-month-olds, but we lack the sensitivity to measure them? We believe this is unlikely, because (i) we can measure significant visual responses from the same 3-4-month-olds, (ii) with the same amount of data, we can measure category selective responses and decode category information from distributed spatiotemporal responses in infants older than 4 months and in adults.</p>
<p>Ours findings together with a recent fMRI study in 2-10-month-olds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> provide accumulating evidence for multiple visual categories representations in infants’ brains before the age of one. However, there are also differences across studies. The earliest we could find reliable group-level category-selective responses for faces was 4-6-month-olds and for limbs and corridors only after 6 months of age. In contrast, Kosakowski and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> report category-selective responses to faces, bodies, and scenes in example 4-5-months-olds. Group average data in their study found significant face- and place-selective responses in infants’ ventral temporal cortex (VTC) but not in lateral occipital cortex (LOTC), and significant body- selective responses in LOTC, but not VTC. Because Kosakowski et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> report group-averaged data across infants spanning 8 months, their study does not provide insights to the time course of this development. We note that, the studies differ in both measurement modalities (EEG/fMRI) and in the types of stimuli infants viewed. In<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> infants viewed isolated, colored, and moving stimuli, but in our study, infants viewed still, gray-level images on phase-scrambled backgrounds, which were controlled for several low level properties. Thus, future research is necessary to determine whether differences between findings are due to differences in measurement modalities or differences in stimulus format.</p>

In contrast, we do not find reliable face-selective responses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) or reliable distributed representations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) to faces in 3-4-month-olds when responses to faces are contrasted to many other items and when stimuli are shown on a background rather than in isolation. Our findings are consistent with longitudinal research in macaques showing that robust cortical selectivity to faces takes several months to emerge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and support the hypothesis that experience with faces is necessary for the development of cortical face selectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our data also reveal that face-selective responses and distributed representations to faces become more robust in 6-8-month-olds and remain robust in 12-15-month-olds. For example, successful decoding of faces in the group level was observed in 80% of individual infants based on several minutes of EEG data. Reliable distributed spatiotemporal responses to different images of faces become significantly different from responses to images from different categories. This robust decoding has important clinical ramifications as it may serve as an early biomarker for cortical face processing, which is important for early detection of social and cognitive developmental disorders such as Autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> and Williams Syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Future research is necessary for elucidating the relationship between the development of brain responses to faces to infant behavior. For example, it is interesting that at 6 months of age, when we find robust face representations, infants also start to exhibit recognition of familiar faces (like parents) and stranger anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>One fascinating aspect of the development of cortical face selectivity is that among the categories we tested, selectivity to faces seems to emerge the earliest at around 4 months of age, yet the development of selectivity and distributed representations to faces is protracted compared to objects and places<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Indeed, in both our data and prior work, face-selective responses and distributed representations to faces in infants are immature compared to adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, and a large body of work has shown that face selectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> and distributed representations to faces <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> continue to develop during childhood and adolescence. This suggests that not only experience during infancy but also life-long experience with faces, sculpts cortical face selectivity. We speculate that the extended cortical plasticity for faces may be due to both the expansion of social circles (family, friends and acquaintances) across the lifespans and also the changing statistics of faces we socialize with (e.g., child and adult faces have different appearance).</p>

<title>New insight about development: different category representations emerge at different times</title>
<p>To our knowledge, our study is the first to examine the development of both ROI level and spatiotemporal distributed responses in infants across the first year of life. We note that both analyses find that category information to faces develops before other categories. However, there are also some differences across analyses (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). For example, for limbs and corridors we find significant category- selective responses at the ROI level in lateral occipitotemporal ROIs starting at 6-8 months but no reliable distinct distributed responses across visual cortex at this age. In contrast, for cars, we find an opposite pattern where there is a distinct spatiotemporal pattern in 12-15 month-olds even as there is no significant car-selective response in the ROI level. As these approaches have different senstivities, they reveal insights to the nature of the underlying representations. For example, as visible in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>, limbs and corridor have a clear category selective waveform in both in 6-8 and 12-15-months-olds, but the waveform of limbs and its spatial distribution is not that different from that to corridors, which may explain why distinctiveness of spatitemporal patterns for limbs is low in 6-8-moths old (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Likewise, even as there is no signifincat response for cars (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4e</xref>), its spatiotemporal pattern is consistently different than for other categories giving rise to a distinctive spatiotemporal response by 12 months (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, the key finding from our study is that the development of category selectivity during infancy is non-uniform: face-selective responses and representations of distributed patterns develop before representations to limbs and other categories. We hypothesize that this differential development of visual category representations may be due to differential visual experience with these categories during infancy. This hypothesis is consistent with behavioral research using head-mounted cameras that revealed that the visual input during early infancy is dense with faces, while hands become more prevalent in the visual input later in development and especially when in contact with objects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Additionally, a large body of research has suggested that young infants preferentially look at faces and face-like stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, as well as look longer at faces than other objects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, indicating that not only the prevalence of faces in babies’ environments but also longer looking times may drive the early development of face representations. Future studies that examine the visual diet, looking behavior, and brain development using additional behaviorally relevant categories such as food<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> can test how environmental and experiential differences may influence infants’ developmental trajectories</p>
<p>Together our findings not only suggest that visual experience is necessary for the development of visual category representations, including faces, but also necessitate a rethinking of how visual category representations develop in infancy. Moreover, this differential development during infancy is evident even for categories that have evolutionary importance and may have innate substrates such as faces, bodies, and places<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Finally, our findings have important ramifications for theoretical and computational models of visual development as well as for the assessment of atypical infant development.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Ethical permission for the study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Stanford University. Parents of the infant participants provided written informed consent prior to their first visit and also prior to each session if they came for multiple sessions. Participants were paid 20$/hour for participation. Participants were recruited via ads on social media (Facebook and Instagram).</p>
<p>Sixty-two full-term, typically developing infants were recruited. Twelve participants were part of an ongoing longitudinal study and came for several sessions spanning ∼3 months apart (seven 3-4-month- olds, three 4-6-month-olds, eight 6-8-month-olds, and twelve 12-15-month-olds). Data from nineteen infants (nine 3-4-month-olds, six 4-6-month-olds, and eight 6-8-month-olds; among whom seven were longitudinal) were acquired in two visits within a two-week span to obtain a sufficient number of valid data epochs. <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S1</xref> contains participants’ demographic information (sex and race). The youngest infants were 3 months old, as the EEG setup requires the infants to be able to hold their head and look at the screen in front of them. 23 adults (14 females) also participated in the study. All participants had normal/corrected-to-normal vision and provided written informed consent.</p>
<p>Data e<italic>xclusion criteria:</italic> We excluded participants who had less than 20 valid epochs (1.1667-s/epoch) per category, had noise/muscular artifacts during the EEG recordings, couldn’t record data, or had no visual responses over the occipital electrodes. As such, we excluded (1) five infants due to an insufficient number of epochs, (2) two infants who had no visual responses, (3) ten infants due to technical issues during data collection, and (4) three adults due to excessive noise/muscular artifacts during EEG. In total, we report data from 45 infants (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) and 20 adults (13 females, 19-38 years) that met inclusion criteria.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Visual stimuli</title>
<p>Natural grayscale images of adult faces, limbs, corridors, characters, and cars are used as stimuli, with 144 images per category from the fLOC image database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/VPNL/fLoc">https://github.com/VPNL/fLoc</ext-link>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The size, view, and retinal position of the items varied, and the items were overlaid on phase-scrambled backgrounds that were generated from a randomly drawn image in the stimulus set. The images were also controlled for multiple low-level differences between stimuli of different categories including their luminance, contrast, similarity and spatial frequency power distributions using the SHINE toolbox <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. As only five of ten categories from <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> were used, we evaluated the stimuli used in our experiments to test if they differed in (i) contrast, (ii) luminance, (iii) similarity, and (iv) spatial frequency. Results show that categories were largely matched on most metrics (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> and Supplementary Materials). The stimuli were presented on a gamma-corrected OLED monitor screen (SONY PVM-2451; SONY Corporation, Tokyo Japan) at a screen resolution of 1920 × 1080 pixels and a monitor refresh rate of 60 Hz. When viewed from 70 cm away, each image extended a visual angle of approximately 12°.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title>EEG Protocol</title>
<p>The experiments were conducted in a calm, dimly illuminated lab room. Stimuli were presented using custom stimulus presentation software with millisecond timing precision. During testing, infant participants were seated on their parent’s laps in front of the screen at a distance of 70 cm. One experimenter stood behind the presentation screen to monitor where the infant was looking. The visual presentation was paused if the infant looked away from the screen and was continued when the infant looked again at the center of the screen. To motivate infants to fixate and look at the screen, we presented at the center of the screen small (∼1°) colored cartoon images such as butterflies, flowers, ladybugs. For adults, we used a fixation cross of the same size instead of the cartoons and asked the participants to fixate and indicate when the fixation’s color changed by pressing a space bar key on a keyboard. EEG measurements for infant participants continued until the infant no longer attended the screen and we obtained between 2-12 different 70-s sequences per individual. For adult participants, we acquired 12 sequences per individual.</p>
<p>A frequency-tagging paradigm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> was used to measure brain responses. In the experiment, randomly selected images from 5 categories were presented sequentially at a rate of 4.286 Hz (∼233 ms per image) with no inter stimulus interval during each 70-s sequence. For each condition, one category was determined as the target category; for this category random selected images from that category were presented first and followed by four images randomly drawn from the other four categories with no regular order (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The target images are therefore presented periodically at 0.857 Hz (i.e. 4.286 Hz/5), but the intervals between sequential presentations of images from the other 4 categories was not periodic. The probability of image occurrences across categories was equal at 20%. The experiment had five conditions one for each of the following target categories: faces, limbs, corridors, characters, and cars. Each 70-s experimental sequence was composed of five 14-s long conditions which included a 1.1667-s stimulus fade-in and a 1.1667-s stimulus fade-out. The order of the category conditions was randomized within each 70-s sequence. No image was repeated within a sequence. Two presentation frequencies were embedded in the experiment: (i) the image frequency (4.286 Hz), which is predicted to elicit visual responses to all stimuli over occipital visual cortex, and, (ii) the category frequency (0.857 Hz), which is predicted to elicit a category-selective response over lateral occipital-temporal electrodes.</p>

<title>EEG Acquisition</title>
<p>EEG data were recorded at 500 Hz from a 128-channel EGI High-Density Geodesic Sensor Net. For infants, the net was connected to a NetAmps 300 amplifier (Electrical Geodesics, Inc., Eugene, OR, USA). For the adults, the net was connected to a NetAmps400 amplifier. The EEG recording was referenced online to a single vertex (electrode Cz) and the channel impedance was kept below 50 KΩ.</p>

<title>Pre-processing</title>
<p>EEG recordings were down-sampled to 420 Hz and were filtered using a 0.03-50 Hz bandpass filter with custom signal processing software. For infants, channels with more than 20% of samples exceeding a 100-150 μV amplitude threshold were replaced with the average amplitude of its six nearest-neighbor channels. The continuous EEG signals were then re-referenced to the common average of all channels and segmented into 1166.7-ms epochs (i.e., duration of five stimuli starting with a target category image followed with four images drawn from the rest four categories). Epochs with more than 15% of time samples exceeding threshold (150 - 200 μV) were excluded further on a channel-by-channel basis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. For adults, the two-step artifact rejection was performed with different criteria as EEG response amplitudes are lower in adults than infants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. EEG channels with more than 15% of samples exceeding a 30 μV amplitude threshold were replaced by the average value of their neighboring channels. Then the EEG signals were re-referenced to the common average of all channels and segmented into 1.1667-s epochs. Epochs with more than 10% of time samples exceeding threshold (30 - 80 μV) were excluded on a channel- by-channel basis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Univariate EEG analyses</title>
<p>Both image update and categorical EEG visual responses are reported in the frequency and time domain over three regions-of-interest (ROIs): two occipito-temporal ROIs (left occipitotemporal (LOT): channels 57, 58, 59, 63, 64, 65 and 68; right occipitotemporal (ROT) channels: 90, 91, 94, 95, 96, 99, and 100) and one occipital ROI (channels 69, 70, 71, 74, 75, 76, 82, 83 and 89). These ROIs were selected a priori based on a previously published study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. We further removed several channels in these ROIs for two reasons: (1) Three outer rim channels (i.e., 73, 81, and 88) were not included in the occipital ROI for further data analysis for both infant and adult participants because they were consistently noisy. (2) Three channels (66, 72, and 84) in the occipital ROI, one channel (50) in the LOT ROI, and one channel (101) in the ROT ROI were removed because they did do not show substantial responses in the group-level analyses.</p>

<p>Individual participant’s preprocessed EEG signals for each stimulus condition were averaged over two consecutive epochs (2.3334-s). The averaged time courses for each participant were then converted to the frequency domain at a frequency resolution of 0.4286 Hz via a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The frequency bins of interest are at exactly every other bin in the frequency spectrum. The real and imaginary Fourier coefficients for each of the categorical and image update responses for each condition were averaged across participants (vector averaging) to obtain a group-level estimates. The amplitudes of response were then computed from the coherently averaged vector. Hotelling’s T2 statistic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> was used to test whether response amplitudes were significantly different from zero.

<title>Time domain analyses</title>
<p>Preprocessed time domain EEG signals of each participant were low-passed filtered with a 30Hz cut-off. The raw EEG signals contain many components including categorical responses 0.857 Hz and harmonics), general visual responses (4.286 Hz and harmonics) and noise. To separate out the temporal waveforms of these two responses, we first transformed the epoch-averaged (2.3334-s) time series of each condition into frequency domain using a DFT. Then, we used an inverse DFT to transform back to the time domain keeping only the responses at the category frequency and its harmonics, zeroing the other frequencies. The same approach was used to separate the visual responses by using an inverse DFT transform of the responses at 4.286 Hz and harmonics.</p>

<sec id="s4i">
<title>Categorical responses</title>
<p>We kept responses at frequencies of interest (0.857 Hz and its harmonics up to 30 Hz, excluding the harmonic frequencies that overlapped with the image frequency and its harmonics) and zeroed responses in other frequencies. Then we applied an inverse Fourier transform to transform the data to the time domain. We further segmented the time series into 1.1667-s epochs and averaged across these epochs for each condition and individual. The mean and standard error across participants were computed for each condition at each time-point.</p>

We calculated the maximum cluster-level statistic for each permutation to generate a non-parametric reference distribution of cluster- level statistics.

<title>Group-level</title>
<p>We used a leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) classifier to test if spatiotemporal responses patterns to each of the five categories were reliable across participants. The classifier was trained on averaged data from N-1 participants and tested on how well it predicted the category the left- out participant was viewing from their brain activations. This procedure was repeated for each left-out participant. We calculated the averaged category temporal waveform for each category across channels of our three ROIs: 7 LOT, 9 occipital, and 7 ROT, as the exact location of the channels varies across individuals. Then we concatenated the waveform from the three ROIs to form a spatiotemporal response vector. At each iteration, the LOOCV classifier computed the correlation between each of the five category vectors from the left-out participant (test data, for an unknown stimulus) and each of the mean spatiotemporal vectors across the N-1 participants (training data, labeled data). The winner-take-all (WTA) classifier classifies the test vector to the category of the training vector that yields the highest correlation with the test vector. We computed group mean decoding performance across all N iterations for each category, and the group mean decoding accuracies across five categories.</p>

<title>Statistical Analyses of Developmental Effects</title>
<p>To quantify developmental effects, we used linear mixed models (LMMs, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> with the ‘fitlme’ function in MATLAB version 2021b (MathWorks, Inc.). LMMs allow explicit modeling of both within-subject effects (e.g., longitudinal measurements) and between-subject effects (e.g., cross-sectional data) with unequal number of points per participants, as well as examine main and interactive effects of both continuous (age) and categorical (e.g., stimulus category) variables. We used random-intercept models that allow the intercept to vary across participants (term: 1|participant). In all LMMs, we measured development as a function of log 10(age in days) as development is typically faster earlier on. Indirect evidence comes from neuroimaging and post-mortem studies showing that the structural development of infants’ brain is nonlinear, with development in the first two years being rapid, especially the first year <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>.</p>

<label>2.</label><title>Low-level image properties analyses</title>
<p>As images of items of visual categories vary both on low-level and high-level properties, and both the EEG signal and babies’ attention may be affected by low-level properties like contrast or luminance, it is important to control for several low-level factors such as luminance, contrast, similarity spatial frequency, as well as high-level properties such as familiarity across categories. Here we used a subset of categories from<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, that did not contain familiar stimuli to our participants and were controlled for several low-level factors using the SHINE toolbox <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. To validate the effect of employing SHINE, we evaluated several low-level metrics and tested if they differed across categories: (i) <italic>Luminance:</italic> mean gray level of each image; (ii) <italic>Contrast:</italic> mean standard deviation of gray level values of each image; (iii) <italic>Similarity:</italic> mean pixel-wise similarity between gray levels across pairs of images of a category, and (iv) <italic>Spatial frequency distribution</italic>: we transformed each image to the Fourier Domain using FFT and calculated its circular amplitude spectrum. We calculated these metrics for each image, then tested if contrast, luminance, similarity metrics were significantly different across categories using pair-wise non- parametric permutation t-tests (10,000 times, with Bonferroni correction). While it is difficult to completely control multiple low-level metrics across categories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, our analyses show that images are largely controlled for several low-level metrics across categories, and that medians, means, and ranges are matched across categories (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>; <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">supplementary Table 3</xref>). With respect to differences in contrast and luminance, there are no significant differences across categories except that limbs have slightly but significantly lower luminance (<italic>ps</italic> &lt; .05, Bonferroni corrected) and lower pairwise similarity (<italic>ps</italic> &lt; .01) and higher contrast (<italic>ps</italic> &lt; .05, except for corridors) than other categories. For similarity, the medians and ranges are similar across categories, but the outliers vary producing significant differences across categories (permutation tests, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, Bonferroni corrected). For spatial frequency distribution, the means and standard deviations are similar across categories (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>-right). We further ran Kolmogrov- Smirnov tests for each pair of categories with Bonferroni correction, our results revealed significantly different distributions across category pairs (<italic>ps</italic> &lt; .001, except for limbs and corridors).</p>

<label>3.</label><title>Analyses of adult data</title>
<p>In the study, one concern is that the amount of empirical data typically collected in infants is less than in adults, which may compromise the experimental power to detect responses in infants as it may affect the noise-bandwidth (sensitivity) of the frequency tagging analysis. Thus, we tested whether it is possible to measure category-selective responses in 20 adults using the same experiment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) and same amount of data collected in infants using three types of analyses. By using the same number of trials in adults as those obtained from our infant participants for data analyses, our goal was to test that we had sufficient power to detect categorical responses from infants using the experimental paradigm. We expect temporal and amplitude differences between adults and infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> as infants have immature brains and skulls. For example, cortical gyrification, which determines the orientation of the electrical fields generated in certain part of the brain region on the scalp, still undergoes development during the first two years of infants’ lives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Second, adults’ skulls are thicker and have lower conductivity than infants’ skulls, thus electrical signals on their scalp are lower than infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, we tested if we could in principle detect category information in adults with the same amount of data as infants. We reasoned that if category information can be detected in adults and signals are stronger in infants then we should have the power to detect category information in infants.</p>

<title>Visual Responses</title>
<p>We averaged the preprocessed data across two consecutive epochs (2.3334-s) and across conditions for each individual to measure visual responses to all images that were presented at 4.286 Hz and then transformed the data to the frequency domain. <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig S1A</xref> shows the three-D topographies of group-averaged responses at 4.286 Hz and its first 3 harmonics (left panel) and the group-averaged Fourier amplitude spectrum over middle occipital and occipitotemporal ROIs (right panel). We used Hotelling’s T2 statistic to test the amplitude significance and found significant visual responses in adults at 4.286 Hz over the occipital ROI containing 9 electrodes over early visual cortex (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, FDR corrected at 4 levels) and significant visual responses at 4.286 Hz and its first two harmonics over the occipitotemporal ROI (14 electrodes) (<italic>ps</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>Examining the temporal waveform of the visual response (filtered at the image frequency and its harmonics), we found a relatively slow waveform with one peak, after 100 ms since stimulus onset (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig S1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Visual Category responses</title>
<p>As adults have mature category-selective regions, we next tested if using our SSVEP paradigm and the same amount of data as in infants, we identify significant category- selective responses in adults. First, we analyzed the mean response at the category frequency and its harmonics in lateral occipitotemporal regions of interest (ROIs). This is a selective response as it reflects the relative response to the target category (generalized across exemplars) above the general visual response to images of other categories. Despite lower response amplitudes in adults than infants, using the same amount of data as infants, adults show significant category-selective responses to each of these five categories (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig S2A</xref> for all categories). <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig S2A</xref> shows the group-averaged Fourier amplitude spectrum over left and right occipitotemporal ROIs (top panels) and the three-D topographies of group-averaged responses at 0.857 Hz and its first harmonic (bottom panel). We used Hotelling’s T2 statistic to test the amplitude significance and found significant above- zero category-selective responses in adults at 0.857Hz and its multiple harmonics over bilateral occipitotemporal ROIs containing 7 electrodes each (<italic>ps</italic> &lt; .05, FDR corrected over 8 levels).</p>
<p>By transforming the filtered data at the category frequency and its harmonics to examine the temporal waveform of each category. Notably, each category generates a unique topography (bottom panels) at 200-217 ms after stimulus onset (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 2B</xref>). For faces, we found an early negative deflection peaking ∼200 ms after stimulus onset in both the left and right occipitotemporal ROIs, with the right occipitotemporal ROI showing a numerically larger mean response amplitude than the left (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig S2B-faces</xref>). Similarly, we found an early negative peak at around 200 ms for characters, and a left hemisphere dominance (at the 162-248 ms and 398-474 ms time windows (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig S2B-characters</xref>). For both limbs and corridors, there was an early positive waveform peaking at around 200 ms in both hemispheres with no hemispheric differences.</p>

<p>Second, we examined in the same 20 adults whether the spatiotemporal pattern of brain responses evoked by different visual categories are distinct from one another and are reliable across participants, using a leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) classifier approach with spatiotemporal timeseries concatenated with mean temporal waveforms from 3 ROIs: (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 3A-left</xref>). Mean LOOCV classification performance was around 80% and significantly above chance in adults (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 3A-right</xref>). This classification was associated with correct decoding of all 5 categories from distributed responses in the majority of participants.</p>

<p>(A) <italic>Left:</italic> An illustration of winner-takes-all leave-one-out- cross-validated classifier (LOOCV) using the spatiotemporal response patterns of each category. Spatiotemporal patterns of response for each category are generated by concatenating the mean time courses from each of the three ROIs: left occipitotemporal (LOT), occipital (OCC), and right occipitotemporal (ROT). At each iteration, we train the classifier with the mean spatiotemporal patterns of each category from N-1 participants, and test how well it predicts the category the left-out participant is viewing from their spatiotemporal brain response. This is a winner-take-all classifier which predicts the category based on the highest pairwise correlation between the training and testing vectors. <italic>Right: White:</italic> mean decoding accuracy across all five categories.

</fig>
<p>Third, we examined in the same 20 adults if there is reliable category information in spatiotemporal distributed in each individual. Distributed spatiotemporal responses were measured in individual participants over 23 occipital and lateral occipital ROIs using split half of data. We computed the representations similarity matrix (RSM) across split halves and then calculated category distinctiveness by subtracting mean between category similarity from within category similarity for each category.</p>
<p>Mean RSM across 20 adults shows that spatiotemporal patterns are more similar across items of a category than across items of different categories (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 3B-left</xref>), and the category distinctiveness scores are significantly above zero for all five categories: faces, <italic>t(19)</italic> = 11.18, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .05; limbs, <italic>t(19)</italic> = 5.01, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .05; corridors, <italic>t(19)</italic> = 5.58, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .05; characters, <italic>t(19)</italic> = 6.56, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .05; and cars, <italic>t(19)</italic> = 10.59, <italic>pFDR</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
<p>Together, these analyses suggest that the experimental paradigm has sufficient power to identify category representations both at the group and individual levels.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the paper, Yan and her colleagues investigate at which stage of development different categorical signals can be detected with EEG using a steady-state visual evoked potential paradigm. The study reports the development trajectory of selective responses to five categories (i.e., faces, limbs, corridors, characters, and cars) over the first 1.5 years of life. It reveals that while responses to faces show significant early development, responses to other categories (i.e., characters and limbs) develop more gradually and emerge later in infancy. The paper is well-written and enjoyable, and the content is well-motivated and solid.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This study contains a rich dataset with a substantial amount of effort. It covers a large sample of infants across ages (N=45) and asks an interesting question about when visual category representations emerge during the first year of life.</p>
<p>(2) The chosen category stimuli are appropriate and well-controlled. These categories are classic and important for situating the study within a well-established theoretical framework.</p>
<p>(3) The brain measurements are solid. Visual periodicity allows for the dissociation of selective responses to image categories within the same rapid image stream, which appears at different intervals. This is important for the infant field, as it provides a robust measure of ERPs with good interpretability.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study would benefit from a more detailed explanation of analysis choices, limitations, and broader interpretations of the findings. This includes:</p>
<p>
a) improving the treatment of bias from specific categories (e.g., faces) towards others;</p>
<p>
b) justifying the specific experimental and data analysis choices;</p>
<p>
c) expanding the interpretation and discussion of the results.</p>
<p>I believe that giving more attention to these aspects would improve the study and contribute positively to the field.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The current work investigates the neural signature of category representation in infancy. Neural responses during steady-state visually-evoked potentials (ssVEPs) were recorded in four age groups of infants between 3 and 15 months. Stimuli (i.e., faces, limbs, corridors, characters, and cars) were presented at 4.286 Hz with category changes occurring at a frequency of 0.857 Hz. The results of the category frequency analyses showed that reliable responses to faces emerge around 4-6 months, whereas responses to libs, corridors, and characters emerge at around 6-8 months. Additionally, the authors trained a classifier for each category to assess how consistent the responses were across participants (leave-one-out approach). Spatiotemporal responses to faces were more consistent than the responses to the remaining categories and increased with increasing age. Faces showed an advantage over other categories in two additional measures (i.e., representation similarity and distinctiveness). Together, these results suggest a different developmental timing of category representation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study design is well organized. The authors described and performed analyses on several measures of neural categorization, including innovative approaches to assess the organization of neural responses. Results are in support of one of the two main hypotheses on the development of category representation described in the introduction. Specifically, the results suggest a different timing in the formation of category representations, with earlier and more robust responses emerging for faces over the remaining categories. Graphic representations and figures are very useful when reading the results.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The role of the adult dataset in the goal of the current work is unclear. All results are reported in the supplementary materials and minimally discussed in the main text. The unique contribution of the results of the adult samples is unclear and may be superfluous.</p>
<p>It would be useful to report the electrodes included in the analyses and how they have been selected.</p>

<p>Yan et al. present an EEG study of category-specific visual responses in infancy from 3 to 15 months of age. In their experiment, infants viewed visually controlled images of faces and several non-face categories in a steady state evoked potential paradigm. The authors find visual responses at all ages, but face responses only at 4-6 months and older, and other category-selective responses at later ages. They find that spatiotemporal patterns of response can discriminate faces from other categories at later ages.</p>
<p>Overall, I found the study well-executed and a useful contribution to the literature. The study advances prior work by using well-controlled stimuli, subgroups of different ages, and new analytic approaches.</p>
<p>I have two main reservations about the manuscript: (1) limited statistical evidence for the category by age interaction that is emphasized in the interpretation; and (2) conclusions about the role of learning and experience in age-related change that are not strongly supported by the correlational evidence presented.</p>
<p>(1) The overall argument of the paper is that selective responses to various categories develop at different trajectories in infants, with responses to faces developing earlier. Statistically, this would be most clearly demonstrated by a category-by-age interaction effect. However, the statistical evidence for a category by interaction effect presented is relatively weak, and no interaction effect is tested for frequency domain analyses. The clearest evidence for a significant interaction comes from the spatiotemporal decoding analysis (p. 10). In the analysis of peak amplitude and latency, an age x category interaction is only found in one of four tests, and is not significant for latency or left-hemisphere amplitude (Supp Table 8). For the frequency domain effects, no test for category by age interaction is presented. The authors find that the effects of a category are significant in some age ranges and not others, but differences in significance don't imply significant differences. I would recommend adding category by age interaction analysis for the frequency domain results, and ensuring that the interpretation of the results is aligned with the presence or lack of interaction effects.</p>
<p>(2) The authors argue that their results support the claim that category-selective visual responses require experience or learning to develop. However, the results don't bear strongly on the question of experience. Age-related changes in visual responses could result from experience or experience-independent maturational processes. Finding age-related change with a correlational measure does not favor either of these hypotheses. The results do constrain the question of experience, in that they suggest against the possibility that category-selectivity is present in the first few months of development, which would in turn suggest against a role of experience. However the results are still entirely consistent with the possibility of age effects driven by experience-independent processes. The manner in which the results constrain theories of development could be more clearly articulated in the manuscript, with care taken to avoid overly strong claims that the results demonstrate a role of experience.</p>
