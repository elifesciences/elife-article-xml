<title>Abstract</title><p>The killing mechanism of many antibiotics involves the induction of DNA damage, either directly or indirectly, which triggers the SOS response. RecA, the master regulator of the SOS response, plays a crucial role in driving the evolution of resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics treated with a single dose of ciprofloxacin. However, the precise roles of RecA and SOS responses in the development of resistance under short-term β-lactam exposure remain unclear. In the present study, we observed a fast evolution of β-lactam resistance (20-fold increase in MIC in 8 hours) in <italic>E. coli</italic> after deleting RecA and exposing the bacteria to a single dose of ampicillin. Notably, once this type of resistance is established, it remains stable and can be passed on to subsequent generations. Contrary to previous findings, it is shown that this accelerated resistance development process is dependent on the hindrance of DNA repair, which is completely orthogonal to the SOS response. Additionally, we identified the rapid emergence of drug resistance associated mutations in the resistant bacterial genome, indicating the impairment of DNA repair. Through comprehensive transcriptome sequencing, we discovered that the expression of numerous antioxidative response genes is repressed in <italic>recA</italic> mutant resistant isolates, resulting in an excessive accumulation of ROS within the cells. This suggests that the induction of ROS drives the fast evolution of antibiotic resistance in RecA-deficient bacteria. Collectively, we show that the hindrance of DNA repair hampers cellular fitness, provides bacteria with genetic adaptability to survive in diverse stressful environments, and accelerates the evolution of antibiotic resistance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Addressing bacterial infections caused by emerging and drug-resistant pathogens represents a major global health priority. Bactericidal antibiotics can exert their effects on cells by directly or indirectly causing DNA damage or triggering the production of highly destructive hydroxyl radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). This, in turn, initiates a protective mechanism known as the SOS response, which enables bacterial survival against the lethal impacts of antibiotics by activating intrinsic pathways for DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The activation of DNA repair processes relies on specific genes, such as <italic>recA</italic>, which encodes a recombinase involved in DNA repair, and <italic>lexA</italic>, a repressor of the SOS response that can be inactivated by RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies have demonstrated that a single exposure to fluoroquinolones, a type of antibiotic that induces DNA breaks and triggers the SOS response, leads to the development of bacterial resistance in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) through a RecA and SOS response-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Given the crucial role of RecA in the SOS response, inhibiting RecA activity to deactivate the SOS response presents an appealing strategy for preventing the evolution of bacterial resistance to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Similarly, exposure to fluoroquinolones induces the SOS response and mutagenesis in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and the deletion of <italic>recA</italic> in this pathogen results in a significant reduction in resistance to fluoroquinolones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike fluoroquinolones, β-lactam antibiotics induce a RecA-dependent SOS response in <italic>E. coli</italic> through impaired cell wall synthesis, mediated by the DpiBA two-component signal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). The development of antibiotic resistance, triggered by exposure to β-lactams, has been extensively investigated using the cyclic adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) method. Mutations that arise during cyclic ALE experiments are attributed to errors occurring during continued growth, necessitating multiple rounds of β-lactam exposure to drive the evolution of resistance in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). However, the precise roles of RecA and SOS responses in the development of resistance under short-term β-lactam antibiotics exposure remain unclear.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in understanding the impact of the stress-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). While exploring methods to harness ROS-mediated killing has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of various antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), the role of ROS in antimicrobial activity has become a topic of controversy following challenges to the initial observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). The generation of ROS has been found to contribute to the development of multidrug resistance, as prolonged exposure to antibiotics in cyclic ALE experiments is known to generate ROS, leading to DNA damage and increased mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Nevertheless, there is still limited knowledge regarding the consequences of ROS accumulation in bacteria when the activity of RecA or the SOS response is suppressed. Here, in the present work, we observed a fast evolution of multi-drug resistance in an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain with the <italic>recA</italic> mutation, following a single exposure to β-lactam antibiotics. This evolution can be attributed to three mechanisms: compromised DNA repair, transcriptional repression of genes associated with antioxidative processes, and the excessive accumulation of ROS.</p>

<title>Single exposures to β-lactam antibiotics trigger a fast evolution of antibiotic resistance in the <italic>recA</italic> mutant strain</title>
<p>To investigate the impact of the SOS response on bacterial evolution towards β-lactam resistance, we generated a <italic>recA</italic> mutant strain (<italic>ΔrecA</italic>) from the <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 strain (LZ101). Initially, we conducted an ALE experiment using a slightly modified treatment protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) on the wild type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strains. During a period of three weeks, the cells were subjected to cycles of ampicillin exposure for either 4 or 8 hours at a concentration of 50 µg/mL (10 times the MIC) each day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). As anticipated based on previous studies, the intermittent ampicillin treatments over the course of three weeks resulted in the evolution of antibiotic resistance in the wild type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">C</xref>). However, we observed rapid development of ampicillin resistance in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain after a single exposure for 8 hours to ampicillin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-C</xref>). To ensure that the emergence of resistance we observed was not illusory due to technical issues during the <italic>recA</italic> knockout process, we employed another <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain (JW2669-1) provided by the Coli Genetic Stock Centre (CGSC) with the same killing procedure. The results from both bacterial strains were consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">B</xref>). To further investigate, we treated both the wild type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> cells with other β-lactams, including penicillin G and carbenicillin, at concentrations equivalent to 10 times the MIC (1 mg/mL and 200 µg/mL, respectively) for 8 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Consistently, these treatments also led to a fast evolution of antibiotic resistance in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">B</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess the stability of this accelerated antibiotic resistance acquired by the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain, we conducted a study wherein the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> resistant isolates, originating from the initial 8-hour treatment with ampicillin, were continuously cultivated in a medium devoid of antibiotics for a period of seven days. Our findings revealed that once resistance was established, resistance remained stable and was able to be passed on to subsequent generations even in the absence of ampicillin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Moreover, we performed a complementation experiment by introducing a plasmid containing <italic>recA</italic> under its native promoter into the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain prior to Step i in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, that is, before exposing the cells to ampicillin. Interestingly, this complemented strain displayed a comparable MIC to the isogenic wild type strain and maintained its sensitivity even after ampicillin treatment for up to 8 hours (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, the evolution of antibiotics is influenced by mutation and selection, among other factors. To further investigate the primary drivers behind the rapid development of antibiotic resistance, we employed rifamycin, an unrelated antibiotic. Our findings indicated that following an 8-hour exposure to ampicillin, the MIC of rifampicin reached about 100 µg/mL for the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain, marking a 10-fold increase compared to the wild-type strain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Moreover, we measured and calculated the mutation frequency by employing rifampicin as the selective agent in both the wild type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strains after the 8-hour ampicillin exposure. This was done by dividing the number of colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter on ampicillin plates by the number of CFU per milliliter on LB plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Our results revealed a significantly higher mutation frequency in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain in contrast to the wild type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). These findings together demonstrate that a singular exposure to β-lactam antibiotics markedly boosts mutation frequency and thereby triggers a fast evolution of antibiotic resistance that is stable and heritable in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain.</p>

<title>Rapid appearance of drug resistance associated DNA mutations in <italic>recA</italic> mutant resistant isolates</title>
<p>In bacteria, resistance to most antibiotics requires the accumulation of drug resistance associated DNA mutations developed over time to provide high levels of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). To verify whether drug resistance associated DNA mutations have led to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in <italic>recA</italic> mutant strain, we randomly selected 15 colonies on non-selected LB agar plates from the wild type surviving isolates, and antibiotic screening plates containing 50 µg/mL ampicillin from the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> resistant isolates, respectively, and performed whole-genome sequencing. We found that abundant drug resistance associated mutations occurred within all resistant isolates, including the promoter of the β-lactamase <italic>ampC (P<sub>ampC</sub>)</italic> in 8 isolates, the ampicillin-binding target PBP3 (<italic>ftsI</italic>) in 1 isolate, and the AcrAB-TolC subunit AcrB (<italic>acrB</italic>) mutations in 6 isolates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). A mutation in gene <italic>nudG</italic> was detected in wild type surviving isolates after the single exposure to ampicillin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), which is involved in pyrimidine (d)NTP hydrolysis to avoid DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Other mutations were listed in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>.</p>

<p>The presence of <italic>P<sub>ampC</sub></italic> mutations was accompanied by a significant increase in the production of β-lactamase in bacteria (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). This leads to specific resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. The gene <italic>acrB</italic> codes for a sub-component of the AcrAB-TolC multi-drug efflux pump, which is central in Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Mutations in AcrAB-TolC enhance the efflux of antibiotics and confer resistance to multiple drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Consequently, after short-term exposure to ampicillin, the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> isolates carrying the <italic>acrB</italic> mutations exhibited resistance to other types of antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol and kanamycin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">C</xref>). Treatment with high concentrations of 1-(1-Naphthylmethyl) piperazine (NMP), an efflux pump inhibitor (EPI) that competitively blocks TolC-composed efflux pumps, successfully restored the sensitivity of <italic>ΔrecA</italic> resistant isolates to ampicillin, bringing them back to the equivalent concentrations found in the wild type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that a single exposure to β-lactam antibiotics can lead to drug resistance associated DNA mutations that play a crucial role in the accelerated development of antibiotic resistance in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain.</p>

<title>Hindrance of SOS-independent DNA repair in <italic>recA</italic> mutant resistant isolates</title>
<p>The impaired ability to repair DNA damage can lead to an accelerated accumulation of DNA mutations. The cellular response to DNA damage, such as the SOS response, often influences the balance between bacterial susceptibility and resistance. We thereafter asked whether the absence of <italic>recA</italic> and subsequently induced inhibition of the SOS response can contribute to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>To investigate this, we first tested the ability of various mutants involved in different pathways of the SOS response to evolving antibiotic resistance following a single treatment with ampicillin for 8 hours at 50 µg/mL. A mutant form of the SOS master regulator LexA (<italic>lexA3</italic>), which is incapable of being cleaved and thus defective in SOS induction, did not exhibit antibiotic resistance evolution (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Additionally, the deletion of either DpiB or DpiA (encoded by <italic>citB</italic> or <italic>citA</italic>, respectively), inhibiting the DpiBA two-component signal transduction system, did not result in the development of antibiotic resistance after ampicillin exposure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Moreover, the deletion of several downstream effectors of the SOS response, including those involved in cell division inhibition (SulA and YmfM encoded by <italic>sulA</italic> and <italic>ymfM</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), and DNA repair (DNA Pol II, DNA Pol IV, and DNA Pol V encoded by <italic>polB</italic>, <italic>dinB</italic> and <italic>umuDC</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) also did not lead to the evolution of antibiotic resistance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Interestingly, these findings indicate that the fast evolution of antibiotic resistance is supposed to occur in an SOS-independent manner in the absence of <italic>recA</italic>.</p>

<p>In addition to the DNA repair components associated with the SOS response, DNA Pol I plays a role in processing RNA primers during lagging-strand synthesis and filling small gaps during DNA repair reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Since DNA Pol I (encoded by <italic>polA</italic>) has been demonstrated as an essential gene required for the growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> in rich medium, including the LB medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), we next utilized Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) to precisely locate the chromosome and DNA Pol I in a dynamic manner. During an 8 hour exposure to ampicillin, we observed the formation of multinucleated filaments in both the wild type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain, indicating a pause in cell division and suggesting a time period for bacterial DNA repair to take place (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). However, the expression level of DNA Pol I was significantly suppressed in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain compared to the wild type strain after 4 hours of ampicillin exposure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). More notably, the super-resolution colocalization analysis revealed a significantly lower ratio of co-localization between the chromosome and DNA Pol I in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), which together demonstrate that the hindrance of DNA repair caused by the absence of <italic>recA</italic> is crucial for the fast evolution of antibiotic resistance in an SOS-independent manner.</p>

<title>Repression on antioxidative-related gene transcription drives the fast evolution of antibiotic resistance in the <italic>recA</italic> mutant strain</title>
<p>To further comprehend the fast evolution of β-lactam resistance that was observed in this study, we investigated the changes in gene transcription induced by ampicillin treatment using a comprehensive transcriptome sequencing approach (total RNA-seq). Our analysis revealed significant alterations in the transcriptomic profiles of both the wild type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain isolates following a single treatment with ampicillin, compared to untreated controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Specifically, we identified changes in the expression of 161 and 248 coding sequences (with log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt; 2 and <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05) in the wild type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strains, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated a notable disparity in the effects of ampicillin on the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain compared to the wild type strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Additionally, a Venn diagram analysis confirmed that 138 and 225 genes were uniquely regulated by ampicillin exposure in the wild type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strains, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>To elucidate the differential expression of genes associated with specific biological functions, we conducted Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">B</xref>) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig. S5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">D</xref>). Our findings indicate that ampicillin profoundly impacted persistence pathways in the wild type strain, specifically affecting pathways related to quorum sensing, flagellar assembly, biofilm formation, and bacterial chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Conversely, in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain, a distinct functional category associated with the oxidative stress response exhibited significant and unique down-regulation. This category included activities such as sulfate transporter activity, iron-sulfur cluster assembly, oxidoreductase activity, and carboxylate reductase activity.</p>
<p>To identify specific genes showing significant fold changes (log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt; 2 and <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05), we used volcano plots to visualize the comprehensive changes in gene expression across the genome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). We examined the transcription levels associated with the SOS response system and found that the transcription of several proteins in the wild type strain can be significantly induced by the single exposure to ampicillin, including <italic>citB</italic> and <italic>dinB</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). However, in the <italic>recA</italic> mutant strain, antibiotic exposure does not affect the transcription levels of any SOS system-related proteins, suggesting that antibiotic exposure induced the SOS response in the wild type strain but not in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain. More importantly, we discovered that the induction of the transcription level of the DNA Pol I was significantly suppressed after the single treatment of ampicillin in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain compared with that in the wild type strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). This is consistent with our imaging results and further supports the notion that an SOS-independent evolutionary mechanism dominates the development of antibiotic resistance in <italic>recA</italic> mutant <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>
<p>Further, significant downregulation in the transcription of antioxidative-related genes in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain was detected, including <italic>cysJ</italic>, <italic>cysI</italic>, <italic>cysH</italic>, <italic>soda</italic>, and <italic>sufD</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). This downregulation suggested an excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to compromised cell antioxidative defences. It has been previously reported that the induction of mutagenesis can be stimulated by the overproduction of ROS during antibiotic administration, leading to the evolution of antibiotic resistance both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that elevated ROS levels might be responsible for the observed fast evolution of antibiotic resistance in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain. To test it, we supplemented the wild type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strains with 50 mM glutathione (GSH), a natural antioxidative compound, and treated them with ampicillin at a concentration of 50 μg/ml for 8 hours. Remarkably, the addition of GSH prevented the development of resistance to ampicillin in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>), without impairing the bactericidal effectiveness of ampicillin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>).</p>
<p>Apart from the SOS response, bacterial cells coordinate other DNA repair activities through a network of regulatory pathways, including excision repair (BER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). The excessive generation of ROS results in elevated levels of deoxy-8-oxo-guanosine triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP), an oxidized form of dGTP that becomes both highly toxic and mutagenic upon integration into DNA. The presence of 8-oxo-dG can induce SNP mutations, especially those occurring in guanine, which can be actively rectified by the BER repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Notably, BER glycosylases MutH and MutY can identify and repair these 8-oxo-dG-dependent mutations; however, when MutY and MutH are inactivated, unrepaired 8-oxo-dG can lead to the accumulation of SNP mutations within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). As a result, we conducted a further assessment of the transcription levels of the BER repair pathway in both the wild-type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain before and after a single exposure to ampicillin. We discovered that after an 8-hour treatment of ampicillin, three DNA repair-associated proteins, including MutH, MutY, and MutM, were notably suppressed in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we sequenced the surviving <italic>ΔrecA</italic> isolates and found that the addition of GSH inhibited drug resistance associated mutations in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain, which was detected in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> resistant isolates including genes of the promoter of <italic>ampC</italic> and <italic>acrB</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>). Given the DNA repair impairment resulting in the generation of ROS, it would have been expected for genes involved in the oxidative stress response to be induced in RecA-deficient cells. However, the repression of antioxidative-related genes indicated the involvement of transcriptional repressors that might be regulated by RecA. Consequently, we examined the transcription levels of all transcriptional repressors in both the wild type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain. Remarkably, we observed a significant upregulation of H-NS, a crucial transcriptional repressor (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref>). This finding suggests that the upregulation of H-NS could potentially account for the downregulation of antioxidant gene transcription levels in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we present a novel perspective challenging the conventional belief that disabling RecA to inhibit the SOS response can prevent bacteria from developing antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). While the SOS response and RecA have been extensively studied for their roles in antibiotic resistance evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), we observed a fast evolution of multi-drug resistance in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain triggered by single exposures to β-lactam antibiotics, which was driven by three mechanisms, including the impaired DNA repair, transcriptional repression of antioxidative-related genes, and excessive accumulation of ROS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Mechanism of rapid development of multi-drug resistance in the <italic>recA</italic> mutant <italic>E. coli</italic> strain.</title>
<p>The deletion of <italic>recA</italic> results in a decrease in DNA damage repair capability. Additionally, the absence of <italic>recA</italic> upregulates the transcription levels of the transcriptional repressor H-NS, although the mechanism of this regulation is still unclear. Upregulation of H-NS potentially inhibits the transcription levels of several downstream genes associated with antioxidant functions, leading to an excessive accumulation of ROS. The excessive production of ROS causes an increased occurrence of genetic mutations. Under antibiotic pressure, mutations related to drug resistance are selected, ultimately leading to the emergence of rapid multidrug resistance.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>We initially suspected that the decrease in DNA repair levels was caused by the suppression of the SOS response, mediated by the deficiency of RecA during rapid resistance development. We therefore examined the response to antibiotic exposure in various <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants lacking specific genes from the SOS response. However, we discovered that these strains remained susceptible after short-term exposure to ampicillin, providing evidence that the decrease in DNA repair levels, regulated by RecA in an SOS-independent manner, served as a mechanism for the accelerated development of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, we conducted super-resolution imaging studies to analyze the expression and localization of DNA Pol I. We observed a significant inhibition of DNA Pol I induction and its involvement in DNA repair. Moreover, a notable suppression of the BER repair system was observed in the <italic>recA</italic> mutant bacteria upon short-term exposure to antibiotics. While we do not yet have evidence explaining why the absence of <italic>recA</italic> might affect the transcriptional regulation of the BER repair system, this evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that the absence of RecA can lead to the accumulation of beneficial mutations within bacteria through downregulation of DNA repair capacity. The regulation of DNA repair by RecA is a significantly complex process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), and although we specifically demonstrated the regulation of DNA Pol I and BER repair system by RecA under antibiotic exposure, there should be other repair mechanisms impaired and contributed to this fast evolution of resistance, which needs to be investigated in future.</p>
<p>Antibiotics exert their bactericidal effects by targeting specific intracellular components, and the production of ROS is considered an alternative mechanism underlying quinolone-induced bacterial killing. However, emerging evidence suggests that lethality may arise from primary antibiotic-induced damage or a secondary response to lethal stress mediated by ROS. ROS generation can also contribute to the development of multidrug resistance, as it can directly damage DNA, leading to genetic mutations. In this study, we demonstrate that excessive ROS accumulation drives the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria with impaired DNA repair capabilities. Significantly, we discovered for the first time that antibiotic exposure can significantly increase the transcription of H-NS in the absence of <italic>recA</italic>. <italic>E. coli</italic> H-NS is a DNA-binding protein known for its involvement in transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). It binds to DNA in a sequence-independent manner, with a preference for A-/T-rich regions in curved DNA, thereby impeding transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Previous findings report that H-NS can down-regulate the transcriptional expression of <italic>cysIJH</italic> through the mediation of <italic>cysB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). While we have established a potential correlation between the increased transcription of H-NS genes induced by antibiotic exposure in RecA deficient cells and the decreased transcription of genes related to antioxidative processes, further investigations are imperative to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms employed by RecA in H-NS transcription and its inhibitory effects on antioxidative gene transcription.</p>
<p>In clinics, the resistance mechanism to β-lactams is not only associated with β-lactamase acquisition but also with increased expression of efflux pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Our research for the first time demonstrates the fast evolution of antibiotic resistance through the rapid accumulation of <italic>acrB</italic> mutations and enhanced functionality of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump in RecA-deficient bacteria exposed to a single dose of ampicillin. This finding supports the clinical observations that the clinical antibiotic resistance is accelerating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>).</p>
<p>DNA repair is a key target for many anti-cancer drugs that aim to destroy tumor cells by inducing DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Homologous recombination (HR) plays a crucial role in DNA repair, and Rad51, a vital protein in the HR pathway of eukaryotic cells, belongs to the <italic>recA</italic>/RAD51 gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Clinical trials are currently assessing a range of Rad51 inhibitors. Interestingly, studies have revealed that inhibitors targeting Rad51 can effectively inhibit the activity of RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Despite RecA and Rad51 sharing only approximately 30% sequence homology, the filaments they form and the conformational changes they induce in DNA are remarkably similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Notably, inhibitors of RecA have demonstrated the ability to enhance the antimicrobial effects of certain antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Our findings have significant clinical implications, especially for patients undergoing cancer treatment. The combination therapy involving β-lactam antibiotics and RecA inhibitors could potentially accelerate the evolution of multi-drug resistance at an alarming rate.</p>
<p>Our findings on the mechanism of the fast evolution of multidrug resistance in <italic>E. coli</italic> after a single exposure to a specific antibiotic can be applied more broadly. The overproduction of ROS is a common effect of many antibiotics and other strategies used to combat infections, such as antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) and cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). These approaches rely on ROS-mediated damage as the primary source of stress-induced damage. Thus, maintaining the transcription of genes involved in the oxidative stress response or the combined treatment with drugs and antioxidants shows promising potential to prevent stress-induced mutagenesis that is typically triggered by various classes of antibiotics.</p>

<p>Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3">Table S3</xref>. Luria-Bertani (LB) was used as broth or in agar plates. <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were grown in LB liquid medium or on LB agar (1.5% w/v) plates at 37°C, unless stated otherwise, antibiotics were supplemented, where appropriate. Antibiotic stock solutions were prepared by dissolving antibiotics in MilliQ filter sterilising, including ampicillin (50 mg/mL), penicillin G (100 mg/mL), carbenicillin (20 mg/mL), kanamycin (50 mg/mL) and tetracycline (10 mg/mL). Chloramphenicol stock solution was prepared in 95% EtOH (25 mg/mL). Antibiotic solutions were stored at −20°C (long-term) or 4°C (short-term).</p>

<title>Treatment with antibiotics to induce evolutionary resistance</title>
<p>For the single exposure to antibiotic experiment, an overnight culture (0.6 mL; 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/mL cells) was diluted 1:50 into 30 mL LB medium supplemented with antibiotics (50 μg/mL ampicillin, 1 mg/mL penicillin G, or 200 μg/mL carbenicillin) and incubated at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm for 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours, respectively. After each treatment, the antibiotic-containing medium was removed by washing twice (20 min centrifugation at 1500 g) in fresh LB medium (See <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> for method overview).</p>
<p>To test resistance, the surviving isolates were first resuspended in 30 mL LB medium and grown overnight at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm. The regrown culture was then plated onto LB agar and incubated overnight at 37°C. Single colonies were isolated and grown in LB medium for 4-6 hours at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm, which were then used to test the resistance or stored at −80°C for future use.</p>
<p>For the ALE antibiotic treatment experiments, an overnight culture (0.6 mL; 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/mL cells) was diluted 1:50 into 30 mL LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL ampicillin and incubated at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm for 4 or 8 hours. After treatment, the antibiotic-containing medium was removed by washing twice (20 min centrifugation at 1500 g) in a fresh LB medium. The remaining pellet was resuspended in 30 mL LB medium and grown overnight at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm. Ampicillin treatment was applied to the regrown culture and repeated until resistance was established, as confirmed by MIC measurement.</p>

<title>Antibiotic susceptibility testing</title>
<p>The susceptibility of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells to antibiotics was measured using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). In brief, overnight cultures were diluted and incubated at 37°C for 4-6 hours with shanking at 250 rpm. Cells were then diluted 1:100 and incubated with increasing concentrations of antibiotics in the Synergy HT BioTek plate reader (BioTek Instruments Inc., USA) at 37°C for 16 hours. It was programmed to measure the OD hourly at 595 nm (Gen5 software, BioTek Instruments Inc., USA). The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined as the concentration of antibiotic where no visible growth was observed.</p>

<title>Mutation frequency</title>
<p>Overnight cultures inoculated from single colonies in LB medium were diluted 1:1,000,000 and incubated at 37°C with shaking until the OD<sub>600</sub> reached to 1~1.3. This extreme dilution minimizes the presence of pre-existing stationary phase mutants. The total number of colony-forming units per ml (CFU/ml) was determined by plating on LB agar. To count mutants, cells were centrifuged and plated on LB agar with an appropriate concentration of antibiotic. LB plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C and selective plates were incubated for 48-72 hours at 37°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>).

<title>Whole genome sequencing</title>
<p>Resistant clones were isolated by selection using LB agar plates with the supplementation of ampicillin at 50 μg/mL. Chromosomal DNA was extracted and purified using the PureLink™ Genomic DNA mini kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher Scientific). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was conducted following the Nextera Flex library preparation kit process (Illumina). Briefly, genomic DNA was quantitatively assessed using Quant-iT picogreen dsDNA assay kit (Invitrogen, USA). The sample was normalised to the concentration of 1 ng/μL. 10 ng of DNA was used for library preparation. After tagmentation, the tagmented DNA was amplified using the facility’s custom-designed i7 or i5 barcodes, with 12 cycles of PCR. The quality control for the samples was done by sequencing a pool of samples using MiSeq V2 nano kit - 300 cycles. After library amplification, 3 μL of each library was pooled into a library pool. The pool was then cleaned up using SPRI beads following the Nextera Flex clean-up and size selection protocol. The pool was then sequenced using a MiSeq V2 nano kit (Illumina, USA). Based on the sequencing data generated, the read count for each sample was used to identify the failed libraries (i.e., libraries with less than 100 reads).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Jin et al. investigated how the bacterial DNA damage (SOS) response and its regulator protein RecA affect the development of drug resistance under short-term exposure to beta-lactam antibiotics. Canonically, the SOS response is triggered by DNA damage, which results in the induction of error-prone DNA repair mechanisms. These error-prone repair pathways can increase mutagenesis in the cell, leading to the evolution of drug resistance. Thus, inhibiting the SOS regulator RecA has been proposed as a means to delay the rise of resistance.</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors deleted the RecA protein from E. coli and exposed this ∆recA strain to selective levels of the beta-lactam antibiotic, ampicillin. After an 8-hour treatment, they washed the antibiotic away and allowed the surviving cells to recover in regular media. They then measured the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ampicillin against these treated strains. They note that after just 8-hour treatment with ampicillin, the ∆recA had developed higher MICs towards ampicillin, while by contrast, wild-type cells exhibited unchanged MICs. This MIC increase was also observed in subsequent generations of bacteria, suggesting that the phenotype is driven by a genetic change.</p>
<p>The authors then used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify mutations that accounted for the resistance phenotype. Within resistant populations, they discovered key mutations in the promoter region of the beta-lactamase gene, ampC; in the penicillin-binding protein PBP3 which is the target of ampicillin; and in the AcrB subunit of the AcrAB-TolC efflux machinery. Importantly, mutations in the efflux machinery can impact the resistance towards other antibiotics, not just beta-lactams. To test this, they repeated the MIC experiments with other classes of antibiotics, including kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and rifampicin. Interestingly, they observed that the ∆recA strains pre-treated with ampicillin showed higher MICs towards all other antibiotics tested. This suggests that the mutations conferring resistance to ampicillin are also increasing resistance to other antibiotics.</p>
<p>The authors then performed an impressive series of genetic, microscopy, and transcriptomic experiments to show that this increase in resistance is not driven by the SOS response, but by independent DNA repair and stress response pathways. Specifically, they show that deletion of the recA reduces the bacterium's ability to process reactive oxygen species (ROS) and repair its DNA. These factors drive the accumulation of mutations that can confer resistance to different classes of antibiotics. The conclusions are reasonably well-supported by the data, but some aspects of the data and the model need to be clarified and extended.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
A major strength of the paper is the detailed bacterial genetics and transcriptomics that the authors performed to elucidate the molecular pathways responsible for this increased resistance. They systemically deleted or inactivated genes involved in the SOS response in E. coli. They then subjected these mutants to the same MIC assays as described previously. Surprisingly, none of the other SOS gene deletions resulted in an increase in drug resistance, suggesting that the SOS response is not involved in this phenotype. This led the authors to focus on the localization of DNA PolI, which also participates in DNA damage repair. Using microscopy, they discovered that in the RecA deletion background, PolI co-localizes with the bacterial chromosome at much lower rates than wild-type. This led the authors to conclude that deletion of RecA hinders PolI and DNA repair. Although the authors do not provide a mechanism, this observation is nonetheless valuable for the field and can stimulate further investigations in the future.</p>
<p>In order to understand how RecA deletion affects cellular physiology, the authors performed RNA-seq on ampicillin-treated strains. Crucially, they discovered that in the RecA deletion strain, genes associated with antioxidative activity (cysJ, cysI, cysH, soda, sufD) and Base Excision Repair repair (mutH, mutY, mutM), which repairs oxidized forms of guanine, were all downregulated. The authors conclude that down-regulation of these genes might result in elevated levels of reactive oxygen species in the cells, which in turn, might drive the rise of resistance. Experimentally, they further demonstrated that treating the ∆recA strain with an antioxidant GSH prevents the rise of MICs. These observations will be useful for more detailed mechanistic follow-ups in the future.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Throughout the paper, the authors use language suggesting that ampicillin treatment of the ∆recA strain induces higher levels of mutagenesis inside the cells, leading to the rapid rise of resistance mutations. However, as the authors note, the mutants enriched by ampicillin selection can play a role in efflux and can thus change a bacterium's sensitivity to a wide range of antibiotics, in what is known as cross-resistance. The current data is not clear on whether the elevated &quot;mutagenesis&quot; is driven ampicillin selection or by a bona fide increase in mutation rate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on a technical level, the authors employed WGS to identify resistance mutations in the treated ampicillin-treated wild-type and ∆recA strains. However, the WGS methodology described in the paper is inconsistent. Notably, wild-type WGS samples were picked from non-selective plates, while ΔrecA WGS isolates were picked from selective plates with 50 μg/mL ampicillin. Such an approach biases the frequency and identity of the mutations seen in the WGS and cannot be used to support the idea that ampicillin treatment induces higher levels of mutagenesis.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to establish what the basal mutation rates of both the WT and ∆recA strains are. Currently, only the ampicillin-treated populations were reported. It is possible that the ∆recA strain has inherently higher mutagenesis than WT, with a larger subpopulation of resistant clones. Thus, ampicillin treatment might not in fact induce higher mutagenesis in ∆recA.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This study aims to demonstrate that E. coli can acquire rapid antibiotic resistance mutations in the absence of a DNA damage response. To investigate this, the authors employed a sophisticated experimental framework based on a modified Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE) workflow. This workflow involves numerous steps culminating in the measurement of antibiotic resistance. The study presents evidence that a recA strain develops ampicillin resistance mutations more quickly than the wild-type, as shown by measuring the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and mutation frequency. Whole-genome sequencing of 15 recA- colonies resistant to ampicillin revealed predominantly inactivation of genes involved in the multi-drug efflux pump system, whereas, in the wild-type, mutations appear to enhance the activity of the chromosomal ampC cryptic promoter. By analyzing mutants involved in the SOS response, including a lexA3 mutant incapable of inducing the SOS response, the authors conclude that the rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance occurs in an SOS-independent manner when recA is absent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of the four experimental conditions suggests that genes related to antioxidative responses drive the swift evolution of antibiotic resistance in the recA- strain.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
However, a potential limitation of this study is the experimental design used to determine the 'rapid' evolution of antibiotic resistance. It may introduce a significant bottleneck in selecting ampicillin-resistant mutants early on. A recA mutant could be more susceptible to ampicillin than the wild-type, and only resistant mutants might survive after 8 hours, potentially leading to their enrichment in subsequent steps. To address this concern, it would be critical to perform a survival analysis at various time points (0h, 2h, 4h, 6h, and 8h) during ampicillin treatment for both recA and wild-type strains, ensuring there is no difference in viability.</p>
<p>The observation that promoter mutations are absent in recA strains could be explained by previous research indicating that amplification of the AmpC genes is a mechanism for E. coli resistance to ampicillin, which does not occur in a recA-deficient background (PMID# 19474201).</p>
<p>The section describing Figure 3 is poorly articulated, and the conclusions drawn are apparent. The inability of a recA strain to induce the SOS response is well-documented (lines 210 and 278). The data suggest that merely blocking SOS induction is insufficient to cause 'rapid' evolution in their experimental conditions. To investigate whether SOS response can be induced independently of lexA cleavage by recA, alternative experiments, such as those using a sulA-GFP fusion, might be more informative.</p>
<p>In Figure 4E, the lack of increased SulA gene expression in the wild-type strain treated with ampicillin is unexpected, given that SulA is an SOS-regulated gene. The fact that polA (Pol I) is going down should be taken into account in the interpretation of Figures 2D and 2E.</p>
<p>The connection between compromised DNA repair, the accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) based on RNA-seq data, and accelerated evolution is merely speculative at this point and not experimentally established.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In the present work, Zhang et al investigate the involvement of the bacterial DNA damage repair SOS response in the evolution of beta-lactam drug resistance evolution in Escherichia coli. Using a combination of microbiological, bacterial genetics, laboratory evolution, next-generation, and live-cell imaging approaches, the authors propose short-term drug resistance evolution that can take place in RecA-deficient cells in an SOS response-independent manner. They propose the evolvability of drug resistance is alternatively driven by the oxidative stress imposed by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and inhibition of DNA repair. Overall, this is a nice study that addresses a growing and fundamental global health challenge (antimicrobial resistance). However, although the authors perform several multi-disciplinary experiments, there are several caveats to the authors' proposal that ultimately do not fully support their interpretation that the observed antimicrobial resistance evolution phenotype is due to compromised DNA repair.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors introduce new concepts to antimicrobial resistance evolution mechanisms. They show short-term exposure to beta-lactams can induce durably fixed antimicrobial resistance mutations. They propose this is due to comprised DNA repair and oxidative stress. This is primarily supported by their observations that resistance evolution phenotypes only exist for recA deletion mutants and not other genes in the SOS response</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors do not show any direct evidence (1) that these phenotypes exist in strains harboring deletions in other DNA repair genes outside of the SOS response, (2) that DNA damage is increased, (3) that reactive oxygen species accumulate, (4) that accelerated resistance evolution can be reversed by anything other than recA complementation. The authors do not directly test alternative hypotheses. The conclusions drawn are therefore premature.</p>
