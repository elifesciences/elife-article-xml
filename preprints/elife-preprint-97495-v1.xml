<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen and causative agent of bacillary dysentery. <italic>S. flexneri</italic> is closely related to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> but harbors a virulence plasmid that encodes a Type III Secretion System (T3SS) required for host cell invasion. Widely recognized as a paradigm for research in cellular microbiology, <italic>S. flexneri</italic> has emerged as important to study mechanisms of cell-autonomous immunity, including septin cage entrapment. Here we use high-content high-resolution microscopy to monitor the dynamic and heterogeneous <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infection process by assessing multiple host and bacterial parameters (DNA replication, protein translation, T3SS activity). In the case of infected host cells, we report a reduction in DNA and protein synthesis together with morphological changes that suggest <italic>S. flexneri</italic> can induce cell-cycle arrest. We developed an artificial intelligence image analysis approach using Convolutional Neural Networks to reliably quantify, in an automated and unbiased manner, the recruitment of SEPT7 to intracellular bacteria. We discover that heterogeneous SEPT7 assemblies are recuited to actively pathogenic bacteria with increased T3SS activation. Our automated microscopy workflow is useful to illuminate host and bacterial dynamics at the single-cell and population level, and to fully characterise the intracellular microenvironment controlling the <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infection process.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterium and the etiologic agent of bacillary dysentery, an intestinal infectious disease that kills more than 150 thousand people worldwide per year, disproportionally affecting children under 5 years old from low- and middle-income countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network., 2020</xref>). After the ingestion of a small number of bacteria (10-100), <italic>S. flexneri</italic> rapidly colonises the human intestinal epithelium. For this, <italic>S. flexneri</italic> uses a Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) that injects bacterial effectors into the host cell to modulate key aspects of the infection process and to evade innate immune defences by the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Schnupf &amp; Sansonetti, 2019</xref>). Following uptake by host cells, <italic>S. flexneri</italic> breaks its vacuolar compartment to access the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ray et al., 2010</xref>). Here, the virulence factor IcsA enables <italic>S. flexneri</italic> to hijack host actin and polymerise comet tails that render bacteria motile to disseminate to neighbouring cells and spread in the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernardini et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Egile et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Septins are highly-conserved GTP-binding proteins that form heteromeric complexes (hexamers, octamers) that assemble into non-polar filaments, bundles and rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Martins et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Soroor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Szuba et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Woods &amp; Gladfelter, 2021</xref>). Septins are involved in many physiological cellular processes (eg. cytokinesis, cilia formation), and play key roles during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mostowy &amp; Cossart, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Robertin &amp; Mostowy, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Spiliotis &amp; Nakos, 2021</xref>). Septins form collar-like structures at the plasma membrane during bacterial invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boddy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mostowy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Robertin et al., 2023</xref>), and ring-like structures surrounding membrane protrusions in cell-to-cell bacterial spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mostowy et al., 2010</xref>). In the cytosol septins are recruited to actin-polymerising bacteria, including <italic>S. flexneri</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic>, as cage-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mostowy et al., 2010</xref>). In the case of <italic>S. flexneri</italic>, septins are recruited to μm-scale curvature at bacterial poles and the division site, which are enriched in the negatively charged phospholipid cardiolipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Krokowski et al., 2018</xref>). Recent work has shown that IcsA promotes the recruitment of septins to <italic>S. flexneri</italic>, and that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhibits <italic>S. flexneri</italic>-septin cage entrapment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lobato-Márquez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mostowy et al., 2010</xref>). Septin cages prevent bacterial actin tail motility and therefore are considered as an antibacterial mechanism of host defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Krokowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mostowy et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Intracellular infection is usually portrayed as a uniform, synchronised and highly orchestrated process. However, infection assays performed in controlled laboratory environments with isogenic populations display a high level of complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Avraham et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Toniolo et al., 2021</xref>). It is particularly unknown how different subsets of bacteria (eg. motile vs. non motile bacteria) can colonise distinct intracellular microenvironments and become targeted by multiple cell-autonomous immunity mechanisms (eg. septin cages, autophagy). It has been proposed that this diversity of intracellular niches impacts bacterial physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Day et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gutierrez &amp; Enninga, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Santucci et al., 2021</xref>). For example, it may affect individual bacterial ability to acquire nutrients, to be exposed to varying antibiotic concentrations, or to elicit different responses and signalling pathways within the host cell. While the concept of phenotypic heterogeneity in prokaryotic clonal populations is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>), the concept is emerging also in eukaryotic cells where non genetic differences may for instance explain individual cell sensitivity and responses by cell-autonomous immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">McDonald &amp; Dedhar, 2024</xref>). It is therefore paramount to study host and bacterial cells at the single-cell level, to assess the individual responses that collectively contribute to the infection process.</p>
<p>Here, to dissect the complexity of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infection in epithelial cells, we use high-content high-resolution microscopy coupled to automated image analysis. High-content microscopy enables the automated acquisition of thousands of microscopy images and therefore is useful to capture the heterogeneity of individual host and bacterial cells during the infection process for quantitative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aylan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brodin &amp; Christophe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Deboosere et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dramé et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fisch et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lensen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pylkkö et al., 2021</xref>). We analyse multiple parameters, such as morphological host cell features, the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of DNA and proteins in both host and bacterial cells, as well as activation of the bacterial T3SS. To investigate the antimicrobial potential of septin-mediated immunity, we develop a deep-learning based approach to automatically identify septin-<italic>S. flexneri</italic> interactions. Together, we highlight the power of high-content microscopy and artificial intelligence to reveal insights on both host and bacterial cells, and illuminate fundamental biology underlying the <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infection process.</p>

<title>Capturing the heterogeneity of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infection using high-content microscopy</title>
<p>To understand the complexity and reveal the heterogeneity of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infection in human epithelial cells, we dissected the infection process using high-content high-resolution microscopy (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref></bold>). We observed a mean of 11.5% of infected cells measured by fluorescence at 3h 40 min post infection (hpi) at MOI 100:1 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). These infected cells presented different burdens of bacteria following an exponential decay distribution (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>), reflective of the formation of infection foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ortega et al., 2019</xref>). With growing evidence of the cytosol being a non-homogeneous compartment containing concentration gradients, biomolecular condensates, protein complexes and concentrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">van Tartwijk &amp; Kaminski, 2022</xref>), we tested whether <italic>S. flexneri</italic> may be exposed to different intracellular microenvironments. For this, we measured the distance of bacteria to the centroid of cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>) and observed a median distance of 8.74 µm. The median distance to the centroid of the cell significantly decreased with increasing bacterial burden (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>), suggesting that the microenvironment of bacteria is diverse and changes as bacteria replicate intracellularly and populate the central parts of host cytosol after uptake at the host cell periphery. To dissect the heterogeneity in host cells, we quantified an increase of 36.9% and 22.3% in the cellular and nuclear area of infected cells, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G, I</xref></bold>), which was dependent on the infection burden (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H, J</xref></bold>). To test whether this increase reflected an increase in volume, we measured the total amount of Hoechst fluorescence in the nucleus of the cell as a proxy for nuclear volume (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>) and observed a 29.4% increase in infected cells. To test if this effect was due to morphological rearrangements during infection, we treated cells with Latrunculin B to inhibit actin polymerisation. While cells treated with Latrunculin B decreased their cellular area (but not their nuclear area) (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B, C</xref></bold>), the drug did not abrogate the difference in size between infected and uninfected cells. Taken together, these results highlight an increase in cellular volume during infection that is dependent on the infection burden.</p>

<title>Epithelial cells reduce <italic>de novo</italic> DNA and protein synthesis upon infection</title>
<p>In order to understand the physiological state of enlarged epithelial cells infected with <italic>S. flexneri</italic>, we monitored host DNA replication and protein translation using Click-chemistry. Using a 1 h pulse of the clickable thymidine analogue Edu, we specifically visualized and quantified <italic>de novo</italic> DNA synthesis in the population of epithelial cells with high-content microscopy (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). We identified the subpopulation of cells in S-phase by their high level of Edu incorporation. Consistent with this, this subpopulation of cells was fully abrogated in the presence of the S-phase blocker Aphidicolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pedrali-Noy et al., 1980</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2A, B</xref></bold>). Approximately one third of uninfected cells (34.45%) were found in S-phase (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B, C</xref></bold>), in agreement with S-phase lasting around one third of the cell cycle (∼8h out of ∼22h). Infected cells presented a similar proportion of cells in S-phase (35.89%), indicating that <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infection did not block transition of cells from G1 to S at the timepoint tested. We then assessed the amount of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA synthesis incorporated in cells in S-phase during infection. Surprisingly, we observed a reduction of Edu incorporation in infected cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>), which was dependent on the bacterial burden (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>). These results indicate that <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infection slows down DNA synthesis of epithelial cells.</p>

<p>Collectively, the cell size increase together with the reduction of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA and protein synthesis in infected epithelial cells suggests that <italic>S. flexneri</italic> induces an arrest in the host cell cycle.</p>

<title>Design of a deep learning pipeline to automatically identify bacteria interacting with SEPT7</title>
<p><italic>S. flexneri</italic> have been shown to interact with septins during infection. These interactions include septin ring-like structures surrounding phagocytic cups, autophagosomes, actin tails and protrusions, all being morphologically diverse structures that are normally scored by hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Krokowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lobato-Márquez et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mostowy et al., 2010</xref>). To study septin-associated bacteria using high-content microscopy, we designed a tailored analysis pipeline for the automatic and unbiased identification of SEPT7-bacteria interactions (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>). SEPT7 is a core component of septin hexamers and octamers, and is historically used to identify septin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mostowy et al., 2010</xref>). The analysis pipeline includes two deep learning models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are effective in solving classification tasks in computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., n.d.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lecun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nielsen, 2015</xref>). As septins can surround individual and also multiple bacteria simultaneously (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>), we focused on individual bacteria. For this, we trained the first classification model to discriminate between “single” bacteria and “clumps”. The second classification model was designed to assign those single bacteria into “SEPT7-positive structures” or alternatively “negatives”, according to the morphology of SEPT7 recruitment around them.</p>

<caption><title>Microscopy pipeline to automatically identify SEPT7-<italic>S. flexneri</italic> interactions</title>
<p>(A) Diagram representing the steps involved in the imaging and analysis pipeline. After infection, fixation and staining, high number of images are automatically acquired using the high-content microscope. Scale bar, 10 µm. These are then processed to segment bacteria based on their fluorescence, so that a square field containing the bacteria in the centre is cropped and saved for subsequent analysis. A deep learning model based on CNN is applied using Jupiter notebooks and the Python Keras library hosted on Colab to sort individual, isolated bacteria. Several processing steps are applied using Python to remove noise (band-pass filtering by difference of Gaussian and mean filters), normalise the data across datasets for comparison, and remove signal away from the bacteria which is irrelevant for the identification of SEPT7 assemblies. Scale bar, 1 µm. Finally, a similar second deep learning model based on CNN is applied to identify SEPT7 interacting with bacteria.</p></caption>

<p>The first classification model (discerning “single” versus “clumped” bacteria) together with its training and performance metrics is summarized in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>. A large dataset of annotated bacteria (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B</xref></bold>) was used to train a Sequential model with a typical CNN architecture that was experimentally tested and optimised accordingly for best results (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). This model provided a good fit of the training data (high accuracy, low loss), with similar predictive power for the validation dataset (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, E</xref></bold>). Performance of the model was further assessed with a confusion matrix where a separate annotated test dataset was challenged and correct number of predictions scored, showing that 96% of SEPT7 structures and 83% of clumps were correctly identified (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></bold>). Finally, effective performance of the model was ensured with high values achieved in additional metrics testing for type I and II errors (precision, recall, F1-score) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>The second classification task (identification of “SEPT7 positive” vs “negative” bacteria) was more challenging due to their intrinsic heterogeneity plus the presence of ubiquitious SEPT7 filaments that populate the vicinity of bacteria (but do not associate with bacteria per se). To address these challenges, we increased the amount of data and complexity of the second classification model (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H-J</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>) compared to the first (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref></bold>). This included more than 1200 images of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> associated to SEPT7, both from infections with wild-type bacteria or expressing AfaI to increase bacterial invasion. The training process achieved a high accuracy and low loss for the training and validation dataset (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K, L</xref></bold>). Correct prediction of manually annotated SEPT7 positive structures was 80% as shown in the confusion matrix (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M</xref></bold>), with performance metrics Precision, Recall and F1 score also around 0.8 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4N</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Characterization of the morphological heterogeneity of SEPT7 recruitment to <italic>S. flexneri</italic></title>
<p>The training of the classification model to identify bacteria associated to SEPT7 required a large dataset of images. We observed diverse morphological conformations of SEPT7 signal around bacteria (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 A-C</xref></bold>). We differentiated five frequent subcategories from a total of 855 cases. The first corresponds to most cases (66.7%), where SEPT7 forms rings that entrap bacteria transversally (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, B, a</xref></bold>). We also observed two categories where SEPT7 surrounds bacteria more homogeneously either in a tight (18.2%) or loose association (6.1%) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, B, b-c</xref></bold>). Finally, we observed partial SEPT7 recruitment, with only one (5.0%) or two (4.0%) bacterial poles being targeted (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, B, d-e</xref></bold>). Given this diversity, we combined the entire dataset to summarise the probability of SEPT7 interactions with bacteria (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). As bacteria are found in any orientation inside epithelial cells, we included only those instances where the z-projection of the bacterial axis measured more than 2.5μm, ensuring they were positioned horizontally when imaged. Representations shown in <bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A, C</xref></bold> and graphs in <bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1B, D</xref></bold> can be understood as a probability map of the area of influence of SEPT7 when associating with intracellular <italic>S. flexneri</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Unravelling the intrinsic heterogeneity of host and bacterial cells underlying the infection process is paramount to design effective therapeutic strategies. High-content and high-throughput image analysis are ideal tools to capture this heterogeneity when coupled to automatic phenotypic image analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Eliceiri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mattiazzi Usaj et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pegoraro &amp; Misteli, 2017</xref>). Here we use high-content high-resolution microscopy and automated image analysis to quantitatively dissect the heterogeneity of <italic>S. flexneri</italic> in epithelial cells at the single-cell and population level at unprecedented subcellular detail.</p>
<p>We discover that <italic>S. flexneri</italic> induces important physiological changes in epithelial cells after 3h40min post infection. These include a marked decrease of DNA synthesis in cells in S-phase, a collective shutdown of protein translation, and a larger cellular and nuclear area, all in a bacterial-burden dependent manner. Collectively, these observations suggest <italic>S. flexneri</italic> infection induces host cell stress and a halt in the normal progression of the cell cycle. Consistent with this, <italic>S. flexneri</italic> has been shown to induce genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bergounioux et al., 2012</xref>), inhibit translation and induce formation of stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>), and block the G2/M phase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Iwai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). In the natural <italic>S. flexneri</italic> niche of the human gut, such an arrest would prevent maturation and shedding of infected epithelial cells, thereby promoting efficient gut colonisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Iwai et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>To understand how bacteria are targeted by cell-autonomus immune defences, such as septin cage entrapment, it is necessary to investigate phenotypic characteristics of targeted bacteria and the heterogeneous recruitment of cell-autonomous immune factors. While traditional image segmentation tools fail to enable this task, rapidly evolving developments in the field of computer vision are democratising the use of deep learning and CNNs for multiple applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Berg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Stringer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">von Chamier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Weigert et al., 2020</xref>) including infection biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Davidson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fisch et al., 2019b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Touquet et al., 2018</xref>). However, the analysis of complex datasets still requires a tailored approach, as shown here for bacterial interactions with the septin cytoskeleton (which is ubiquitious in the cell and forms diverse assemblies whose precise identifcation requires high resolution). We successfully implement a CNN based approach for the automated classification of bacteria associated with SEPT7 assemblies, enabling the analysis of thousands of bacterial cells while saving time and preventing human bias.</p>
<p>A large dataset of images depicting <italic>S. flexneri</italic> – SEPT7 interactions was acquired to train the deep learning algorithm and to characterize the diversity of these structures. We observe that the most frequent septin assembly is in the form of rings transversally surrounding the bacterial surface. We also detected alternative morphologies, including homogeneous SEPT7 labelling surrounding the bacterial surface (tight vs loose), as well as the discrete recruitment of SEPT7 to one or two bacterial poles. While previous work has shown that septin cage assembly around <italic>S. flexneri</italic> can start with the discrete recruitment of septins to one or two bacterial poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Krokowski et al., 2018</xref>), it is not yet known if the different septin assemblies we describe here correspond to different stages or fates of the same structure or whether it marks separate biological events.</p>
<p>We use deep learning analysis to interrogate intracellular bacteria and show that <italic>S. flexneri</italic> associated with SEPT7 present heterogenous DNA and protein synthesis. In addition, we show that bacteria associated with SEPT7 have increased T3SS activity (as compared to bacteria not associated with SEPT7) indicating that SEPT7 is recruited to actively pathogenic bacteria. T3SS activity has been shown to be higher in motile bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Campbell-Valois et al., 2014</xref>) which reinforces the antimicrobial role of septins in counteracting actin tail motility. Altogether, our deep learning tool to analyse septin-bacteria interactions opens the door to future studies on interactions between bacteria and components of cell-autonomous immunity.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>Heterogeneity in a controlled lab environment is only a small representation of the broader heterogeneity underlying the clinical infection process, considering the genetic background of the patient, interactions with microbiota, etc. In the future, our pipeline can be applied to investigate septin-bacteria interactions among different <italic>Shigella</italic> spp. or clinically relevant strains, as well as other intracellular bacteria (eg. <italic>M. marinum, Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>). In addition, our pipeline can be adapted to identify and score other cytoskeletal structures (such as actin tails) or membrane organelles (such as autophagosomes) associated with intracellular bacteria. Ultimately, we envision that our automated microscopy workflows will help to screen pharmacologic or genetic libraries in a multiparametric manner and understand their impact on host and bacterial cells at the single-cell and population level. In this way, novel host and bacterial factors underlying heterogeneity and bacterial pathogenesis could be identified, leading to transformative therapeutic strategies to combat bacterial infection in humans.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence and fluorescence microscopy</title>
<p>Bacteria, coverslips or 96-well microplates containing adherent infected or uninfected cells were washed three times with PBS pH 7.4 and fixed 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) at RT. Fixed cells were washed three times with PBS pH 7.4 and subsequently permeabilized 5min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (in PBS). Cells were then washed three times in PBS and incubated 1h with primary antibodies diluted in PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then washed three times in PBS and incubated 45 min with anti-rabbit secondary antibodies diluted 0.1% Triton X-100 (in PBS), and Hoestch and Alexa-conjugated phalloidin where indicated. 96-well microplates were washed three times in PBS and preserved in 0.01% sodium azide (#10338380 Thermo Scientific) in PBS pH 7.4. Stained bacteria cultures and coverslips were washed three times with PBS pH 7.4 mounted on glass slides with ProLong™ Diamond Antifade Mountant (#P36970I Invitrogen). Fluorescence microscopy on stained bacteria was performed using a using a 63×/1.4 C-Plan Apo oil immersion lens on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope driven by ZEN Blacksoftware (v2.3). Microscopy images were obtained using z-stack image series taking 8–16 slices. Fluorescence microscopy on infected or uninfected cells was performed using a ZEISS Plan-APOCHROMAT 20× / 0.95 Autocorr Objective or a ZEISS Plan-APOCHROMAT 50×/1.2 water immersion lens coupled to a 0.5x tubelens on a Zeiss CellDiscoverer 7 with Airyscan detectors driven by ZEN Blue software (v3.5). Microscopy images were obtained using z-stack image series taking 32 slices. Confocal images were processed using Airyscan processing (Weinerfilter) using “Auto Filter” and “3D Processing” options.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, López-Jiménez and colleagues demonstrated the utility of using high-content microscopy in dissecting host and bacterial determinants that play a role in the establishment of infection using Shigella flexneri as a model. The manuscript nicely identifies that infection with Shigella results in a block to DNA replication and protein synthesis. At the same time, the host responds, in part, via the entrapment of Shigella in septin cages.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strength of this manuscript is its technical aspects. They nicely demonstrate how an automated microscopy pipeline coupled with artificial intelligence can be used to gain new insights regarding elements of bacterial pathogenesis, using Shigella flexneri as a model system. Using this pipeline enabled the investigators to enhance the field's general understanding regarding the role of septin cages in responding to invading Shigella. This platform should be of interest to those who study a variety of intracellular microbial pathogens.</p>
<p>Another strength of the manuscript is the demonstration - using cell biology-based approaches- that infection with Shigella blocks DNA replication and protein synthesis. These observations nicely dovetail with the prior findings of other groups. Nevertheless, their clever click-chemistry-based approaches provide visual evidence of these phenomena and should interest many.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are two main weaknesses of this work. First, the studies are limited to findings obtained using a single immortalized cell line. It is appreciated that HeLa cells serve as an excellent model for studying aspects of Shigella pathogenesis and host responses. However, it would be nice to see that similar observations are observed with an epithelial cell line of intestinal, preferably colonic origin, and eventually, with a non-immortalized cell line, although it is appreciated that the latter studies are beyond the scope of this work.</p>
<p>The other weakness is that the studies are minimally mechanistic. For example, the investigators have data to suggest that infection with Shigella leads to an arrest in DNA replication and protein synthesis; however, no follow-up studies have been conducted to determine how these host cell processes are disabled. Interestingly, Zhang and colleagues recently identified that the Shigella OspC effectors target eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 to block host cell translation (PMID: 38368608). This paper should be discussed and cited in the discussion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Septin caging has emerged as one of the innate immune responses of eukaryotic cells to infections by intracellular bacteria. This fascinating assembly of eukaryotic proteins into complex structures restricts bacteria motility within the cytoplasm of host cells, thereby facilitating recognition by cytosolic sensors and components of the autophagy machinery. Given the different types of septin caging that have been described thus far, a single-cell, unbiased approach to quantify and characterise septin recruitment at bacteria is important to fully grasp the role and function of caging. Thus, the authors have developed an automated image analysis pipeline allowing bacterial segmentation and classification of septin cages that will be very useful in the future, applied to study the role of host and bacterial factors, compare different bacterial strains, or even compare infections by clinical isolates.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors developed a solid pipeline that has been thoroughly validated. When tested on infected cells, automated analysis corroborated previous observations and allowed the unbiased quantification of the different types of septin cages as well as the correlation between caging and bacterial metabolic activity. This approach will prove an essential asset in the further characterisation of septin cages for future studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As the main aim of the manuscript is to describe the newly developed analysis pipeline, the results illustrated in the manuscript are essentially descriptive. The developed pipeline seems exceptionally efficient in recognising septin cages in infected cells but its application for a broader purpose or field of study remains limited.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript uses high-content imaging and advanced image-analysis tools to monitor the infection of epithelial cells by Shigella. They perform some analysis on the state of the cells (through measurements of DNA and protein synthesis), and then they focus on differential recruitment of Sept7 to the bacteria. They link this recruitment with the activity of the bacterial T3SS, which is a very interesting discovery. Overall, I found numerous exciting elements in this manuscript, and I have a couple of reservations. Please see below for more details on my reservations. Nevertheless, I think that these issues can be addressed by the authors, and doing so will help to make it a convincing and interesting piece for the community working on intracellular pathogens. The authors should also carefully re-edit their manuscript to avoid overselling their data (see below for issues I see there). I would consider taking out the first figure and starting with Figure 3 (Figure 2 could be re-organized in the later parts)- that could help to make the flow of the manuscript better.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The high-content analysis including the innovative analytical workflows are very promising and could be used by a large number of scientists working on intracellular bacteria.</p>
<p>The finding that Septins (through SEPT7) are differentially regulated through actively secreting bacteria is very exciting and can steer novel research directions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript makes a connection between two research lines (1: Shigella infection and DNA/protein synthesis, 2: regulation of septins around invading Shigella) that are not fully developed - this makes it sometimes difficult to understand the take-home messages of the authors.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether the analysis that was done on projected images actually reflects the phenotypes of the original 3D data. This issue needs to be carefully addressed.</p>

<p>We thank the Reviewer for their constructive feedback and the excitement for our results, including our findings on T3SS activity and <italic>Shigella</italic>-septin interactions_._ In accordance with the Reviewer’s comments, we agree to carefully re-edit our manuscript to avoid overselling our data in a future version of the manuscript. We will also consider to rearrange figures depending on new results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the manuscript is mostly technical and therefore some of our experimental observations would benefit from follow up mechanistic studies in the future. We highlight our vision for broader applicability in response to weaknesses raised by Reviewer 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is not clear whether the analysis that was done on projected images actually reflects the phenotypes of the original 3D data. This issue needs to be carefully addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that characterizing 3D data using 2D projected images has limitations.</p>
<p>We observe an increase in cell and nuclear surface that does not strictly imply a change in volume. This is why we measure Hoechst intensity in the nucleus using SUM-projection (as it can be used as a proxy of DNA content of the cell). However, we agree that future use of other markers (such as fluorescent labelled histones) would make our conclusions more robust.</p>
<p>Regarding the different orientation of intracellular bacteria, we agree that investigation of septin recruitment is more challenging when bacteria are placed perpendicular to the acquisition plane. In a first step, we trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using 2D data, as it is easier/faster to train and requires fewer annotated images. In doing so, we already managed to correctly identify 80% of <italic>Shigella</italic> interacting with septins, which enabled us to observe higher T3SS activity in this population. In future studies, we will maximize the 3D potential of our data and retrain a CNN that will allow more precise identification of <italic>Shigella</italic>-septin interactions and in depth characterization of volumetric parameters.</p>
