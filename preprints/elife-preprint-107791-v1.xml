<title>Summary</title>
<p>Signalling to the podocyte via the structurally related insulin receptor (IR) or insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1) is important for podocyte function. This study sought to elucidate the compound role of the insulin/IGF1 axis in podocytes using transgenic mice and cell culture models deficient in both receptors.</p>
<p>Podocyte specific IR/IGF1R knockdown mice developed a severe kidney phenotype with albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis and renal failure with death occurring in some mice between 4 and 24 weeks. Simultaneous knockdown of both receptors in cultured podocytes resulted in &gt;50% cell death by 7 days.</p>
<p>Proteomic analysis revealed a striking downregulation of spliceosome-related proteins in IR/IGF1R knockdown podocytes with long-read RNA sequence data indicating an increased fraction of transcripts with intron retention/premature termination codons in these cells.</p>
<p>This work underlines the critical importance of podocyte insulin/IGF signalling revealing a novel role for this extrinsic hormonal signalling axis in regulating gene transcription.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Podocytes are highly specialised, terminally differentiated epithelial cells located at the urinary aspect of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in the kidney. They are critical in maintaining glomerular filtration barrier integrity thus preventing the development of albuminuria, an independent risk factor for end-stage-kidney-disease [ESKD] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), cardiovascular morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) and death. Therefore, understanding the critical signalling pathways necessary for maintaining podocyte health is desirable.</p>
<p>The insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling axis regulates many aspects of growth and metabolism: insulin signalling is predominantly associated with metabolism and IGF signalling with growth and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). However, insulin, IGF1 and their cognate receptors (the insulin receptor [IR] and insulin-like growth factor receptor [IGF1R]) share significant structural homology and several common downstream signalling nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The IR and IGF1R can bind each other’s ligands and can act redundantly in some contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). The constitutive global (whole body) loss of either the IR or IGF1R in murine knockout models is lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) suggesting a limited ability for these receptors to compensate for each other in every cell type. However, it is now clear that the insulin / IGF axis has different roles in different cell types. Several mouse models with tissue-specific dual knockout of both the IR and IGF1R show differential consequences occurring in a cell type dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>).</p>
<p>Insulin signalling to the podocyte via the IR is critical for podocyte function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) and it is apparent that IGF signalling is also important for podocyte homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Recently we have shown that loss of podocyte IGF1 signalling can have both detrimental and beneficial effects dependent upon the level of IGF1R suppression: whilst near total loss of podocyte IGF1R expression results in severe mitochondrial dysfunction associated with cell death, partial receptor inhibition promotes podocyte survival in conditions of cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we show that combined simultaneous loss of both the IR and IGF1R in podocytes is physiologically highly detrimental and present proteomic and transcriptomic analyses indicating that the IR/IGF1R hormonal signalling axis is crucial in controlling spliceosome assembly and RNA processing in this cell.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Mouse models</title>
<p>Mice in which exon four of the IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) and exon three of the IGF1R have been flanked by loxP sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) were crossed with podCre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Progeny with the genotype podCre <sup>+/-</sup> IR <sup>wt/fl</sup> IGF1R<sup>wt/fl</sup> was then crossed with IR<sup>fl/fl</sup> IGF1R<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice to generate podocyte specific IR/IGF1R knockdown animals from embryonic day 12 (podDKO) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp Figure 1A</xref>). Cre negative littermates served as controls. All mice were on a mixed genetic background including contributions from 129/Sv, FVB and C57BL/6. Both sexes were studied, and no phenotypic differences observed.</p>

<title>Urinary albumin and creatinine measurements</title>
<p>Albumin and creatinine levels in spot collections of mouse urine were measured using a mouse-specific albumin ELISA (Universal Biologicals, Cat# E90-134) and creatinine companion kit (Exocell, Cat# 1012), following the manufacturer’s methodology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Histology and periodic acid-Schiff staining</title>
<p>Kidneys were fixed in 10% buffered neutral formalin, further processed and paraffin embedded. 3 μm sections were cut and stained using a Periodic acid-Schiff staining kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Tissues were imaged using a Leica DN2000 microscope and micrographs taken using Leica Application Suite software. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ; all images were contrast enhanced using the same parameters.</p>
<p>Glomerulosclerosis was scored for each glomerulus as follows: 0=normal glomeruli; 1=up to 25% involvement; 2=25-50% involvement; 3=50-75% involvement; 4=over 75% involvement. The glomerulosclerosis index was calculated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) and according to the formula [(1xN1)+(2xN2)+(3xN3)+(4xN4)]/(N0+N1+N2+N3+N4) were Nx is the number of glomeruli with each given score.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Electron microscopy</title>
<p>Tissues for electron microscopy were fixed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, 2% glutaraldehyde, and imaged on a Technai 12 transmission electron microscope. Average slit diaphragm, foot process and glomerular basement membrane width were calculated using ImageJ assessing at least 20 regions of glomerular basement membrane from at least 2 glomeruli per mouse.</p>

<title>Lentiviral transduction of a conditionally immortalised IR/IGF1R floxed podocyte cell line</title>
<p>Kidneys were isolated from IR <sup>fl/fl</sup> IGF1R<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice and used to make a temperature-sensitive SV40 conditionally immortalised podocyte cell line using techniques as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2</xref>). Podocytes were cultured at 33°C and when 50% confluent were thermo-switched to 37°C and incubated for a further 7 days before transduction with a lentivirus expressing Cre recombinase as described previously. Transduction was in RPMI media with hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma) at 4 μg/ml and the virus used at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Following a 24-hour incubation, the lentivirus was removed and replaced with fresh media. Cells were incubated for a further 3-7 days before imaging and protein extraction.</p>
<p>To determine ciDKO cell number, cells were washed 3 times in PBS, the nuclei stained with Hoechst (Sigma) at 1 μg/ml and imaged using an IN Cell analyser 2200 (GE Healthcare), and data analysed using IN Cell analyser Developer software (GE Healthcare).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>Conditionally immortalised podocyte cell lines were cultured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). For acute insulin and IGF1 stimulation, cells were serum starved for 4 hours, then 10 nM and 100 nM of insulin or 10 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml IGF1 was applied to the cells for 10 minutes. Spliceosome inhibitor treatment was carried out using pladienolide B at 0-100 nM for 48 hours before determination of cell number.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Cultured cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). 10-30 μg of protein was resolved by electrophoresis and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in TRIS-buffered saline with 0.1% tween 20 and 5% BSA for 1 hour and then incubated overnight with primary antibody at a dilution of 1:1000. Membranes were washed before incubation with horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma). Immunoreactive bands were visualised using Clarity ECL Western blotting substrate (Biorad) on a GE AI600 imager. Densitometry was performed using ImageJ software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>Proteomic analysis</title>
<p>ciDKO podocytes (3 days after Cre lentiviral transduction and before significant cell loss) were lysed in RIPA buffer and subjected to LC-MS/MS using isobaric TMT labelling as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). n=9 ciDKO and control podocytes were analysed. Wild-type mouse podocytes served as controls.</p>
<p>The data output from Proteome Discoverer 2.1 was further analysed in Microsoft Office Excel, Graphpad Prism 9 and Perseus 1.6.10.43 using log2-transformed scaled total protein abundance data. A <italic>t</italic>-test was used to determine significantly differentially expressed proteins. Hierarchical clustering was performed in Perseus by Euclidean distance using <italic>k</italic>-means pre-processing. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and enrichments were performed in Perseus using a Fisher test of significantly changed proteins versus the unchanged population after annotation with the proteins.</p>
<p>For Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) enrichment analysis, the ciDKO expression dataset was submitted to STRING with log2 fold change values associated with each protein. Functional enrichments were identified, and enrichment scores calculated based on aggregate fold change or Kolmogorov-Smirnov testing in STRING.</p>

<sec id="s2i">
<title>Long read RNA sequencing</title>
<p>RNA was isolated from ciDKO podocytes (3 days after Cre lentiviral transduction) and wild-type control cells (n=4 for each group) using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA was quantified using a Qubit Fluorimeter (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and quality assessed using the TapeStation system (Agilent). All samples had an RNA integrity number &gt;8.</p>
<p>Barcoded PCR-cDNA library preparation was performed on 75 ng of RNA from each sample using the SQK-PCB109 kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). The resulting library was quantified using a Qubit Fluorimeter (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and molecular weight estimated using the TapeStation system (Agilent). 50 fmol of library was then loaded onto three promethION R9.4.1 flowcells (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), sequenced for 72 h and basecalled using guppy_basecaller 5.0.17 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) in high accuracy mode.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2j">
<title>Long read RNA analysis</title>
<p>IsoQuant analysis: the reads were aligned using IsoQuant (version 2.3.0), with option --data_type nanopore. The mouse gencode annotation (V29) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) was used. The IsoQuant reference-based transcripts counts were used for further analysis. Differential expression analysis between the 2 conditions was performed using limma function with voom approach from limma Bioconductor package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). The transcripts were analyzed without being grouped by genes, which will lead to a more stringent analysis than if done by gene (multiple correction testing is done by transcript). For visualization in the genome browser, the bam files were converted to bigWig files (using a scaleFactor calculated with edgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>)). FLAIR analysis (flair version 1.6.4): pychopper (version 2.7.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) was first run on the total reads. Then the full length and rescued reads were aligned with “flair align” on the reference fasta file. The alignments were corrected using “flair correct”. The alignments were then collapsed using “flair collapse”, using the 8 replicates, into 1 complete reference. Then flair quantify, diffExp and diffSplice were run using the 2x4 replicates to get the rank lists of the 4 splicing event types (cassette, 3’, 5’, IR). A custom R script was used to find the nearest gene to the splicing events. In parallel, flair mark_intron_retention and predictProductivity (option --longestORF) were run on each corrected alignments to list the intron retention events by sample and predict the transcripts productivity by sample.</p>

<title>Quantitative PCR</title>
<p>cDNA was synthesised from RNA isolated from ciDKO and wild-type podocytes using the High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix (Merck) in a StepOnePlus PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). Primers with the following sequences were purchased from Life Technologies: Fn1 F 5’ CCCAGCTCACTGACCTAAGC 3’; Fn1 R 5’ GGAAGAGTTTAGCGGGGTCC 3’; Hcfc1r1 F 5’ GCCACCACTGGGGTAACTC 3’; Hcfc1r1 R 5’CTTCGGGAAAAGTCACAGGG3’; beta actin F 5’ GACAGGATGCAGAAGGAGATTACT 3’; beta actin R 5’ TGATCCACATCTGCTGGAAGGT 3’.</p>

<title>podDKO mice develop a severe renal phenotype by 24 weeks</title>
<p>To study the effect of the combined loss of podocyte IR and IGF1R <italic>in vivo</italic>, transgenic mice were generated by crossing IR<sup>fl/fl</sup>/IGF1R<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of a podocin promotor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1A</xref>). There was no difference in body weight or blood glucose in podDKO mice compared with littermate controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A and B</xref>). However, knockout mice developed albuminuria with significantly increased urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (uACR) (p&lt;0.01) at 24 weeks of age (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The severity of the phenotype was variable and while some mice exhibited only mild albuminuria, more severe renal disease was observed in others resulting in death in ∼20% of the mice. uACR was not increased in Cre negative and podCre expressing mice at 6 months excluding Cre toxicity as the driver of albuminuria in podDKO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1C</xref>). Glomerulosclerosis was significantly increased (p&lt;0.05) in knockout mice with areas of sclerosis and tubular protein casts visible on periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stained sections (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), together with evidence of increased fibrosis as determined by Masson’s trichrome staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed disruption of the filtration barrier ultrastructure with significantly increased (p&lt;0.01) foot process width (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Podocyte number, evaluated by immunofluorescence (IF) using a podocyte specific WT1 antibody, was significantly (p&lt;0.0001) reduced in podDKO mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>

Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using Perseus software to determine that samples were clustered according to the experimental group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figures S3A and S3B</xref>). 4842 proteins were significantly differentially expressed in ciDKO cells compared to wild-type controls with 2127 proteins upregulated and 2715 proteins downregulated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S3C</xref>).

<title>Exposure of cultured podocytes, but not glomerular endothelial cells, to the spliceosome inhibitor pladienolide B results in dose dependent cell death</title>
<p>Proteomic analysis indicated a significant reduction in spliceosome proteins associated with all stages of the splicing process in ciDKO podocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have previously shown that signalling to the podocyte via the IR is critical for kidney function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) while the IGF1R has a role in maintaining podocyte mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). The current study used <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> models lacking both receptors simultaneously to further elucidate important common signalling pathways regulated by the insulin/IGF1 axis in the podocyte.</p>
<p>We initially used a transgenic mouse model (podDKO) to determine the physiological consequences of dual receptor loss <italic>in vivo</italic>. These mice developed an obvious renal phenotype: significant albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis, and ultrastructural filtration barrier damage was apparent by 6 months and was severe enough to cause death in a number of mice. However, body weight and blood glucose in podDKO mice were comparable to controls, in contrast with several other mouse models where alongside tissue-specific manifestations, double receptor knockout also gives rise to systemic effects. For example, IR/IGF1R knockout in kidney proximal tubule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) both result in decreased body size while other models have impairments in systemic metabolism: mice with adipose tissue-specific IR/IGF1R knockout develop diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) while dual receptor knockout in hippocampus and central amygdala results in a decrease in glutamate receptors and reduced glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>We performed unbiased proteomic analysis to identify the mechanistic processes responsible for the detrimental phenotype observed in our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> models. Given the well-established mitogenic effect of IGF1 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), this showed a predictable downregulation of cell cycle and DNA replication pathways. However, we also observed a decrease in DNA damage response pathways and histone methylation. As post-mitotic cells with a limited capacity for replenishment, maintaining genomic integrity is crucial for podocyte health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Furthermore, altered histone methylation, another feature of the podocyte IR/IGF1R knockdown proteome, has been shown to affect the function of the DNA repair system in podocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Recent studies suggest that podocyte DNA damage and changes in glomerular DNA methylation may be useful markers of chronic kidney disease and correlate with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline in patients with diabetic nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). It therefore seems plausible that deficiencies in DNA damage repair mechanisms contribute to the detrimental phenotype and ultimate loss of podocytes resulting from IR/IGF1R knockdown.</p>
<p>Evidence from previous studies suggests that DNA damage is intrinsically linked with spliceosome function: DNA damage affects the expression, activity and localisation of splicing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) while spliceosome dysfunction leads to DNA damage by promoting the aberrant formation of R loops during transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Thus, accurate spliceosome function is critical for maintaining genomic integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). In addition to the decreased expression of DNA damage response proteins revealed by our proteomic data, we also observed a striking reduction in the levels of proteins required for spliceosome assembly and regulation in ciDKO podocytes. We have previously used lentiviral mediated expression of Cre recombinase to induce knockout of other podocyte genes, notably glycogen synthase kinase 3 α and β in combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). While this resulted in a highly detrimental cellular phenotype, proteomic analysis of these cells showed no differences in the expression of spliceosome related proteins, so we are confident that the results from the current study are not due to generalised cell death/dysfunction.</p>
<p>The spliceosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex whose critical function in all eukaryotic cells is to catalyse the removal of introns from precursor messenger RNA molecules and join the flanking exons to generate mature mRNA transcripts that direct protein synthesis during translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Spliceosome function is also a driver of significant proteomic diversity via alternative splicing, whereby multiple mRNA transcripts containing different exon combinations are produced from a single gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Mutations in core spliceosome components, spliceosome assembly factors or regulatory proteins can result in defects in pre-RNA processing, increased nonsense-mediated decay of affected transcripts, abnormal or truncated protein products and changes to alternative splicing. Such erroneous splicing can substantially alter the transcriptome in specific cell types. This has been shown in immune cell dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Somatic mutations in genes encoding spliceosome components can result in diseases, known as spliceosomopathies, (including retinitis pigmentosa, myelodyplastic syndromes and craniofacial disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>)), with tissue-specific manifestations, suggesting that although spliceosome factors are ubiquitously expressed, they likely have cell type specific functions. Interestingly, one of the splice factors frequently involved in these spliceosomopathies - SF3B4 - is down regulated in the double knock-down podocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). We used the spliceosome inhibitor pladienolide B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>), which targets the SF3B complex, to investigate the effect of reduced spliceosome activity in wild-type podocytes. Developed as an anti-neoplastic agent, pladienolide B is effective at reducing cell viability, particularly in cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), presumably due to an increased demand for translation and protein production in such actively dividing cells. In contrast, a comparatively high dose of pladienolide B is not sufficient to induce cytotoxicity in HEK 293T cells, suggesting that not all cell types are equally sensitive to spliceosome inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). While we were able to reproduce the low dose cytotoxic effect of this spliceosome inhibitor in HeLa cells reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>), the response of the glomerular cell types we assayed differed. No cytotoxic effect was apparent in glomerular endothelial cells while in contrast, we found podocytes to be sensitive to pladienolide B, resulting in significant cell death and suggestive of the importance of adequate spliceosome function in this cell type. The splicing factor CD2 antigen cytoplasmic tail binding protein 2 (CD2BP2) is known to be essential for kidney development and podocyte integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>) while alternative splicing of genes including Wilm’s tumour gene 1 (WT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>) is important in podocyte homeostasis and disruption of this tightly regulated process associated with chronic kidney disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). We therefore performed long-read RNA sequencing to explore the effect of podocyte IR/IGF1R loss on spliceosome function and the transcriptome of ciDKO cells.</p>
<p>Long read RNA Seq analysis shows that podocyte IR/IGF1R depletion has a marked impact on alternative splicing events, notably an increase in the fraction of transcripts with intron retention/premature termination codons. Interestingly, enrichment analysis shows that many transcripts associated with spliceosome function and RNA transport have increased levels of intron retention, cassette exon splicing and alternative 5’ and 3’ splicing. Although it has recently been recognised that intron retention can serve as a mechanism for regulating gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>) including the regulation of RNA processing genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>), our results could also be explained by the apparent loss of the spliceosome in ciDKO podocytes. Indeed, intron retention secondary to mutations in spliceosome components is a hallmark of a number of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>) and neurodegenerative conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Moreover, it is likely that our RNA seq analysis underestimates the incidence of transcripts with premature termination codons as many will be targeted for nonsense-mediated decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>) and would thus be unmeasurable in our samples.</p>
<p>Significant differential transcript expression was apparent in ciDKO podocytes with transcripts encoding the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin among the top hits. We detected increased expression of a Fn1 splice variant which included the EDA and EDB exons. Although EDA/EDB-fibronectin is important during development, its expression is limited in adult tissue including kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). However, EDA-fibronectin is upregulated in cultured podocytes exposed to TGFβ treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>) and a pathological increase in this isoform results in insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>), together with fibrosis in multiple tissues including lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>) and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). It is conceivable that the changes in podocyte splicing resulting from IR/IGF1R knockdown promote a fibrotic phenotype by altering the ratio of fibronectin variants expressed, consistent with the increased fibrosis observed in our podDKO mice.</p>
<p>In summary, we have shown that the IR/IGF1R axis is critical for podocyte health. Mechanistically it does this through controlling gene transcription by maintaining spliceosome function. This suggests hormonal signals are important for the genetic control of these terminally differentiated cells.</p>

<p>This study investigated the role of insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) in the renal glomerular podocytes by characterizing the mice with dual deletion of both receptors in vivo as well as the cultured murine podocytes with induced deletion of both receptors in vitro. The <bold>solid</bold> data presented in this paper demonstrated the critical requirement of both IR and IGF1R signaling in normal podocyte physiology in mice, albeit a more detailed characterization of the mouse model is desired. Interestingly, long-range sequencing revealed significant retention of introns in mRNAs, due to an altered spliceosome level resulted from the loss of IR and IGF1 signaling in cultured podocytes. This new finding suggests an essential role of IR and IGF1R signaling in regulating RNA metabolism in podocyte, which provides <bold>useful</bold> information for the understanding of physiology and metabolism of podocytes. However, the underlying molecular mechanism for such a regulation is still unclear and awaits further studies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the roles of the insulin receptor and the insulin growth factor receptor were investigated in podocytes. Mice in which both receptors were deleted developed glomerular dysfunction and developed proteinuria and glomerulrosclerosis over several months. Because of concerns about incomplete KO, the authors generated podocyte cell lines where both receptors were deleted. Loss of both receptors was highly deleterious with greater than 50% cell death. To elucidate the mechanism, the authors performed global proteomics and find that spliceosome proteins are down-regulated. They confirm this by using long-range sequencing. These results suggest a novel role for these pathways in podocytes.</p>
<p>This is primarily a descriptive study. The mechanism of how insulin and IGF1 signaling are linked to the spliceosome is not addressed and the phenotype of the mice is only superficially explored. The main issues are that the completeness of the mouse KO is never assessed nor is the completeness of the KO in cell lines. The absence of this data is a significant weakness. The mouse experiments would be improved if the serum creatinines were measured to provide some idea about the severity of the kidney injury. An attempt to rescue the phenotype by overexpression of SF3B4 would also be useful. If this didn't rescue the phenotype, an explanation in the text would suffice. As insulin and IGF are regulators of metabolism, some assessment of metabolic parameters would be an optional add-on. Lastly, in the cell line experiments, the authors should discuss the caveats associated with studying the 50% of the cells that survive vs the ones that died.</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>With the GLP1 agonists providing renal protection, there is great interest in understanding the role of insulin and other incretins in kidney cell biology. It is already known that Insulin and IGFR signaling play important roles in other cells of the kidney, therefore, there is great interest in understanding these pathways in podocytes. The major advance is that these two pathways appear to have a role in RNA metabolism, the major limitations are the lack of information regarding the completeness of the KO's. If, for example, they can determine that in the mice, the KO is complete, that the GFR is relatively normal, then the phenotype they describe is relatively mild.</p>
<p>Comments on revision plan:</p>
<p>I agree with the suggested experiments especially, the experiments to examine whether insulin/IGF1 signaling have effects on splicing proteins. An alternative experiment would be to ask whether rescue of IR or IGF1R would ameliorate the splicing effects.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, submitted to Review Commons (journal agnostic), Coward and colleagues report on the role of insulin/IGF axis in podocyte gene transcription. They knocked out both the insulin and IGFR1 mice. Dual KO mice manifested a severe phenotype, with albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis, renal failure and death at 4-24 weeks.</p>
<p>Long read RNA sequencing was used to assess splicing events. Podocyte transcripts manifesting intron retention were identified. Dual knock-out podocytes manifested more transcripts with intron retention (18%) compared wild-type controls (18%), with an overlap between experiments of ~30%.</p>
<p>Transcript productivity was also assessed using FLAIR-mark-intron-retention software. Intron retention w seen in 18% of ciDKO podocyte transcripts compared to 14% of wild-type podocyte transcripts (P=0.004), with an overlap between experiments of ~30% (indicating the variability of results with this method). Interestingly, ciDKO podocytes showed downregulation of proteins involved in spliceosome function and RNA processing, as suggested by LC/MS and confirmed by Western blot.</p>
<p>Pladienolide (a spliceosome inhibitor) was cytotoxic to HeLa cells and to mouse podocytes but no toxicity was seen in murine glomerular endothelial cells.</p>
<p>The manuscript is generally clear and well-written. Mouse work was approved in advance. The four figures are generally well-designed, with bars/superimposed dot-plots.</p>
<p>Methods are generally well described. It would be helpful to say that tissue scoring was performed by an investigator masked to sample identity.</p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>(1) Data are presented as mean/SEM. In general, mean/SD or median/IQR are preferred to allow the reader to evaluate the spread of the data. There may be exceptions where only SEM is reasonable.</p>
<p>(2) It would be useful to for the reader to be told the number of over-lapping genes (with similar expression between mouse groups) and the results of a statistical test comparing WT and KO mice. The overlap of intron retention events between experimental repeats was about 30% in both knock-out podocytes. This seems low and I am curious to know whether this is typical for typical for this method; a reference could be helpful.</p>
<p>(3) Please explain &quot;adjusted p value of 0.01.&quot; It is not clear how was it adjusted. The number of differentially-expressed proteins between the two cell types was 4842.</p>
<p>Comments on revision plan:</p>
<p>The authors suggest additional experiments that should address my concerns and probably the other reviewers' concerns.</p>
<p>I encourage the authors to proceed with their proposed experiments and revisions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>These investigators have previously shown important roles for either insulin receptor (IR) or insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) in glomerular podocyte function. They now have studied mice with deletion of both receptors and find significant podocyte dysfunction. They then made a podocyte cell line with inducible deletion of both receptors and find abnormalities in transcriptional efficiency with decreased expression of spliceosome proteins and increased transcripts with impaired splicing or premature termination.</p>
<p>The studies appear to be performed well and the manuscript is clearly written.</p>
<p>There are a number of potential issues and questions with these studies.</p>
<p>(1) For the in vivo studies, the only information given is for mice at 24 weeks of age. There needs to be a full time course of when the albuminuria was first seen and the rate of development. Also, GFR was not measured. Since the podocin-Cre utilized was not inducible, there should be a determination of whether there was a developmental defect in glomeruli or podocytes. Were there any differences in wither prenatal post natal development or number of glomeruli?</p>
<p>(2) Although the in vitro studies are of interest, there are no studies to determine if this is the underlying mechanism for the in vivo abnormalities seen in the mice. Cultured podocytes may not necessarily reflect what is occurring in podocytes in vivo.</p>
<p>(3) Given that both receptors are deleted in the podocyte cell line, it is not clear if the spliceosome defect requires deletion of both receptors or if there is redundancy in the effect. The studies need to be repeated in podocyte cell lines with either IR or IGFR single deletions.</p>
<p>(4) There are no studies investigating signaling mechanisms mediating the spliceosome abnormalities.</p>
<p>Comments on revision plan:</p>
<p>I do not have any changes from my prior review. I applaud the authors for developing a plan to address the questions and concerns raised in my prior review.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>This is primarily a descriptive study and no technical concerns are raised. The mechanism of how insulin and IGF1 signaling are linked to the spiceosome is not addresed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not think the paper is descriptive as we used non-biased phospho and total proteomics in the DKO cells to uncover the alterations in the spliceosome (that have not been previously described) that were detrimental. However, we are happy to look further into the underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>We would propose:</p>
<p>(1) Stimulating/inhibiting insulin/IGF signalling pathways in the Wild-type and DKO knockout cells and check expression levels and/or phosphorylation status of splice factors (including those in Figure 3E) and those revealed by phospho-proteomic data; a variety of inhibitors of insulin/IGF1 pathways could also be used along the pathways that are shown in Fig 2.</p>
<p>(2) Looking at the RNaseq data bioinformatically in more detail – the introns/exons that move up or down are targets of the splice factors involved; most splice factors binding sequences are known, so it should be possible to ask bioinformatically – from the sequences around the splice sites of the exons and introns that move in the DKO, which splice factors binding sites are seen most frequently? To uncover splice factors/RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that are involved in the insulin signaling we will use a software named MATT which was specifically designed to look for RNA-binding motifs (PMID 30010778). In brief, using the long-sequencing data, we will test 250 nt sequences flanking the splice sites of all regulated splicing events (intronic and exonic) against all RNA- binding proteins in the CISBP-RNA database (PMID 23846655) using MATT. This will result in a list of RBPs potentially involved in the insulin signaling. We will validate these by activating insulin signaling (similar to Figures 2 B,C) and probe whether the RBPs are activated (e.g. phosphorylated or change in expression) or we will manipulate expression of the candidate RBPs and measure how they affect the insulin signaling.</p>
<p>(3) Examining the phospho and total proteomic data for IGF1R and Insulin receptor knockout alone podocytes (which we have already generated) and analysing these in more detail and include this data set to elucidate the relative importance of both receptors to spliceosome function.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The phenotype of the mouse is only superficially addressed. The main issues are that the completeness of the mouse KO is never assessed nor is the completeness of the KO in cell lines. The absence of this data is a significant weakness.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologise for not making clear but we did assess the level of receptor knockdown in the animal and cell models.  The <italic>in vivo</italic> model showed variable and non-complete levels of insulin receptor and IGF1 receptor podocyte knock down (shown in supplementary figure 1B). This is why we made the <italic>in vitro</italic>  floxed podocyte cell lines in which we could robustly knockdown both the insulin receptor and IGF1 receptor (shown in Figure 2A)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The mouse experiments would be improved if the serum creatinines were measured to provide some idea how severe the kidney injury is.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We can address this:</p>
<p>We have further urinary Albumin:creatinine ratio (uACR) data at 12, 16 and 20 weeks. We also have more blood tests of renal function that can be added. There is variability in creatinine levels which is not uncommon in transgenic mouse models (probably partly due to variability in receptor knock down with cre-lox system). This is part of rationale of developing the robust double receptor knockout cell models where we knocked out both receptors by &gt;80%.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>An attempt to rescue the phenotype by overexpression of SF3B4 would also be useful. If this didn't work, an explanation in the text would suffice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would consider  over express SF3BF4 in the Wild type and DKO cells and assess the effects on spliceosome if deemed necessary.  However, we think it is unlikely to rescue the phenotype as so many other spliceosome components are downregulated in the DKO cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>As insulin and IGF are regulators of metabolism, some assessment of metabolic parameters would be an optional add-on.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have some detail on this and can add to the manuscript. However it is not extensive as not a major driver of this work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lastly, the authors should caveat the cell experiments by discussing the ramifications of studying the 50% of the cells that survive vs the ones that died.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you, we appreciate this and this was the rationale behind cells being studied after 2 days differentiation before significant cell loss in order to avoid the issue of studying the 50% of cells that survive.</p>

Intron retention w seen in 18% of ciDKO podocyte transcripts compared to 14% of wild-type podocyte transcripts (P=0.004), with an overlap between experiments of ~30% (indicating the variability of results with this method). Interestingly, ciDKO podocytes showed downregulation of proteins involved in spliceosome function and RNA processing, as suggested by LC/MS and confirmed by Western blot.</p>
<p>Pladienolide (a spliceosome inhibitor) was cytotoxic to HeLa cells and to mouse podocytes but no toxicity was seen in murine glomerular endothelial cells.</p>

<p>Specific comments.</p>
<p>(1) Data are presented as mean/SEM. In general, mean/SD or median/IQR are preferred to allow the reader to evaluate the spread of the data. There may be exceptions where only SEM is reasonable.</p>

<p>Graphs can be changed to SD rather than SEM.</p>

<p>(2) It would be useful to for the reader to be told the number of over-lapping genes (with similar expression between mouse groups) and the results of a statistical test comparing WT and KO mice. The overlap of intron retention events between experimental repeats was about 30% in both knock-out podocytes. This seems low and I am curious to know whether this is typical for typical for this method; a reference could be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an excellent question. We had 30% overlap as the parameters used for analysis were very stringent. We suspect we could get more than 30% by being less stringent, which still be considered as similar events if requested. Our methods were based on FLAIR analysis (PMID: 32188845)</p>

<p>These investigators have previously shown important roles for either insulin receptor (IR) or insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) in glomerular podocyte function. They now have studied mice with deletion of both receptors and find significant podocyte dysfunction. They then made a podocyte cell line with inducible deletion of both receptors and find abnormalities in transcriptional efficiency with decreased expression of spliceosome proteins and increased transcripts with impaired splicing or premature termination.</p>
<p>The studies appear to be performed well and the manuscript is clearly written.</p>

<p><bold>Significance</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p>
<p>With the GLP1 agonists providing renal protection, there is great interest in understanding the role of insulin and other incretins in kidney cell biology. It is already known that Insulin and IGFR signaling play important roles in other cells of the kidney. So, there is great interest in understanding these pathways in podocytes. The major advance is that these two pathways appear to have a role in RNA metabolism, the major limitations are the lack of information regarding the completeness of the KO's. If, for example, they can determine that in the mice, the KO is complete, that the GFR is relatively normal, then the phenotype they describe is relatively mild.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. The receptor  KO in the mice is unlikely to be complete (Please see comments above and Supplementary Figure 1b). There are many examples of KO models targeting other tissues showing that complete KO of these receptors seems difficult to achieve , particularly in reference to the IGF1 receptor. In the brain (which is also terminally differentiated cells PMID:28595357 (barely 50% iof IGF1R knockdown was achieved in the target cells). Ovarian granulosa cells PMID:28407051 -several tissue specific drivers tried but couldn't achieve any better than 80%. The paper states that 10% of IGF1R is sufficient for function in these cells so they conclude that their knockdown animals are probably still responding to IGF1. Finally, in our recent IGF1R podocyte knockdown model we found Cre levels were important for excision of a single floxed gene (PMID: 38706850) hence we were not surprised that trying to excise two floxed genes (insulin receptor and IGF1 receptor) was challenging. This is the rationale for making the double receptor knockout cell lines to understand process / biology in more detail.</p>

<p>There are a number of potential issues and questions with these studies.</p>
<p>(1) For the in vivo studies, the only information given is for mice at 24 weeks of age. There needs to be a full time course of when the albuminuria was first seen and the rate of development. Also, GFR was not measured. Since the podocin-Cre utilized was not inducible, there should be a determination of whether there was a developmental defect in glomeruli or podocytes. Were there any differences in wither prenatal post natal development or number of glomeruli?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you we will add in further phenotyping data. We do not think there was a major developmental phenotype as  albuminuria did not become significantly different until several months of age. We could have used a doxycycline inducible model but we know the excision efficiency is much less than the podocin-cre driven model SUPP FIGURE 1. This would likely give a very mild (if any) phenotype and not reveal the biology adequately.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Although the in vitro studies are of interest, there are no studies to determine if this is the underlying mechanism for the in vivo abnormalities seen in the mice. Cultured podocytes may not necessarily reflect what is occurring in podocytes in vivo.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this we are happy to employ Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) using spliceosome antibodies on tissue sections from DKO and control mice to examine spliceosome changes. However, as the DKO results in podocyte loss, there may not be that many DKO podocytes still present in the tissue sections. This will be taken into consideration.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Given that both receptors are deleted in the podocyte cell line, it is not clear if the spliceosome defect requires deletion of both receptors or if there is redundancy in the effect. The studies need to be repeated in podocyte cell lines with either IR or IGFR single deletions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. We have full total and phospho-proteomic data sets from single insulin receptor and IGF1 receptor knockout cell lines that we will investigate for this point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) There are not studies investigating signaling mechanisms mediating the spliceosome abnormalities.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you as outlined as above to reviewer 1 point 1 we are very happy to investigate insulin / IGF signalling pathways in more detail.</p>
