<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients, alveolar epithelium architectures are persistently lost and lung gas transfer function would decline over time, which cannot be rescued by conventional anti-fibrotic therapy. P63+ airway basal progenitor cells are previously reported to have great potential to repair damaged lung epithelium. Here, we successfully cloned and expanded the autologous P63+ progenitor cells from IPF patients to manufacture the cell therapeutic product REGEND001, which were further characterized by cell morphology and single-cell transcriptomic analysis. Subsequently, an open-label, dose-escalation autologous progenitor cell transplantation clinical trial (CTR20210349) was conducted. The primary outcome was the incidence and severity of the cell therapy-related adverse events (AEs); secondary outcome included other safety and efficacy evaluation in each dose groups. We treated 12 patients with ascending doses of cells: 0.6x, 1x, 2x and 3.3× 10<sup>6</sup> cells/kg bodyweight. The data revealed that P63+ basal progenitor cell was safe and well tolerated at all doses, with no dose-limiting toxicity or cell therapy-related severe adverse events observed. Patients in the three higher dose groups showed statistically significant improvement of lung gas transfer function as well as exercise ability after REGEND001 therapy. Resolution of honeycomb lesion was also observed in patients of higher dose groups. Altogether these results indicated that REGEND001 has high safety profile and meanwhile encourages further efficacy exploration in IPF patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal disease of unknown etiology, characterized by irreversible alveolar damage and lung tissue fibrosis. The progression of IPF would lead to persistent decline of lung function, attenuated exercise ability, impaired quality of life and eventually death within 3∼5 years after disease onset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Currently there is no cure for IPF, and the clinically applied treatments, such as self-care measures, anti-fibrotic medication, and pulmonary rehabilitation, can only help relieve the symptoms and/or slow down the progression of IPF. Among them, the first-line anti-fibrotic drugs Nintedanib and Pirfenidone could only reduce the rate of decline in lung function (primarily lung forced vital capacity) rather than halt or reverse the disease progression. Furthermore, patients with IPF may discontinue Nintedanib and Pirfenidone due to adverse events such as nausea and diarrhea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. More importantly, none of these conventional medications could repair or regenerate the injured lung tissues in IPF patients. Therefore, multiple pluripotent stem cell or adult stem/progenitor cell-based regenerative strategies are being widely studied at the pre-clinical or clinical level for IPF treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Following lung injury, a number of tissue-specific stem cells, including airway basal progenitor cells, secretory progenitor cells and type 2 alveolar stem cells, are responsible for lung epithelial repair and regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Among these cell populations, airway basal progenitor cells marked by the expression of TP63 (P63), keratin 5 (KRT5) have been widely studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. These P63+ progenitor cells located in the airway basal layer are known to be capable of differentiating into secretory, goblet and ciliated cells and reconstituting the airway epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In the recent decade, it has been discovered that these P63+ progenitor cells in airway can be activated by multiple types of major alveolar injuries (eg. IPF, influenza infection, COVID-19), and then migrate from airway to the damaged loci in the alveolar compartment, where they play complex roles in the pathogenesis process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. It is proposed that the normal P63+ progenitor cells in the alveolar area are able to expand and rapidly form epithelial barriers to “band-aid” the injured lung tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. When stimulated by proper microenvironment signals, the P63+ progenitor cells could also differentiate towards alveolar epithelium lineages to facilitate lung repair and regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, in the context of IPF, it has been confirmed that there are some dysplastic P63+ progenitor cells distributed near the fibrotic foci, which might be pro-fibrotic with potential to exacerbate the IPF disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Therefore, in IPF patients, the function of normal or dysplastic P63+ progenitor cells still need to be investigated in details especially in clinical trials.</p>
<p>Previously our group had evaluated the therapeutic potential of mouse/human P63+ progenitor cell transplantation in a bleomycin-injured pulmonary fibrosis murine model. The transplanted mouse/human P63+ progenitor cells were able to engraft into the injured mouse lung tissue, re-establish the epithelial barrier, reconstitute vascularized air sac, and improve the blood oxygen levels of the mice. Transplantation of P63+ progenitor cells could also attenuate collagen deposition and myofibroblast cell proliferation in lung and eventually reduce mouse mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Pre-clinical safety evaluations were also performed on both mice and monkeys following Good Laboratory Practice guidelines, showing that intrapulmonary transplantation of P63+ progenitor cells is very safe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In a pilot clinical study conducted in 2016, two patients with severe non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis were treated with autologous P63+ progenitor cell transplantation. Pulmonary functions of both patients recovered remarkably, with none aberrant cell growth or other related adverse events (AEs) during the whole follow-up time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In a very recent report of a controlled phase 1 clinical trial, autologous P63+ progenitor cell transplantation was performed to treat 17 patients with chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD). These data indicated that the cell treatment could significantly improve the gas transfer function (DLCO) of the COPD lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Altogether these previous pre-clinical and clinical evidences encourage us to further test the cell therapy in the pulmonary fibrosis disease at clinical stage.</p>
<p>Here, we report the first clinical trial treating IPF patients with autologous P63+ lung progenitor cell product (REGEND001) transplantation. The progenitor cells were isolated from a trace amount of healthy airway epithelium sample obtained via bronchoscopic brushing. After 3-5 weeks of cell expansion, up to 100 million P63+ lung progenitor cells were produced and transplanted into the lungs of IPF patients via bronchoscopy. The safety and potential efficacy of this novel cell therapy for treating IPF were addressed in this clinical trial.</p>

<title>Enrollment of patients</title>
<p>We conducted an open-label, dose-escalation phase 1 clinical trial (CTR20210349) from July, 2021 to June, 2023, to study the safety and efficacy of autologous P63+ lung progenitor cell transplantation in patients with IPF. <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary table 1</xref> showed detailed patient inclusion and exclusion information. Totally 12 patients were enrolled in the trial and assigned to one of four dose groups sequentially: 0.6 million cells/kg bodyweight (0.6 M), 1 million cells/kg bodyweight (1 M), 2 million cells/kg bodyweight (2 M) and 3.3 million cells/kg bodyweight (3.3 M) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). After the 3rd patient of the 3.3 M group was recruited, enrollment of patients was terminated. Baseline demographic data (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) showed that the trial participants in all groups were generally matched. Of note, 75% participants used anti-fibrotic drug pirfenidone as concomitant medication in this trial. None of them used Nintedanib as concomitant medication.</p>

<title>Clone P63+ progenitor cells from normal lung area of IPF patients</title>
<p>First, a small tissue sample is collected via bronchoscopy from grade 3-5 bronchi of upper lung lobes in patients with IPF. P63+ progenitor cells are selectively expanded through a pharmaceutical-grade cell cloning culture system. 50 μg/mL gentamicin sulfate is applied at the initial passage but not in the subsequent 2-5 passages to prevent microbial contamination. Each batch of cell products were confirmed to be free of bacterial contamination, or endotoxin, BSA, and antibiotic residues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In IPF patients, the fibrotic foci are mainly distributed in lower or middle lobes. We selected relatively healthy lung upper lobes to collect tissue samples, which allowed us to collect the normal autologous P63+ progenitor cells instead of those pro-fibrotic cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Expression of representative progenitor cell markers KRT5 and P63 was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometric analysis demonstrating KRT5+ cell purity &gt; 95% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>). For each batch of cell product, no tumorigenic potential was confirmed in the soft agar colony formation assay (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>).</p>

<p>We noticed that the cell cloned from different individual patients exhibited diverse morphology: some clones were regularly round while others exhibited irregular shape (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). To further analyze the individual variances in P63+ progenitors isolated from the 12 IPF patients, we conducted cell morphological analysis on P4 passages of all subjects and correlated them with patient age and lung function. The data revealed significant negative correlation between the age of patients and P63+ progenitor cell clone roundness, which might be related to previous findings that aging can negatively impact cell properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed a positive correlation between P63+ progenitor cell clone roundness and the pulmonary function indexes DLCO, FVC, and FEV1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>To gain molecular insights into the identity composition of the cells selectively grown in the culture system, we performed single-cell sequencing on the cells. Unsupervised clustering of the cells uncovered 3 distinct subpopulations:C1, C2 and C3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The C1 population was characterized by lung progenitor classic markers KRT5 and P63 and accounts for more than half of all cells (65.03%) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that C1 cells demonstrated high expression of genes involved in Wnt Signaling pathway and negative regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining the identity of stem cells and the development of the lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Notably, we found C1 cells also have the function of positive regulation of angiogenesis and negative regulation of fibroblast proliferation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The C2 populations accounts for 23.40% of the total number of cells. It also expressed KRT5, P63, and meanwhile expresses the proliferation-related marker KI67 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). C2 was mainly enriched in mitosis-related genes, which is consistent with its identity as a proliferative state (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>C3 cells accounts for 11.57% of the total number of cells, which showed very low level of KRT5 or P63 expression, but expressed high level of alveolar epithelial cell types 1 (AEC1) gene HOPX. Of note, the C3 cells also expressed a set of genes known as markers for variant progenitor cells, including CXCL17, CEACAM6, IL1RN and CLDN4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Further gene ontology analysis identified differentially expressed genes in C3 cells were enriched in epithelial cell development and differentiation and wound healing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). In order to know whether these C3 cells represents the previously reported pro-fibrotic abnormal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, we compared their transcriptomic profile with the basal cells isolated from the injured area of IPF lungs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The data showed that in comparison to the C3 cells isolated from healthy area, the basal cells isolated from injured area were significantly enriched with genes related to DNA damage, senescence, apoptosis, as well as genes related to the differentiation of mesenchymal cells and fibroblasts (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>). Therefore, the C3 cells are different from those pro-fibrotic basal cells. Altogether these data indicated that the current cell isolation and expansion system could efficiently enrich normal P63+ lung progenitor cells from IPF patients.</p>
<p>At final passage, P63+ progenitor cells were cultured under feeder-free conditions until reaching 85-100% confluence (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref>). After harvesting P63+ progenitor cells using xeno-free TrypLE, cells were suspended in 14 mL of preservation reagent. The final product was sealed in cell preservation bags and shipped fresh to three clinical research centers via cold chain transportation (2-8°C) within 48 hours. Just before transplantation, cell suspension was warmed to room temperature, further diluted in saline, and then transplanted into bronchial segments of the middle and lower lobes by bronchoscope for 3 mL per segment. After the transplant surgery, the patients were asked to assume a supine position and breathe deeply for two hours to promote the adhesion of the transplanted P63+ progenitor cells to the injured lung area.</p>

<title>Safety analysis of REGEND001</title>
<p>Patients were followed up at baseline, 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks post REGEND001 treatment for safety evaluation. Until 24 weeks after transplantation, totally 62 cases of grade I-III adverse events (AEs), but no grade IV and grade V AEs, were recorded (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The most common AE is COVID-19. COVID-19 were recorded in all 6 patients in 2 M and 3.3 M dose groups, which were not related to cell therapy but due to the outbreak of pandemic in China from December 2022 to March 2023. 22.6% (14/62) AEs were considered related to the cell therapy. Fever is one of the mostly common cell therapy-related AEs (21.4%, 1 grade II, 2 grade I), which all happened within 24 hours after REGEND001 treatment and recovered 4-9 hours afterwards. Bloody sputum is another common cell therapy-related AEs (21.4%, all grade I), which all happened within 24 hours after REGEND001 treatment and recovered within 1-3 days. The reason for bloody sputum was considered to be related to the bronchoscopic surgery but not the cell product. The grade III AEs include 2 severe COVID-19 and 2 acute bronchitis. The 2 acute bronchitis happened in two patients in 2 months and 4 months post cell transplantation respectively, and both recovered after standard treatment. Considering the medical history of the two patients, we think the acute bronchitis were not related to the cell treatment.</p>

<p>The results of blood routine and blood biochemistry in all patients were plotted in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>. Overall, majority of these measures were maintained within the normal reference ranges. For the abnormal readings, most of them were clinically meaningless. The most common clinically meaningful abnormality is increasement of blood glucose level in 5 patients with diabetes. In addition, mild increase of eosinophil level was observed in 1M group. By consecutive high-resolution CT (HRCT) scanning of the chest, we did not find any signs of malignancy or new pathologies in any patient. Consistently, no clinically meaningful change of 4 tumor markers in blood sample was observed (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>). 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) and urine routine results were also normal after cell treatment.

<title>Change of lung functions after REGEND001 treatment</title>
<p>One key efficacy outcome of the current study is the change in gas transfer function after cell therapy. Lung gas transfer function is determined by effective alveolar capillary surface area, which could be quantitatively measured by diffusion capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and alveolar volume-corrected DLCO (DLCO/VA). In patients with IPF, progression of pulmonary fibrosis is the primary cause of decline in gas transfer function, which is a consistent and strong predictor of mortality in patients with various fibrotic lung diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. In current trial, we found that the 7 patients in the higher dose groups (1.0∼3.3 M) showed statistically significant increase of DLCO/VA level trend from averagely 72.06% (baseline) to 84.10% (24 weeks) of predicted value (p value=0.008). Of note, the overall change of DLCO/VA in the higher dose group was statistically significant from that in the lower dose group (p value=0.019), indicating a dose-dependent therapeutic effect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and S6). The results were similar when analyzing the DLCO/VA absolute value, DLCO absolute value as well as DLCO percentage (%) to its predicted values (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and S6). Interestingly, based on previous morphological studies, this may have suggested that variations in cell roundness were not significantly associated with changes in DLCO and DLCO/VA following treatment. Altogether, above data indicated that REGEND001 treatment had potential to improve lung gas transfer function when applied at higher dose. Moreover, we also noticed that the concomitant COVID-19 events happened in 2 M and 3.3 M group post cell treatment, which might compromise some the potential benefit from REGEND001 treatment (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>).</p>

<p>We also analyzed the change of forced vital capacity (FVC) after REGEND001 treatment. FVC represents the airflow aspect of lung function, and its decline is the indicator of the progression of IPF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Unlike DLCO, in the higher dose groups, we only observed minimal improvement of FVC% from averagely 76.91 % (baseline) to 77.01 % (24 weeks). The overall change of FVC in the higher dose group was statistically significant from that in the lower dose group (P=0.028) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and S6). In the higher dose groups, 3 of 7 patients demonstrated &gt; 2% positive change of FVC% after REGEND001 treatment, which reached the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for FVC% change in IPF patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Altogether, these data suggested that REGEND001 treatment might have potential to stabilize or slightly improve FVC when given at a high dose.</p>

<title>Change of exercise ability, quality of life and lung CT image</title>
<p>We also analyzed the 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) of patients, which is a widely used measure to assess functional exercise ability. In consistent with their improvement of lung functions, patients in higher dose groups demonstrated statistically significant improvement of 6MWD from averagely 424 m at baseline to 482 m at 24 weeks (p value=0.008) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and S6). The 58 m increase of 6MWD is considered clinically quite meaningful<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. We also evaluated the patients’ quality of life by St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), which was originally developed and validated in obstructive airway disease and has acceptable validity and reliability in IPF patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Its scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more limitations in the overall health of patient, daily life, and perceived well-being. Similar to the 6MWD result, patients in higher dose groups demonstrated decrease of SGRQ numerically from mean 32.3 at baseline to 25.8 at 24 weeks (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>). The 6 points change of SGRQ score were considered clinically quite meaningful<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Altogether, these findings suggest that REGEND001 treatment, especially at higher dose groups, could help to improve the exercise ability and quality of life in IPF patients.</p>
<p>We also used HRCT scan to evaluate changes in the lung morphology of patients. In IPF lung, honeycombing cyst was a characteristic structure, which was developed after collapse of fibrotic alveolar wall and dilatation of terminal airways. The honeycombing pattern in CT imaging is considered permanent and independently associated with the disease prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. In current study, three experts independently evaluated the lung CT images at baseline and 24 weeks after REGEND001 treatment in blinded manner. The results indicated that at baseline, all recruited IPF patients shows predominantly peripheral and lower lobe bilateral reticulation and honeycombing pattern. At 24 weeks, as most patients showed no obvious change of lung CT images post cell therapy, the Patient #005 and #006 in 1 M group demonstrated resolution of honeycombing lesion in their lower lungs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We also performed three-dimensional (3D) computational visualization of reticulation and honeycombing in #006 CT images. Interestingly, the 3D data showed that the improvement of lung lesion was exclusively observed in the lower lobes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). One explanation could be that the cell suspension delivered through the bronchoscope tend to flow into the lower lobes due to gravity, which would result in cell concentration in lower lobes. Similar effect was also observed in the repair of mild emphysematous lesion in COPD patients in our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. In consistency with the improvement of CT images in #005 and #006, these two patients demonstrated improvement of DLCO, FVC and 6MWD as well (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>). Interestingly, based on the data in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, the cell cloned from #005 and #006 had vastly diverse roundness, suggesting that high clone roundness morphology might not be required for therapeutic efficacy. Altogether the above data suggested that REGEND001 treatment have potential to repair the pulmonary fibrotic structure at least in some patients in 1 M group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The destruction of alveolar tissues in the lungs of IPF patients is currently irreversible. Thus, there is an urgent need for treatment options that support lung repair and/or regeneration. Previous studies have demonstrated that human P63+ lung progenitor cells can be easily isolated, expanded, and transplanted for lung regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. In the current study, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized the cells cloned from healthy upper lobe of IPF patient. Interestingly, apart from the KRT5+/P63+ basal progenitor cells, we also identified a subpopulation of “variant progenitor cells” in IPF patients. Similar variant cells have been found in healthy donors in low numbers as well as in the injured lobes of IPF patients with high abundance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Interestingly, our cells cloned from healthy lobe have a low abundance of variant cells exactly like those cloned from healthy donors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Moreover, unlike the previously reported profibrotic subpopulation in IPF patients, our variant progenitor cells exhibited a higher expression level of the HOPX gene, which is known to be expressed in normal type I alveolar cells, while exhibited lower expression of fibrosis-related genes. These data suggest that we can clone relatively normal, but not pro-fibrotic, progenitor cells from the healthy lobes of IPF patients, which can be used to manufacture a qualified cell therapeutic product.</p>
<p>Some previous studies also proposed that those abnormal, dysplastic P63+ progenitor cells located in the injured lung area of IPF patients could halt the repair process, participate in “honeycomb” structure formation and be deleterious for the lung function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. These findings raised “red flag” for the safe transplantation of P63+ progenitor cells in IPF patients. To address the safety issue of autologous P63+ progenitor cells, we conducted the current dose-escalation phase 1 clinical trial. Our data indicated minimal safety issues, with all events related to cell administration being mild and transient. Considering our previous pre-clinical animal data altogether<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, we now know that at least the P63+ progenitor cells isolated from the healthy lobes of IPF patients are safe for intrapulmonary transplantation.</p>
<p>Although the trial was primarily focused on safety and not designed to assess efficacy, the data obtained also suggested meaningful improvements in lung gas transfer function DLCO, which is known to be closely related to the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. DLCO is considered to be a consistent and powerful predictor of mortality in patients with various fibrotic lung diseases including IPF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Low DLCO level are strongly associated with diminished survival rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. A drop of more than 15% in DLCO was associated with a three-fold increased risk of death compared to a drop of less than 15% in IPF patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Additionally, DLCO also has a predictive effect on the exercise ability of IPF patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Earlier studies indicated that conventional anti-fibrotic drugs could not achieve improvements in DLCO in IPF patients. In a clinical trial of conventional IPF treatment, Durheim et al. analyzed data from 436 IPF patients after initiating antifibrotic therapy and reported an annual change rate of predicted DLCO% of −2.9%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Similarly, when Zulkova et al. evaluated the effect of pirfenidone on lung function decline and survival based on 383 patients with IPF, they found that the predicted mean change in DLCO% at week 24 was −1.6%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. In contrast, our study demonstrated a +12.0% increase in DLCO/VA% and a +5.4% increase in DLCO% from baseline at 24 weeks in higher dose groups. Although there were data from only 7 patients in the higher dose groups, it still implies a potential advantage over conventional therapy, showing a statistically significant difference from patients in the lower dose group.</p>
<p>The current study has several limitations that need to be addressed in future research. Firstly, the sample size of the study was very small. Secondly, the absence of a placebo-controlled arm makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of the treatment. Thirdly, the progenitor cells cloned from individual patients had their own morphological properties as well as genetic and epigenetic background, which might lead to distinct response to therapy in different individuals. Fourthly, the data collection and analysis of the 2 M and 3.3 M patient groups were interfered by the concomitant COVID-19 events and city lockdown policy. To overcome some of these limitations, a randomized, placebo-controlled, blind, multi-center phase 2 study with a larger sample size is currently being performed in China (Clinical Trial No. NCT06081621). Hopefully, the phase 2 trial might address the limitations of the current study and provide more reliable evidence for the efficacy of the treatment.</p>

Sequencing libraries were loaded on an Illumina NovaSeq with 2 × 150 paired-end kits at Novogene, China. Raw sequencing reads were processed using the Cell Ranger v.3.1.0 pipeline from 10× Genomics. In brief, reads were demultiplexed, aligned to the human GRCh38 genome, and UMI counts were quantified per gene per cell to generate a gene-barcode matrix. Post-processing, including filtering by number of genes and mitochondrial gene content expressed per cell, was performed using the Seurat v.4.3.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Genes were filtered out that were detected in less than three cells. A global-scaling normalization method ‘LogNormalize’ was used to normalize the data by a scale factor (10000). Next, a subset of highly variable genes was calculated for downstream analysis and a linear transformation (ScaleData) was applied as a pre-processing step. Principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction was performed with the highly variable genes as input in Seurat function RunPCA. The top 30 significant PCs were selected for two-dimensional Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), implemented by the Seurat software with the default parameters. FindCluster in Seurat was used to identify cell clusters. Marker genes were identified through differential expression analysis utilizing the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat. Genes showing differential expression, observed in at least 25% of cells within the cluster, and exhibiting a fold change greater than 0.25 on a logarithmic scale, were classified as marker genes. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes were implemented by the ClusterProfiler R package. GO terms with P-value &lt; 0.05 were considered significantly enriched.

<title>Interventions</title>
<p>To sample autologous airway tissue, the bronchoscopy was performed by a team of certified physicians using a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope. Before the bronchoscopy, 2% lidocaine spray anesthesia or general anesthesia was used. Peking Union Medical College Hospital and Shanghai Ruijin Hospital used spray anesthesia, while The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University used general anesthesia. The total dosage of lidocaine was limited to 8.2 mg/kg bodyweight. During bronchoscopy, the patient is usually placed in a supine position. To qualify for tissue sampling, the surface of the airway should be smooth with normal color under bronchoscopy, with no new growths, ulcers, or bleeding points. Afterwards, a small amount of tissue sample was collected from the 3-5th level bronchi of IPF patients by sliding the brushes tenderly. Brushed samples were then shipped from hospital to cell factory through cold-chain transport (2-8℃) within 48 hours. In the cell factory, single-cell suspension was prepared by washing and enzymatically digestion, which were then cultured under a regenerative cell cloning (R-Clone) system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The final product passed a series of rigorous tests, including identity, purity, sterility, residual endotoxin, viral contamination, residual BSA and residual antibiotics, etc., were qualified for this clinical trial. The qualified autologous P63+ lung progenitor cells product would be suspended in 14 mL saline, sealed in a cell preservation bag and shipped freshly to the hospital through cold-chain transport (2-8℃) within 48 hours.</p>
<p>To prepare for autologous P63+ lung progenitor cells transplantation, the cell suspension was re-suspended in 28 mL saline and then averagely injected into bronchial segments in middle and lower lobes (3 mL each) through the fiberoptic bronchoscope. All patients maintained a supine position for 2 hours, avoided drinking and minimized coughing for 3 hours post administration. When necessary, oral codeine was given.</p>
<p>In principle, all patients continued to use medications they had taken before participating this clinical trial, except Nintedanib. Nintedanib was excluded from the allowed medication list because as tyrosine kinase inhibitor, it is worried to have growth inhibition effect on the transplanted progenitor cells. Compatible concomitant IPF medications include Pirfenidone, Omeprazole, N-Acetyl Cysteine, Methylprednisolone, and Prednisone.

<caption><title>Profile of current clinical trial.</title>
<p>In total 12 patients were recruited for the trial and assigned to 4 dose groups. All patients in the 2 M and 3.3 M groups were infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the follow-up period. Two patients (#007 and #008) in the 2 M group were excluded from the efficacy analysis because they missed the 24-week visit due to the lockdown policy during COVID-19 pandemic. The remaining 10 patients were subjected to both safety and efficacy analysis</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study describes a first-in-human trial of autologous p63+ stem cells in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a lethal condition for which effective treatments are lacking. The authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that P63+ progenitor cell therapy can be safely delivered in patients with ILD, warranting movement to a Phase 2. However, given that this is a Phase 1 study with a small sample size, conclusions regarding efficacy should not yet be made.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>IPF is a disease lacking regressive therapies which has a poor prognosis, and so new therapies are needed. This ambitious phase 1 study builds on the authors 2024 experience in Sci Tran Med with positive results with autologous transplantation of P63 progenitor cells in patients with COPD. The current study suggests P63+ progenitor cell therapy is safe in patients with ILD. The authors attribute this to acquisition of cells from a healthy upper lobe site, removed from the lung fibrosis. There are currently no cell based therapies for ILD and in this regard the study is novel with important potential for clinical impact if validated in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study addresses the need for an effective therapy for interstitial lung disease. It offers good evidence the cell used for therapy are safe. In so doing it addresses a concern that some P63+ progenitor cells may be proinflammatory and harmful, as has been raised in the literature (articles which suggested some P63+ cells can promote honeycombing fibrosis; ref 26 &amp;35). The authors attribute the safety they observed (without proof) to the high HOPX expression of administered cells (a marker found in normal Type 1 AECs. The totality of the RNASeq suggests the cloned cells are not fibrogenic. They also offer exploratory data suggesting a relationship between clone roundness and PFT parameters (and a negative association of patient age and clone roundness).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors can conclude they can isolate, clone, expand and administer P63+ progenitor cells safely; but with the small sample size and lack of placebo group no efficacy should be implied.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The paper is meritorious as I noted initially</p>
<p>However, the authors did not directly address several of my concerns-i.e. their responses to the initial review were polite but did not translate into much change in the manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) Do these progenitor cells exert their beneficial effects by a paracrine mechanism vs transforming into lung AECs? Based on work in the field of bronchopulmonary dysplasia I suspect the benefits are mediated by a paracrine mecahnism and arguably media from these cells should be tested as an alternative to administering the cells themselves. In any case, for the revision a Discussion of the possibility of differentiation vs paracrine mechanisms, citing relevant literature, would be expected. I suggest that you add such a paragraph to a limitation section.</p>
<p>(2) Please address that potential implications of the fact that 5 patients had essentially normal DLCO/VA values. Saying that the &quot;criterion for entry was DLCO&quot; does not take away from the fact that DLCO/VA is a valid measure of lung diffusion capacity. In the absence of placebo an enrollment of mildly diseased patients would favor positive results (including stability in study endpoint parameters even without treatment). Thus, I suggest again that the limitations section should be more forthright in this regard.</p>
<p>(3) The authors acknowledge the lack of a placebo group but in a study of mild IPF, I worry that without a placebo group the only robust findings are those related to technique of transplantation and the safety of cell therapy. The paper still reads as if there is a clinical benefit...I would advise you further soften this (while understanding the desire to emphasize a hopeful observation). The price for not having a placebo group must be avoidance of claims of efficacy. The improvements in DLCO and CT in several cases speaks for the need for the planned phase 2 trial, which if positive will be the time to claim efficacy signals.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>IPF is a disease lacking regressive therapies which has a poor prognosis, and so new therapies are needed. This ambitious phase 1 study builds on the authors' 2024 experience in Sci Tran Med with positive results with autologous transplantation of P63 progenitor cells in patients with COPD. The current study suggests that P63+ progenitor cell therapy is safe in patients with ILD. The authors attribute this to the acquisition of cells from a healthy upper lobe site, removed from the lung fibrosis. There are currently no cell-based therapies for ILD and in this regard the study is novel with important potential for clinical impact if validated in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study addresses the need for an effective therapy for interstitial lung disease. It offers good evidence that the cells used for therapy are safe. In so doing it addresses a concern that some P63+ progenitor cells may be proinflammatory and harmful, as has been raised in the literature (articles which suggested some P63+ cells can promote honeycombing fibrosis; references 26 &amp;35). The authors attribute the safety they observed (without proof) to the high HOPX expression of administered cells (a marker found in normal Type 1 AECs. The totality of the RNASeq suggests the cloned cells are not fibrogenic. They also offer exploratory data suggesting a relationship between clone roundness and PFT parameters (and a negative association between patient age and clone roundness).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the important comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors can conclude they can isolate, clone, expand, and administer P63+ progenitor cells safely; but with the small sample size and lack of a placebo group, no efficacy should be implied.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and agree that we should be more cautious to discuss the efficacy of current study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Specific points:</p>
<p>(1) The authors acknowledge most study weaknesses including the lack of a placebo group and the concurrent COVID-19 in half the subjects (the high-dose subjects). They indicate a phase 2 trial is underway to address these issues.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>N/A</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors suggest an efficacy signal on pages 18 (improvement in 2 subjects' CT scans) and 21 (improvement in DLCO) but with such a small phase 1 study and such small increases in DLCO (+5.4%) the authors should refrain from this temptation (understandable as it is).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that exploring potential efficacy signal is also one aim of this study. All these efficacy endpoint analyses had been planned in prior to the start of clinical trials (as registered in ClinicalTrial.gov) and the data need be analyzed anyhow.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Likewise most CT scans were unchanged and those that improved were in the mid-dose group (albeit DLCO improved in the 2 patients whose CT scans improved).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors note an impressive 58m increase in 6MWTD in the high-dose group but again there is no placebo group, and the low-dose group has no net change in 6MWTD at 24 weeks.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) I also raise the question of the enrollment criteria in which 5 patients had essentially normal DLCO/VA values. In addition there is no discussion as to whether the transplanted stem cells are retained or exert benefit by a paracrine mechanism (which is the norm for cell-based therapies).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your detailed feedback.  The enrollment criteria are based on DLCO instead of DLCO/VA. And we would like to further discuss the possible benefit by paracrine mechanism in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p>(1) Four of the enrolled subjects had normal DLCO/VA (% of predicted) (&gt;90% of predicted). This raises questions about the severity of their illness see: Table 1: Subjects 103, 105, 112, and 204 have DLCO/VA % predicted &gt;90% of predicted and would appear not to qualify for the study. While technically enrollment criteria for DLCO are satisfied, DLCO/VA is an equally valid measure of ILD severity, and these 4 cases seem very mild.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your detailed feedback. Yes, the current inclusion criteria is based on DLCO but not DLCO/VA.  And we believe improvement of DLCO and DLCO/VA is both meaningful. In future trial, we will consider DLCO/VA as inclusion criteria as well.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors state &quot;Resolution of honeycomb lesion was also observed in patients of higher dose groups&quot;. This appears inaccurate as only 2 subjects in the study showed CT improvement and they were not in the highest dose group. This statement is an overreach for a Phase 1 study and should be removed from the abstract and more balance inserted in the text. The phase 2 study they are doing will answer these questions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. We changed our statement about efficacy in the abstract part.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>a) Under exclusion criteria: More detail is required as to what defines &quot;subjects who cannot tolerate cell therapy&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Those patients cannot tolerate previous cell therapy, for example mesenchymal stem cell transplantation, would not be included in the current trial.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b) Figure S6 is important and should be in the main manuscript. This Figure shows that many (6) subjects had COVID at some trial measurement time points. This is an unfortunate confounder for efficacy signals (but efficacy is not the point of this study). Second, Figure 6 (in my view) shows little efficacy signal, which is a reminder to the authors that efficacy should not be implied in a study that was not powered to detect efficacy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agreed that the efficacy should be discussed very carefully.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure S3: It appears at some does there is a significant rise in monocytes (1M cells) and neutrophils (3 M cells).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your reasonable concerns regarding the safety of the treatment. The monocyte counts in the S3 patients, even after an increase, remains within the reference range, and therefore we consider this elevation to be clinically meaningless. One patient exhibited a significant increase in neutrophils at 24 weeks, which was attributed to a grade II adverse event, acute bronchitis, which was unrelated to cell therapy. The symptoms resolved within three days following treatment with appropriate medication.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 3: I wonder about the statistical significance of the 6MWD. Was this done by repeat measure ANOVA? The analysis suggests a p=0.08 but all error bars between low and high dose overlap and the biggest difference is at 24 weeks, and that appears to be labelled as not significant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your kind reminding. The 6MWD result with a p-value of 0.008 was derived to compare the improvement in 6MWD at the 24-week time point versus baseline within the higher group. Therefore, a paired t-test was used for this analysis. In the revised version, we label them more clearly.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes a first-in-human clinical trial of autologous stem cells to address IPF. The significance of this study is underscored by the limited efficacy of standard-of-care anti-fibrotic therapies and increasing knowledge of the role p63+ stem cells in lung regeneration in ARDS. While models of acute lung injury and p63+ stem cells have benefited from widespread and dynamic DAD and immune cell remodeling of damaged tissue, a key question in chronic lung disease is whether such cells could contribute to the remodeling of lung tissue that may be devoid of acute and dynamic injury. A second question is whether normal regions of the lung in an otherwise diseased organ can be identified as a source of &quot;normal&quot; p63+ stem cells, and how to assess these stem cells given recently identified p63+ stem cell variants emerging in chronic lung diseases including IPF. Lastly, questions of feasibility, safety, and efficacy need to be explored to set the foundation for autologous transplants to meet the huge need in chronic lung disease. The authors have addressed each of these questions to different extents in this initial study, which has yielded important if incomplete information for many of them.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>As with a previous study from this group regarding autologous stem cell transplants for COPD (Ref. 24), they have shown that the stem cells they propagate do not form colonies in soft agar or cancers in these patients. While a full assessment of adverse events was confounded by a wave of Covid19 infections in the study participants, aside from brief fevers it appears these transplants are tolerated by these patients.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the important comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The source of stem cells for these autologous transplants is generally bronchoscopic biopsies/brushings from 5th-generation bronchi. Although stem cells have been cloned and characterized from nasal, tracheal, and distal airway biopsies, the systematic cloning and analysis of p63+ stem cells across the bronchial generations is less clear. For instance, p63+ stem cells from the nasal and tracheal mucosa appear committed to upper airway epithelia marked by 90% ciliated cells and 10% goblet cells (Kumar et al., 2011. Ref. 14). In contrast, p63+ stem cells from distal lung differentiate to epithelia replete with Club, AT2, and AT1 markers. The spectrum of p63+ stem cells in the normal bronchi of any generation is less studied. In the present study, cells are obtained by bronchoscopy from 3-5 generation bronchi and expanded by in vitro propagation. Single-cell RNA-seq identifies three clusters they refer to as C1, C2, and C3, with the major C1 cluster said to have characteristics of airway basal cells and C2 possibly the same cells in states of proliferation. Perhaps the most immediate question raised by these data is the nature of the C1/C2 cells. Whereas they are clearly p63/Krt5+ cells as are other stem cells of the airways, do they display differentiation character of &quot;upper airway&quot; marked by ciliated/goblet cell differentiation or those of the lung marked by AT2 and AT1 fates? This could be readily determined by 3-D differentiation in so-called airliquid interface cultures pioneered by cystic fibrosis investigators and should be done as it would directly address the validity of the sourcing protocol for autologous cells for these transplants. This would more clearly link the present study with a previous study from the same investigators (Shi et al., 2019, Ref. 9) whereby distal airway stem cells mitigated fibrosis in the murine bleomycin model. The authors should also provide methods by which the autologous cells are propagated in vitro as these could impact the quality and fate of the progenitor cells prior to transplantation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We totally agree that the sub-population of the progenitor cells should be further analyzed. We would try this in the revised manuscript. And the methods to expand P63+ lung progenitor cells have been described in full details by Frank McKeon/Wa Xian group (Rao, et.al., STAR Protocols, 2020), which is adapted to pharmaceutical-grade technology patented by Regend Therapeutics, Ltd.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors should also make a more concerted effort to compare Clusters 1, 2, and 3 with the variant stem cell identified in IPF (Wang et al., 2023, Ref. 27). While some of the markers are consistent with this variant stem cell population, others are not. A more detailed informatics analysis of normal stem cells of the airways and any variants reported could clarify whether the bronchial source of autologous stem cells is the best route to these transplants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank for reviewer for the good suggestion and would like to make more detailed comparison in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Other than these issues the authors should be commended for these firstin-human trials for this important condition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you so much for the kind compliment.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p>Described in the review text but the authors need to be clear about how they propagated autologous stem cells in vitro.</p>
<p>(1) Perhaps the most immediate question raised by these data is the nature of the C1/C2 cells. Whereas they are clearly p63/Krt5+ cells as are other stem cells of the airways, do they display differentiation character of &quot;upper airway&quot; marked by ciliated/goblet cell differentiation or those of the lung marked by AT2 and AT1 fates?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The differentiation potential of the P63+/KRT5+ basal progenitor cells have been analyzed in multiple previous literatures, which are mentioned in the revised introduction part. Basically, the human P63+ progenitor cells can differentiate into airway epithelial cells in the airway area, while give rise to immature, but functional AT1 cells in alveolar area.</p>
