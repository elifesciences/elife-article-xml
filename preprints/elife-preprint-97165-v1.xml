<sec>
<title>Background &amp; Aims</title>
<p>The prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is increasing, urging more research into the underlying mechanisms. MicroRNA-26b (miR-26b) might play a role in several MASH-related pathways. Therefore, we aimed to determine the role of miR-26b in MASH and its therapeutic potential using miR-26b mimic-loaded lipid nanoparticles (LNPs).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p><italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>LysM<sup>cre</sup>Mir26b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, and respective controls were fed a western-type diet to induce MASH. Plasma and liver samples were characterized regarding lipid metabolism, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis. Additionally, miR-26b mimic-loaded LNPs were injected in <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice to rescue the phenotype and key results were validated in human precision-cut liver slices. Finally, kinase profiling was used to elucidate underlying mechanisms.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p><italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice showed increased hepatic lipid levels, coinciding with increased expression of scavenger receptor a and platelet glycoprotein 4. Similar effects were found in mice lacking myeloid-specific <italic>miR-26b</italic>. Additionally, hepatic TNF and IL-6 levels and amount of infiltrated macrophages were increased in <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Moreover, <italic>Tgfb</italic> expression was increased by the <italic>miR-26b</italic> deficiency, leading to more hepatic fibrosis. A murine treatment model with miR-26b mimic-loaded LNPs reduced hepatic lipids, rescuing the observed phenotype. Kinase profiling identified increased inflammatory signaling upon <italic>miR-26b</italic> deficiency, which was rescued by LNP treatment. Finally, miR-26b mimic-loaded LNPs also reduced inflammation in human precision-cut liver slices.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Overall, our study demonstrates that the detrimental effects of <italic>miR-26b</italic> deficiency in MASH can be rescued by LNP treatment. This novel discovery leads to more insight into MASH development, opening doors to potential new treatment options using LNP technology.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>‘Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease’ (MASLD), formerly known as non-alcohol fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], is the most common form of fatty liver disease. It accounts for roughly 25% of liver-disease cases globally and is defined by fat accumulation in the liver in the absence of heavy alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. MASLD refers to a group of disorders that include simple metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver (MASL) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. An estimated 20% to 25% of MASL patients will acquire MASH, and both MASL and MASH prevalence are predicted to rise even higher over the next decade due to increased frequency of risk factors such as obesity and insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. While MASL is still considered reversible and generally benign, its progression into MASH is thought to be harmful in most cases since it precedes the development of liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms that initiate inflammation and cause MASL to progress into MASH are still poorly understood, which restricts the range of available treatments.</p>
<p>One of the main players that may be involved in these processes is microRNAs (miRs). MiRs are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by limiting messenger RNA (mRNA) translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Because miRs are involved in the control of numerous genes and processes, multiple miRs have been demonstrated to play a role in fundamental aspects of MASH, including lipid metabolism, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Although many miRs have been examined in MASLD, the possible pathogenic involvement of numerous others, remains unknown. One of the miRs that has been researched in a number of pathologies, including cancer, cardiovascular illnesses, and neurological disorders is miR-26b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. However, so far very little is known about the function of miR-26b in the liver and MASH. Nonetheless, some studies have already revealed that miR-26b may play a role in several MASH-related pathways. For example, miR-26b appears to suppress the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines by inhibiting the expression of TGF-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) and TAK1-binding protein-3, both of which are positive regulators of the NF-κB system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, miR-26b has been shown to downregulate the gene expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFR-β), hence reducing hepatic fibrogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>The findings above show that miR-26b may play a role in the pathogenesis of MASH, although no study has determined its exact causal involvement in MASH development. In this investigation, we used previously described miR-26b knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] and myeloid cell-specific miR-26b knockout mice to clarify the role of miR-26b in hepatic lipid metabolism, inflammation, and fibrogenesis. Furthermore, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which act as clinically and therapeutically relevant vehicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], loaded with miR-26b mimics were used to restore miR-26b levels in mice as well as in human precision-cut liver slices to investigate its therapeutic potential.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<label>2.1</label><title>Animals</title>
<p><italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were generated as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were used as control and all mice were on C57BL/6J background for more than 10 generations. Both male and female mice were used for this study. Furthermore, myeloid lineage-specific <italic>Mir26b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice on an <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background were generated by crossing <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> with <italic>Lysm<sup>Cre+</sup></italic> transgenic mice to form <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>fl/fl</sup>Lysm<sup>Cre+</sup></italic> mice. <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup> Mir26b<sup>fl/fl</sup>Lysm<sup>Cre-</sup></italic> mice were used as control. Starting at 8 weeks of age, the mice were fed a Western-type diet (WTD) containing 21% fat and 0.20% cholesterol (Sniff TD88137) for 4 or 12 weeks after which the mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (0.1 mg/g body weight) and xylazine (0.02 mg/g body weight). The blood was collected, and livers were harvested and snapfrozen using liquid nitrogen. The livers were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Sakura) and cryosectioned in 5µm cuts and mounted on glass slides. For metabolic measurements and further analysis, 100µm tissue sections were collected in 2ml reaction tubes. All animal studies performed were approved by the local ethical committee (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany, approval number 81-02.04.2019.A363 and Regierung von Oberbayern, approval number 55.2-1-54-253245-2015).</p>

<label>2.2</label><title>Lipid Nanoparticle Production</title>
<p>The ionizable cationic lipid DLin-MC3-DMA (Hycultec GmbH, Beutelsbach, Germany) was combined with DSPC (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine, Avanti), Cholesterol (Sigma) and DMG-PEG 2000 (Avanti) in absolute ethanol at molar ratios of 50:10:38.5:1.5 and a final lipid concentration of 50 mM. The aqueous phase was prepared by dissolving a combination (1:1) of miRNA-26b-3P and -5P in sterile 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 4), to achieve a 0.17 µg/µL solution. For LNP formulation, the ethanol and aqueous phase were injected into a microfluidic herringbone mixer (Microfluidic ChipShop, Jena, Germany) via syringe pumps at a flow rate ratio of 1:3, respectively, with a total flow rate of 4 mL/min to obtain an N/P ratio of 4. Generated lipid nanoparticles were diluted with PBS to a concentration of ethanol below 2 %, followed by concentrating via ultra-centrifugation (3000 <italic>xg</italic>) using 10 kDa Amicon Ultrafilitration units (Sigma), and were finally dialyzed against PBS using a dialysis membrane with 30 kDa MWCO.</p>
<p>To characterize the particle size and surface charge, samples were diluted with PBS and equilibrated for 15 min at 20°C before analysis. Particle sizes and polydispersity were determined by dynamic light scattering and Zetapotential measurements were carried out both, using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd).</p>
<p>The encapsulation efficiency of RNA of prepared lipid nanoparticles was determined using a Quant-iT RiboGreen assay according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were analyzed by fluorescence quantification on a microplate reader (Cytation 3, BioTek Instruments Inc.). The encapsulation efficiency was calculated as the difference between the total RNA and the non-encapsulated RNA, divided by the total RNA (x100%). The dosing of RNA-LNPs was based on the Ribogreen assay result.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<label>2.3</label><title>LNP injections</title>
<p>LNPs were produced as described above LNPs containing 2mg/kg RNA were administered via intraperitoneal injection every 3 days. Empty LNPs (eLNPs) and LNPs loaded with murine miR-26b-3p (Duplex Sequences: 5’-/5Phos/rCrCrUrGrUrUrCrUrCrCrArUrUrArCrUrUrGrGmCmUrC-3’ and 5’- mGmCrCmArAmGrUmArAmUrGmGrAmGrAmArCmArGG-3’) and miR-26b-5p (Duplex Sequences: 5’-/5Phos/rUrUrCrArArGrUrArArUrUrCrArGrGrArUrAmGmGrU-3’ and 5’-mCmUrAmUrCmCrUmGrAmArUmUrAmCrUmUrGmAA-3’) mimics (IDT) were injected into <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>miRNA-26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice to determine potential therapeutic effects.</p>

<p>One frozen liver piece of 25mg per mouse was homogenized in a closed tube with glass beads and 1mL Qiazol by using the Tissue Lyser (Qiagen) for 5min at 50Hz. RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen). Following RNA isolation, cDNA was made from 500ng total RNA by adding 1µl Oligo (dT)-Primer (Eurofins Genomics). Secondary RNA structure was denaturalized at 70°C for 5min after which the samples were briefly cooled on ice to allow primer annealing. Subsequently, M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase, M-MLV RT 5x Buffer, and dNTP Mix (Promega) were added and cDNA synthesis was completed by incubation for 1h at 37°C. The relative gene expression levels were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using primer sequences listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. For the qPCR reaction, 10ng of cDNA template was used to which 1X PowerUp™ SYBR™ Green Master Mix (ThermoFisher) and primers (Eurofins Genomics) were added. PCR cycling was performed on QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR system (ThermoFisher) with the following conditions: 50°C for 2min for 1 cycle (UDG activation); 95°C for 2min for 1 cycle (Dual-Lock DNA polymerase); and 95°C for 15sec (Denature), 58°C for 15sec (Anneal) and 72°C for 1min (Extend) for 40 cycles.

Each STK-PamChip® array contains 144 individual phospho-site(s) that are peptide sequences derived from substrates for Ser/Thr kinases. One 100μm liver section was lysed for 15 min on ice using M-PER Mammalian Extraction Buffer containing Halt Phosphatase Inhibitor and EDTA-free Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (1:100 each; Thermo Fischer Scientific).

<p>For the STK assay, 2.0µg of protein and 400µM ATP were applied per array (n=4 per condition) together with an antibody mix to detect the phosphorylated Ser/Thr. After incubation for an hour (30°C) where the sample is pumped back and forth through the porous material to maximize binding kinetics and minimize assay time, a 2nd FITC-conjugated antibody is used to detect the phosphorylation signal. Imaging was done using an LED imaging system and the spot intensity at each time point was quantified (and corrected for local background) using the BioNavigator software version 6.3 (PamGene International, ’s-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands). Upstream Kinase Analysis (UKA), a functional scoring method (PamGene) was used to rank kinases based on combined specificity scores (based on peptides linked to a kinase, derived from 6 databases) and sensitivity scores (based on treatment-control differences).</p>

To identify whether the increase of Mac-1-positive cells is due to macrophage or neutrophil infiltration we also determined the number of Ly6G-positive cells, which remained unchanged, suggesting that the increased number of Mac-1 positive cells was likely the result of an increase in the number of infiltrating macrophages rather than neutrophils (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Furthermore, the whole-body knockout of <italic>miR-26b</italic> only affected the number of infiltrating macrophages and not Kupffer cells, which are recognized as CD68-positive cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>).

<p>To elucidate the underlying mechanisms behind the effects of miR-26b on the liver, we have performed a kinase activity profiling, focusing on serine-threonine kinases (STK). In order to evaluate the differentially activated kinases, the degree of phosphorylation of peptides coated on STK arrays is determined. Liver lysates from <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (KO) showed a strong and very distinct upregulation of peptide phosphorylation compared to liver lysates from <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (WT) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref> and <bold>Supplemental Figure 1A</bold>). Remarkably, 84 kinases were significantly more activated in liver lysates from <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), many of which are involved in inflammatory pathways such as c-Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNKs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and extracellular-signal, regulated kinases (ERKs). This was also further corroborated by pathway analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-E</xref>), showing enrichment in pathways related to inflammation (e.g. MAP kinase activation, TLR signaling) and angiogenesis (e.g. VEGF signaling). Combined, these results demonstrate that the lack of <italic>miR-26b</italic> increases kinase activity in the liver, particularly of kinases related to inflammatory pathways, which can thus be a plausible mechanism behind the hepatic effects observed in <italic>miR-26b</italic> deficient mice.</p>

Injections with mLNPs lowered hepatic cholesterol levels compared to the vehicle control (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), whilst triglyceride levels remained unaffected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). These findings were further confirmed by demonstrating that treatment with mLNPs significantly reduced the Oil-red-O positive area (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). While mLNP treatment did not affect <italic>Cd36</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), it resulted in a 0.67-fold reduction in <italic>Sra</italic> expression compared to mice injected with eLNPs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>).</p>

<p>Since the mouse experiments demonstrated a clear therapeutic potential of LNPs loaded with miR-26b mimics, we also set out to explore this potential in a human setting. Human precision-cut liver slices were cultured for 24h or 48h in the presence of mLNPs or eLNPs as control (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). Although no effects were observed on IL-6 secretion (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>), mLNPs had strong anti-inflammatory effects on these human precision-cut liver slices.

<p>To further evaluate the importance of miR-26b in liver diseases in humans, we have measured the expression levels of miR-26b-3p and miR-26b-5p in the plasma of healthy subjects and patients with liver cirrhosis (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>). Remarkably, both miR-26b-3p and -5p were significantly elevated in the plasma of liver cirrhosis patients (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8G-H</xref>), suggesting -at least-a strong association between miR-26b and the development of MASH in humans.</p>

<label>4.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>MiRs have been indicated to play a critical role in the development of several pathologies, including MASH. While the role of miR-26b has already been investigated in various cardio-metabolic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], its role in MASH remained unknown so far. Therefore, this study focused on the role of miR-26b in MASH showing that mice deficient in miR-26b presented with a higher hepatic lipid content, higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and an increased number of infiltrated macrophages in the liver and exacerbated hepatic fibrosis. This coincided with an increased activity of kinases that are involved in inflammatory pathways. Finally, when attempting to rescue this phenotype by injecting LNPs loaded with miR-26b mimics, we managed to decrease hepatic cholesterol, overall hepatic lipid levels, gene expression of <italic>Sra</italic>, and the activity of inflammatory kinases. These anti-inflammatory effects of miR-26b loaded LNPs were also confirmed in human precision-cut liver slices. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-26b plays a protective role in MASH development and shows the therapeutic potential of miR-26b loaded LNPs.</p>
<p>In this study, <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice showed elevated hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which coincided with increased expression of <italic>Sra</italic> and <italic>Cd36</italic>. Generally, SR-A and CD36 play a critical role in lipid metabolism, as 75% to 90% of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) is taken up by macrophages via these receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. In line with our observations, previous studies already highlighted that CD36 and SR-A play a key role in MASH development. For example, a hematopoietic deficiency of these receptors resulted in reduced hepatic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that mice lacking SR-A show decreased hepatic lipid levels and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Interestingly, they also demonstrated that SR-A induced JNK signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], which is also in line with our kinase activity results. Moreover, it could be demonstrated that <italic>CD36</italic> expression is upregulated in the livers of MASLD patients, leading to hepatic triglyceride accumulation and consequently an exacerbation of hepatic steatosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Overall, this strongly indicates that an increased hepatic expression of <italic>Cd36</italic> and <italic>Sra</italic> in both mice and humans causes hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride accumulation as well as inflammation, adding fuel to the notion of CD36 and SR-A as a possible underlying mechanism through which miR-26b exerts its effects on MASH development.</p>
<p>Elevated hepatic lipid levels lead to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, consequently mediating liver injury and inflammation in MASH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], which could also be observed in our study. The elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the liver led to the increased number of Mac-1 positive cells, representing infiltrated macrophages. The production of IL-6 and TNF by macrophages in turn led to further local inflammation, also highlighted by the increased inflammatory kinase activity in the liver, thereby causing a vicious cycle of cytokine release and myeloid cell infiltration[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Interestingly, TNF has been shown to promote steatosis by altering lipid metabolism and inducing fatty acid uptake in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], further showing the critical link between inflammation and hyperlipidemia. Additionally, infiltrated macrophages usually form clusters, especially in areas of macrovesicular steatosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], which was in line with our current study. Overall, these findings indicate a crosstalk between hepatic lipid levels, inflammation, and macrophage infiltration and show that miR-26b might play a protective role in these processes.</p>
<p>The third characteristic of MASH that was investigated during this study was hepatic fibrogenesis. Hepatic fibrosis is mainly caused by the activation of the fibrogenic factor TGF-β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], which is also confirmed in the current study as miR-26b knockout mice displayed a higher amount of Sirius red positive area and an increased expression of <italic>Tgfb</italic>. Additionally, <italic>Mmp13</italic>, a protein responsible for extracellular matrix degradation, was upregulated in <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, which is probably a secondary compensatory response to the increase in fibrosis. Besides this, MMP13 has been shown to play a less straightforward role in liver fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Uchinami <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that levels of TNF and TGF-β were suppressed in MMP13-deficient mice in an early phase of liver fibrosis, suggesting that MMP13 possibly accelerates hepatic fibrogenesis by mediating inflammation. Overall, this indicates that miR-26b plays a protective role in hepatic fibrogenesis, possibly due to modulating TGF-β and MMP13 levels.</p>
<p>Finally, to study the therapeutic potential of miR-26b, we injected whole-body knockout mice with miR-26b mimic-loaded LNPs. LNP-based therapies have emerged over the last few years and have been extensively studied and even already used in clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], underlining the translatability and potential of our study. Interestingly, the LNP treatment not only showed significant results on hepatic lipid metabolism but also reversed the effects on inflammatory kinase activity, particularly of pathways mediated by key regulators like JNKs, MAPKs and ERKs. However, a note of caution is the fact that we injected the LNPs simultaneously with the diet, providing a more preventative approach as opposed to a curative therapy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-26b loaded LNPs have anti-inflammatory effects on human precision-cut liver slices, which, combined with the suppressed levels of cholesterol and hepatic lipids in our mouse model, underline its potential as an exciting therapeutic option.</p>
<p>Collectively, these results show that miR-26b plays a protective role in the development of MASH by exerting effects on hepatic lipid metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis. Future research should focus on the further clinical translation of our results by evaluating the effects of miR-26b loaded LNPs on various human tissues. Overall, we show here thought-provoking results on the role of miR-26b in MASH development and highlight this miR as a promising therapeutic target, providing a solid base for exciting future research.</p>

<p>Based on previous publications suggesting a potential role for miR-26b in the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), the researchers aim to clarify its function in hepatic health and explore the therapeutical potential of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to treat this condition. First, they employed both whole-body and myeloid cell-specific miR-26b KO mice and observed elevated hepatic steatosis features in these mice compared to WT controls when subjected to WTD. Moreover, livers from whole-body miR-26b KO mice also displayed increased levels of inflammation and fibrosis markers. Kinase activity profiling analyses revealed distinct alterations, particularly in kinases associated with inflammatory pathways, in these samples. Treatment with LNPs containing miR-26b mimics restored lipid metabolism and kinase activity in these animals. Finally, similar anti-inflammatory effects were observed in the livers of individuals with cirrhosis, whereas elevated miR-26b levels were found in the plasma of these patients in comparison with healthy control. Overall, the authors conclude that miR-26b plays a protective role in MASH and that its delivery via LNPs efficiently mitigates MASH development.</p>
<p>The study has some strengths, most notably, its employ of a combination of animal models, analyses of potential underlying mechanisms, as well as innovative treatment delivery methods with significant promise. However, it also presents numerous weaknesses that leave the research work somewhat incomplete. The precise role of miR-26b in a human context remains elusive, hindering direct translation to clinical practice. Additionally, the evaluation of the kinase activity, although innovative, does not provide a clear molecular mechanisms-based explanation behind the protective role of this miRNA.</p>
<p>Therefore, to fortify the solidity of their conclusions, these concerns require careful attention and resolution. Once these issues are comprehensively addressed, the study stands to make a significant impact on the field.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Peters, Rakateli, et al. aims to characterize the contribution of miR-26b in a mouse model of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) generated by a Western-type diet on the background of Apoe knock-out. In addition, the authors provide a rescue of the miR-26b using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), with potential therapeutic implications. In addition, the authors provide useful insights into the role of macrophages and some validation of the effect of miR-26b LNPs on human liver samples.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provide a well-designed mouse model, that aims to characterize the role of miR-26b in a mouse model of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) generated by a Western-type diet on the background of Apoe knock-out. The rescue of the phenotypes associated with the model used using miR-26b using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) provides an interesting avenue to novel potential therapeutic avenues.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the authors provide a new and interesting avenue to understand the role of miR-26b in MASH, the study needs some additional validations and mechanistic insights in order to strengthen the author's conclusions.</p>
<p>(1) Analysis of the expression of miRNAs based on miRNA-seq of human samples (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ccb-compute.cs.uni-saarland.de/isomirdb/mirnas">https://ccb-compute.cs.uni-saarland.de/isomirdb/mirnas</ext-link>) suggests that miR-26b-5p is highly abundant both on liver and blood. It seems hard to reconcile that despite miRNA abundance being similar in both tissues, the physiological effects claimed by the authors in Figure 2 come exclusively from the myeloid (macrophages).</p>
<p>(2) Similarly, the miRNA-seq expression from isomirdb suggests also that expression of miR-26a-5p is indeed 4-fold higher than miR-26b-5p both in the liver and blood. Since both miRNAs share the same seed sequence, and most of the supplemental regions (only 2 nt difference), their endogenous targets must be highly overlapped. It would be interesting to know whether deletion of miR-26b is somehow compensated by increased expression of miR-26a-5p loci. That would suggest that the model is rather a depletion of miR-26.</p>

<p>(3) Similarly, the miRNA-seq expression from isomirdb suggests also that expression of miR-26b-5p is indeed 50-fold higher than miR-26b-3p in the liver and blood. This difference in abundance of the two strands is usually regarded as one of them being the guide strand (in this case the 5p) and the other being the passenger (in this case the 3p). In some cases, passenger strands can be a byproduct of miRNA biogenesis, thus the rescue experiments using LNPs with both strands in equimolar amounts would not reflect the physiological abundance miR-26b-3p. The non-physiological overabundance of miR-26b-3p would constitute a source of undesired off-targets.</p>
<p>(4) It would also be valuable to check the miRNA levels on the liver upon LNP treatment, or at least the signatures of miR-26b-3p and miR-26b-5p activity using RNA-seq on the RNA samples already collected.</p>
<p>(5) Some of the phenotypes described, such as the increase in cholesterol, overlap with the previous publication by van der Vorst et al. BMC Genom Data (2021), despite in this case the authors are doing their model in Apoe knock-out and Western-type diet. I would encourage the authors to investigate more or discuss why the initial phenotypes don't become more obvious despite the stressors added in the current manuscript.</p>
<p>(6) The authors have focused part of their analysis on a few gene makers that show relatively modest changes. Deeper characterization using RNA-seq might reveal other genes that are more profoundly impacted by miR-26 depletion. It would strengthen the conclusions proposed if the authors validated that changes in mRNA abundance (Sra, Cd36) do impact the protein abundance. These relatively small changes or trends in mRNA expression, might not translate into changes in protein abundance.</p>
<p>(7) In Figures 5 and 7, the authors run a phosphorylation array (STK) to analyze the changes in the activity of the kinome. It seems that a relatively large number of signaling pathways are being altered, I think that should be strengthened by further validations by Western blot on the collected tissue samples. For quite a few of the kinases, there might be antibodies that recognise phosphorylation. The two figures lack a mechanistic connection to the rest of the manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Provisional author response to Reviewer #1</bold>  </p>
<p>
We would like the reviewer for his/her careful evaluation of our manuscript and appreciate his/her appraisal for the strengths of our study. Regarding the weaknesses, we plan to address these as good as possible during the revision of our manuscript.</p>
<p>
We can already state that miR-26b has clear anti-inflammatory effects on human liver slices, which is in line with our results demonstrating that miR-26b plays a protective role in MASH development in mice. The notion that patients with liver cirrhosis have increasing plasma levels of miR-26b, seems contradictory at first glance. However, we believe that this increased miR-26b expression is a compensatory mechanism to counteract the MASH/cirrhotic effects. However, the exact source of this miR-26b remains to be elucidated in future studies.</p>
<p>
The performed kinase activity analysis revealed that miR-26b affects kinases that particularly play an important role in inflammation and angiogenesis. Strikingly and supporting these data, these effects could be inverted again by LNP treatment. Combined, these results already provide strong mechanistic insights on molecular and intracellular signalling level. Although the exact target of miR-26b remains elusive and its identification is probably beyond the scope of the current manuscript due to its complexity, we believe that the kinase activity results already provide a solid mechanistic basis.</p>
