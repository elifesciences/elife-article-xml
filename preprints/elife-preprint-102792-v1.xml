<title>Abstract</title><p>The assembly and operation of neural circuits in the brain rely on the coordination and balance of excitatory and inhibitory activities. Inhibitory synapses are key regulators of the functional balance of neural circuits. However, due to the diversity of inhibitory presynaptic neurons, the complex composition of postsynaptic receptor subunits and the lack of typical postsynaptic dense structure, there are relatively few studies on the regulatory mechanisms for inhibitory synaptic structure and function, and insufficient understanding of the cellular and molecular abnormalities of inhibitory synapses in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we report a crucial role for endophilin A1 in inhibitory synapses. We show that endophilin A1 directly interacts with the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin in excitatory neurons, and promotes organization of the inhibitory postsynaptic density and synaptic recruitment/stabilization of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors via its plasma membrane association and actin polymerization promoting activities. Loss of endophilin A1 by gene knockout in mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells weakens inhibitory synaptic transmission and causes imbalance in the excitatory/inhibitory function of neural circuits, leading to increased susceptibility to epilepsy. Our findings identify endophilin A1 as an iPSD component and provide new insights into the organization and stabilization of inhibitory postsynapses to maintain E/I balance as well as the pathogenesis of epilepsy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activities of neural circuits are tightly orchestrated in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sakimoto et al., 2021</xref>). The imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity is implicated in many neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Canitano and Pallagrosi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Canitano and Palumbi, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Foss-Feig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fritschy, 2008</xref>). In the brain, in contrast to asymmetric excitatory synapses formed between axonal boutons and dendritic postsynaptic structures with thick disc-shaped PSD, inhibitory synapses are symmetric and are constituted of the presynaptic terminal from diverse interneurons and the postsynaptic plasma membrane with thin sheet-like PSD where receptor complexes are anchored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Favuzzi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mody and Pearce, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tao et al., 2018</xref>). Although the formation, maturation and plasticity of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses are vitally important for neural circuit functioning, much more research efforts have been focused on the regulatory mechanisms governing excitatory synaptic structure and function. The mechanisms by which inhibitory synapses are constructed in the brain and fine-tuned in response to neural activity remain largely unexplored.</p>
<p>The γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs), major targets of antiseizure drugs, are heteropentameric chloride channels that mediate fast synaptic transmission at inhibitory synapses in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Scott and Aricescu, 2019</xref>). Several neuropathologies are characterized by alterations in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor trafficking, synaptic E/I ratio and neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sakimoto et al., 2021</xref>). At the inhibitory postsynaptic site, synaptic localization and functioning of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs requires trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules, submembranous scaffold proteins and intracellular signaling proteins. Gephyrin is a master organizer of iPSD, which self-assembles into planar lattices beneath the plasma membrane and anchors GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs or glycine receptors (GlyRs) to the postsynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">George et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kasaragod and Schindelin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kirsch et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2014</xref>). Collybistin, a membrane lipid-binding protein, functions in recruitment of gephyrin and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to the plasma membrane by interacting with gephyrin, the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin-2 (NL-2) and the α2 subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kalscheuer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kins et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Saiepour et al., 2010</xref>). The transmembrane protein Shisa7 binds GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and regulates their trafficking, synaptic abundance and functional properties via binding to protein(s) other than gephyrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, mechanisms governing the assembly, recruitment and maintenance of various inhibitory synaptic components remain largely enigmatic.</p>
<p>The majority of inhibitory synapses are formed on the dendritic shaft, or around the cell body of excitatory principal neurons where both actin and microtubule cytoskeletons are present underneath the plasma membrane. Through direct interaction with polymerized tubulin, gephyrin organizes the iPSD by anchoring the GlyRs and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to the microtubule cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Parato and Bartolini, 2021</xref>). Notably, although small F-actin patches are observed within the dendritic shaft where the majority of inhibitory synapses are assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">van Bommel et al., 2019</xref>), role(s) of the actin cytoskeleton in the organization and maintenance of inhibitory synapses is still unclear.</p>
<p>Endophilin A1 (EEN1) is a member of the endophilin A protein family characterized by an amino (N)-terminal membrane-binding N-BIN/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain and a carboxyl (C)-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. The gene encoding endophilin A1 (<italic>EEN1</italic>, gene name <italic>sh3gl2</italic>) is almost exclusively expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ringstad et al., 1997</xref>), and has been implicated in epilepsy, schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Corponi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Germer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Yu et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yu et al., 2018b</xref>).</p>
<p>In excitatory synapses, endophilin A1 functions in synaptic vesicle recycling and autophagosome formation at the axon terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bademosi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Murdoch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ringstad et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schuske et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Soukup et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Verstreken et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Watanabe et al., 2018</xref>), and regulates the morphogenesis, maturation, and acute structural plasticity of dendritic spines by promoting actin polymerization via its effector protein p140Cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yang et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies reported that the double knockout (KO) mice of <italic>EEN1</italic> and <italic>EEN2</italic> exhibit spontaneous epileptic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>). However, <italic>EEN1</italic> depletion only causes a slight decrease in excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). As E/I imbalance is caused by changes in either excitatory or inhibitory activity, or both, we were prompted to investigate the biological function of endophilin A1 in the inhibitory synapses. In this study, we show that endophilin A1 interacts with gephyrin and localizes to GABAergic postsynapses. Via its membrane-binding and actin polymerization-promoting activities, endophilin A1 facilitates organization of the inhibitory postsynaptic machinery. Loss of endophilin A1 causes impairment of inhibitory synaptic transmission, E/I imbalance and aggravation of epileptic susceptibility.</p>

<title>Ablation of endophilin A1 causes E/I imbalance and increases epilepsy susceptibility</title>
<p>Previous studies found that <italic>EEN1</italic> and <italic>EEN2</italic> double knockout (KO) mice exhibit spontaneous epileptic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that endophilin A1 and A2 are involved in maintaining the E/I balance. However, another study reported that the protein levels of endophilin A1 were higher in temporal neocortex neurons of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yu et al., 2018b</xref>). Moreover, in a chemical kindling mouse model of epilepsy, in which mice are chronically induced with the GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dhir, 2012</xref>), endophilin A1 was also upregulated in the hippocampus and adjacent temporal cortex, and silencing its expression in the hippocampal CA3 region reduced PTZ-induced seizure susceptibility and severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yu et al., 2018b</xref>). To investigate the role of endophilin A1 in epilepsy, we determined the impact of <italic>EEN1</italic> gene ablation on chemical kindling of pan-neural <italic>EEN1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yang et al., 2018</xref>) with PTZ at a sub-convulsive dose of 25 mg/kg.

<p>We previously found that <italic>EEN1</italic> KO caused a slight decrease in the amplitude of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSC) and a significant attenuation of long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). As imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory signals in neuronal circuits is implicated in epilepsy, we then determined whether loss of endophilin A1 in excitatory neurons affects the E/I ratio by electrophysiological analysis. To this end, we eliminated the <italic>EEN1</italic> gene in pyramidal neurons by stereotaxic injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing CaMKIIα promoter-driven Cre recombinase into the hippocampal CA1 region of <italic>EEN1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Whole-cell patch clamp recording of CA1 pyramidal cells indicated that, while the eEPSC and its paired-pulse ratio were not significantly changed, the evoked inhibitory postsynaptic current (eIPSC), not its PPR, was decreased in the <italic>EEN1</italic> KO neurons, resulting in a significant increase in the E/I ratio (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-I</xref>). Of note, neither the frequency nor the amplitude of miniature EPSCs (mEPSC) or miniature IPSCs (mIPSC) was altered in <italic>EEN1</italic> KO neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J-O</xref>). Moreover, neither fast mIPSCs (perisomatic events: &lt; 2.8 ms) nor slow mIPSCs (distal dendritic events: &gt; 2.8 ms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Miles et al., 1996</xref>) were affected by <italic>EEN1</italic> KO (Figure S1), indicating that presynaptic quantal release of soma-or dendrite-targeting inhibitory synapses is normal. Taken together, these data indicate that endophilin A1 in hippocampal pyramidal neurons functions in inhibitory synaptic transmission to maintain E/I balance.</p>

<title>Endophilin A1 is required for the formation and stabilization of inhibitory synapses</title>
<p>Diminished eIPSC in <italic>EEN1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> pyramidal neurons prompted us to determine the role of endophilin A1 in inhibitory synapses by immunofluorescence staining of brain sections from <italic>EEN1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Analysis of confocal microscopy images revealed that, compared with the wild-type, there was a significant decrease in fluorescent signals of both VGAT and gephyrin, the inhibitory pre-and post-synaptic markers, and PSD95, the excitatory postsynaptic marker, in all subregions of the hippocampus of the <italic>EEN1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice on postnatal day 21 (P21) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,C</xref>,D,F, and S2A,S2C), suggesting defects in synapse development. The decreases in inhibitory but not excitatory postsynaptic protein were also detected in the <italic>EEN1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice at P60 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,C</xref>,E,F, and S2B,S2C), indicating that the assembly and/or stabilization of inhibitory postsynapses was impaired throughout brain development. Notably, gephyrin signals in all layers of the hippocampal subregions were reduced in the <italic>EEN1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (Figure S2D and S2E). As different types of interneurons synapse with hippocampal excitatory neurons at distinct subcellular compartments (soma, axon initial segment, proximal and distal dendrites) indicated by the layered structures of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Spruston, 2008</xref>), these data suggest that endophilin A1 functions in the assembly/stabilization of inhibitory synapses formed between various presynaptic neurons and postsynaptic neurons.</p>

<p>Next we analyzed the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and found that, consistent with changes in inhibitory postsynaptic marker, signals of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 subunit were decreased in the hippocampi of both juvenile and adult <italic>EEN1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G-I</xref>). These data collectively indicate that endophilin A1 orchestrates the assembly of inhibitory synapses, the architecture of inhibitory postsynapses in particular, and functioning of GABAergic synapses.</p>

<title>Endophilin A1 localizes to the iPSD and augments the organization of the inhibitory postsynaptic machinery</title>
<p>To substantiate the role of postsynaptic endophilin A1 in the assembly of inhibitory synapses and exclude the impacts of presynaptic endophilin A1 and its depletion on early embryonic development, we determined the effects of endophilin A1KO on inhibitory and excitatory synapses in cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons during late developmental stages. As the expression levels of GABA<sub>A</sub>R α1 are highly heterogeneous in individual cultured neurons (Figure S3), we determined the effect of Cre-mediated <italic>EEN1</italic> KO on surface expression of GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 in <italic>EEN1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> hippocampal neurons by immunofluorescence staining. Whilst no changes in surface GluA1 was detected, the fluorescence signal intensity and number of surface GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 clusters were largely lower in dendrites of <italic>EEN1</italic> KO neurons, which was rescued by re-expression of endophilin A1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-D</xref>).

<p>Next we sought to determine the molecular function of endophilin A1 in inhibitory synapses at the cellular level. By immunofluorescence staining and super-resolution microscopy of hippocampal neurons in dissociated culture, we observed partial colocalization of endophilin A1 with gephyrin as well as surface GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 in dendrites of hippocampal neurons, and juxtaposition or partial colocalization of endophilin A1 and VGAT puncta (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G-I</xref> and Video S2-4), indicating that endophilin A1 localizes to not only ePSD but also iPSD. Therefore, we speculated that endophilin A1 acted as a component of iPSD. Previous studies reported that synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs contain the γ2 subunit along with α and β subunits (e.g., α1β2γ2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Scott and Aricescu, 2019</xref>). The γ2 subunit is essential for receptor clustering at the synapse, mediated by interactions with scaffold proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Essrich et al., 1998</xref>). Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) of endogenous proteins in membrane fractions from mouse brain lysates with antibodies against GABA<sub>A</sub>R α1 detected not only the known iPSD components γ2, NL2 and gephyrin, but also endophilin A1, and vice versa (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). Of note, loss of endophilin A1 caused decreases in levels of GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 and gephyrin but not NL2 in anti-GABA<sub>A</sub>R α1 immunoprecipitates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). Further, immunoblotting of synaptosome fractions revealed that the levels of GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 and gephyrin were reduced at synapses in adult <italic>EEN1</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>). Together, these data support that endophilin A1 functions at the iPSD to promote the assembly and/or stabilization of the GABAergic postsynaptic machinery.</p>

<p>We subsequently sought to investigate the mechanistic role of endophilin A1 in the clustering of inhibitory postsynaptic proteins.

<p>Gephyrin is the major scaffold protein which interacts with the intracellular domains of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and anchors them at the inhibitory postsynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Essrich et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kneussel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mukherjee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tretter et al., 2008</xref>). The cell adhesion molecule NL2 drives postsynaptic assembly at perisomatic inhibitory synapses via interaction with gephyrin and the membrane lipid-binding protein collybistin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</xref>). We speculated that endophilin A1 functions in the assembly of iPSD via interaction with the scaffold and/or intercellular adhesion proteins. To determine which inhibitory synaptic protein(s) interacts with endophilin A1, we performed coIP from HEK293T cells transiently expressing endophilin A1 and NL2, or gephyrin, and detected interaction of endophilin A1with gephyrin but not NL2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). Moreover, coIP from mouse brain lysates corroborated interaction between endophilin A1 and gephyrin but not GABA<sub>A</sub>R α1 or γ2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Further, neither endophilin A2 nor A3 interacted with gephyrin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, although the expression levels of gephyrin were not affected by ablation of <italic>EEN1</italic>, its distribution in the PSD fraction was decreased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>). Consistently, immunofluorescence staining revealed a decrease in the clustering of gephyrin across the soma, the axon initial segment (AIS), and dendrites (Figure S4). The gephyrin clustering phenotype was rescued by expression of endophilin A1 but not endophilin A2 or A3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G,H</xref>), suggesting that their functions at the inhibitory postsynapses are not redundant. Conversely, overexpression of endophilin A1 caused an increase in the mean signal intensity and number of gephyrin puncta in the soma and dendrites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I,J</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that endophilin A1 interacts with the scaffold protein gephyrin and facilitates its clustering at inhibitory postsynapses.</p>
<p>At the submembraneous postsynaptic density, gephyrin self assembles via the N-terminal G and C-terminal E domains to provide scaffold for inhibitory postsynapses and anchors GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to the postsynaptic sites.

Moreover, overexpression of endophilin A1 also enhanced clustering of GABA<sub>A</sub>R g2 in the soma and dendrites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D,E</xref>).

<p>To further understand the mechanism by which endophilin A1 regulates the assembly and function of inhibitory postsynapses, next we attempted domain mapping of the endophilin A1-gephyrin interaction. To this end, we generated a series of truncation and internal deletion mutants for endophilin A1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). For those which did not express in mammalian cells, we determined their interaction with gephyrin by in vitro binding assays with recombinant proteins. None of the truncation or internal deletion mutants lost the ability to bind to gephyrin, and deletion of neither the BAR nor the SH3 domain weakened the binding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G,H</xref>), suggesting that they are involved in the interaction with gephyrin. Indeed, the decreases in clustering of either gephyrin or GABA<sub>A</sub>R g2 in <italic>EEN1</italic> KO neurons were not rescued by expression of endophilin A1 fragments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I-L</xref>), indicating that all functional domains of endophilin A1 are required for the assembly of the GABAergic postsynaptic machinery.</p>

<title>Actin polymerization is required for stabilization of inhibitory postsynapses</title>

To further investigate the mechanism underlying endophilin A1-mediated assembly of inhibitory postsynapses, we asked whether actin polymerization contributes to the stabilization of iPSD and GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering in dendrites. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">van Bommel et al., 2019</xref>), we observed large patches of F-actin labeled by LifeAct-mCherry in spines and small puncta in dendritic shafts that exhibited partial colocalization with or adjoined gephyrin in cultured hippocampal neurons by super-resolution microscopy (Figure S5A and Video S5). We then determined the impact of F-actin depolymerization on gephyrin-labeled iPSD and g2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in cultured hippocampal neurons. One-hour or two-hour treatment of mature neurons with nocodazole, a microtubule depolymerizing reagent, caused decreases in the number of both PSD95 and gephyrin puncta (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-D</xref>), which was in good agreement with previous findings that microtubule dynamics regulates the spatial organization of both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jaworski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kirsch and Betz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kirsch et al., 1991</xref>). Short-term or long-term incubation with latrunculin A, which disrupts actin polymerization, also caused decreases in the number of both ePSD and iPSD puncta (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-D</xref>), indicating that actin polymerization also contributes to the stabilization of the iPSD. We then tested the effect of actin depolymerization on GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering and found that, long-term but not short-term latrunculin A application caused a reduction in the number of GABA<sub>A</sub>R g2 puncta in dendrites (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E-H</xref>), this finding supported the observation that the decrease in gephyrin cluster preceded the reduction in GABA<sub>A</sub>R g2 receptor cluster following latrunculin A treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>). In addition, colocalization analysis revealed less recruitment of g2 to gephyrin puncta even after short-term drug application, without changes in g2 clustering (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J,K</xref>).

<title>Both the membrane-binding and p140Cap-binding capacities of endophilin A1 are indispensable for its function at the inhibitory postsynapses</title>
<p>At the excitatory synapse, the plasma membrane-associated endophilin A1 regulates the morphogenesis, maturation and structural plasticity of dendritic spines by promoting branched actin polymerization underneath the postsynaptic membrane via its interaction with the cytoskeleton regulator p140Cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Having established the requirement for both endophilin A1 and the actin cytoskeleton in the assembly and stabilization of the inhibitory postsynaptic structure, we speculated that regulation of inhibitory postsynapse assembly by endophilin A1 necessitated its plasma membrane-binding and actin polymerization-promoting activities. Silencing p140Cap expression in postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal cells by shRNA-mediated knockdown caused decreases in the clustering of gephyrin puncta in dendrites, which was restored by overexpression of p140Cap (Figure S5B,S5C), suggesting that p140Cap-mediated actin polymerization is required for the assembly of iPSD in postsynaptic neurons. However, compared with mere depletion of endophilin A1, p140Cap knockdown did not further attenuate the clustering of gephyrin in <italic>EEN1</italic> KO neurons (Figure S5D,S5E). Moreover, overexpression of p140Cap did not rescue the iPSD phenotype in <italic>EEN1</italic> KO neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A,B</xref>), suggesting that p140Cap-enhanced actin polymerization promotes the organization of iPSD through endophilin A1-mediated pathway. Indeed, overexpression of neither the membrane-binding deficient (KKK-EEE) nor the p140Cap-binding deficient (Y343A) mutant of endophilin A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yang et al., 2021</xref>) could rescue the iPSD defect (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A,B</xref>).

<p>Next, we determined the mechanistic role of endophilin A1 in vivo by rescuing the epilepsy susceptibility caused by <italic>EEN1</italic> KO. Indeed, when AAVs expressing the Cre recombinase and endophilin A1 were co-injected into the hippocampal CA1 region of <italic>EEN1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, only the wild-type but not the membrane-binding or p140Cap-binding deficient mutant of endophilin A1 rescued the early onset and severity of PTZ-induced seizures (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E,F</xref> and Video S6).

All together, these data indicate that endophilin A1 contributes to the structure and function of inhibitory synapses by promoting the submembrane assembly of iPSD and synaptic localization of the GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, thereby maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory activities in neural circuits (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although collybistin is implicated in plasma membrane recruitment and clustering of gephyrin and GABA<sub>A</sub>R α2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Saiepour et al., 2010</xref>), studies of collybistin KO mice showed that the GABA<sub>A</sub>R α3 subunit promotes gephyrin-mediated formation of inhibitory synapses in the absence of collybistin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wagner et al., 2021</xref>), raising the possibility that formation of a subset of GABAergic synapses requires gephyrin-interacting membrane-associated proteins other than collybistin. In the present study, we identify endophilin A1 as a novel binding partner for gephyrin and demonstrate that it promotes the assembly of inhibitory synapses and clustering of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at the iPSD. Loss of endophilin A1 activity causes impairment of inhibitory synaptic transmission in neuronal circuits and increases susceptibility to seizures. In the central nervous system, inhibitory interneurons are highly diverse in morphologies, molecular profiles and physiological functions. Presynaptic terminals from different types of interneurons target distinct subcellular compartments in postsynaptic pyramidal neurons where GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors of specific subunit compositions are located. Parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons usually contact the soma and proximal dendrites, whereas somatostatin-expressing (SST+) interneurons mainly innervate the dendrites of pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>). Although different inhibitory synapses localized in different subcellular compartments of postsynaptic neurons have distinct properties and express a diversity of synaptic proteins, gephyrin remains a core postsynaptic component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Favuzzi et al., 2019</xref>). Our study revealed that endophilin A1 promotes the clustering of gephyrin in all subcellular compartments of pyramidal neurons, indicating that endophilin A1 functions in the organization of inhibitory postsynapses innervated by various presynaptic interneurons.</p>
<p>Among the endophilin A proteins, endophilin A1 is the most abundant in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>). Although they have redundant roles in physiological or pathological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>), endophilin A1, but not A2 or A3, promotes spine morphogenesis and excitatory postsynaptic organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we uncover a previously unanticipated role for endophilin A1 at GABAergic synapses. By deleting endophilin As in specific neuron subtypes, we found that endophilin A1 regulates GABAergic postsynaptic compartments. Endophilin A1, rather than A2 or A3, interacts with gephyrin and modulates the inhibitory postsynaptic machinery. Although endophilin A1 might function redundantly with other endophilin As in synaptic vesicle recycling at the presynaptic site, it participates in the organization or reorganization of postsynaptic structures through specific binding to postsynaptic proteins, a function that cannot be fully replaced by other endophilin As at both excitatory and inhibitory postsynapses.</p>
<p>The membrane lipid-binding protein collybistin interacts with the trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecule NL-2 to recruit gephyrin and GABA<sub>A</sub>R α2 to the postsynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kalscheuer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kins et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Saiepour et al., 2010</xref>). Adamtsl3 secreted from presynapses binds to the transmembrane protein DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer) and controls its synaptic localization, which is required for the maintenance of GABAergic synapses in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cramer et al., 2023</xref>). Anchoring of the α5 subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub>R to the actin cytoskeleton through radixin, an actin-binding protein, facilitates its clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Loebrich et al., 2006</xref>). These findings underscore the necessity for investigation of mechanism(s) regulating the plasma membrane-iPSD-actin cytoskeleton interaction. As membrane-binding and actin polymerization-promoting activities of endophilin A1 are both required for its function in enhancing iPSD formation and γ2–containing GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering to iPSD, we propose that membrane-bound endophilin A1 promotes postsynaptic assembly by coordinating the plasma membrane tethering of the postsynaptic protein complex and its stabilization with the actin cytomatrix (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). In contrast, clustering of β2/3 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is independent of the actin or microtubule cytoskeleton in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allison et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kasaragod et al., 2022</xref>). Given that synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are composed of distinct subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kasaragod et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Koh et al., 2023</xref>), these findings indicate that the actin cytoskeleton plays distinct roles in the clustering and possibly dynamic changes in the subunit composition and subcompartmental localization of different types of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. Of note, the subcellular distribution of gephyrin, which has a tubulin-binding motif, is not affected by depolymerization of F-actin or microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allison et al., 2000</xref>). Overall, the discrepancy in data about the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in inhibitory synapses may be due to differences in drug concentration, treatment time, receptor subtypes and neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mody and Pearce, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sexton et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The number of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors is subject to alterations not only during development and neuronal plasticity but also during pathological processes such as epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nusser et al., 1998</xref>). Synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are recruited directly from extrasynaptic pools following exocytosis, and their endocytosis occurs exclusively at extrasynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bogdanov et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, lateral diffusion of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs between synaptic and extrasynaptic sites and their iPSD anchoring are very important for their synaptic distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Thomas et al., 2005</xref>). In good agreement with the finding that GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs stabilization at synapses depends on gephyrin clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jacob et al., 2005</xref>), we found that decreases in gephyrin clustering precedes the reduction in surface GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs following F-actin depolymerization (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). As the core scaffold protein in iPSD, gephyrin is highly enriched at the inhibitory postsynaptic sites and drives the formation of iPSD sheets via phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai et al., 2021</xref>). As binding of gephyrin by its partner proteins inhibits the iPSD condensate formation via autoinhibition of the multivalent interactions between its E domain and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hoffmann and Milovanovic, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), it is conceivable that endophilin A1 binding not only tethers the scaffold protein to the plasma membrane, but also releases it from the autoinhibitory conformation to facilitate the phase separation of the gephyrin-receptor complexes. Whether the activity of endophilin A1 is regulated by neuronal activity to participate in the structural and functional remodeling of iPSD awaits further investigation.</p>
<p>At the presynaptic site of excitatory synapses, endophilin A1 functions in synaptic vesicle recycling by recruiting the clathrin-uncoating factor synaptojanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schuske et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Verstreken et al., 2003</xref>). At the excitatory postsynapse, plasma membrane-associated endophilin A1 facilitates the morphogenesis, stabilization, maturation and plasticity of dendritic spines by promoting actin polymerization via its interaction with p140Cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that endophilin A1 functions upstream of p140Cap in not only excitatory but also inhibitory postsynapses of excitatory neurons. Intriguingly, recent studies reported that p140Cap is present in the inhibitory presynaptic compartment and regulates GABAergic synaptogenesis and neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Russo et al., 2019</xref>), raising the possibility that endophilin A1 and p140Cap also coordinate to regulate the organization and activity of GABAergic synapses at the inhibitory presynaptic site. Remodeling of inhibitory synapses and dendritic spines are spatially clustered by sensory inputs in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, the turnover of inhibitory synapses outpace that of excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable that deficits in inhibitory synapses are much more severe in <italic>EEN1</italic> KO mice, leading to perturbation of the E/I balance and increased epileptic vulnerability.</p>

<title>GST-pull down, co-immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunoisolation</title>
<p>For GST-pull down assays, GST-fused protein EEN1 and its fragments were expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>. Myc-tagged GPN constructs were expressed in HEK293 cells for 48 h and lysates were prepared in a buffer (in mM: Tris-HCl 50, pH 7.4, NaCl 150, 1% NP-40, EDTA 2) plus protease inhibitors cocktail. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000× <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4°C and the supernatant was incubated with individual GST-fused proteins conjugated with Glutathione-Sepharose beads for overnight at 4°C. Beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting.</p>
<p>For co-IP from brain lysates, the whole brain from 8-10-week-old WT and KO mice were dissected and homogenized in the pre-chilled lysis buffer (in mM: Tris-HCl 20, pH 7.4, NaCl 150, 1% NP-40, EDTA 5) plus protease inhibitor cocktail, followed by incubation on ice for 15 min. The lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000× <italic>g</italic> for 15 min and the supernatant was collected and incubated with anti-EEN1 antibody (2 μg) or control IgG overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with 20 μL Dynabeads Protein A (ThermoFisher, 10007D for rabbit antibody) for 2 h at 4°C. After washing the beads with the same lysis buffer four times, the bound proteins were incubated 2× SDS sample buffer at 37°C for 10 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot with indicated antibodies.</p>
<p>For co-IP of proteins in HEK293T cells, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (in mM: 0.5% NP-40, Tris-HCl 50, pH 7.4, NaCl 150, EDTA 5) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates were then centrifuged at 16,000× <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4°C. Cell lysates were incubated with anti-Flag Affinity Gel (A2220, Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4°C on a roller mixer. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in lysis buffer and boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer, then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.</p>
<p>For immunoisolation of membrane proteins, hippocampi were homogenized with lysis buffer (in mM: Tris-HCl 20, pH 7.4, HEPES 10, pH 7.4, NaCl 150, sucrose 250, EDTA 0.5, pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 800× <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. The supernatants were collected and subjected to high-speed centrifugation at 100,000× <italic>g</italic> for 1 h (TLS-55 rotor, OptimaTMMAX Ultracentrifuge; Beckman Coulter, USA). The supernatants (S100) and pellets (P100, the membrane fraction) resuspended in lysis buffer were subjected to immunoisolation with Dynabeads Protein A (100-4D, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) coupled with 2 μg of rabbit anti-EEN1 or rabbit anti-GABA<sub>A</sub>R α1 antibody. Bound proteins were eluted by incubation with 2× SDS loading buffer at 37°C for 10 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.</p>

<title>PSD fractionation of brain lysates</title>
<p>PSD fractions from mouse brain were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). In brief, hippocampi were homogenized on ice with 20 strokes of a Teflon-glass homogenizer in 1 mL of HEPES-buffered sucrose (0.32 M sucrose, 4 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) containing freshly added protease inhibitors, then centrifuged at 800× <italic>g</italic> at 4°C to remove the pelleted nuclear fraction (P1). Supernatant (S1) was centrifuged at 10,000× <italic>g</italic> for 15 min to yield the crude synaptosomal pellet (P2) and the pellet was washed once in 1 mL HEPES-buffered sucrose. P2 was lysed by hypoosmotic shock in 900 μL ice-cold 4 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 plus protease inhibitors, homogenized by pipetting and rotating for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 25,000× <italic>g</italic> for 20 min to yield supernatant (S3, crude synaptic vesicle fraction) and pellet (P3, lysed synaptosomal membrane fraction). To prepare the PSD fraction, P3 was resuspended in 900 μL of ice-cold 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, plus protease inhibitors and 0.5% Triton X-100, rotated for 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 32,000× <italic>g</italic> for 20 min to obtain the PSD pellet. PSD pellets were resuspended in 50 μL ice-cold 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA plus protease inhibitors. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.</p>

<title>Protein identification with mass spectrometry and pathway analysis</title>
<p>For identification of EEN1-interacting proteins, mouse brain was homogenized with lysis buffer (in mM: Tris-HCl 20, pH 7.4, HEPES 10, pH 7.4, NaCl 150, EDTA 1, 1% NP-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000× <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. The supernatants were incubated with rabbit anti-EEN1 antibody overnight at 4°C. Beads were rinsed with lysis buffer for five times and bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the gels were reduced with 10 mM DTT at 37°C for 1 h, then alkylated with 25 mM iodoacetamide at RT for 1 h in the dark before digestion with trypsin (T1426, Sigma-Aldrich; enzyme-to-substrate ratio 1:50) in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 37°C overnight. Tryptic peptides were extracted from gel by sonication with a buffer containing 5% trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile. The liquid was dried by SpeedVac, and peptides were resolubilized in 0.1% formic acid and filtered with 0.45 μm centrifugal filters before analysis with a TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, Canada) coupled to an Eksigent nanoLC. Proteins were identified by searching the MS/MS spectra against the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> SwissProt database using the ProteinPilot 4.2 software. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as the fixed modification. Trypsin was specified as the proteolytic enzyme with a maximum of 2 miss cleavages. Mass tolerance was set to 0.05 Da and the false discovery rates for both proteins and peptides were set at 1%. For enrichment pathway analysis: Only proteins with intensity to IgG ratio of &gt; 1.5 were considered in the analysis. These genes were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment Analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfo.org/kobas">http://bioinfo.org/kobas</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>To knockout <italic>EEN1</italic> in the brain, <italic>EEN1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were injected with high-titer AAV stock carrying pAOV-CaMKIIα-mCherry-2A-Cre (AAV-mCherry-2A-Cre) (1∼5 × 10<sup>13</sup> IU/ml) in the hippocampal CA1 region within 24 h after birth. Newborn mice were anesthetized on ice for 4-5 min and then mounted in a custom ceramic mold to align the head along the X and Y axes, with lambda set as (X, Y) = (0, 0). The zero point of the Z axis was the position at which the injecting needle penetrated the skin. Approximately 10 nL of the viral solution was injected at each of the seven sites (coordinates in mm, [X, Y, Z] = [1.2, 1.2, 1.4/1.0/0.6] and [1.5, 1.0, 1.7/1.3/0.9/0.5]) targeting the hippocampus in each cerebral hemisphere using a microsyringe (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA, USA) and beveled glass injection pipette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). For the rescue experiment, P0 <italic>EEN1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were injected with a mixture of two high-titer AAV stocks: AAV-EGFP and AAV-mCherry or AAV-mCherry-2A-Cre; AAV-mCherry-2A-Cre and AAV-EGFP-2A-FLAG-EEN1, AAV-EGFP-2A-FLAG-EEN1 Y343A or AAV-EGFP-2A-FLAG-EEN1 KKK-EEE. Approximately 20 nL of the viral solution was injected at each of the seven sites. The injected pups were returned to the home cage and used for recording 2 weeks later.</p>
<p>To prepare acute brain slices for electrophysiological analyses, mice were anesthetized with tribromoethanol (330-390 mg/kg) (T48402, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and decapitated. Whole brains were removed promptly and placed in ice-cold oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) low-Ca<sup>2+</sup>/high-Mg<sup>2+</sup> high-sucrose cutting solution (in mM: KCl 2.5, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.25, glucose 10, sucrose 210, Na-Ascorbate 1.3, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 7). Coronal 300 μm slices were obtained using a vibrating tissue slicer (Leica VT1200S; Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Deutschland). Slices were immediately transferred to standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (in mM: NaCl 119, KCl 2.5, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 1.3, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2.5, glucose 11, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 26.2, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1, pH 7.3-7.4) at 33°C and continuously bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After 30 min of incubation, slices were transferred to a recording chamber with the same extracellular buffer at room temperature (RT, ∼25°C).</p>
<p>For whole-cell patch clamp recordings, brain slices were continuously perfused with standard ACSF at RT under visual control with differential interference contrast illumination on an upright microscope (BX51WI, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a 40× water-immersion objective and a digital camera. The mCherry-and/or EGFP-positive hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons were identified by an epifluorescence microscope (pE-300, CoolLED Ltd, Andover, UK). Whole-cell recordings were performed on an AAV-infected neuron and a neighboring uninfected neuron. Patch clamp data were obtained using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA), and signals were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz using an Axon Digidata 1550B analog-to-digital board (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA).</p>
<p>To analyze evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs), evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs), and paired-pause ratio, cells were recorded with 3-7 MΩ borosilicate glass patch pipettes filled with the intracellular solution (in mM: CsMeSO<sub>3</sub> 135, HEPES 10, EGTA 1, QX-314 3.3, MgATP 4, NaGTP 0.3, and Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine 8, pH 7.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Horn and Nicoll, 2018</xref>), following stimulation of Schaffer collaterals with a bipolar stimulation electrode placed in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region. EPSCs were measured at a holding potential of –70 mV, and IPSCs were recorded at +10 mV. Paired-pulse ratios of EPSCs were measured at a holding potential of –70 mV by applying two electrical stimulations at a 50 ms interval and calculating the ratio of the peak amplitudes. Paired-pulse ratios of IPSCs were measured at a holding potential of +10 mV by applying two electrical stimulations at a 200 ms interval and calculating the ratio of the peak amplitudes. E/I ratios were measured by applying the same stimulation current and then calculating the ratio of the absolute values of the peak amplitudes of EPSCs and IPSCs. The miniature EPSCs and IPSCs were measured in the ACSF bath solution containing 1 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX, MSS0002, BGB Analytik AG, BL, Switzerland) at –70 mV and +10 mV, respectively, in the voltage-clamp mode. Data were collected and analyzed using the pClamp 10.6 software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA).</p>
<p>All electrophysiological recordings were carried out blindly and all n numbers in the data figures indicate the number of recorded neurons. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich except otherwise noted.</p>

<title>Confocal and three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) image acquisition and analysis</title>
<p>Confocal images were collected using the Spectral Imaging Confocal Microscope Digital Eclipse C1Si (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with a 100× Plan Apochromat VC (NA 1.40) oil objective (4× optical zoom). Images were z projections of images taken at 0.25-μm step intervals. The number of planes, typically 5-7, was chosen to cover the entire dendrite from top to bottom. Images were captured using a 1024×1024 pixels screen for neuronal cells. Laser power, digital gain, and offset settings were identical in each experiment. Images were processed with the NIH ImageJ software and exported into Adobe Photoshop. Only brightness and contrast were adjusted for the whole frame, and no part of a frame was enhanced or modified in any way. Control and experimental group neurons which were to be directly compared were imaged with the same acquisition parameters.</p>
<p>For 3D-SIM, secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 were used and images were captured as described by Niu et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Niu et al., 2017</xref>) on the DeltaVision OMX V4 imaging system (Applied Precision Inc, USA) with a 100× 1.4 oil objective (Olympus UPlanSApo), solid state multimode lasers (488, 593 and 642 nm) and electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras (Evolve 512× 512, Photometrics, USA). Serial Z-stack sectioning was done at 125 nm intervals. The microscope is routinely calibrated with 100 nm fluorescent spheres to calculate both the lateral and axial limits of image resolution. SIM image stacks were reconstructed using softWoRx 5.0 (Applied Precision) with the following settings: pixel size 39.5 nm; channel-specific optical transfer functions; Wiener filter 0.001000; discard Negative Intensities background; drift correction with respect to first angle; custom K0 guess angles for camera positions. Pixel registration was corrected to be less than 1 pixel for all channels using 100 nm Tetraspeck beads. Three dimensional images were reconstructed from z stacks. For clarity of display, small linear changes of brightness and contrast were performed on three-dimensional reconstructions.</p>
<p>For quantitative analysis of immunofluorescent signals in neurons, maximal projection images were created with the ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net">https://imagej.net</ext-link>.) from 6-7 serial optical sections. Background was subtracted by using the “subtract background” function and the background level was held identical for all cells within each experiment. To examine the number and fluorescence intensity of signal puncta in soma or dendrites, the EGFP-or DsRed-labeled soma or dendrites were outlined automatically by using the “Wand Tool” function. The region of interest (ROI) in cultured neurons was defined along a segment of the dendrite according to the fluorescence signal distinguished from the background. Average values of fluorescence intensities in ROI (the total fluorescent intensity divided by the total area of a dendritic segment) were calculated by Analyze &gt; measure. Gephyrin clusters were thresholded and confirmed visually to select appropriate clusters following a minimal size cut-off by using the “Analyze Particles” plugin of the ImageJ software. For colocalization quantifications, NIS-Elements Software was used as follows: region of interest (ROI) of dendritic segments was manually chosen, and thresholded using the “Threshold” function to remove background signals. Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Manders overlap coefficient were analyzed by using the “Analyze Control &gt; colocalization” function.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>For all biochemical, cell biological and electrophysiological recordings, at least three independent experiments were performed (independent cultures, transfections or different mice). Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Data sets were tested for normality and direct comparisons between two groups were made using two-tailed Student’s t test (t test, for normally distributed data) as indicated. To evaluate statistical significance of three or more groups of samples, one-way analysis of variance with a Tukey test was used. The statistical significance was defined as * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001, respectively. All data are presented as mean ± S.E.M.</p>

<p>This study presents a <bold>valuable</bold> finding on the molecular mechanisms that govern GABAergic inhibitory synapse function. The authors propose that Endophilin A1 serves as a novel regulator of GABAergic synapses by acting as a component of the inhibitory postsynaptic density. Although the study employs a variety of approaches to address this question, the current analysis is <bold>incomplete</bold> and requires further experiments to substantiate the claims fully. The findings are likely to interest a broad audience of scientists focusing on inhibitory synaptic transmission, the excitation-inhibition balance, and its disruption in disorders such as epilepsy.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the present study, Chen et al. investigate the role of Endophilin A1 in regulating GABAergic synapse formation and function. To this end, the authors use constitutive or conditional knockout of Endophilin A1 (EEN1) to assess the consequences on GABAergic synapse composition and function, as well as the outcome for PTZ-induced seizure susceptibility. The authors show that EEN1 KO mice show a higher susceptibility to PTZ-induced seizures, accompanied by a reduction in the GABAergic synaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin as well as specific GABAAR subunits and eIPSCs. The authors then investigate the underlying mechanisms, demonstrating that Endophilin A1 binds directly to gephyrin and GABAAR subunits, and identifying the subdomains of Endophilin A1 that contribute to this effect. Overall, the authors state that their study places Endophilin A1 as a new regulator of GABAergic synapse function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the topic of this manuscript is very timely, since there has been substantial recent interest in describing the mechanisms governing inhibitory synaptic transmission at GABAergic synapses. The study will therefore be of interest to a wide audience of neuroscientists studying synaptic transmission and its role in disease. The manuscript is well-written and contains a substantial quantity of data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A number of questions remain to be answered in order to be able to fully evaluate the quality and conclusions of the study. In particular, a key concern throughout the manuscript regards the way that the number of samples for statistical analysis is defined, which may affect the validity of the data analysed. Addressing this weakness will be essential to providing conclusive results that support the authors' claims.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The function of neural circuits relies heavily on the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Particularly, inhibitory inputs are understudied when compared to their excitatory counterparts due to the diversity of inhibitory neurons, their synaptic molecular heterogeneity, and their elusive signature. Thus, insights into these aspects of inhibitory inputs can inform us largely on the functions of neural circuits and the brain.</p>
<p>Endophilin A1, an endocytic protein heavily expressed in neurons, has been implicated in numerous pre- and postsynaptic functions, however largely at excitatory synapses. Thus, whether this crucial protein plays any role in inhibitory synapse, and whether this regulates functions at the synaptic, circuit, or brain level remains to be determined.</p>
<p>New Findings:</p>
<p>(1) Endophilin A1 interacts with the postsynaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin at inhibitory postsynaptic densities within excitatory neurons.</p>
<p>(2) Endophilin A1 promotes the organization of the inhibitory postsynaptic density and the subsequent recruitment/stabilization of GABA A receptors via Endophilin A1's membrane binding and actin polymerization activities.</p>
<p>(3) Loss of Endophilin A1 in CA1 mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons weakens inhibitory input and leads to susceptibility to epilepsy.</p>
<p>(4) Thus the authors propose that via its role as a component of the inhibitory postsynaptic density within excitatory neurons, Endophilin A1 supports the organization, stability, and efficacy of inhibitory input to maintain the excitatory/inhibitory balance critical for brain function.</p>
<p>(5) The conclusion of the manuscript is well supported by the data but will be strengthened by addressing our list of concerns and experiment suggestions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Technical concerns:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 1F and Figure 1H, Figures 7H,J:</p>
<p>
Can the authors justify using a paired-pulse interval of 50 ms for eEPSCs and an interval of 200 ms for eIPSCs? Otherwise, experiments should be repeated using the same paired pulse interval.</p>
<p>(2) Figures 3G,H,I:</p>
<p>
While 3D representations of proteins of interest bolster claims made by superresolution microscopy, SIM resolution is unreliable when deciphering the localization of proteins at the subsynaptic level given the small size of these structures (&lt;1 micrometer). In order to determine the actual location of Endophilin A1, especially given the known presynaptic localization of this protein, the authors should complete SIM experiments with a presynaptic marker, perhaps an active zone protein, so that the relative localization of Endophilin A1 can be gleaned. Currently, overlapping signals could stem from the presynapse given the poor resolution of SIM in this context.</p>
<p>Manuscript consistency:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 2:</p>
<p>
The authors looked at VGAT and noticed a reduction of signals in hippocampal regions in their P21 slices, indicating that the proposed postsynaptic organization/stabilization functions of Endophilin A1 extend to the inhibitory presynapse, perhaps via Neuroligin 2-Neurexin. Simultaneously, hippocampal regions in P21 slices showed a reduction in PSD-95 signals, indicating that excitatory synapses are also affected. It would be crucial to also look at excitatory presynapses, via VGLUT staining, to assess whether EndoA1 -/- also affects presynapses. Given the extensive roles of Endophilin A1 in presynapses, especially in excitatory presynapses, this should be investigated.</p>
<p>(2) Figure 7C:</p>
<p>
The authors do not assess whether p140Cap overexpression rescues GABAAR receptor loss exhibited in Endophilin A1 KO, as they did for Gephryin. This would be an important data point to show, as p140Cap may somehow rescue receptor loss by another pathway. In fact, it is mentioned in the text that this experiment was done, &quot;Consistently, neither p140Cap nor the endophilin A1 loss-of-function mutants could rescue the GABAAR clustering phenotype in EEN1 KO neurons (Figure 7C, D)&quot; yet the data for p140Cap overexpression seem to be missing. This should be remedied.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Chen et al. identify endophilin A1 as a novel component of the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold. Their data show impaired evoked inhibitory synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons of mice lacking endophilin A1, and an increased susceptibility to seizures. Endophilin can interact with the postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin and promote assembly of the inhibitory postsynaptic element. Endophilin A1 is known to play a role in presynaptic terminals and in dendritic spines, but a role for endophilin A1 at inhibitory postsynaptic densities has not yet been described.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors used a broad array of experimental approaches to investigate this, including tests of seizure susceptibility, electrophysiology, biochemistry, neuronal culture, and image analysis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Many results are difficult to interpret, and the data quality is not always convincing, unfortunately. The basic premise of the study, that gephyrin and endophilin A1 interact, requires a more robust analysis to be convincing.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the present study, Chen et al. investigate the role of Endophilin A1 in regulating GABAergic synapse formation and function. To this end, the authors use constitutive or conditional knockout of Endophilin A1 (EEN1) to assess the consequences on GABAergic synapse composition and function, as well as the outcome for PTZ-induced seizure susceptibility. The authors show that EEN1 KO mice show a higher susceptibility to PTZ-induced seizures, accompanied by a reduction in the GABAergic synaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin as well as specific GABAAR subunits and eIPSCs. The authors then investigate the underlying mechanisms, demonstrating that Endophilin A1 binds directly to gephyrin and GABAAR subunits, and identifying the subdomains of Endophilin A1 that contribute to this effect. Overall, the authors state that their study places Endophilin A1 as a new regulator of GABAergic synapse function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the topic of this manuscript is very timely, since there has been substantial recent interest in describing the mechanisms governing inhibitory synaptic transmission at GABAergic synapses. The study will therefore be of interest to a wide audience of neuroscientists studying synaptic transmission and its role in disease. The manuscript is well-written and contains a substantial quantity of data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A number of questions remain to be answered in order to be able to fully evaluate the quality and conclusions of the study. In particular, a key concern throughout the manuscript regards the way that the number of samples for statistical analysis is defined, which may affect the validity of the data analysed. Addressing this weakness will be essential to providing conclusive results that support the authors' claims.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for appreciation of the value of our study and careful critics to help us improve the manuscript. We will correct the way that the number of samples for statistical analysis is defined throughout the manuscript as suggested and update figures, figure legends, and Materials and Methods accordingly. For example, we will average the values for all dendritic segments from one neuron, so that each data point represents one neuron in the graphs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The function of neural circuits relies heavily on the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Particularly, inhibitory inputs are understudied when compared to their excitatory counterparts due to the diversity of inhibitory neurons, their synaptic molecular heterogeneity, and their elusive signature. Thus, insights into these aspects of inhibitory inputs can inform us largely on the functions of neural circuits and the brain.</p>
<p>Endophilin A1, an endocytic protein heavily expressed in neurons, has been implicated in numerous pre- and postsynaptic functions, however largely at excitatory synapses. Thus, whether this crucial protein plays any role in inhibitory synapse, and whether this regulates functions at the synaptic, circuit, or brain level remains to be determined.</p>
<p>New Findings:</p>
<p>(1) Endophilin A1 interacts with the postsynaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin at inhibitory postsynaptic densities within excitatory neurons.</p>
<p>(2) Endophilin A1 promotes the organization of the inhibitory postsynaptic density and the subsequent recruitment/stabilization of GABA A receptors via Endophilin A1's membrane binding and actin polymerization activities.</p>
<p>(3) Loss of Endophilin A1 in CA1 mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons weakens inhibitory input and leads to susceptibility to epilepsy.</p>
<p>(4) Thus the authors propose that via its role as a component of the inhibitory postsynaptic density within excitatory neurons, Endophilin A1 supports the organization, stability, and efficacy of inhibitory input to maintain the excitatory/inhibitory balance critical for brain function.</p>
<p>(5) The conclusion of the manuscript is well supported by the data but will be strengthened by addressing our list of concerns and experiment suggestions.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Technical concerns:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 1F and Figure 1H, Figures 7H,J:</p>
<p>Can the authors justify using a paired-pulse interval of 50 ms for eEPSCs and an interval of 200 ms for eIPSCs? Otherwise, experiments should be repeated using the same paired pulse interval.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion. As illustrated by the schematic current traces, the decay time constants of eEPSCs and eIPSCs in hippocampal CA1 neurons are different. The eEPSCs exhibit a faster channel closing rate, corresponding to a smaller time constant Tau. Thus, a shorter inter-stimulus interval (50 ms) was chosen for paired-pulse ratio recordings. In contrast, the eIPSCs display a slower channel closing rate, with a Tau value larger than that of eEPSCs, so a longer inter-stimulus interval (200 ms) was used for PPR. This protocol has been long-established and adopted in previous studies (please see below for examples).</p>

<p>(2) Figures 3G,H,I:</p>
<p>While 3D representations of proteins of interest bolster claims made by superresolution microscopy, SIM resolution is unreliable when deciphering the localization of proteins at the subsynaptic level given the small size of these structures (&lt;1 micrometer). In order to determine the actual location of Endophilin A1, especially given the known presynaptic localization of this protein, the authors should complete SIM experiments with a presynaptic marker, perhaps an active zone protein, so that the relative localization of Endophilin A1 can be gleaned. Currently, overlapping signals could stem from the presynapse given the poor resolution of SIM in this context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestions. It is certainly preferable to investigate the relative localization of endophilin A1 using both presynaptic and postsynaptic markers. For SIM imaging in Figure 3G-I, to visualize neuronal morphology, we immunostained GFP as cell fill, leaving two other channels for detection of immunofluorescent signals of endophilin A1 and another protein. We will try co-immunostaining of endophilin A1, the active zone protein bassoon (presynaptic marker) and gephyrin without morphology labeling. Alternatively, we will do co-staining of endophilin A1 and bassoon in GFP-expressing neurons. We agree that overlapping signals or proximal localization of presynaptic endophilin A1 with gephyrin or GABAAR γ2 could not be ruled out. To note, if image resolution is improved with the use of a more advanced imaging system, the overlap between two proteins will become smaller or even disappear. With the ~110 nm lateral resolution of SIM microscopy, the degree of overlap between the two proteins of interest is much lower than in confocal microscopy. Given the presynaptic localization of endophilin, most likely we will observe a small overlap (presynatpic) or proximal localization (postsynaptic) of endophilin A1 with bassoon. Nevertheless, we will complete the SIM experiments as suggested to improve the manuscript.</p>

<p>Manuscript consistency:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 2:</p>
<p>The authors looked at VGAT and noticed a reduction of signals in hippocampal regions in their P21 slices, indicating that the proposed postsynaptic organization/stabilization functions of Endophilin A1 extend to the inhibitory presynapse, perhaps via Neuroligin 2-Neurexin. Simultaneously, hippocampal regions in P21 slices showed a reduction in PSD-95 signals, indicating that excitatory synapses are also affected. It would be crucial to also look at excitatory presynapses, via VGLUT staining, to assess whether EndoA1 -/- also affects presynapses. Given the extensive roles of Endophilin A1 in presynapses, especially in excitatory presynapses, this should be investigated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the thoughtful comments. Given that the both VGAT and PSD95 signals are reduced in hippocampal regions in P21 slices, it is conceivable that the proposed postsynaptic organization/stabilization functions of endophilin A1 extend to the inhibitory presynapse via Neuroligin-2-Neurexin and the excitatory presynapse as well during development. Of note, endophilin A1 knockout did not impair the distribution of Neuroligin-2 in inhibitory postsynapses (immunoisolated with anti-GABAAR α1) in mature mice (Figure 3K), and endophilin A1 did not bind to Neuroligin-2 (Figure 4D), suggesting that endophilin A1 might function via other mechanisms. Nevertheless, as functions of endophilin A family members at the presynaptic site are well-established, the reduction of presynaptic signals in developmental hippocampal regions of <italic>EndoA-/-</italic> mice might result from the depletion of presynaptic endophilin A1. The presynaptic deficits can be compensatory by other mechanisms as neurons mature. Certainly, we will do VGLUT staining of <italic>EndoA1-/-</italic> brain slices as suggested to assess the role of endophilin A1 in excitatory presynapses in vivo.</p>

<p>(2) Figure 7C:</p>
<p>The authors do not assess whether p140Cap overexpression rescues GABAAR receptor loss exhibited in Endophilin A1 KO, as they did for Gephryin. This would be an important data point to show, as p140Cap may somehow rescue receptor loss by another pathway. In fact, it is mentioned in the text that this experiment was done, &quot;Consistently, neither p140Cap nor the endophilin A1 loss-of-function mutants could rescue the GABAAR clustering phenotype in EEN1 KO neurons (Figure 7C, D)&quot; yet the data for p140Cap overexpression seem to be missing. This should be remedied.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks a lot for the thoughtful comment. We will determine whether p140Cap overexpression also rescues the GABAAR clustering phenotype in EndoA1-/- neurons by surface GABAAR γ2 staining in our revised manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Chen et al. identify endophilin A1 as a novel component of the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold. Their data show impaired evoked inhibitory synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons of mice lacking endophilin A1, and an increased susceptibility to seizures. Endophilin can interact with the postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin and promote assembly of the inhibitory postsynaptic element. Endophilin A1 is known to play a role in presynaptic terminals and in dendritic spines, but a role for endophilin A1 at inhibitory postsynaptic densities has not yet been described.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors used a broad array of experimental approaches to investigate this, including tests of seizure susceptibility, electrophysiology, biochemistry, neuronal culture, and image analysis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Many results are difficult to interpret, and the data quality is not always convincing, unfortunately. The basic premise of the study, that gephyrin and endophilin A1 interact, requires a more robust analysis to be convincing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the positive comment on our study and the very valuable feedback for us to improve the manuscript. We will conduct additional experiments to improve our data quality and strengthen our evidences according to these great constructive suggestions. To gain strong evidence for the interaction between endophilin A1 and gephyrin, we will perform in vitro pull-down assay with recombinant proteins from bacterial expression system.</p>
