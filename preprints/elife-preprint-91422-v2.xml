<title>Abstract</title><p>The Notch signaling pathway uses families of ligands and receptors to transmit signals to nearby cells. These components are expressed in diverse combinations in different cell types, interact in a many-to-many fashion, both within the same cell (in cis) and between cells (in trans), and their interactions are modulated by Fringe glycosyltransferases. A fundamental question is how the strength of Notch signaling depends on which pathway components are expressed, at what levels, and in which cells. Here, we used a quantitative, bottom-up, cell-based approach to systematically characterize trans-activation, cis-inhibition, and cis-activation signaling efficiencies across a range of ligand and Fringe expression levels in two mammalian cell types. Each ligand (Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, and Jag2) and receptor variant (Notch1 and Notch2) analyzed here exhibited a unique profile of interactions, Fringe-dependence, and signaling outcomes. All four ligands were able to bind receptors in cis and in trans, and all ligands trans-activated both receptors, although Jag1-Notch1 signaling was substantially weaker than other ligand-receptor combinations. Cis-interactions were predominantly inhibitory, with the exception of the Dll1-and Dll4-Notch2 pairs, which exhibited cis-activation stronger than trans-activation. Lfng strengthened Delta-mediated trans-activation and weakened Jagged-mediated trans-activation for both receptors. Finally, cis-ligands showed diverse cis-inhibition strengths, which depended on the identity of the trans-ligand as well as the receptor. The map of receptor-ligand-Fringe interaction outcomes revealed here should help guide rational perturbation and control of the Notch pathway.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Notch signaling pathway controls stem cell differentiation and proliferation, plays key roles in numerous diseases, and represents a major drug target. It uses multiple membrane-bound ligands and receptors that interact with one another in a many-to-many fashion, as well as Fringe glycosyltransferases (Fringes) that modulate those interactions. In mammals, the Notch pathway consists of four receptors (Notch1-4), four canonical activating ligands (Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, and Jag2), at least one predominantly inhibitory ligand (Dll3), and non-canonical ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">D’Souza et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Falix et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fiddes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gera and Dighe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ladi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Serth et al., 2015</xref>). Ligands and receptors interact both within the same cell (in cis) and between adjacent cells (in trans). Either configuration has the potential to activate or inhibit signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">del Álamo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nandagopal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>). The level of signaling in a Notch-expressing cell generally depends on which ligand, receptor, and Fringe variants are expressed in the cell and its neighbors. These components are expressed in various combinations in different cell types, often including coexpression of ligands, receptors and at least one Fringe enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Granados et al., 2022</xref>). However, it remains difficult to predict signaling strength—how strongly a given cell will signal to another cell—based on the expression profiles of Notch pathway components. It similarly remains challenging to rationally and predictably perturb signaling for therapeutic and tissue engineering purposes.</p>
<p>Transcriptional responses are sensitive to the amplitude and duration of Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Falo-Sanjuan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kuang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Nandagopal et al., 2018</xref>). In the canonical trans-activation mechanism, binding of ligands on one cell to receptors on an adjacent cell triggers ligand endocytosis, which generates mechanical strain on the receptor, exposing a metalloproteinase recognition site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Langridge and Struhl, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lovendahl et al., 2018</xref>). S2 cleavage by ADAM10 results in shedding of the receptor extracellular domain (NECD) and permits a subsequent S3 cleavage by γ-secretase to release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The free NICD directly translocates into the nucleus and binds cofactors MAML and RBPjκ to activate target genes. Downstream target genes respond similarly to NICD originating from the Notch1 or Notch2 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kraman and McCright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Liu et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">2013</xref>). However, they respond differently to distinct concentrations of NICD. In pancreatic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Ninov et al., 2012</xref>) and central nervous system (CNS) stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Guentchev and McKay, 2006</xref>), complete Notch inhibition permitted differentiation, low levels of NICD promoted proliferation, and higher levels induced quiescence. Notch signaling amplitude can also influence the timing of developmental transitions, with higher NICD concentrations activating master transcription factors earlier than lower concentrations, depending on the target’s enhancer architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Falo-Sanjuan et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The Notch pathway provides numerous ways to tune signaling amplitude. Fringe enzymes can alter receptor-ligand binding and activation strengths, sometimes in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kakuda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kakuda and Haltiwanger, 2017</xref>). Upregulating expression of a ligand can suppress Notch signaling cell-autonomously, through a process termed cis-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Becam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fiuza et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Thambyrajah et al., 2024</xref>), or trans-activate receptors on neighboring cells. In some cases, ligands can also activate signaling by receptors in the same cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nandagopal et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, growing evidence suggests that some ligands can inhibit signaling intercellularly (“trans-inhibition”) by binding receptors strongly without activating them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Golson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Luna-Escalante et al., 2018</xref>), as may be the case for Jag1 and Lunatic Fringe (Lfng)-modified Notch1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kakuda and Haltiwanger, 2017</xref>). Thus, the Notch pathway architecture allows for receptor-ligand interactions to result in either activation or inhibition of signaling, in either cis or trans. However, for the majority of possible receptor-ligand interaction pairs, the relative activation and inhibition strengths have not been measured in both cis and trans orientations, making it difficult to predict signaling outcomes in natural contexts and in applications such as tissue engineering.</p>
<p>Here, to address these challenges, we developed a set of engineered cell lines and coculture reporter assays that allow systematic characterization of trans-activation, cis-inhibition, and cis-activation efficiencies across a range of cis-ligand and Fringe expression levels. We focused on interactions among four ligands—Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, and Jag2—with two receptors—Notch1 and Notch2—and their modulation by Lfng. We verified that key features are consistent between two distinct cell lines: Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts. Each receptor and ligand had a unique profile of Lfng-dependent cis- and trans-interactions with other components. In trans, all ligands were capable of activating Notch1 and Notch2. However, Jag1 trans-activated Notch1 inefficiently, despite the strong Notch1-activating ability of recombinant Jag1 fragments. In cis, with competition from trans-activating ligands, Dll1 and Dll4 inhibited Notch1 and further activated Notch2 signaling, while Jagged ligands cis-inhibited both receptors. Lfng modulated most receptor-ligand interactions. It increased Jag1’s inhibitory potential by strengthening binding but weakening activation of Notch1, as seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kakuda and Haltiwanger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, Lfng potentiated trans-activation for Delta-Notch combinations, but attenuated Jagged-Notch signaling. It also had diverse receptor- and ligand-specific effects on cis-activation, which in general differed from those on trans-activation for Notch2 but not for Notch1. Together, this map of relative cis and trans receptor-ligand-Fringe interactions should be useful to explain Notch signaling behaviors in diverse developmental and physiological contexts, and guide more rational, targeted perturbation of Notch signaling activity.</p>

<title>Engineered “receiver” and “sender” cell lines enable quantitative comparison of receptor-ligand-Fringe interactions</title>
<p>To systematically analyze pairwise cis and trans receptor-ligand interactions, and their dependence on Fringe enzyme expression, we engineered a set of over 50 different stable cell lines (Supplementary Table 1). Collectively, they provide quantitative readouts of Notch signaling activity, receptor level, and ligand level. They also enable precise modulation of ligand expression. As a base cell line, we used CHO-K1 cells, which exhibit negligible endogenous expression levels of Notch receptors and ligands, and no endogenous Notch signaling activity (Supplementary Table 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Singh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>). In this background, we constructed three types of cell lines, described below.</p>
<p>First, to read out Notch signaling, we created monoclonal “receiver” cells, similar to those described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">LeBon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nandagopal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). These cells expressed a chimeric human Notch receptor, whose intracellular domain was replaced with a minimal Gal4 transcription factor (“Gal4esn”, henceforth denoted Gal4). This coding sequence was followed by H2B-mTurq2, with an intervening ribosomal skipping T2A sequence, for cotranslational readout of receptor expression. This construct was stably integrated in the host cell genome using piggyBac transposition (Methods). Expression of the cotranslational mTurq2 reporter was broadly comparable between different receiver clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1A">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and correlated with surface receptor expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1B">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The cells also contained an insulated UAS promoter driving expression of H2B-mCitrine, such that mCitrine production reflects Notch activity.</p>

Receptor activation releases Gal4, which activates expression of a stably integrated UAS-H2B-mCitrine reporter (yellow). Some strains also contained a stably integrated ligand and reporter (second cartoon). These sender cell lines were constructed by integrating plasmids containing each of the four activating ligands fused to 2xFLAG, followed by T2A-H2B-mCherry for co-translational readout of ligand expression, either under Tet-OFF control (to allow induction by 4-epiTc) or expressed from the constitutive CBh promoter.</p><p>(<bold>B</bold>) Example distributions of Tet-OFF inducible ligand expression in CHO-K1 cells, read out by fluorescence of a cotranslational H2B-mCherry (A.U.).

<p>Second, to analyze same-cell (cis) ligand-receptor interactions, we used lentivirus to stably integrate each of the four activating human Notch ligands (Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, Jag2) into the receiver cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). All ligand constructs contained a T2A co-translational H2B-mCherry reporter for readout of expression. Ligand expression was controlled by the Tet-OFF system, allowing the use of the doxycycline analog 4-epi-tetracycline (4-epi-Tc) to titrate ligand levels. In these lines, varying the concentration of 4-epi-Tc tuned expression unimodally across two orders of magnitude (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1B" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To control for non-specific effects of ligand overexpression, we also constructed parallel negative control cell lines expressing H2B-mCherry or human nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR)-T2A-H2B-mCherry constructs in place of ligands. NGFR has been used in other Notch studies as a surface-detectable coexpression reporter or marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Del Real and Rothenberg, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Romero-Wolf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sakata-Yanagimoto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Taghon et al., 2009</xref>). These cell lines enabled control and readout of cis-ligand levels.</p>
<p>Third, we engineered a repertoire of “sender” cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). One set of these cell lines enabled inducible expression of each of the four ligands under control of the Tet-OFF system (<xref rid="figs1C" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, Methods). These lines allowed control of ligand expression in cells without Notch receptors. A second set provided constitutive expression of each ligand at a variety of different levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Because cotranslational protein abundance is limited as a proxy for surface protein, this study focuses primarily on the relationship between signaling activity and the total amount of translated receptor or ligand. However, we note that high signaling activity need not, in general, directly correlate with surface expression levels; for example, factors such as vimentin decrease basal surface of Jag1 but increase its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Antfolk et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>To limit combinatorial complexity, we focused on two essential receptors, Notch1 and Notch2, four canonical activating ligands (Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, and Jag2), and one Fringe (Lfng). We omitted Notch3, since Notch3 knockout mice are viable with minor vascular defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kitamoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Krebs et al., 2003</xref>), and because Notch3 receptors are hypersensitive to activation during cell passaging, yielding elevated background signaling. We also omitted Notch4, which has no knockout phenotype in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Krebs et al., 2000</xref>), does not appear to activate in coculture with ligand-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Groot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">James et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lafkas et al., 2015</xref>), and has been suggested to inhibit Notch1 activation in cis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">James et al., 2014</xref>). Among the best-studied ligands, we omitted Dll3, which is essential and believed to be purely cis-inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bochter et al., 2022</xref>). Finally, we focused on Lunatic Fringe (Lfng), which we perturbed using siRNAs and transient plasmid transfection, because it is the only Fringe enzyme that is essential in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Evrard et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Moran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>), and its effects dominate over those of Radical and Manic Fringe (Rfng and Mfng, respectively) when coexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Pennarubia et al., 2021</xref>).

<title>Trans-activation strength depends on ligand and receptor identity, and is modulated by Lfng</title>
<p>A fundamental question about the Notch system is how signaling strength depends on the identity of the interacting ligand and receptor, and expression of Fringe enzymes. Previous investigations reached conflicting conclusions about how strongly and even in what direction Fringes affect different ligand-receptor interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kakuda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Shimizu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). They also focused on only a subset of essential ligand-receptor combinations, omitted analysis of Fringe dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tveriakhina et al., 2018</xref>), and in some cases used plate-bound ligands rather than ligands expressed by cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kakuda et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>To address these gaps, we used a trans-activation assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) to systematically measure trans-signaling across all 8 receptor-ligand combinations, under controlled Fringe expression conditions (Methods). We first suppressed endogenous Rfng and Lfng expression via siRNA knockdown in receiver cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref rid="figs4A" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>; Supplementary Table 2). Approximately 16 hours later, we removed siRNAs and transfected plasmids encoding wild-type mouse Lfng or, as a negative control, a catalytically inactive mutant Lfng (D289E, denoted “dLfng”) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Luther et al., 2009</xref>). We also co-transfected a plasmid expressing infrared fluorescent protein (IFP2) as a transfection marker. After recovering for 16-20 hours post-transfection, we cocultured these receiver cells with an excess of sender cells, previously sorted into bins of stable ligand expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Finally, after 22-24 hours of coculture, we measured Notch activity in receivers by flow cytometry, gating on mTurq2, the reporter of Notch expression, to separate senders and receivers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), and gating on IFP2 to enrich for Fringe plasmid-transfected cells (Methods, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref rid="figs4B" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>To quantify signaling, we first defined signaling activity as reporter fluorescence (mCitrine) normalized by receptor expression, as read out by mTurq2 fluorescence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs5A" ref-type="fig">Figure 1— figure supplement 5</xref>). To control for variation in ligand expression across sender populations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), we further normalized this signaling activity by ligand expression, read out by a distinct co-translational fluorescent protein (mCherry) (<xref rid="figs2A" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), similar to an approach used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tveriakhina et al., 2018</xref>). The resulting receptor- and ligand-normalized signaling strengths varied widely across the 16 Notch-ligand-Fringe combinations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs2A" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Comparing signaling between the two receptors revealed two key features of trans-signaling: First, almost all ligands signaled more strongly to Notch2 than to Notch1, regardless of Fringe expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The exception was Dll4, which signaled more strongly to Notch1 than Notch2 in the dLfng condition, but activated Notch1 and Notch2 to similar levels with Lfng. Second, Notch1 and Notch2 responded in a qualitatively similar way to Lfng, as can be seen by plotting signaling strengths for the Lfng condition versus those for dLfng (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">C</xref>). Lfng significantly enhanced Notch1 and Notch2 trans-activation by both Dll1 and Dll4. Its greatest effect was on Dll1-Notch1 (3-fold increase) followed by Dll4-Notch2 (2.5-fold increase). Lfng significantly decreased trans-activation of both receptors by Jag1 (&gt;2.5-fold) and, to a lesser extent, Jag2 (∼1.4-fold). (Note that while Jag1-Notch1 signaling was low, it was still possible to detect further reductions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).) Thus, the two receptors differed in their responses to the four ligands but responded similarly to Lfng, which strengthened Delta-mediated trans-activation and weakened Jagged-mediated trans-activation for both receptors.</p>
<p>Next, we focused on the difference in trans-activation by Dll1 and Dll4 in the two Fringe conditions. In the absence of Fringe expression (i.e., with dLfng), Dll1-Notch1 signaling strength was only slightly above background (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). By contrast, Dll4 activated Notch1 9-fold more strongly than Dll1 in the dLfng condition, consistent with previous results from E14TG2a mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tveriakhina et al., 2018</xref>), possibly reflecting the ∼10-fold greater binding affinity of Notch1 to the Dll4 extracellular domain (ECD), compared to the Dll1 ECD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrawes et al., 2013</xref>). Lfng expression increased Dll1 signaling more than Dll4, reducing the difference in signaling strengths between the ligands to 2.7-fold (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). With Notch2, Dll1 signaling exceeded Dll4 signaling, with or without Lfng.</p>
<p>Similar to the Delta ligands, the Jagged ligands also showed diverse signaling activities. Strikingly, Jag1 activated Notch1 poorly in both the dLfng and Lfng conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). This lack of signaling was not due to a defect in the ligand, which was properly trafficked to the cell surface (<xref rid="figs2B" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and which signaled to Notch2 at levels comparable to those of Dll1 in the dLfng condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to Jag1, Jag2 was the strongest trans-activating ligand for both receptors with dLfng, and remained among the strongest with Lfng. Taken together, these results establish unique patterns of activity for the four ligands across different receptor and Fringe contexts.</p>
<p>In addition to signaling strength, another key feature of signaling is ultrasensitivity, which plays a pivotal role in developmental patterning circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gozlan and Sprinzak, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Sprinzak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Yasugi and Sato, 2022</xref>). Ultrasensitivity could in principle emerge from clustering of Notch ligands and receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bardot et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cattoni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Duke and Graham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Narui and Salaita, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Radhakrishnan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Tetzlaff et al., 2018</xref>). To quantify ultrasensitivity, we titrated ligand expression in 4-epi-Tc-inducible sender cells (<xref rid="figs1C" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>) and measured signaling activity in a co-cultured minority of CHO-K1 receiver cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Signaling levels increased monotonically to levels that varied by ∼1.5 fold across most ligands (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). However, there were two exceptions: First, Dll1-Notch signaling was biphasic, declining at high trans-ligand expression levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Second, Jag1-Notch1 signaling was much weaker than other signaling interactions, as expected, preventing analysis of ultrasensitivity in this case. Most dose-response curves showed ultrasensitive responses in which signaling activity increased approximately as the square of the ligand concentration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref rid="figs2C" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The exception was Jag1-Notch2 signaling, with a logarithmic sensitivity of ∼1.5. An independent analysis based on fitting Hill functions to the subset of dose-response curves that reached saturation similarly produced Hill coefficients of ∼2 for Dll4 with both receptors and Jag1-Notch2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>).</p>
<p>The dose-response curves also allowed analysis of the relative activation strength of different ligands, defined by the ligand concentration required to signal above a threshold (Methods). Signaling strengths determined this way interpolated between the values described above in Lfng and dLfng conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>), likely reflecting the endogenous Fringe profile of CHO-K1 cells, which express Rfng as well as low levels of Lfng, a profile whose effects are largely consistent with low levels of Lfng (<xref rid="figs2D" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, Methods).</p>
<p>Together, these results show that Notch signaling is modestly ultrasensitive for most ligand-receptor pairs in this cell context and, more broadly, reveal quantitative receptor-ligand preferences and their dependence on Lfng expression.</p>

</fig>
<p>For all ligand-receptor combinations, signaling increased monotonically with plated ligand levels across the utilized concentration range. Because factors such as partial denaturation of recombinant proteins preclude absolute measurements of effective ligand concentrations, we compared the relative activity of individual ligands across different receptors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), but did not compare activation of the same receptor by different ligands. We again defined the relative activation strengths by the ligand concentration required to signal above a threshold (Methods). Receptor preferences were qualitatively, and sometimes quantitatively, consistent between the plated ligand assay and trans-activation coculture assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). For example, Jag2 and Dll1 exhibited ∼2-and ∼3-fold stronger activation, respectively, for Notch2 than Notch1 in both assays. Similarly, Dll4 showed a slight preference for Notch1 over Notch2 in both assays, although the fold-difference was larger in the plated ligand assay. Strikingly, while Jag1 sender cells failed to activate Notch1 receivers above background (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), plate-bound Jag1-ext-Fc activated Notch1 only ∼3-fold less efficiently than it activated Notch2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-D</xref>). This suggests that the natural endocytic activation mechanism, or potential differences in tertiary structure between the expressed and recombinant Jag1 extracellular domains, could play roles in preventing Jag1-Notch1 signaling in coculture.</p>
<p>Finally, in contrast to the ultrasensitive responses to expressed ligands, dose-response curves in the plated ligand assay were approximately linear for all ligand-receptor combinations except Jag1, which showed logarithmic sensitivities closer to ∼1.5 for both receptors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref rid="figs3A" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These differences in ultrasensitivity may reflect a difference in clustering behaviors between plated ligand-ext-Fc ligands and cell-expressed ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cattoni et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that plate-bound ligands differ in their Notch activation compared to ligands expressed on living cells.</p>

<title>Ligand binding is sensitive to Fringe expression</title>
<p>Despite their different signaling properties, recombinant ligands provide a convenient system to measure receptor-ligand binding interactions. Previous work has shown that the effects of Lfng on binding and signaling are not directly correlated. Lfng increased recombinant Jag1 binding to Notch1, but reduced its signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kakuda and Haltiwanger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). On the other hand, Lfng strengthened Dll1-Notch1 binding and increased signaling. In another study, Lfng reduced Jag1-Notch2 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Shimizu et al., 2001</xref>). However, Lfng effects on the binding strength of most receptor-ligand combinations remain unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we focused on Lfng effects on relative ligand-receptor binding strengths for the four Notch1-ligand combinations. We incubated CHO-K1 receiver cells, or parental reporter cells expressing only endogenous receptors, with soluble ligand-ext-Fc fragments pre-clustered with a dye-conjugated antibody, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kakuda and Haltiwanger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Varshney and Stanley, 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). We then used flow cytometry to measure the amount of ligand bound to cells, transiently expressing either Lfng or dLfng.</p>
<p>In agreement with the previous work, Lfng strengthened Notch1 binding to Dll1 and Jag1 by 6.4-fold and 2.8-fold on average, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">H</xref>). Lfng also modestly strengthened Notch1 binding to Jag2. However, Lfng had relatively little effect on Dll4-Notch1 binding. These data do not rule out the possibility that other ligand concentration regimes might be more sensitive to Lfng.</p>
<p>In parallel with binding, we also analyzed the effect of Lfng on signaling by plate-bound ligands (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We incubated dLfng- or Lfng-transfected Notch1 receivers on plated Dll1-ext-Fc and Jag1-ext-Fc. Lfng strongly increased Dll1-Notch1 signaling and weakened Jag1-Notch1 signaling in the plated ligand assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>), similar to results with expressed ligands (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Thus, Lfng had opposite effects on binding and activation of Notch1 by the same Jag1-ext-Fc fragment. By strengthening Jag1-Notch1 binding while decreasing activation, Lfng may allow Jag1 to competitively trans-inhibit Notch1 activation by other ligands (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Golson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Pedrosa et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>While they do not rule out additional effects of Lfng on binding affinity for Dll4-Notch1, these results together suggest that with Dll1, Lfng strengthens both binding and activation of Notch1, while with Jagged ligands it strengthens binding but instead weakens activation.</p>

<title>Cis-interaction outcomes depend on receptor and ligand identity</title>
<p>Activating ligands are frequently coexpressed with Notch1 and/or Notch2, provoking the question of how ligands and receptors interact in the same cell (in cis), and more specifically whether they activate (cis-activation) or inhibit (cis-inhibition) signaling. Cis-interactions are difficult to investigate in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Henrique and Schweisguth, 2019</xref>). However, in vitro studies in mammalian cells have demonstrated that Dll1 and Dll4 can cis-activate both Notch1 and Notch2 in CHO-K1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nandagopal et al., 2019</xref>), and that Dll1, Dll4, and Jag1 can cis-inhibit Notch1 activation by other ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">LeBon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Preuße et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Thambyrajah et al., 2024</xref>). Nevertheless, it has remained unclear whether other receptor-ligand combinations also engage in cis-activation and/or cis-inhibition. We therefore sought to analyze cis-interactions more comprehensively.</p>
<p>In the cis-activation assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), we first preinduced expression of cis-ligands in receivers for 48 hours by titrating 4-epi-Tc to the desired level in the presence of the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nandagopal et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, Methods). To focus on cis-interactions alone, we then cultured receiver cells at low density, amid an excess of wild-type CHO-K1 cells, and allowed them to signal for 22-24 hours before flow cytometry analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E,F</xref>). At these cell densities, trans-interactions among the minority cells should be minimal, activating to no more than 5% of maximum reporter activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). As described below, trans-interactions between sister cells following cell division during the assay could in principle contribute to the observed cis-activation signal, but are insufficient to account for strong cis-activation.</p>

<p>We found that cis-activation was both ligand and receptor specific (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, left column). Notch1 exhibited no cis-activation for any of the ligands, except for a modest response to Dll4, of no more than 20% of maximal trans-activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, upper left), consistent with previous observations in wild-type CHO-K1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nandagopal et al., 2019</xref>). By contrast, Notch2 was cis-activated by both Dll1 and Dll4, to levels exceeding those produced by trans-activation by high-Dll1 senders (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, lower left, compare with trans-activation in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, lower right). (Thus, the Notch2 cis-activation observed here is too strong to be explained by potential trans-interactions between sister cells following cell division in the cis-activation assay.) Jagged ligands, on the other hand, did not cis-activate Notch2 in this assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, lower left).</p>
<p>In contrast to cis-activation, the reciprocal phenomenon of cis-inhibition can only be detected in the context of basal Notch activation by other ligands. We therefore established a parallel “cis-modulation” assay, which probes the combined effect of cis- and trans-interactions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, Methods). In this assay, a minority of preinduced receiver cells are cocultured with an excess of “high-Dll1” sender cells that constitutively express Dll1 at levels sufficient to strongly activate receiver cells not expressing cis-ligands (<xref rid="figs4A" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Cis-inhibition, like cis-activation, was found to depend on both receptor and cis-ligand identity. All ligands cis-inhibited intercellular Dll1-Notch1 signaling, achieving 75-100% inhibition in the highest cis-ligand expression bin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, upper right). By contrast, intercellular Dll1-Notch2 signaling was cis-inhibited by Jag1 and Jag2, but not by Dll1 or Dll4, whose cis-activation further increased Notch2 signaling (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, lower right). These results were not due to non-specific effects of ectopic cis protein expression, as Notch1 and Notch2 reporter activities showed no dependence on expression of negative control proteins H2B-mCherry or NGFR-T2A-H2B-mCherry, in either the cis-activation or cis-modulation assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these results reveal three striking differences in cis-interactions among receptor-ligand combinations: (1) Delta ligands cis-activate Notch2 much more strongly than Notch1, (2) all four ligands cis-inhibit Notch1, and (3) Jagged, but not Delta, ligands cis-inhibit Notch2.</p>

<title>Cis-activation does not arise from prior trans-activation</title>
<p>Since cis-activation in Delta-Notch2 receivers appeared to rival the strength of trans-activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) and is blocked by γ-secretase inhibitors, similar to canonical trans-activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nandagopal et al., 2019</xref>), we considered the possibility that the cis-activation signal could be an artifact of intercellular signaling occurring prior to the start of the assay. During the ligand preinduction phase, the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT prevents S3, but not S2, receptor cleavage. Thus, intercellular contacts between receivers during preinduction culture could in principle generate a S2-cleaved receptor, also known as the Notch extracellular truncation (NEXT). NEXT could then undergo S3 cleavage after DAPT removal, contributing to the total observed signal in the cis-activation assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>To test this possibility, we carried out a control cis-activation assay in which receivers were cultured at both sparse and confluent densities during the 48 hour cis-ligand preinduction phase, and then replated sparsely or densely after 24 hours of preinduction to maintain the initial low or high cell density conditions (Methods). If cis-activation signal resulted from intercellular signaling during preinduction, only cells preinduced in confluent culture (able to make intercellular contacts) would show a “cis-activation” signal 24 hours after DAPT removal. For Notch2-Dll1 and Notch2-Dll4, single cell reporter activities correlated with cis-ligand expression, regardless of whether cells were preinduced at a high or low culture density (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). While cells pre-cultured in the confluent condition shifted the signaling distributions to higher values relative to cells in sparse pre-cultures, the correlation between cis-ligand expression and reporter activity was maintained. This signaling shift is consistent with elevated expression of Tet-OFF-controlled cis-ligands at high cell density (<xref rid="figs4B" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, this analysis rules out the possibility that Delta-Notch2 cis-activation signal arises from S3-cleavage of NEXT generated by intercellular signaling during the ligand preinduction phase.</p>

<title>Coexpression of ligands and receptors can produce cis- or trans-signaling in confluent monoculture</title>
<p>In a population of cells coexpressing both receptors and ligands, signaling could occur through cis-activation, trans-activation, or both. How do these two modes of signaling combine when both can occur simultaneously? To disentangle the contributions of these two modes of signaling, we compared cis-activation alone (sparsely cultured receivers, “cis-activation assay”) to signaling occurring through both cis- and trans-interactions (confluent receivers, “cis-+ trans-activation assay”) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). We repeated this analysis for each receptor-ligand pair, and for both dLfng and Lfng conditions, across a broad range of ligand expression (<xref rid="figs5A" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). For ligand-Notch1 interactions (cis + trans), transactivation significantly contributed to the overall signaling strength observed in our experiments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref rid="figs5B" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). With Lfng, the combination of cis- and trans-interactions produced over twice the signaling activity from Dll1 or Dll4 compared to cis-interactions alone in the increasing phase of the dose-response curves (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). This result indicates that trans-activation can increase Notch1 activity beyond the level produced by cis-activation alone. For Jag2-Notch1, in either dLfng or Lfng conditions, signaling was only observed with trans-interactions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,B</xref>). For Jag1-Notch1, no activation was seen in the cis-activation or the cis-+ trans-activation modes, consistent with earlier results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>Ligand-Notch2 interactions showed a qualitatively different profile of behaviors compared to Notch1. Of the four ligands, trans Jag2 modestly increased Notch2 signaling beyond the level achieved by cis-activation alone, by about 1.5-fold (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). In all other ligand-Notch2 conditions, trans-ligands failed to increase signaling, suggesting that cis-activation alone is sufficient to explain the observed level of signaling in these cis + trans conditions. With Jag1-Notch2, combined cis- and trans-signaling was slightly lower than cis-only signaling with Lfng (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that trans-interactions may limit signaling from cis-activation in this case. (Note that this assay used a Jag1-Notch2 clone with lower background signaling than in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, enabling detection of cis-activation (<xref rid="figs4A" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs5D" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).)</p>
<p>Together, these results indicate that cis- and trans-signaling combine differently across the ligand-receptor combinations. Some combinations showed increased activity with cis- and trans-interactions compared to cis-interactions alone, while other combinations showed either a preference for a particular signaling mode or appeared to signal equally well through both modes.</p>

<title>Lfng modulates cis-activation strengths</title>
<p>Cis-activation and trans-activation share several features. They both require receptor-ligand binding at the cell surface and depend on γ-secretase cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nandagopal et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, they share similar ligand-dependent responses to Rfng, which increases both cis-activation and trans-activation by Dll1 but not Dll4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kakuda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nandagopal et al., 2019</xref>). However, it was not clear whether Lfng would exhibit similar effects on cis-activation and trans-activation, and how any similarities or differences between activation modes might vary across receptor-ligand combinations.</p>
<p>To address these questions, we analyzed the results from the cis-activation assay with or without Lfng (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Effects of Lfng on Notch1 cis-activation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref rid="figs5E" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>) quantitatively resembled those on trans-activation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Lfng significantly increased Dll1-Notch1 and Dll4-Notch1 signaling by 3.3-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively, in both assays. By contrast, Lfng had no effect on cis-activation of Notch1 by Jag1 and Jag2, which remained negligible with or without Lfng.</p>
<p>With Notch2, Lfng’s effects on cis- and trans-interactions diverged (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Despite its ability to increase Dll1 and Dll4 trans-activation of Notch2, Lfng did not strongly affect cis-activation. While Lfng sharply reduced Jag1-Notch2 trans-activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), it had negligible effects on cis-activation by the same components (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Conversely, for Jag2-Notch2, Lfng had weak effects on trans-activation, but reduced cis-activation by more than 2-fold (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that cis- and trans-activation mechanisms respond to Lfng similarly for Notch1, but differently for Notch2.</p>

<title>Three-component interactions modulate cis-inhibition</title>
<p>Notch trans-activation and cis-inhibition involve oligomeric binding and clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Narui and Salaita, 2013</xref>), provoking the question of whether higher order (beyond pairwise) signaling interactions could influence signaling.

To examine this possibility, we used the cis-modulation assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) to determine how cis-inhibition strength depends on the identity of the trans-activating ligand for each cis-ligand-receptor pair.

<p>The effects of cis-interactions were qualitatively similar across different trans-activating ligands (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). In all cases, cis-Jagged ligands inhibited Notch1 and Notch2, while cis-Delta ligands inhibited Notch1 and activated Notch2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). (Note that cis-inhibition of Notch1 could not be analyzed when Jag1 sender cells were used due to a lack of trans-activation by Jag1 (<xref rid="figs6A" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).)</p>
<p>Quantitatively, cis-inhibition strength depended on both cis-ligand and trans-ligand identity. For example, Jag2 was the most effective Notch1 cis-inhibitor across all trans-ligands (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Ligands’ relative cis-inhibition strengths did not correlate well with trans-activation strengths (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). In general, combinations with modest or strong cis-activating potentials, such as Dll4-Notch1, Dll1-Notch2, and Dll4-Notch2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), showed relatively poor cis-inhibition efficiencies relative to trans-activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). The converse was also true for Notch1: the non-cis-activating ligands, Jag1 and Jag2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), showed strong cis-inhibition efficiencies relative to trans-activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). For Notch2, no ligands favored cis-inhibition over trans-activation, consistent with the observation that all ligands can cis-activate Notch2 to some extent (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>
<p>To quantitatively compare cis-inhibition efficiencies for different trans-ligands, we computed trans-adjusted cis-inhibition efficiencies by dividing values from <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> by the strength of trans-activation mediated by each sender population (<xref rid="figs6A" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). For Notch1, ligands’ trans-adjusted cis-inhibition efficiencies showed diverse dependencies on the identity of the trans-ligand (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Notably, each cis-ligand inhibited signaling from the trans-ligand of the same identity with an equal or greater efficiency than it inhibited other trans-ligands. For example, Dll1 cis-inhibited trans-Dll1 signaling more efficiently than either trans-Jag2 or -Dll4. Similarly, Jag2 cis-inhibited trans-Jag2 signaling more efficiently than trans-Dll1 signaling, and Dll4 cis-inhibited trans-Dll4 signaling more efficiently than trans-Jag2 signaling. In contrast to the variability of Notch1 cis-inhibition, Jag-Notch2 cis-inhibition was relatively uniform across different cis- and trans-ligand combinations, varying by no more than 2-fold between the strongest and weakest cis-inhibiting combinations. Together, these results suggest that cis-inhibition strengths for Notch1, and to a lesser extent, Notch2, depend on the interplay of trans-ligand, cis-ligand, and receptor.</p>
<p>Finally, we estimated the ultrasensitivity of cis-inhibition by fitting Hill functions to most of the dose-response curves in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>. Hill coefficients ranged from ∼0.75-1.5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), below the values obtained for trans-activation by the same components (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">G</xref>). These results suggest that cis-inhibition is a less ultrasensitive, or potentially more stoichiometric, process compared to trans-activation. Taken together, these data suggest a complex interplay among ligands and receptors in cis and trans.</p>

<p>To compare C2C12-Nkd signaling responses to those of CHO-K1 cells, we repeated the trans-activation assay described previously (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D,E</xref>) in the C2C12-Nkd background. In these assays, to minimize residual expression of endogenous Notch components, we also inserted a transient knockdown step, in which we used siRNAs to suppress basal expression of endogenous Notch receptors, and, in some cases, Rfng (<xref rid="figs7A" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>, Methods). We focused on one ligand of each Delta and Jagged class, Dll1 and Jag1, to test whether these ligands would exhibit similar relative abilities to trans-activate Notch1 and Notch2 in the C2C12-Nkd background versus the CHO-K1 cells.</p>
<p>Jag1 senders activated Notch1 C2C12-Nkd receivers poorly, despite activating Notch2 receivers well (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>), just as we observed in CHO-K1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Dll1 senders activated Notch1 much more efficiently than Jag1 senders did, but Notch2 receivers were activated to a similar extent by Jag1 and Dll1 senders (&lt;1.5-fold difference), also consistent with our results in CHO-K1.</p>
<p>Next, to compare cis-interactions between cell lines, we performed cis-activation and cis-modulation assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) in the C2C12-Nkd background, adjusting assay parameters such as cell density to compensate for differences in cell properties (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, Methods). We focused on Dll4 and Jag2, for one ligand each of the Delta and Jagged classes. With Notch2, we observed strong cis-activation by Dll4 and cis-inhibition by Jag2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>), similar to results in the CHO-K1 background (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). Also similar to their behavior in CHO-K1 cells, Dll4 and Jag2 cis-inhibited Notch1 reporter activity in C2C12-Nkd cells relative to the NGFR cis-ligand negative control. Furthermore, Jag2 did not cis-activate Notch1 in this background. However, in contrast to CHO-K1, where Dll4 weakly cis-activated Notch1 even without Fringe expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), we observed no cis-activation by Dll4 in C2C12-Nkd.</p>
<p>Together, these results indicate that key signaling behaviors are similar between the CHO-K1 and C2C12 backgrounds. In particular, weak trans-activation of Notch1 by Jag1, and strong cis-activation of Notch2 by Dll1 and Dll4, are likely to be intrinsic properties of these ligands and receptors. Future studies will be necessary to extend these comparisons to a broader range of cell contexts.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It has been known for decades that the mammalian Notch signaling pathway contains multiple interacting ligand, receptor, and Fringe variants. However, the functional consequences of this component diversity have remained difficult to understand. This is due in part to a lack of comprehensive measurements of signaling outcomes across ligand-receptor pairs, signaling modes (cis versus trans), and Fringe modification states. Here, systematic mapping of interactions revealed that each ligand and receptor is unique in terms of its profile of cis- and trans-activation and cis-inhibition activities, and the dependence of these activities on Lfng (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>).</p>

<p>Canonical trans-signaling exhibited a range of signaling activities across ligand-receptor-Fringe combinations. Ligand class (Delta vs Jagged) did not predict the signaling level with either receptor. However, it did correlate strongly with the sign of response to Lfng, which respectively increased or decreased signaling by Delta or Jagged ligands to both receptors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Amid variability in trans-signaling efficiencies, there was striking uniformity in the ultrasensitivity of Notch responses, which was roughly constant across ligand-receptor-Fringe combinations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F,G</xref>).</p>
<p>Including cis-interactions revealed additional differences among ligand and receptor variants. All ligands interacted with both Notch1 and Notch2 in cis, but did so with effects that varied across ligand-receptor-Fringe combinations. Broadly, Delta ligands cis-inhibited only Notch1, and cis-activated Notch2 at levels exceeding the maximal Notch2 trans-signaling observed here, while Jagged ligands cis-inhibited both receptors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Overall, the effects of cis-ligands were complex, with signaling activity often exhibiting Fringe-dependence (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), a biphasic dependence on ligand level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), and, in some cases, sensitivity to trans-activating ligands (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Notably, Lfng had different impacts on cis- and trans-interactions for some ligand-receptor combinations such as Jag1-Notch2 and Jag2-Notch2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting the possibility that cis- and trans-activation may involve different molecular mechanisms.</p>
<p>Lfng-dependent trans-inhibition of Notch1 by Jag1 has been shown to play a key role in some contexts such as angiogenesis, where it inhibits Dll4-Notch1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Pedrosa et al., 2015</xref>) and the embryonic pancreas, where it inhibits Dll1-Notch1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Golson et al., 2009</xref>). Our results explain how trans-inhibition could result from the combination of strong binding with weak activation, which was most pronounced for Jag1-Notch1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Further, this effect was enhanced by Lfng, which increased binding strength in the ligand binding assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>), while decreasing signaling in both the coculture and plated ligand assays (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3I</xref>), consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kakuda and Haltiwanger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). No other ligand exhibited this combination of strong binding and weak activation. These results suggest that Notch1 trans-inhibition may be a core function of Jag1, and could help explain the sometimes divergent behavior of Jag1 mutants compared with other ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chrysostomou et al., 2020</xref>). However, it is possible that positive Jag1-Notch1 signaling is also functionally important in some contexts, since weak signaling from Jag1-expressing OP9 cells prevents T-cell progenitors from differentiating into the B-cell lineage, in contrast with no-ligand controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lehar et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>A major question is how Notch receptors integrate information from cis- and trans-ligands. Previous work introduced a general model in which cis- and trans-ligands compete to form different ligand-receptor complexes. In this model, each complex may have a distinct binding strength and a distinct signaling efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Formosa-Jordan and Ibañes, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Sprinzak et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">2010</xref>). The competitive binding model is indirectly supported by previous observations that the same conserved domain of the Serrate ligand is required both for cis-inhibitory and trans-activating Notch interactions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cordle et al., 2008</xref>), that interdomain flexibility in receptors and ligands could facilitate antiparallel binding in both cis and trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Luca et al., 2015</xref>), and that synthetic synNotch ligands can cis-inhibit their receptors when expressed in the same cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Morsut et al., 2016</xref>). However, it has not been tested systematically.</p>
<p>Our results are broadly consistent with the competitive binding model (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). For example, when strongly cis-activating ligands compete with strongly trans-activating ligands, they cause no net decrease in signaling, as observed when cis-Delta ligands interact with Notch2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). By contrast, when a strongly binding cis-ligand produces a weak or inactive complex, it can cis-inhibit. In general, combinations that did not cis-activate (Jagged-Notch1) showed relatively stronger cis-inhibition than combinations that cis-activated weakly (Delta-Notch1, Jag1-Notch2) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Cis-Jag2-Notch1 was the strongest cis-inhibiting combination overall. Because of its unique attributes of strong binding and weak cis-activation, cis-Jag2-Notch1 could operate in a “mutual inactivation” regime in which a cis-ligand titrates the receptor levels available to potential trans-activating ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">LeBon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). Linear titration of this type is consistent with the roughly linear logarithmic sensitivity observed in dose-response experiments for Notch1 with cis-Jag2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results revealed additional complexities in cis-inhibition. Existing models describe competitive inhibition of Notch signaling in terms of pairwise cis and trans receptor-ligand binding affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">del Álamo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Formosa-Jordan and Ibañes, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">LeBon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Luna-Escalante et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>). However, in our data, cis-inhibition strength depended on the identity of the receptor, the activating trans-ligand, and the cis-ligand. Strikingly, for Notch1, each type of ligand had a comparative advantage in its ability to cis-inhibit trans-activation by itself compared to other ligands (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). For example, Dll1 cis-inhibited trans-Dll1 signaling more efficiently than trans-Jag2, while Jag2 cis-inhibited trans-Jag2 signaling more efficiently than trans-Dll1. These results hint at the possibility of multi-way interactions, possibly involving oligomeric structures.</p>
<p>Overall, our results were broadly consistent with earlier work for previously analyzed receptor-ligand pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kakuda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Song et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stanley and Guidos, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tveriakhina et al., 2018</xref>). However, there were some notable discrepancies. While we observed a negative effect of Lfng on trans Jag1-Notch2 signaling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent with one previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Shimizu et al., 2001</xref>), other studies showed either positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>), or no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kakuda et al., 2020</xref>) with this combination. A second notable discrepancy was our observation that Delta-like ligands cis-activate but cannot cis-inhibit Notch2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). This conflicts with a report that wild-type Dll4 cis-inhibited Notch2 in U2OS osteosarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). It is possible that cell type-specific factors prevent Dll4 cis-activation of Notch2 in U2OS cells or that Dll4 cis-inhibition requires some interaction between Dll4 and the N2ICD (absent from our N2ECD-Gal4 receptors). Third, we found that Dll1 trans-activated Notch2 more efficiently than Notch1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), consistent with results from a previous plated ligand assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kakuda et al., 2020</xref>), but conflicting with a coculture assay showing equivalent activation of both receptors by Dll1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tveriakhina et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Looking ahead, a major question is how to understand and predict the behavior of complex pathway profiles involving multiple receptors, ligands and Fringe proteins. For example, one of the most prevalent Notch component expression profiles, found in cell types within the heart, trachea, forelimb, and other tissues, exhibits high levels of Notch1 and Notch2 as well as moderate levels of all four activating ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Granados et al. 2022</xref>). What signaling properties does this combination of components produce? Which cell types can it signal to or receive signals from? Expanding the approach developed here to allow simultaneous analysis of multiple receptor activities could help to address these questions. On the other hand, directly measuring the signaling properties of all prevalent profiles may be infeasible with current techniques. Therefore, it will be critical to develop quantitative models that predict signaling behaviors among cells based on their pathway expression profiles. The data and analysis provided here should help to create such models, and thereby improve our ability to understand, predict, and control Notch signaling in diverse contexts.</p>

Receiver cells were created by initial transfection of the 2xHS4-UAS-H2B-mCitrine-2xHS4 plasmid. After selection in 400 ug/ml Zeocin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), cells were placed into limiting dilution, and a single reporter clone was identified that activated well in response to transient expression of Gal4, and continued with. The reporter clone was then transfected with a chimeric Notch1 or Notch2 receptor, whose intracellular domain was replaced with a Gal4esn-T2A-H2B-mTurq2 sequence (Gal4esn = minimal Gal4 transcription factor). Transfected reporter cells were selected in 600 ug/ml Geneticin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and placed into limiting dilution. A Notch1 or Notch2 receiver cell clone was chosen by its ability to demonstrate high mCitrine expression when plated on plate-bound ligands in culture. For receiver cells with inducible ligand, Tet-OFF-ligand-T2A-H2B-mCherry was added to the receiver cells by lentiviral infection (see Lentiviral production and infection section above). Cells were selected in 10 ug/ml Blasticidin (Invivogen), and sorted (Sony MA900 Multi-Application Cell Sorter) for expression of Notch (mTurq2) and ligand (mCherry) in the absence of 4-epi-Tc. Sorted cells were placed into limiting dilution, and clones were selected that demonstrated good ligand induction range (mCherry levels) when treated with various amounts of 4-epi-Tc as well as expressed good levels of mTurq2 (Notch receptor). Sender cell lines, stably expressing each of the four ligands under control of the Tet-OFF system or constitutively activated by the CBh promoter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) were created by infection of CHO-K1 cells with Tet-OFF-ligand-T2A-H2B-mCherry lentivirus or CBh-ligand-T2A-H2B-mCherry lentivirus, respectively.

Data were then uploaded to Galaxy for subsequent processing. Reads were aligned to the Mouse Dec. 2011 (GRCm38/mm10) genome using HISAT2 with default parameters and transcript abundances were computed with StringTie using the GENCODE annotation of the mouse genome (GRCm38), version M22 (Ensembl 97), downloaded 2019-06-27.</p>

<title>Characterization of Tet-OFF promoter behavior</title>
<p>To optimize preculture conditions in experiments using cell lines with Tet-OFF inducible ligands, we analyzed the dynamics and density dependence of transcription. First, we analyzed transcription dynamics with a qRT-PCR time course. CHO-K1 senders with integrated Dll1 or Dll4 ligands driven by the Tet-OFF promoter were seeded at a density that would reach confluence in a 24-well plate at the indicated time of collection. Seeded senders were induced to express ligand by reducing 4-epi-Tc concentration in the culture medium from 500 ng/ml to 5 or 10 ng/mL for Dll4 and Dll1 senders, respectively. Media was changed every 24 hr to replenish the proper 4-epi-Tc concentration, and cells were passaged every 72 hr, where applicable. At collection time, cells were spun down and RNA was extracted, followed by cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR analysis. Ligand mRNA expression reached steady state levels within 24 hours of 4-epi-Tc addition (<xref rid="figs1B" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, we analyzed the Tet-OFF promoter’s dependence on cell density. 25,000 CHO-K1 Dll1 or Dll4 sender cells were seeded in a 24-well, 12-well, or 6-well plate (for high, medium, and low density, respectively) and induced to maximal ligand expression by removing 4-epi-Tc from the culture medium. Cells were collected 72 hr later and RNA expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Ligand expression from the Tet-OFF promoter showed a modest (&lt;2-fold) dependence on cell culture density in the absence of 4-epi-Tc (<xref rid="figs4B" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Surface ligand isolation and quantification</title>
<p>We measured surface ligand levels in several CHO-K1 sender cell lines with the Pierce Cell Surface Protein Biotinylation and Isolation Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol, followed by Western blot analysis of the purified surface proteins. Western blot was performed as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nandagopal et al., 2019</xref>). Notch ligand protein was detected with anti-FLAG tag staining, while GAPDH and NAK ATPase staining served as negative and positive controls, respectively, for detection of surface protein isolation. Dll4 surface levels were undetectable despite cotranslational expression levels similar to a Dll1 cell line with positive signal (<xref rid="figs2B" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), as others have observed in OP9 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Shah et al., 2012</xref>). However, this disparity could also reflect a potential dependence of surface protein pulldown efficiency on the number of primary amines (lysines) available for biotinylation in the extracellular domain (Dll1 has 17, while Dll4 has only 9). Similarly, Jag1’s high extracellular lysine count (44) could explain, at least in part, why its surface abundance exceeded that of the other ligands. Note that although surface protein isolation successfully depleted the cytoplasmic control and enriched it for the surface protein control, it is possible that some portion of the detected Notch ligands is residual cytoplasmic protein.</p>

<title>Signaling assays with flow cytometry readout</title>
<p>Various cellular assays enabled quantitative analysis of relative signaling activity mediated by different receptor-ligand pairs expressed in cis and/or trans (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">F</xref>). The general workflow for all assays was as follows (see also <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>): Ligand expression was induced in either sender or receiver cells by reducing the 4-epi-Tc concentration in the culture medium to the desired level (Supplementary Table 3), and receivers were incubated in the Notch signaling inhibitor DAPT to prevent reporter activation during this 48 hr preinduction phase. Media was changed after 24 hr to maintain the desired 4-epi-Tc concentration and 1 µM or 2 µM DAPT for CHO-K1 and C2C12 receivers, respectively. For all assays with siRNA knockdown, siRNAs were applied 7-10 hrs after cell seeding such that cells were 30-50% confluent at time of transfection (see section “siRNA transfections”) and siRNAs were removed after a ∼16 hr incubation. Plasmid transfections (when applicable) were performed immediately after siRNA media change (24 hr before starting an assay) when cells were ∼80% confluent. Per 0.5mL of medium in a 24-well, 500 ng of total plasmid was transfected including IFP2 plasmid only or 350 ng of an IFP2 plasmid cotransfected with 150 ng of a plasmid containing wild-type mouse Lfng or the Lfng D289E mutant (mutated catalytic aspartate, “dLfng”). (Note that surface Notch1 levels differed by less than 25% between the dLfng- and Lfng-transfected samples (<xref rid="figs4B" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>)). Media was changed (replacing proper 4-epi-Tc and DAPT concentrations) 4-6 hr after transfection. To start the signaling assay, receivers (and sender cells, if applicable) were trypsinized using 0.25% Trypsin without EDTA and plated at a total cell density to reach confluence after 24 hours, either in a monoculture, coculture, or on plated ligand (see assay subtype details below). Senders used for each coculture assay experiment are listed in Supplementary Table 4. Cells were incubated for 22-24 hours in the proper 4-epi-Tc concentration (if applicable) but without DAPT to allow signaling, and with the IFP2 cofactor biliverdin for samples transfected with IFP2 plasmid. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and Notch activation was analyzed by flow cytometry. All assays were performed with at least three biological replicates.

For experiments with C2C12 cells, 24-well plates were used and volumes were scaled up accordingly. Either PBS alone or IgG1 Fc was plated as a negative control.

<p>CHO-K1 reporter cells and reporter cells with integrated Notch1 (“receiver” cells) were prepared with endogenous Fringe knockdown and Lfng or dLfng transfection (with IFP2 as a cotransfection marker) as described in the section above (“Signaling assays with flow cytometry readout”). Instead of beginning a signaling assay, cells were replated on non-tissue-culture-treated polystyrene plates from CellStar to reduce cell attachment to the bottom of the well, enabling detachment without trypsin. After a 24 hr incubation in medium supplemented with the IFP2 cofactor biliverdin, the ligand binding assay was carried out with slight modifications from protocols described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kakuda and Haltiwanger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Varshney and Stanley, 2017</xref>). Cells were detached by pipetting and spun down for 5 minutes at 400xg at room temperature (same parameters used for all centrifugation steps), then blocked with blocking buffer (2% BSA + 100 µg/mL CaCl2 in 1X DPBS) for 15 minutes. Ligands were prepared by preclustering ligand-ext-Fc fragments (at 2X concentrations relative to the final concentrations given in Supplementary Table 5) with AlexaFluor 594-conjugated anti-human secondary antibodies (1:1000) in blocking buffer for 1 hr in the dark at 4C. After blocking, cells were spun down again, resuspended in 50 µL blocking buffer, and mixed with 50 µL 2X preclustered ligands, then incubated in the dark for 1hr at 4C. To evaluate Fringe effects on surface Notch levels, cells were incubated with 400 ng/mL PE-conjugated anti-Notch1 antibodies (instead of ligands) in blocking buffer at room temperature in the dark for 30 mins.

<title>Density optimization for the cis-activation assay</title>
<p>For CHO cells, Notch1 or Notch2 receiver cells were trypsinized using 0.25% Trypsin without EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Receiver cells were plated sparsely at 2,500, 5,000 or 10,000 in a 24 well plate along with an equal number of CHO-K1 “high-Dll4” (Dll4-L1) sender cells for Notch1 or “high-Dll1” (Dll1-L1) sender cells for Notch2, and surrounded by 150,000 CHO-K1 wild-type cells.

<title>Analysis of endogenous Fringe effects on signaling in CHO-K1 cells</title>
<p>CHO-K1 cells endogenously express low levels of Lfng and ∼20-fold higher levels of Rfng (Supplementary Table 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Singh et al., 2018</xref>). To assess the effects of endogenous Fringes on receptor-ligand interactions, we expressed dLfng or Lfng while knocking down endogenous Rfng and Lfng with siRNA in CHO-K1 receiver cells (as described above), and compared these “No Fringe” and “high Lfng” conditions to wild-type levels of Fringe in a trans-activation assay with flow cytometry readout (<xref rid="figs2D" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p>
<p>As a general trend, the magnitude of signaling in the presence of endogenous Fringes fell between the dLfng and Lfng signaling magnitudes. Jag1-Notch1 signaling was not potentiated by endogenous Fringes (as would be expected in the case of Rfng dominance), but showed 1.7-fold weaker with endogenous CHO-K1 Fringes than with dLfng, consistent with Lfng dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kakuda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Pennarubia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yang et al., 2005</xref>), despite the much lower expression of Lfng relative to Rfng (Supplementary Table 2). (Note: Near signal saturating conditions, we observed very small (&lt;1.3-fold) decreases in Delta-Notch signaling with endogenous Fringes compared with dLfng, suggesting the possibility of mild, nonspecific effects of the siRNA or plasmid treatment in the two conditions). Although endogenous Fringes showed overall weaker effects on signaling activity than transfected Lfng did, our results suggest that endogenous Lfng modestly weakens Jagged signaling and strengthens Dll1-Notch1 signaling.

Signaling activity defined this way controls for variations in receptor expression across receiver clones and eliminates artifacts in mCitrine and mTurq2 fluorescence quantification that occur when binning cells on high cis-ligand expression (<xref rid="figs1E" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Average bulk measurements for each sample were obtained by computing the mean signal across single-cell data for a given sample (and mCherry bin, if applicable).

A minimum of 100 cells were required during averaging; mCherry bins with too few cells did not generate a bulk data point.</p>
<p><bold>Notes</bold>: (1) Despite sometimes heterogeneous cis-ligand expression, reporter activity vs. cis-ligand expression curves showed similar trends in CHO-K1 cells whether fluorescence values were averaged across cells from different wells sorted into the same bin of cis-ligand (mCherry) expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) or across cells from the same well and 4-epi-Tc concentration, without mCherry binning (<xref rid="figs5B" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). (2) For C2C12-Nkd cells, the fluorescence averaging method sometimes showed differences when values were averaged across cells from different wells sorted into the same bin of cis-ligand (mCherry) expression or across cells from the same well and 4-epi-Tc concentration, without mCherry binning. We selected averaging methods based on responses to expression of the NGFR control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). For Notch2, individual receivers were sorted into discrete bins of mCherry (A.U.) and the mCitrine/mTurq2 (signaling activity) and mCherry (cotranslational cis-ligand expression) fluorescence values were averaged across all cells in that bin. For Notch1, single-cell data were not sorted into mCherry bins, but averaged by 4-epi-Tc concentration, because mCherry binning yielded anomalous reporter activities with the NGFR control, possibly due to selection of abnormally large cells when sorting into the high mCherry bins.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Background subtraction was performed by subtracting “leaky” reporter activity of the receiver (using high 4-epi-Tc concentrations to minimize cis-ligand expression, where applicable) in coculture with “blank” senders (CHO-K1 wt or C2C12-Nkd parental cells, according to the receiver cell type).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Y-axis normalization was performed as described in each Figure caption. The term, “max normalized,” refers to signaling activities that were divided by trans-signaling in coculture with excess senders expressing relatively high ligand levels (with cis-ligand expression suppressed by high 4-epi-Tc, where applicable.) When signaling activities were background subtracted first, they are referred to as “min-max normalized.” Note: the maximum trans-signaling activity used in these normalizations may not reflect the true reporter activity maximum, especially in cases where cis-activation exceeds trans-activation strength. Additionally, in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>, maximal trans-signaling used in normalization was relatively weak for Notch2 (only 1.3-to 2.2-fold above background).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In some cases, average signaling activity (from steps #6 and 8 above) was further normalized to average cotranslational ligand expression (mCherry, A.U.) to define a signaling strength metric (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs2D" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). In such cases, saturated data points, defined as those with normalized signaling activity over 0.75 in both dLfng and Lfng conditions, were excluded. Only senders with mCherry levels &lt; 75% of the maximum sender expression were used, due to nonlinearities in normalized signaling activity with extremely high ligand expression.

Activating and repressing Hill functions were defined, respectively, as <italic>y</italic> = <italic>bx<sup>n</sup></italic>/(<italic>K<sup>n</sup></italic> + <italic>x<sup>n</sup></italic>) and <italic>y</italic> = <italic>bK<sup>n</sup></italic>/(<italic>K<sup>n</sup></italic> + <italic>x<sup>n</sup></italic>), where <italic>K</italic> denotes the EC50 and <italic>b</italic> denotes the curve maximum. We note that fits of activating responses to Hill functions could exhibit systematic errors in estimation of maximal signaling activity where observed responses are biphasic (e.g., Dll1 curves in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) or do not fully saturate (e.g., Jag2 curves in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). For the biphasic Dll1 curves, only datapoints in the increasing phase were fit to Hill functions.</p>
<p>Signaling strength metrics were based on the ligand concentration at which the fitted Hill function crossed a y-axis threshold (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). These thresholds were defined as the half-maximum signaling measured for each receptor (separately, due to differences in reporter dynamic range) from the <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> trans-activation data with Jag2, which signaled most strongly to both receptors. However, Jag2 curves were not fully saturated for either receptor, and errors in the estimation of relative maximum signaling for the two receptors (used to define half-maximal thresholds) could potentially skew relative signaling strengths computed for Notch1 vs. Notch2.</p>
<p>For linear regressions to compute a fold-change between two conditions, y-intercepts were fixed to (0,0) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>, <xref rid="figs5C" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref rid="figs5E" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). For statistically robust comparison of the relative trans-signaling strengths of Dll1 and Jag1 in C2C12-Nkd cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>), we pooled data from control and Rfng siRNA treatment conditions (Rfng is reported to potentiate Notch1 signaling but have no effect on Notch2 signaling for both Dll1 and Jag1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kakuda et al., 2020</xref>)).</p>
<p>All mean values and 95% confidence intervals were computed based on 10,000 bootstrap replicates with at least n = 3 biological replicates. When bootstrapping confidence intervals on parameter estimates from fitting ligand dose-response curves to lines (<xref rid="figs2C" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref rid="figs3A" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs5C" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref rid="figs5E" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>) or Hill functions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), bootstrapped datasets were constructed by sampling separately from biological replicates within each x-axis “bin,” defined as the mCherry fluorescence window, the plated ligand concentration, or the 4-epi-Tc concentration, as relevant.</p>
<p>P-values were computed in two ways. To evaluate whether the correlation between two paired variables had a slope greater or less than 1, we used one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests implemented in scipy—scipy.stats.wilcoxon. To test whether two sets of data points came from distributions with the same means, we used permutation testing following these steps:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Compute the true difference in means between the control and test datasets (of length <italic>n</italic> and <italic>m</italic>, respectively).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pool the two datasets and scramble the order of data points.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Define the permutation sample by labeling the first <italic>n</italic> points from the scrambled data as “control” data and the next <italic>m</italic> points as “test” data.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Compute the difference in means between the control and test distributions from the permutation replicate versus the original data set.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Repeat many times. The p-value is the fraction of permutation replicates with a difference in means greater than the true difference in means.</p></list-item>
</list>
P-values were computed using at least 10,000 permutation replicates with one-sided differences in mean.</p>

The left scatterplot shows differences in expression between wild-type cells and the C2C12-Nkd clone with Notch signaling stimulated by plated recombinant Dll1-ext-Fc in a plated ligand assay. The right scatterplot shows the effect of Notch ligand stimulation of C2C12-Nkd by comparing expression in the + vs. - plated Dll1-ext-Fc conditions. Transcripts corresponding to key Notch pathway and target genes are colored red and labeled.</p><p>(<bold>B</bold>) Western blot showing loss of endogenous Notch2 expression in CRISPR-treated C2C12 cell lines. (Left) First Western blot performed. (Right) Repeat Western blot to confirm the original results. The red X marks a well with no sample (signal is spillover from leftmost well).</p><p>(<bold>C</bold>) RT-PCR analysis of endogenous Jag1 transcript in CRISPR-treated C2C12 cell lines. Agarose gel electrophoresis of Jag1 RT-PCR product from C2C12 wt cells and 2 CRISPR treated cell lines, 1H10 and Nkd, shows loss of Jag1 transcript (617 bp band). No RT = “no reverse transcription” control. No duplicate performed.</p><p>(<bold>D</bold>) qRT-PCR of mouse Notch transcripts (labeled on x-axis) in Notch1 and Notch2 receiver cells derived from the C2C12-Nkd clone. Cells were treated with either a negative control siRNA, siRNAs against mNotch1, mNotch2, and mNotch3 (“N1-3”), or siRNAs against all three endogenous mouse receptors and mRfng (“N1-3, Rfng”). Y-axis values are 2<sup>-ΔCq</sup> values (computed using mSdhA as a housekeeping gene) normalized to the expression level in the negative control knockdown for each gene within each bioreplicate. Black bars are the mean of three biological replicates.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The Notch signaling pathway plays important roles in many developmental and disease processes. Although well-studied there remain many puzzling aspects. One is the fact that as well as activating the receptor through a trans-activation, the transmembrane ligands can interact with receptors present in the same cell. These cis-interactions are usually inhibitory, but in some cases, as in the assays used here, they may also be activating. With a total of 6 ligands and 4 receptor there are potentially a wide array of possible outcomes when different combinations are co-expressed in vivo. Here the authors set out to make a systematic analysis of the qualitative and quantitative differences in the signaling output from different receptor ligand combinations, generating sets of &quot;signaling&quot; (ligand expressing) and &quot;receiving&quot; (receptor +/- ligand expressing cells).</p>
<p>The readout of pathway activity is transcriptional, relying on the fusion of GAL4 in the intracellular part of the receptor. Positive ligand interactions result in proteolytic release of Gal4 that turns on expression of H2B-citrine. As an indicator of ligand and receptor expression levels, they are linked via TA to H2B mCherry and H2B mTurq expression respectively. The authors also manipulate expression of the glycosyltransferase Lunatic-Fringe (LFng) that modifies the EGF repeats in the extracellular domains impacting on their interactions. The testing of multiple ligand receptor combinations at varying expression levels is a tour de force, with over 50 stable cell lines generated, and yields valuable insights although as a whole, the results are quite complex.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Taking a reductionist approach to test systematically differences in the signaling strength, binding strength and cis-interactions from the different ligands in the context of the Notch1 and Notch 2 receptors (they justify well they choice of players to test via this approach) produces a baseline understanding of the different properties and leads to some unexpected and interesting findings. Notably:</p>
<p>
- Jag1 ligand expressing cells failed to activate Notch1 receptor although were capable of activating Notch2. Conversely, Jag2 cells elicited the strongest activation of both receptors. The results with Jag1 are surprising also because it exhibits some of the strongest binding to plate bound ligands. The failure to activate Notch1 has major functional significance and it will be important in future to understanding the mechanistic basis.</p>
<p>
- Jagged ligands have the strongest ciis-inhibitory effects and the receptors differ in their sensitivity to cis-inhibition by Dll ligands. These observations are in keeping with earlier in vivo and cell culture studies. More referencing of those would better place the work in context but it nicely supports and extends previous studies that were conducted in different ways.</p>
<p>
- Responses to most trans-activating ligands showed a degree of ultrasensitivity but this was not the case for cis-interactions where effects were more linear. This has implications for the way the two mechanisms operate and for how the signaling levels will be impacted by ligand expression levels.</p>
<p>
- Qualitatively similar results are obtained in a second cell line, suggesting they reflect fundamental properties of the ligands/receptors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One weakness is that the methods used to quantify the expression of ligands and receptors rely on co-translation of tagged nuclear H2B proteins. These may not accurately capture surface levels/correctly modified transmembrane proteins. In general, the multiple conditions tested partly compensate for the concerns - for example as Jag1 cells do activate Notch2 even if they do not activate Notch1 some Jag1 must be getting to the surface. But even with Notch2, Jag1 activities are on the lower side, making it important to clarify, especially given the different outcomes with the plated ligands. Similarly, is the fact that all ligands &quot;signalled strongest to Notch2&quot; an inherent property or due to differences in surface levels Notch 2 compared to Notch1?.. The results would be considerably strengthened by calibration of the ligand/receptor levels (and ideally their sub-cellular localizations). Assessing the membrane protein levels would be relatively straightforward to perform on som eof the basic conditions because their ligand constructs contain Flag tags, making it plausible to relate surface protein to H2B, and there are antibodies available for Notch1 and Notch2</p>
<p>In the revised version this has been addressed to some extent. A figure showing the relationship between co-translated mTurquiose and surface receptor expression for some clones (Figure 1-figure supplement 1B) goes some way to address the concerns that differences in Notch1 and Notch 2 could be due to the receptor levels. The data analyzing surface ligand levels is more equivocal, (a Western blot for biotinylated surface proteins), as the levels detected vary substantially between Dll1 and Dll4 (the latter barely detectable). But as a signal for surface expression of Jag1 was obtained this rules-out one concern that this ligand was failing to reach the surface. A discussion of the caveats of the approach is warranted, to make clear the limitations.</p>
<p>Cis-activation as a mode of signaling has only emerged from these synthetic cell culture assays raising questions about its physiological relevance. Cis-activation is only seen at the higher ligand (Dll1, Dll4) levels, how physiological are the expression levels of the ligands/receptors in these assays? Is it likely that this would make a major contribution in vivo? Is it possible that the cells convert themselves into &quot;signaling&quot; and &quot;receiving&quot; sub-populations within the culture by post-translational mechanism. Again some analysis of the ligand/receptors in the cultures would be a valuable addition to show whether or not there are major heterogeneities.</p>
<p>It is hard to appreciate how much cell to cell variability in the &quot;output&quot; there is. For example, low &quot;outputs&quot; could arise from fewer cells becoming activated or from all cells being activated less. As presented, only the latter is considered. That maybe already evident in their data, but not easy for the reader to distinguish from the way they are presented. For example, in many of the graphs, data have been processed through multiple steps of normalization. Some discussion/consideration this point is needed.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>
Overall, cataloguing of the outcomes from the different ligand-receptor combinations, both in cis and trans, yields a valuable baseline for those investigating their functional roles in different contexts. There is still a long way to go before it will be possible to make a predictive model for outcomes based on expression levels, but this work gives an idea about the landscape and the complexities. This is especially important now that signaling relationships are frequently hypothesised based on single cell transcriptomic data. The results presented here demonstrate that the relationships are not straightforward when multiple players are involved.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript the authors extend their previous studies on trans-activation, cis-inhibition (PMID: 25255098) and cis-activation (PMID: 30628888) of the Notch pathway. Here they create a large number of cell lines using CHO-K1 and C2C12 cells expressing either Notch1-Gal4 or Notch2-Gal4 receptors which express a fluorescent protein upon receptor activation (receiver cells). For cis-inhibition and cis-activation assays, these cells were engineered to express one of the four canonical Notch ligands (Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, Jag2) under tetracycline control. Some of the receiver cells were also transfected with a Lunatic fringe (Lfng) plasmid to produce cells with a range of Lfng expression levels. Sender cells expressing all of the canonical ligands were also produced. Cells were mixed in a variety of co-culture assays to highlight trans-activation, cis-activation, and cis-inhibition. All four ligands were able to trans-activate Notch1 and Notch 2, although Jag1 transactivated Notch1 weakly. Lfng enhanced trans-activation of both Notch receptors by Dll1 and Dll4, and inhibited both receptors by Jag 1 and Jag2. Cis-expression of all four ligands were predominantly inhibitory, but Dll1 and Dll4 showed strong cis-activation of Notch2. Interestingly, cis-ligands preferentially inhibited trans-activation by the same ligand, with varying effects on other trans-ligands.</p>

<p>This represents the most comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the effects of canonical ligands on cis- and trans-activation, and cis-inhibition, of Notch1 and Notch2 in the presence or absence of Lfng so far. Studying cis-inhibition and cis-activation is difficult in vivo due to the presence of multiple Notch ligands and receptors (and Fringes) that often occur in single cells. The methods described here are a step towards generating cells expressing more complex arrays of ligands, receptors and Fringes to better mimic in vivo effects on Notch function.</p>
<p>In addition, the fact that their transactivation results with most ligands on Notch1 and 2 in the presence or absence of Lfng were largely consistent with previous publications provides confidence that the author's assays are working properly.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In the original version, there was a major concern about quantifying the amount of Notch receptors and ligands on the cell surface (especially Jag1) based on total fluorescence. The authors have added data to demonstrate that most of the receptors and ligands are on the cell surface, allaying most of these concerns.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in many developmental and disease processes. Although well-studied there remain many puzzling aspects. One is the fact that as well as activating the receptor through trans-activation, the transmembrane ligands can interact with receptors present in the same cell. These cis-interactions are usually inhibitory, but in some cases, as in the assays used here, they may also be activating. With a total of 6 ligands and 4 receptors, there is potentially a wide array of possible outcomes when different combinations are co-expressed in vivo. Here the authors set out to make a systematic analysis of the qualitative and quantitative differences in the signaling output from different receptor-ligand combinations, generating sets of &quot;signaling&quot; (ligand expressing) and &quot;receiving&quot; (receptor +/- ligand expressing cells).</p>
<p>The readout of pathway activity is transcriptional, relying on the fusion of GAL4 in the intracellular part of the receptor. Positive ligand interactions result in the proteolytic release of Gal4 that turns on the expression of H2B-citrine. As an indicator of ligand and receptor expression levels, they are linked via TA to H2B mCherry and H2B mTurq expression respectively. The authors also manipulate the expression of the glycosyltransferase Lunatic-Fringe (LFng) that modifies the EGF repeats in the extracellular domains impacting their interactions. The testing of multiple ligand-receptor combinations at varying expression levels is a tour de force, with over 50 stable cell lines generated, and yields valuable insights although as a whole, the results are quite complex.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Taking a reductionist approach to testing systematically differences in the signaling strength, binding strength, and cis-interactions from the different ligands in the context of the Notch1 and Notch 2 receptors (they justify well the choice of players to test via this approach) produces a baseline understanding of the different properties and leads to some unexpected and interesting findings. Notably:</p>
<p>-                Jag1 ligand expressing cells failed to activate Notch1 receptor although were capable of activating Notch2. Conversely, Jag2 cells elicited the strongest activation of both receptors. The results with</p>
<p>Jag1 are surprising also because it exhibits some of the strongest binding to plate-bound ligands. The failure to activate Notch1 has major functional significance and it will be important in the future to understand the mechanistic basis.</p>
<p>-                Jagged ligands have the strongest cis-inhibitory effects and the receptors differ in their sensitivity to cis-inhibition by Dll ligands. These observations are in keeping with earlier in vivo and cell culture studies. More referencing of those would better place the work in context but it nicely supports and extends previous studies that were conducted in different ways.</p>
<p>-                Responses to most trans-activating ligands showed a degree of ultrasensitivity but this was not the case for cis-interactions where effects were more linear. This has implications for the way the two mechanisms operate and for how the signaling levels will be impacted by ligand expression levels.</p>
<p>-                Qualitatively similar results are obtained in a second cell line, suggesting they reflect fundamental properties of the ligands/receptors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the positive and constructive feedback.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One weakness is that the methods used to quantify the expression of ligands and receptors rely on the co-translation of tagged nuclear H2B proteins. These may not accurately capture surface levels/correctly modified transmembrane proteins. In general, the multiple conditions tested partly compensate for the concerns - for example, as Jag1 cells do activate Notch2 even if they do not activate Notch1 some Jag1 must be getting to the surface. But even with Notch2, Jag1 activities are on the lower side, making it important to clarify, especially given the different outcomes with the plated ligands. Similarly, is the fact that all ligands &quot;signalled strongest to Notch2&quot; an inherent property or due to differences in surface levels of Notch 2 compared to Notch1? The results would be considerably strengthened by calibration of the ligand/receptor levels (and ideally their sub-cellular localizations). Assessing the membrane protein levels would be relatively straightforward to perform on some of the basic conditions because their ligand constructs contain Flag tags, making it plausible to relate surface protein to H2B, and there are antibodies available for Notch1 and Notch2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that mCherry fluorescence does not provide a direct readout of active surface ligand levels. As the reviewer points out, the ability of Jag1 to activate Notch2 demonstrates that expressed Jag1 is competent for signaling. Further, in some cases, Jag1-Notch2 activation can be comparable to Dll1-Notch2 activation (Figure 2A). Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we performed a Western blot for multiple expression levels for each of three surface ligands (Dll1, Dll4, Jag1) (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). This blot revealed a signal for surface expression of Jag1. Interpretation is complicated by the expected dependence of the efficiency of surface protein purification on the number of primary amines in the protein, which varies among these ligands, and qualitatively correlates with the staining intensity. While this makes quantitative interpretation difficult, this result further supports the notion that Jag1 is present on the cell surface. Finally, we note that high signaling activity need not, in general, directly correlate with surface expression levels. In fact, one study showed an example in which increased ligand activity occurred with decreased basal ligand surface levels (Antfolk et al., 2017). While one would ideally like to know all parameters of the system, including surface protein levels, rates of recycling, etc. the perspective taken here is that the net effect of these many post-translational processing steps can be subsumed into the overall relationship between the expression of the protein (which, in our case, is read out by the co-translational reporter) and its activity, which is relevant for the behavior of developmental circuits, among other systems. To address this comment, we now explicitly mention the limitation of mCherry as a proxy for surface protein, and add a reference to previous work highlighting the relationship between surface levels and ligand activity.</p>
<p>In terms of the dependence of signaling on Notch levels, the metric of signaling activity used here is explicitly normalized by the mTurquoise co-translational reporter of Notch expression to account for differences in receptor expression across receiver clones. We have added a new figure to show the variation in expression (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) and to demonstrate this normalization (Figure 1—figure supplement 5). Having said that, as the reviewer correctly points out, we cannot directly address the dependence on surface receptor levels with mTurquoise alone. To address this comment, we have added a figure that shows cotranslational and surface receptor expression for a subset of our receiver clones (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). Although antibody binding strengths may vary, it appears unlikely that higher surface levels could explain most ligands’ preferential activation of Notch2 over Notch1, since Notch2 levels were lower than Notch1 levels in both surface expression and cotranslational expression.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Cis-activation as a mode of signaling has only emerged from these synthetic cell culture assays raising questions about its physiological relevance. Cis-activation is only seen at the higher ligand (Dll1, Dll4) levels, how physiological are the expression levels of the ligands/receptors in these assays? Is it likely that this would make a major contribution in vivo? Is it possible that the cells convert themselves into &quot;signaling&quot; and &quot;receiving&quot; sub-populations within the culture by post-translational mechanism? Again some analysis of the ligand/receptors in the cultures would be a valuable addition to show whether or not there are major heterogeneities.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The cis-activation results in this paper are, as the reviewer points out, conducted in synthetic cell culture assays. Cis-activation is observed across a large dynamic range of ligand expression, possibly including non-physiologically high levels. However, our previous work (Nandagopal et al, eLife 2019) showed that cis-activation does not require over-expression, as it occurred in unmodified Caco-2 and NMuMG cells with their endogenous ligand and receptor expression levels. As shown here in Figure 4B, cis-activation for Notch2 increases monotonically and is substantial even at intermediate ligand concentrations. In other cases, cis-activation is maximal at intermediate concentrations. We agree that the in vivo role remains unclear, and is difficult to determine due to the typical close contacts among cells in tissues. Therefore, these assays do not speak to in vivo relevance. Note that we can, however, rule out the possibility of trans signaling between well-mixed cell populations at these densities (Figure 4A).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is hard to appreciate how much cell-to-cell variability in the &quot;output&quot; there is. For example, low &quot;outputs&quot; could arise from fewer cells becoming activated or from all cells being activated less. As presented, only the latter is considered. That may be already evident in their data, but not easy for the reader to distinguish from the way they are presented. For example, in many of the graphs, data have been processed through multiple steps of normalization. Some discussion/consideration of this point is needed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that in different experiments changes in a mean response can reflect changes in fraction of activated cells, or level of activation or some combination of both. In this work, most assays were conducted by flow cytometry, which provides a full distribution of cellular responses. We provided distributions for some experiments in the supplementary figures (i.e., Figure 4—figure supplement 1, and Figure 5—figure supplement 4). The sheer number of experiments and samples prevents us from displaying all underlying histograms. Therefore, we have provided all flow data sets in an extensive archive that is publicly available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://data.caltech.edu">data.caltech.edu</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.22002/gjjkn-wrj28">https://doi.org/10.22002/gjjkn-wrj28</ext-link>).</p>

<p>Impact:</p>
<p>Overall, cataloging the outcomes from the different ligand-receptor combinations, both in cis and trans, yields a valuable baseline for those investigating their functional roles in different contexts. There is still a long way to go before it will be possible to make a predictive model for outcomes based on expression levels, but this work gives an idea about the landscape and the complexities. This is especially important now that signaling relationships are frequently hypothesized based on single-cell transcriptomic data. The results presented here demonstrate that the relationships are not straightforward when multiple players are involved.</p>

<p>We appreciate this concise impact summary, and agree with its conclusions.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors extend their previous studies on trans-activation, cis-inhibition (PMID: 25255098), and cis-activation (PMID: 30628888) of the Notch pathway. Here they create a large number of cell lines using CHO-K1 and C2C12 cells expressing either Notch1-Gal4 or Notch2-Gal4 receptors which express a fluorescent protein upon receptor activation (receiver cells). For cis-inhibition and cis-activation assays, these cells were engineered to express one of the four canonical Notch ligands (Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, Jag2) under tetracycline control. Some of the receiver cells were also transfected with a Lunatic fringe (Lfng) plasmid to produce cells with a range of Lfng expression levels. Sender cells expressing all of the canonical ligands were also produced. Cells were mixed in a variety of co-culture assays to highlight trans-activation, cis-activation, and cis-inhibition. All four ligands were able to trans-activate Notch1 and Notch 2, except Jag1 did not transactivate Notch1. Lfng enhanced trans-activation of both Notch receptors by Dll1 and Dll2, and inhibited Notch1 activation by Jag2 and Notch2 activation by both Jag 1 and Jag2. Cis-expression of all four ligands was predominantly inhibitory, but Dll1 and Dll4 showed strong cis-activation of Notch2. Interestingly, cis-ligands preferentially inhibited trans-activation by the same ligand, with varying effects on other trans-ligands.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This represents the most comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the effects of canonical ligands on cis- and trans-activation, and cis-inhibition, of Notch1 and Notch2 in the presence or absence of Lfng so far. Studying cis-inhibition and cis-activation is difficult in vivo due to the presence of multiple Notch ligands and receptors (and Fringes) that often occur in single cells. The methods described here are a step towards generating cells expressing more complex arrays of ligands, receptors, and Fringes to better mimic in vivo effects on Notch function.</p>
<p>In addition, the fact that their transactivation results with most ligands on Notch1 and 2 in the presence or absence of Lfng were largely consistent with previous publications provides confidence that the author's assays are working properly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the thoughtful comments and feedback.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It was unusual that the engineered CHO cells expressing Notch1-Gal4 were not activated at all by co-culture with Jag1-expressing CHO cells. Many previous reports have shown that Jag1 can activate Notch1 in co-culture assays, including when Notch1 was expressed in CHO cells. Interestingly, when the authors used Jag1-Fc in a plate coating assay, it did activate Notch1 and could be inhibited by the expression of Lfng.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our assays, we do in fact also see some signaling of Jag1 to Notch1, especially when dLfng is coexpressed (Figure 2—figure supplement 4, formerly Figure 2—figure supplement 3). While these levels are lower than those observed for other ligand-receptor combinations, they are significantly elevated compared to baseline. In specific natural contexts, it will be important to determine whether the weak but non-zero Jag1-Notch1 signaling acts negatively to suppress signaling from other ligands, or provides weak but potentially functionally important levels of signaling. Evidence for both modes exists in the literature. To address this, we have expanded the discussion of Jag1-Notch1 signaling and added references to other work on Jag1-Notch1 signaling to the Discussion section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The cell surface level of the ligands was determined by flow cytometry of a co-translated fluorescent protein. Some calibration of the actual cell surface levels with the fluorescent protein would strengthen the results.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript reports a comprehensive analysis of Notch-Delta/Jagged signaling inclusive of the human Notch1 and Notch2 receptors and DLL1, DLL4, JAG1, and JAG2 ligands. Measurements</p>
<p>encompassed signaling activity for ligand trans-activation, cis-activation, cis-inhibition, and activity modulation by Lfng. The most striking observations of the study are that JAG1 has no detectable activity as a Notch1 ligand when presented on a cell (though it does have activity when immobilized on a surface), even though it is an effective cis-inhibitor of Notch1 signaling by other ligands, and that DLL1 and DLL4 exhibit cis-activating activity for Notch1 and especially for Notch2. Notwithstanding the artificiality of the system and some of its shortcomings, the results should nevertheless be a valuable resource for the Notch signaling community.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1)  The work is systematic and comprehensive, addressing questions that are of importance to the community of researchers investigating mammalian Notch proteins, their activation by ligands, and the modulation of ligand activity by LFng.</p>
<p>(2)  A quantitative and thorough analysis of the data is presented.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript is primarily descriptive and does not delve into the underlying, mechanistic origin or source of the different ligand activities.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the goals of this paper were largely to discover the range of signaling modes that occur. A mechanistic analysis would be beyond the scope of this work, but we agree it is an important next step.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The amount of ligand or receptor expressed is inferred from the flow cytometry signal of a co-translated fluorescent protein-histone fusion, and is not directly measured. The work would be more compelling if the amount of ligand present on the cell surface were directly measured with anti-ligand antibodies, rather than inferred from measurements of the fluorescent protein-histone fusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This issue was also raised by Reviewers #1 and #2. Please see responses to Reviewer #1, above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It would be helpful to see plots of the raw activity data before transformation and normalization, because the plots present data after several processing steps, and it is not clear how the processed data relate to the original values determined in each measurement.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We included examples showing how raw data is processed in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—figure supplement 4. The sheer number of experiments precludes including similar figures for all data sets. However, all raw and processed data and data analysis code is publicly available at (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.22002/gjjkn-wrj28">https://doi.org/10.22002/gjjkn-wrj28</ext-link>).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors use sparse plating of engineered cells with parental (no ligand or receptor-expressing cell to measure cis activation). However, the cells divide within the cultured period of 22-24 h and can potentially trans-activate each other.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>If measured cis-activation signal arises solely from trans-activation, then the measured cis-activation signal per cell should increase with cell density, since trans-activation per cell does depend on cell density (Figure 4A). However, for the strongest cis-activators (Dll1- and Dll4-Notch2), signaling magnitude is similar when these cells are cultured sparsely or at confluence, which would otherwise allow efficient trans signaling (Figure 5A). Thus, for Dll1- and Dll4-Notch2 receivers, total signaling strength per cell depends little or not at all on the opportunity to signal intercellularly. Moreover, cis-activation signal for the Dll1- and Dll4-Notch2 combinations exceeded the maximum trans-signaling levels we could achieve for the same receivers when cis-ligand was suppressed (Figure 4B). These results argue that cis interactions dominate signaling in this context. However, we have not ruled out the possibility that trans-signaling between sister cells after division contributes to the comparatively weak cis-activation observed for Notch1 receivers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>As outlined in the public review, there is a question of whether the nuclear H2B accurately reflects the surface levels of the transmembrane proteins (ligand and receptor). Clearly, it would not be feasible to check levels in all of the experimental conditions, but some baseline conditions should be analyzed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We addressed this above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1)  As mentioned above, it was unusual that Jag1 did not activate Notch1 in co-culture assays, but did activate Notch1 in plate-coating assays. The authors should add some text to the Discussion to explain why they think this is happening in their engineered cells. One possibility is that the CHO cells express Manic fringe (Mfng) which is known to reduce Jag1-Notch1 activation. Data for Mfng levels in CHO cells were not included in Supplemental Table 2. Knocking down all three Fringes in CHO cells might increase Jag1-Notch1 activation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is already addressed in a sentence in the results: “Strikingly, while Jag1 sender cells failed to activate Notch1 receivers above background (Figure 2D), plate-bound Jag1-ext-Fc activated Notch1 only ~3-fold less efficiently than it activated Notch2 (Figure 3B-D). This suggests that the natural endocytic activation mechanism, or potential differences in tertiary structure between the expressed and recombinant Jag1 extracellular domains, could play roles in preventing Jag1-Notch1 signaling in coculture.” Regarding the point about Mfng, we added a note to Supplementary Table about other CHO-K1 expression data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure 1-supplemental figure 1: Both the Notch1-Jag1 and Notch1-Jag2 cells show high expression of Jag1 in low 4epi, but any higher concentration reduces to control levels. How much of a problem is this for interpreting your data?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This was not the ideal behavior, but by binning cells by co-translational reporters for ligand expression, we were able to obtain enough cells in intermediate bins. (Note: Figure 1—figure supplement 1 is now Figure 1—figure supplement 2.)</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the level signaling is lower in sparse compared to confluent on average. This is explained by the sensitivity of the Tet-OFF promoter to culture density (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). However, the key point of this experiment is the positive correlation, which is consistent with cis-activation, and inconsistent with the pre-generation of NEXT hypothesis diagrammed in Figure 4C, which would not be expected to produce such a correlation.</p>

<p>It is also difficult to understand Figure 2_—_figure Supplement 3B, in which it appears that Jag1 induces a Notch1 reporter response when LFng is knocked down (dLfng), and how those data relate to the inactive response to Jag1 shown in the main figures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The issue here is a difference of normalization. Figure 2A in the main text is normalized to the sender expression level, i.e. relative signaling strength. By contrast, Figure 2—figure supplement 4B (previously Figure 2—figure supplement 3B) shows absolute signaling activity, which can appear higher because it does not normalize for ligand expression. For Jag1-Notch1 signaling in particular, substantial signaling required very high levels of Jag1. We have added a new figure to demonstrate these two types of normalization (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A).</p>
<p>See the Authr response image 1 below for a direct comparison of these two normalization modes using data from both Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 4B.

Normalized signaling activity is defined as reporter activity (mCitrine, A.U.) divided by cotranslational receptor expression (mTurq2, A.U.), normalized to the strongest biological replicate-averaged signaling activity across all ligand-receptor-Lfng combinations in this experiment.
