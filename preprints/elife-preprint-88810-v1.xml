<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Rats are believed to communicate their emotional state by emitting two distinct types of ultrasonic vocalizations. The first is long “22-kHz” vocalizations (&gt;300 ms, &lt;32 kHz) with constant frequency, signaling aversive states and the second, is short “50-kHz” calls (&lt;100 ms, &gt;32 kHz), often frequency-modulated, in appetitive situations. Here we are first to describe a new-type of aversive vocalizations emitted at a higher pitch by Wistar and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) in an intensified aversive state – prolonged fear conditioning. These calls, which we named “44-kHz vocalizations”, are long (&gt;150 ms), generally at a constant frequency (usually within 35-50 kHz range) and have an overall spectrographic image similar to 22-kHz calls. Some 44-kHz vocalizations are comprised of both 22-kHz-like and 44-kHz-like elements. Furthermore, two separate clustering methods confirmed that these 44-kHz calls are distinct from other vocalizations. We also show that some of rats’ responses to the playback of 44-kHz calls were more akin to that of aversive calls, e.g. heart rate changes, whereas other responses were at an intermediate level between aversive and appetitive calls. Our results suggest that rats have a wider vocal repertoire than previously believed, and current definitions of major call types may require reevaluation.</p>

<p>This new-type of vocalization was also observed in a different rat strain acquired from a different breeding colony, i.e. spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, also trained in delay fear conditioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Six of the 32 SHR tested displayed high-pitch, long, monotonous vocalizations (e.g. <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2AG</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, we analyzed 140,149 vocalizations from all fear conditioning experiments and through trial-and-error, we set <bold>new criteria</bold>, namely <bold>peak frequency of &gt;32 kHz and &gt;150 ms duration</bold> to define the new-type calls. We manually verified the results on the spectrogram using these parameters and only 308 calls (0.2%) were incorrectly assigned (i.e. exceptionally long 50-kHz vocalizations misplaced in the new-type group or borderline-short vocalizations of the new-type misplaced to 50-kHz calls). Hence the new parameters correctly assigned 99.8% of cases and are thus effective to distinguish the new-type calls in an automated fashion. Finally, 10,445 new-type calls were identified, which constituted 7.5% of the total calls during fear conditioning experiments (comp. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). These vocalizations have a peak frequency range from 32.2 to 51.5 kHz (95% of cases) with an average peak frequency of 42.1 kHz, and they exhibited 43.8 kHz peak frequency at the cluster center in a DBSCAN analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). In line with the accepted nomenclature convention, underlining the relationship with 22-kHz vocalizations, we christened this new-type of ultrasonic calls as “<bold>44-kHz vocalizations</bold>”.</p>

<title>New calls in long aversive stimulation</title>
<p>We found 44-kHz vocalizations especially in rats which received multiple electric shocks. These vocalizations were less frequent following the first trial (1.7 ± 0.9% of all long aversive calls), and increased in subsequent trials, particularly during the 5<sup>th</sup> (12.6 ± 6.5%) to 10<sup>th</sup> (24.0 ± 8.4%) trials, where 44-kHz calls gradually replaced 22-kHz vocalizations in some rats (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, Supplementary Video 1; comp <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1E</xref>). Please note, in the Wistar rats that undergone 10 trials of delay fear conditioning, majority of the 22-kHz calls were emitted after the 3<sup>rd</sup> shock, i.e. during the 3<sup>rd</sup> ITI (inter-trial-interval), while 44-kHz vocalizations were emitted in the second part of the training, i.e. 5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> ITI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). We also observed the frequencies of 22-kHz calls to gradually rise throughout fear conditioning training, i.e. during subsequent ITI (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1DE</xref>). The frequency levels of 44-kHz vocalizations also appeared to rise (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1DE</xref>) but we were unable to statistically demonstrate it. There were more 44-kHz vocalizations during fear conditioning training than testing (4.42 ± 1.27 vs. 0.30 ± 0.17 calls/min; all three experiments; p &lt;0.0001, Wilcoxon).</p>

<title>44-kHz sorted into five subtypes</title>
<p>While the majority of 44-kHz vocalizations were of continuous unmodulated frequency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), some comprised additional elements. Based on the composition of individual call elements and their relation to each other, we manually sorted the calls into five categories (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-F</xref>). If the start (<italic>prefix</italic>) or end (<italic>suffix</italic>) portion of a call was less than 1/5<sup>th</sup> the length of the following or previous element, this portion of the call was not considered in its categorization into the five subtypes. The names and descriptions of the five subtypes are: <bold>flat</bold> – single element with near constant frequency with little to no interruptions to the sound continuity on the spectrogram; <bold>step up</bold> – two elements with an instantaneous frequency jump, where the first element is of lower frequency; <bold>step down</bold> – two elements with an instantaneous frequency jump, where the first element is of higher frequency; <bold>insert</bold> – three elements with an instantaneous frequency change, where the middle element is of different frequency; <bold>complex</bold> – more than three elements with instantaneous frequency changes.</p>

<title>44-kHz and 22-kHz calls closely related</title>
<p>44-kHz were emitted in aversive behavioral situations – as 22-kHz calls are observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Both types of calls are long (usually &gt;300 ms) and frequency-unmodulated. Some of the elements constituting such as step up; step down; insert and complex 44-kHz vocalizations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-F</xref>) were at a lower frequency – typical for 22-kHz vocalizations. <italic>Vice versa</italic> we also observed 22-kHz calls with 44-kHz-like elements. Therefore, we propose that these long 22-kHz and 44-kHz vocalizations constitute a <italic>supertype</italic> group of long unmodulated aversive calls (“22/44-kHz vocalizations”).</p>
<p>We observed a stable, approximately 1.5 ratio in peak frequency levels between 22-kHz and 44-kHz vocalizations within individual rats. Specifically, in fourteen rats (13 Wistar and 1 SHR) at their transition from 22-kHz to 44-kHz calls during the fear conditioning session, the proportion between the frequencies of the long 22-kHz vocalizations and the long 44-kHz calls was 1.48 ± 0.02. Similar results were obtained for 70 step up (1.53 ± 0.03) and 65 step down (1.59 ± 0.02) 44-kHz calls – altogether suggesting a 1.5-times or 3:2 frequency ratio. This ratio and its relevance has been observed in invertebrates and vertebrates including human speech and music<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In music theory, 3:2 frequency ratio is referred to as a perfect fifth and is often featured, e.g. the first two notes of the <italic>Star Wars</italic> 1977 movie (ascending, i.e. step up; comp. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, Supplementary Audio 1) and <italic>Game of Thrones</italic> 2011 television series (descending, i.e. step down; comp. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, Supplementary Audio 2) theme songs. All of which may point to a common evolutionary basis for this sound interval and its prevalence (also discussed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>).</p>

<title>New calls form separate, distinct group</title>
<p>Next, we showed that 44-kHz calls indeed constitute a distinct, separate type of ultrasonic vocalizations as it was sorted into isolated clusters by two different methods. First, using the DBSCAN algorithm method based on calls’ peak frequency and duration, we were able to divide all vocalizations recorded during all training sessions into 44-kHz vocalizations vs. all other vocalizations as two separate clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Secondly, a clustering algorithm that includes call contours, i.e. k-means with UMAP projection done via DeepSqueak, sorted 44-kHz vocalizations of different subtypes including unusual ones (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A-F</xref>), into topologically-separate groups. Notably, flat 44-kHz calls were consistently in a separate cluster from 22-kHz calls <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3B</xref>).<bold>Specific response to 44-kHz playback</bold></p>
<p>To describe the behavioral and physiological impact of 44-kHz vocalizations, we performed playback experiments in two separate groups of naive rats (Methods, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">S4</xref>). Overall, the responses to 44-kHz aversive calls presented from the speaker were either similar to 22-kHz vocalizations or in-between responses to 22-kHz and 50-kHz playbacks. For example, the heart rate of rats exposed to 22-kHz and 44-kHz vocalizations decreased, and increased to 50-kHz calls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs 4A</xref>, comp.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>). Whereas the number of vocalizations emitted by rats was highest during and after the playback of 50-kHz, intermediate to 44-kHz and lowest to 22-kHz playbacks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs 4BC</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">S4EF</xref>). Additionally, the duration of 50-kHz vocalizations emitted in response to 44-kHz playback was also intermediate, i.e. longer than following 22-kHz playback (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>) and shorter than following 50-kHz playback (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4SG</xref>). Finally, similar tendencies were observed in the distance travelled and time spent in the half of the cage adjacent to the speaker (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4SA-D</xref>).</p>

<p><bold>A</bold> – heart rate (HR); <bold>B</bold> – the number of emitted vocalizations. <bold>AB</bold> – gray sections correspond to the 10-s-long ultrasonic playback. Each point is a mean for a 10-s-long time-interval with SEM. <bold>CD</bold> – properties of 50-kHz vocalizations emitted in response to ultrasonic playback, i.e. number of calls (<bold>C</bold>) and duration (<bold>D</bold>) calculated from the 0-120 s range. <bold>A</bold> – 50-kHz playback resulted in HR increase (playback time-interval vs. 10-30 s time-interval, p = 0.0007), while the presentation of the aversive playbacks resulted in HR decrease, both in case of 22-kHz (p &lt; 0.0001) and 44-kHz (p = 0.0014, average from -30 to -10 time-intervals (i.e. “<italic>before</italic>”) vs. playback interval, all Wilcoxon), which resulted in different HR values following different playbacks, especially at +10 s (p = 0.0097 for 50 kHz vs. 22-kHz playback; p = 0.0275 for 50 kHz vs. 44-kHz playback) and +20 s time-intervals (p = 0.0068, p = 0.0097, respectively, all Mann-Whitney). <bold>B</bold> – 50-kHz playback resulted also in a rise of evoked vocalizations (<italic>before</italic> vs. 10-30 s time-interval, p = 0.0002, Wilcoxon) as was the case with 44-kHz playback (p = 0.0176 in respective comparison), while no rise was observed following 22-kHz playback (p = 0.1777). However, since the increase in vocalization was robust in case of 50-kHz playback, the number of emitted vocalizations was higher than after 22-kHz playback (e.g. p &lt; 0.0001 during 0-30 time-intervals) as well as after 44-kHz playback (e.g. p &lt; 0.0001 during 0-10 time-intervals, both Mann-Whitney). Finally, when the increases in the number of emitted ultrasonic calls in comparison with <italic>before</italic> intervals were analyzed, there was a difference following 44-kHz vs. 22-kHz playbacks during 30 s and 40 s time intervals (p = 0.0420 and 0.0430, respectively, Wilcoxon). <bold>C</bold> – During the 2 min following the onset of the playbacks, rats emitted more ultrasonic calls during and after 50-kHz playback in comparison with 22-kHz (p &lt; 0.0001) and 44-kHz (p = 0.0011) playbacks. The difference between the effects of 22-kHz and 44-kHz playbacks was not significant (p = 0.2725, comp. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4F</xref>; all Mann-Whitney). <bold>D</bold> – Ultrasonic 50-kHz calls emitted in response to playback differed in their duration, i.e. they were longer to 50-kHz (p = 0.0004) and 44-kHz (p = 0.0273, both Mann-Whitney) playbacks than to 22-kHz playback. <sup>*</sup> 50-kHz vs. 44-kHz, $ 50-kHz vs. 22-kHz, # 22-kHz vs. 44-kHz; one character (<sup>*</sup>, $ or #), p &lt; 0.05; two, p &lt; 0.01; three, p &lt; 0.001; Mann-Whitney (<bold>AB</bold>) or Wilcoxon (<bold>CD</bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As Charles Darwin noted above<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> and other researchers have confirmed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, the frequency level of animal calls is a vocal parameter that changes in accordance with its arousal state (intensity) or emotional valence (positive/negative state). The frequency shifts towards both higher and lower levels, i.e. alterations were observed during both positive (appetitive) and negative (agonistic/aversive) situations, however, as a general rule, frequency increases with an increase in arousal. It could be argued that our prolonged fear conditioning increased the arousal of the rats with no change in the valence of the aversive stimuli.</p>
<p>The question is, why have the 44-kHz vocalizations been overlooked until now? On one hand, long (or not that long<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>), frequency-stable high-pitch vocalizations have been reported before (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>), notably as caused by intense cholinergic stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> or higher shock-dose fear conditioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, they have not been systematically defined, described or demonstrated to be a separate type of vocalization. On the other hand, 44-kHz calls were likely omitted as the analyses were restricted to canonical groups (flat 22-kHz and short 50-kHz calls), moreover – many older bat-detectors had limited frequency-range detection when stress-evoked types of ultrasonic calls were being established. Finally, 44-kHz vocalizations are emitted much fewer than 22-kHz calls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Here we established that these 44-kHz vocalizations are a separate and behaviorally-relevant group of rat ultrasonic calls. Our results bring to awareness that rats employ these previously unrecognized, long, high-pitched and flat aversive calls in their vocal repertoire. Researchers investigating rat ultrasonic vocalizations should be aware of their potential presence and to not rely fully on automated detection of high vs. low-pitch calls.</p>

<p>All conditioning procedures were conducted in a chamber (VFC-008-LP, Med Associates, Fairfax, VT, USA) located in an outer cubicle (MED-VFC2-USB-R, Med Associates) equipped with an ultrasound CM16/CMPA condenser microphone (Avisoft Bioacoustics, Berlin, Germany). Ultrasonic vocalizations were recorded via Avisoft USGH Recorder (Avisoft Bioacoustics), and rat behavior was recorded via NIR monochrome camera (VID-CAM-MONO-6, Med Associates). All procedures were described in detail before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><bold>Trace fear conditioning</bold> was performed similarly to some previous reports (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>). Rats were individually placed in the fear conditioning apparatus in one of two different contexts: A (safe) or B (unsafe). Context A was in an illuminated room with the cage interior with white light, the cage floor was made of solid plastic, and the cage was scented with lemon odor, cleaned with a 10% ethanol solution; the experimenter was male wearing white gloves. Context B was a different, dark room, with the cage interior with green light, the floor was made of metal bars, and the cage was scented with mint odor, cleaned with 1% acetic acid; the experimenter was female with violet gloves. The procedure: on day -2, each rat was habituated to context A for 20 min; on day -1, habituated to context B for 20 min; on day 0, each rat was placed for 52 min in context A; on day 1, after 10 min in context B, the rat received 10 conditioning stimuli (15-s-long sine wave tone, 5 kHz, 85 dB) followed by a 30 s trace period and a foot-shock (1 s, 1 mA) and 210 s inter-trial interval (ITI) (total session duration: 52 min). The animals were tested with the same protocol without shocks in context A (day 2) and context B (day 3). During the test session, control animals showed a lower level of freezing than conditioned animals (1.32 ± 0.80% vs. 19.72 ± 4.29% during the first 5 min in unsafe context B and 0.39 ± 0.28% vs. 9.94 ± 1.85% during 10 s following the time of expected shock in context B, results averaged from the first three out of ten trials; p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0001, respectively, Mann-Whitney); none of the control animals emitted 44-kHz calls, neither the fear conditioning day nor the test days.</p>

<title>Delay fear conditioning</title>
<p>The procedure and its results were described before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>; rats received 1, 6 or 10 conditioning stimuli (20-s-long white light co-terminating with an electric foot-shock, 1 s, 1 mA). Control animals showed a lower level of freezing than conditioned animals. There were only 4 ultrasonic calls we classified as 44-kHz vocalizations among 4,126 vocalizations emitted by the control rats during training and testing. We did not observe any difference in the number of 44-kHz vocalizations between Wistar rats with transmitters vs. without transmitters during delay conditioning training (p = 0.8642, Mann-Whitney). These two groups were therefore reported together.</p>
<p><bold>Freezing behavior</bold> was scored automatically using Video Freeze software (Med Associates). To avoid including brief moments of the animal’s stillness, freezing was measured only if the animal did not move for at least 1 s.</p>

<title>Ultrasonic playback</title>
<p>It was performed as described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> in individual experimental cages with acoustic stimuli presented through a Vifa ultrasonic speaker (Avisoft Bioacoustics, Berlin, Germany) connected to an UltraSoundGate Player 116 (Avisoft Bioacoustics). Ultrasonic vocalizations emitted by the rat were recorded by a CM16/CMPA condenser microphone (Avisoft Bioacoustics). Both playback and recording of calls were performed using Avisoft Recorder USGH software (version 4.2.28, Avisoft Bioacoustics). The locomotor activity was recorded with an acA1300-60gc camera (Basler AG, Ahrensburg, Germany). Sets of ultrasonic vocalizations presented:</p>

<p><bold>Playback procedure, rats with transmitters;</bold> as previously described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In short, after 10 min of silence, Wistar rats were exposed to four 10-s-long call sets with 5-min-long ITI in-between; the order of the presented sets was randomized with alternated appetitive or aversive playbacks.</p>
<p><bold>Playback procedure, rats without transmitters;</bold> after 5 min of initial silence, Sprague-Dawley rats were presented with two 10-s-long playback sets of either 22-kHz or 44-kHz calls, followed by one 50-kHz modulated call 10-s set and another two playback sets of either 44-kHz or 22-kHz calls not previously heard. The playback presentations were separated by 3 min ITI.</p>
<sec id="s7e1">
<title>Locomotor activity in playback</title>
<p>An automated video tracking system (Ethovision XT 10, Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands) was used to measure the total distance travelled (cm). Proximity to the speaker was expressed as the percentage of time spent in the half of the cage closer to the ultrasonic speaker. Center-point of each animal’s shape was used as a reference point for measurements of locomotor activity thus registering only full-body movements.</p>

<title>22-kHz vs. 44-kHz frequency ratio</title>
<p>A clear transition point between 22-kHz and 44-kHz long calls was observed in n = 13 Wistar rats and n = 1 SHR. In each case, ten 22-kHz calls followed by ten 44-kHz calls were analyzed.</p>

<title>Ultrasonic vocalizations clustering (two independent methods)</title>
<p>Calls of conditioned and control animals were taken from all fear conditioning training sessions (n = 218 rats). We used <bold>DBSCAN algorithm</bold><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>; a density based method, from the scikit-learn (sklearn) Python package, because of its ability to detect a desired number of clusters of arbitrary shape; with two main input parameters: MinPts (minimal number of points forming the core of the cluster) and ε (the maximum distance two points can be from one another while still belonging to the same cluster). To avoid detecting small clusters, we limited MinPts to 150 samples. The heuristic method described by Ester et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> was implemented to find the initial range of <italic>ε</italic>. All the input data were standardized. The silhouette coefficient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> was used to control the quality of the clustering. Maximizing <italic>ε</italic> among different ranges helped to select the most relevant number of identified clusters. Clustering with <italic>ε</italic> in the range of 0.14–0.2 resulted in a silhouette coefficient around 0.2–0.5.</p>

<title>K-means algorithm</title>
<p>Vocalizations of all fear-conditioned rats with 6-10 shocks and &gt;30 of 44-kHz calls (n = 26) were detected using a built-in neural network for long rat calls (Long Rat Detector YOLO R1) on DeepSqueak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> software (version 3.0.4) running under MATLAB (version 2021b, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) and manually revised for missed and mismatched calls. Unsupervised k-means clustering was based on call contour, frequency and duration variables, with equal weights assigned, and several descending elbow optimization parameters were used to obtain different maximum numbers of clusters together with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> for superimposing and visualization of clusters.</p>

<p>Olszyński and colleagues present data showing variability from canonical &quot;aversive calls&quot;, typically described as long 22 kHz calls rodents emit in aversive situations. Similarly long but higher-frequency (44 kHz) calls are presented as a distinct call type, including analyses both of their acoustic properties and animals' responses to hearing playback of these calls. While this work adds an intriguing and important reminder, namely that animal behavior is often more variable and complex than perhaps we would like it to be, there is some caution warranted in the interpretation of these data. The authors also do not provide adequate justification for the use of solely male rodents. With several reported sex differences in rat vocal behaviors this means caution should be exercised when generalizing from these findings.</p>
<p>Firstly, the authors argue that the shift to higher-frequency aversive calls is due to an increase in arousal (caused by the animals having received multiple aversive foot shocks towards the end of the protocols). However, it cannot be ruled out that this shift would be due to factors such as the passage of time and increase in fatigue of the animals as they make vocalizations (and other responses) for extended periods of time. In fact the gradual frequency increase reported for 22kHz calls and the drop in 44 kHz calls the next day in testing is in line with this.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the analysis where calls were sorted using DBSCAN based on peak frequency and duration, it is not surprising that the calls cluster based on frequency and duration, i.e. the features that are used to define the 44 kHz calls in the first place. Thus presenting this clustering as evidence of them being truly distinct call types comes across as a circular argument. The sparsity of calls in the 30-40 kHz range (shown in the individual animal panels in Figure 2C) could in theory be explained by some bioacoustics properties of rat vocal cords, without necessarily the calls below and above that range being ethologically distinct.</p>
<p>The behavioral response to call playback is intriguing, although again more in line with the hypothesis that these are not a distinct type of call but merely represent expected variation in vocalization parameters. Across the board animals respond rather similarly to hearing 22 kHz calls as they do to hearing 44 kHz calls, with occasional shifts of 44 kHz call responses to an intermediate between appetitive and aversive calls. This does raise interesting questions about how, ethologically, animals may interpret such variation and integrate this interpretation in their responses. However, the categorical approach employed here does not address these questions fully.</p>
<p>In sum, rather than describing the 44kHz long calls as a new call type, it may be more accurate to say that sometimes aversive calls can occur at frequencies above 22 kHz. Individual and situational variability in vocalization parameters seems to be expected, much more so than all members of a species strictly adhering to extremely non-variable behavioral outputs.</p>

<p>Olszyński et al. claim that they identified a &quot;new-type&quot; ultrasonic vocalization around 44 kHz that occurs in response to prolonged fear conditioning (using foot-shocks of relatively high intensity, i.e. 1 mA) in rats. Typically, negative 22-kHz calls and positive 50-kHz calls are distinguished in rats, commonly by using a frequency threshold of 30 or 32 kHz. Olszyński et al. now observed so-called &quot;44-kHz&quot; calls in a substantial number of subjects exposed to 10 tone-shock pairings, yet call emission rate was low (according to Fig. 1G around 15%, according to the result text around 7.5%). They also performed playback experiments and concluded that &quot;the responses to 44-kHz aversive calls presented from the speaker were either similar to 22-kHz vocalizations or in-between responses to 22-kHz and 50-kHz playbacks&quot;.</p>
<p>Strengths: Detailed spectrographic analysis of a substantial data set of ultrasonic vocalizations recorded during prolonged fear conditioning, combined with playback experiments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: I see a number of major weaknesses.</p>
<p>While the descriptive approach applied is useful, the findings have only focused importance and scope, given the low prevalence of &quot;44 kHz&quot; calls and limited attempts made to systematically manipulate factors that lead to their emission. In fact, the data presented appear to be derived from reanalyses of previously conducted studies in most cases and the main claims are only partially supported. While reading the manuscript, I got the impression that the data presented here are linked to two or three previously published studies (Olszyński et al., 2020, 2021, 2023). This is important to emphasize for two reasons: 1) It is often difficult (if not impossible) to link the reported data to the different experiments conducted before (and the individual experimental conditions therein). While reanalyzing previously collected data can lead to important insight, it is important to describe in a clear and transparent manner what data were obtained in what experiment (and more specifically, in what exact experimental condition) to allow appropriate interpretation of the data. For example, it is said that in the &quot;trace fear conditioning experiment&quot; both single- and group-housed rats were included, yet I was not able to tell what data were obtained in single- versus group-housed rats. This may sound like a side aspect, however, in my view this is not a side aspect given the fact that ultrasonic vocalizations are used for communication and communication is affected by the social housing conditions. 2) In at least two of the previously published manuscripts (Olszyński et al., 2021, 2023), emission of ultrasonic vocalizations was analyzed (Figure S1 in Olszyński et al., 2021, and Fig. 1 in Olszyński et al., 2023). This includes detailed spectrographic analyses covering the frequency range between 20 and 100 kHz, i.e. including the frequency range, where the &quot;new-type&quot; ultrasonic vocalization, now named &quot;44 kHz&quot; call, occurs, as reflected in the examples provided in Fig. 1 of Olszyński et al. (2023). In the materials and methods there, it was said: &quot;USV were assigned to one of three categories: 50-kHz (mean peak frequency, MPF &gt;32 kHz), short 22-kHz (MPF of 18-32 kHz, &lt;0.3 s duration), long 22-kHz (MPF of 18-32 kHz, &gt;0.3 s duration)&quot;. Does that mean that the &quot;44 kHz&quot; calls were previously included in the count for 50-kHz calls? Or were 44 kHz calls (intentionally?) left out? What does that mean for the interpretation of the previously published data? What does that mean for the current data set? In my view, there is a lack of transparency here.</p>
<p>Moreover, whether the newly identified call type is indeed novel is questionable, as also mentioned by the authors in their discussion section. While they wrote in the introduction that &quot;high-pitch (&gt;32 kHz), long and monotonous ultrasonic vocalizations have not yet been described&quot;, they wrote in the discussion that &quot;long (or not that long (Biały et al., 2019)), frequency-stable high-pitch vocalizations have been reported before (e.g. Sales, 1979; Shimoju et al., 2020), notably as caused by intense cholinergic stimulation (Brudzynski and Bihari, 1990) or higher shock-dose fear conditioning (Wöhr et al., 2005)&quot; (and I wish to add that to my knowledge this list provided by the authors is incomplete). Therefore, I believe, the strong claims made in abstract (&quot;we are the first to describe a new-type...&quot;), introduction (&quot;have not yet been described&quot;), and results (&quot;new calls&quot;) are not justified.</p>
<p>In general, the manuscript is not well written/ not well organized, the description of the methods is insufficient, and it is often difficult (if not impossible) to link the reported data to the experiments/ experimental conditions described in the materials and methods section. For example, I miss a clear presentation of basic information: 1) How many rats emitted &quot;44 kHz&quot; calls (in total, per experiment, and importantly, also per experimental condition, i.e. single- versus group-housed)? 2) Out of the ones emitting &quot;44 kHz&quot; calls, what was the prevalence of &quot;44 kHz&quot; calls (relative to 22- and 50-kHz calls, e.g. shown as percentage)? 3) How did this ratio differ between experiments and experimental conditions? 4) Was there a link to freezing? Freezing was apparently analyzed before (Olszyński et al., 2021, 2023) and it would be important to see whether there is a correlation between &quot;44-kHz&quot; calls and freezing. Moreover, it would be important to know what behavior the rats are displaying while such &quot;44-kHz&quot; calls are emitted? (Note: Even not all 22-kHz calls are synced to freezing.) All this could help to substantiate the currently highly speculative claims made in the discussion section (&quot;frequency increases with an increase in arousal&quot; and &quot;it could be argued that our prolonged fear conditioning increased the arousal of the rats with no change in the valence of the aversive stimuli&quot;). Such more detailed analyses are also important to rule out the possibility that the &quot;new-type&quot; ultrasonic vocalization, the so-called &quot;44 kHz&quot; call, is simply associated with movement/ thorax compression.</p>
<p>The figures currently included are purely descriptive in most cases - and many of them are just examples of individual rats (e.g. majority of Fig. 1, all of Fig. 2 to my understanding, with the exception of the time course, which in case of D is only a subset of rats (&quot;only rats that emitted 44-kHz calls in at least seven ITI are plotted&quot; - is there any rationale for this criterion?)), or, in fact, just representative spectrograms of calls (all of Fig. 3, with the exception of G, all of Fig. 4). Moreover, the differences between Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 are not clear to me. It seems Fig. 5B is included three times - what is the benefit of including the same figure three times? A systematic comparison of experimental conditions is limited to Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, the figures depicting the playback results (which led to the conclusion that &quot;the responses to 44-kHz aversive calls presented from the speaker were either similar to 22-kHz vocalizations or in-between responses to 22-kHz and 50-kHz playbacks&quot;, although it remains unclear to me why differences were seen b e f o r e the experimental manipulation, i.e. the different playback types in Fig. 8B).</p>
<p>Related to that, I miss a clear presentation of relevant methodological aspects: 1) Why were some rats single-housed but not the others? 2) Is the experimental design of the playback study not confounded? It is said that &quot;one group (n = 13) heard 50-kHz appetitive vocalization playback while the other (n = 16) 22-kHz and 44-kHz aversive calls&quot;. How can one compare &quot;44 kHz&quot; calls to 22- and 50-kHz calls when &quot;44 kHz&quot; calls are presented together with 22-kHz calls but not 50-kHz calls? What about carry-over effects? Hearing one type of call most likely affects the response to the other type of call. It appears likely that rats are a bit more anxious after hearing aversive 22-kHz calls, for example. Therefore, it would not be very surprising to see that the response to &quot;44 kHz&quot; calls is more similar to 22-kHz calls than 50-kHz calls. Of note, in case of the other playback experiment it is just said that rats &quot;received appetitive and aversive ultrasonic vocalization playback&quot; but it remains unclear whether &quot;44 kHz&quot; calls are seen as appetitive or aversive. Later it says that &quot;rats were presented with two 10-s-long playback sets of either 22-kHz or 44-kHz calls, followed by one 50-kHz modulated call 10-s set and another two playback sets of either 44-kHz or 22-kHz calls not previously heard&quot; (and wonder what data set was included in the figures and how - pooled?). Again, I am worried about carry-over effects here. This does not seem to be an experimental design that allows to compare the response to the three main call types in an unbiased manner. Of note, what exactly is meant by &quot;control rats&quot; in the context of fear conditioning is also not clear to me. One can think of many different controls in a fear conditioning experiment. More concrete information is needed.</p>
