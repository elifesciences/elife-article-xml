<title>Abstract</title><p>Peptidoglycan (PGN), a net-like polymer constituted by muropeptides, provides protection for microorganisms and has been one of the major targets for antibiotics for decades. Researchers have explored host-microbiome interactions through PGN recognition systems and discovered key muropeptides modulating host responses. However, most common characterization techniques for muropeptides are labor-intensive and require manual analysis of mass spectra due to the complex cross-linked PGN structures. Each species has unique moiety modifications and inter-/intra-bridges, which further complicates the structural analysis of PGN. Here, we developed a high-throughput automated muropeptide analysis (HAMA) platform leveraging tandem mass spectrometry and <italic>in silico</italic> muropeptide MS/MS fragmentation matching to comprehensively identify muropeptide structures, quantify their abundance, and infer PGN cross-linking types. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the HAMA platform using well-characterized PGNs from <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> and further applied it to common gut bacteria including species of <italic>Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus,</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia.</italic> We thoroughly explored their PGN structures accurately identified muropeptide mono-/multi-mers, and even unambiguously discriminated the structural isomers via the HAMA platform. Furthermore, we found that the cell stiffness may be correlated to the compactness of the PGN structures through the length of interpeptide bridges or the site of transpeptidation within <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> species. In summary, the HAMA framework exhibits an automated, intuitive, and accurate analysis of PGN compositions, which may serve as a potential tool to investigate the post-synthetic modifications of saccharides, the variation in interpeptide bridges, and the types of cross-linking within bacterial PGNs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Enveloping the cytoplasmic membrane, peptidoglycan (PGN) is an essential and distinct component of bacterial cell walls that maintains the defined bacterial shape, preserves cell integrity by counteracting the internal osmotic pressure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> and acts as a scaffold for other cell wall-anchored components such as proteins and teichoic acids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> PGN also provides a protective barrier for microorganisms against environmental threats, contributing to its structural rigidity. PGN is a net-like polymeric structure composed of various muropeptide molecules, with their glycans linearly conjugated and short peptide chains cross-linked through transpeptidation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> The muropeptide (i.e., PGN-repeating unit) comprises <italic>N-</italic>acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), <italic>N-</italic> acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) and a 2–5 amino acid peptide stem, where the two saccharides are linked by β-1,4 glycosidic bonds and the peptide chain covalently binds to the lactyl moiety of MurNAc. In Gram-negative bacteria, the peptide stem generally contains L-alanine, D-iso-glutamic acid, <italic>meso</italic>-diaminopimelic acid (<italic>m</italic>DAP), D-alanine, and D-alanine, while in Gram-positive bacteria, it contains L-alanine, D-iso-glutamine, L-lysine, D-alanine, and D-alanine. Although the structural composition of PGN is relatively conserved across species, the mature PGN structure remains heterogeneous and species-specific. This structural diversity is attributed to chemical modifications of the sugar backbone (e.g., <italic>O-</italic>acetylation, <italic>N-</italic>deacetylation, and <italic>N-</italic> glycolylation), alternative amino acids of the peptide stem, interpeptide bridge compositions (e.g., various number of glycine chain), and cross-linking types (e.g., 4-3 linkage, 3-3 linkage, and 2-4 linkages).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In recent years, characterizing muropeptides has become increasingly important, not only because PGN is a target for antibiotic drug design, but also because of the various roles muropeptides play as signaling molecules involved in microbial interaction, antimicrobial release, and host innate immunity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> The gut microbiota, consisting of thousands of bacteria, is a key source of PGNs in the host organisms. The signaling functions of gut microbiota-derived PGN fragments in host-microbiota interactions have been extensively studied in inflammation, metabolism, autoimmune diseases, and brain development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Therefore, analyzing the PGN structural composition and its chemical modifications is critical to understand the PGN recognition processes and subsequent activation mechanisms in the immune system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nowadays, analytical methods for PGN architecture include HPLC, LC-MS, solid-state NMR, and AFM imaging, enabling a comprehensive study of PGN structure from chemical composition to 3-D architecture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> Online ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) is the primary strategy for muropeptide structural identification, requiring minimal sample amounts and time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> However, peak annotation and MS/MS spectra alignment still mostly relies on manual inspection of experienced biological chemists. Previous work published by Bern <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated on the analysis of muropeptide monomers with MS/MS fragmentation spectra by commercial Byonic peptide identification software.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> Later, PGFinder showed consistent and reproducible data analysis of Gram-negative bacterial PGN with MS1 library searching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> Although they both demonstrated great success in identifying muropeptide monomers, the accurate identification of muropeptide multimers and other various bacterial PGN structures still remains unresolved. This is because deciphering the compositions requires MS/MS fragmentation, but it is still challenging to automatically annotate MS/MS spectra from these complex muropeptide structures.</p>
<p>Here, we developed an in-house, high-throughput automated muropeptide analysis (HAMA) platform that simplifies muropeptide structures to sequence format, making it compatible with the (glyco-)proteomics-like “bottom-up” approach. We then established a comprehensive <italic>in silico</italic> MS/MS fragmentation database for muropeptide identification. Using this platform coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry, we revealed the PGN compositions of common gut bacteria (some of which are Gram-positive), including species from <italic>Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus,</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic>.</p>

<title>Peptidoglycan extraction and mutanolysin digestion</title>
<p>The extraction of peptidoglycan was performed using a previously described method, with some modifications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> Ten milliliters of the overnight culture that has reached the stationary phase were harvested and lysed by 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution in 0.1 M Tris/HCl (pH 7.0). The SDS lysate was boiled for 30 minutes at 100 □ in a heating block and spun down at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes. In order to wash out SDS thoroughly, the pellet was resuspended with 1 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes, and removed supernatant. After washed with H<sub>2</sub>O three times, the pellet was resuspended in 750 μL of H<sub>2</sub>O and sonicated for 30 minutes. The suspension was spiked with 750 μL of 0.1 M Tris/HCl solution (pH 7.0) and treated with DNase and RNase at 37 □ in a shaker for 1 hour. After the removal of residual nucleic acids, the suspension was subsequently treated with pronase to digest cell wall-bound proteins (final concentration of 0.1 μg/mL for 16 hours at the same conditions). The pronase-treated cell walls were washed twice with H<sub>2</sub>O before wall teichoic acids were released by 1 mL of 1 N HCl incubation for 4 hours. Insoluble peptidoglycans were washed with H<sub>2</sub>O until pH 5-6 and resuspended in 200-500 μL of 12.5 mM sodium dihydrogen-phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 3.0. One hundred microliters of insoluble peptidoglycan suspensions were digested overnight with 1 μL of mutanolysin solution (1.000 U/mL in H<sub>2</sub>O). Following mutanolysin inactivation (100 □ boiling for 3 minutes) and centrifugation (5 minutes at 10,000 rpm), the supernatants were spiked with 50 μL of reduction solution (10 mg/mL sodium borohydride in 250 mM borate buffer at pH 9.0). After 20 minutes incubation at room temperature, the reduction reaction was stopped by adding 1 μL of phosphoric acid (98%), resulting in pH 2-3. Reduced muropeptide samples were subsequently analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS.</p>

<title>UPLC-MS/MS analysis of muropeptides</title>
<p>UPLC-MS/MS analysis was performed by a Dionex UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system coupled to a Q-Exactive Plus hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Soluble muropeptides were separated by an ACQUITY UPLC CSH C18 column (130 □, 1.7 μm, 2.1 mm X 100 mm), with a solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) as the mobile phase. A flow rate of 0.25 mL/min and 1% mobile phase B were applied in column condition. The injection volume of each sample was 5 μL. An elution gradient was run for 25 minutes: starting with 1% solvent B for 0-2 min; 1-20% B (linear), 2-15 min, 20-95% B (linear), 15-17 min; 95% B, 17-19 min; 95-1% B (linear), 19-21 min; 1% B, 21-25 min for re-equilibration. The column temperature was controlled at 52 □ throughout the whole analysis program. A Heat electrospray ionization (HESI) source was operated in positive mode, with parameters automatically optimized under a flow rate of 250 μL/min (a capillary temperature of 300 □, a probe temperature of 300 □, and a spray voltage of 3.5 kV). Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode was used in the instrument. A mass range of MS1 acquisition was from 400 to 2,000 <italic>m/z</italic> at a resolution of 70,000 and the top 5 most abundant ions were subjected to higher-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) fragmentation with Δ<italic>m/z</italic> 3 isolation window, stepped normalized collision energy (NCE) at 20, 25, and 35 (A.U.), and dynamic exclusion time of 4 sec.</p>

<title>HAMA platform: a High-throughput Automated Muropeptide Analysis for Identification of PGN Fragments</title>
<p>Identification and structural analysis of PGNs are time-consuming and challenging due to the complex compositions and modifications. Herein, we developed a high-throughput and automated platform for PGN structural analysis inspired by the (glyco-)proteomic “bottom-up” approach. However, unlike proteins are 1-D amino acid sequences, the PGN is composed by various muropeptides that are intertwined by their glycans and peptide stems. Hence, we first simplified the muropeptide structures as 1-line muropeptide sequences while preserving their complex linkage compositions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>, b). Based on the prior knowledge of all possible compositions and modifications of the bacteria species, we used <italic>DBuilder</italic> to build the species-specific database. Subsequently, we analyzed the MS data with <italic>Analyzer</italic> along with the possible <italic>b-</italic> and <italic>y-</italic> ions of CID/HCD fragmentation generated <italic>in silico</italic>. The above-mentioned automated identification processes are compiled in the HAMA platform, a MATLAB-based software with a user-friendly graphic user interface (Supplementary Figure 1 and Additional Files) that includes three parts: <italic>DBuilder</italic>, <italic>Analyzer</italic>, and <italic>Viewer</italic>.</p>

<caption><title>Schematic representation of the high-throughput automated muropeptide analysis (HAMA) framework.</title>
<p>(a) The peptidoglycans of bacteria were extracted and purified, followed by mutanolysin digestion. The resulting muropeptide products are analyzed by UHPLC-MS/MS and identified using the HAMA platform. The HAMA strategy involves simplifying muropeptide structures to sequence format, which facilitates the database construction and <italic>in silico</italic> generation of <italic>b-</italic> and <italic>y-</italic> ion fragmentation spectra for matching. Muropeptide symbols: B, <italic>N-</italic>acetylglucosamine; M, <italic>N-</italic>acetylmuraminitol (without lactyl group); l, lactic acid; A, alanine; E, glutamic acid; H, diaminopimelic acid. (b) <italic>DBuilder</italic> constructs a muropeptide database containing monomers, dimers, and trimers with two types of linkage: glycosidic bonds (Gb) and peptide bonds (Pb). For peptide linkages, the direct way is through a direct covalent bond between the penultimate D-Ala of a donor stem and <italic>m</italic>DAP residue in the neighboring acceptor stem, and the indirect way is via an interpeptide bridge branching from the lysine. Donor peptides are labeled in red, and acceptor peptides are labeled in black. (c) The flowchart outlines the LC-MS data processing in <italic>Analyzer</italic>.</p></caption>

<p>(i) <bold><italic>DBuilder</italic></bold> <italic>for Species-specific muropeptide database construction.</italic> In order to construct muropeptide databases <italic>in silico</italic>, we named each residue in the muropeptide with a distinct letter and simplified the muropeptide structure into a 1-line sequence format (all representation letters of monosaccharides and amino acids are listed in Supplementary Table 2). Muropeptide sequences were structured with dashes representing peptide/glycosidic bonds and parentheses to discriminate certain subunits. Based on their known (or putative) PGN structures, all possible combinations of GlcNAc, MurNAc and peptide were input into <italic>DBuilder</italic> to generate a comprehensive database that contains monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric muropeptides (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). Herein, we constructed PGN multimers using two types of polymerization events: transglycosylation connected via glycosidic bonds, and transpeptidation linked through peptide bonds. In <italic>DBuilder</italic>, the type of peptide linkage used was the common 4-3 cross-link, which could be achieved either directly through a covalent bond between the penultimate D-Ala and the third residue in the acceptor peptide stem, or via an interpeptide bridge. We also considered that the terminal D-Ala (at the fifth position) in the donor stem was not allowed during the transpeptidation reaction. In addition, choosing more possible modifications (anhydro MurNAc residues, deacetyl GlcNAc residues, acetyl MurNAc residues, and amidated iso-Glu) to construct a PGN database could lead to severe mass coincidence issues for MS1 searching in the <italic>Analyzer</italic>. Hence, we set a maximum modification number of six to avoid generating multi-modified muropeptide candidates. Finally, the species-specific muropeptide database was outputted to a *.csv format file, including muropeptide sequences and corresponding chemical formula and theoretical monoisotopic mass.</p>
<p>(ii) <bold><italic>Analyzer</italic></bold> <italic>for analysis of muropeptide MS raw files. Analyzer</italic> is an integrated tool for processing MS data and identifying muropeptides. The flowchart is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>. First, the species-specific database, MS raw file (mzXML format),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and parameters were loaded into <italic>Analyzer</italic>. Parameters were originally set with MS1 range <italic>m/z</italic> 400-2000, retention time range 2- 12 min, mass tolerance of 10 ppm (orbitrap mass spectrometry data), intensity threshold of 1e5, etc., which could be input by users for different experimental conditions. Then, the mzXML file was processed sequentially by peak picking, deisotoping, feature selection, and deconvolution. The observed masses were searched against the loaded database within 10 ppm tolerance. However, in cases where the observed mass matched more than one inferred sequence in MS1 searching, <italic>Analyzer</italic> compared the MS/MS spectra of those MS1 matched features to <italic>in silico</italic> MS/MS fragmentation spectra of corresponding inferred candidates through cosine similarity and matched peak score (MPS, the number of the matched peaks divided by the number of the predicted peaks) calculation. The observed mass was then identified as the sequence with the highest matching score. Lastly, all identified muropeptides were merged into an Excel spreadsheet reporting charge state, molecular weight, retention time, peak intensity, peak area, sequence, main scan number, cosine similarity, score, etc. <italic>Analyze</italic>r also outputted a base peak chromatogram with peak annotations and a result file (in MATLAB data) for <italic>Viewer</italic> input.

<title>Demonstration of the HAMA Platform Using Well-characterized PGNs of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic></title>
<p>As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated the HAMA platform using well-characterized peptidoglycans from Gram-negative <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DH5α and Gram-positive <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> SA113. The typical PGN subunit of <italic>E. coli</italic> is GlcNAc – MurNAc – L-Ala – D-iGlu – <italic>m</italic>DAP – D-Ala – D-Ala, represented as a sequence of B-M-l(-A-E-H-A-A) in the HAMA platform. For <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the classic PGN structure is a disaccharide-pentapeptide with the Gly<sub>5</sub> interpeptide bridge branching from the lysine, which is simplified as B-M-l(-A-Q-(G-G-G-G-G-)K-A-A. Based on the analyzed input dataset, approximately 70% of the peak area in the base peak chromatograms was assigned to muropeptide signals, which allowed for a comprehensive PGN mapping (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, c). The HAMA platform successfully identified <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> muropeptides, and their XICs and MS/MS matching spectra could be visualized in <italic>Viewer</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>, d). In total, 28 and 89 unique muropeptides were identified in PGNs of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, respectively. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> lists overviews of the main muropeptide peaks in the chromatograms. Upon examining the entire identification results, we found that some muropeptides were eluted in multiple retention times due to the existence of a few abundant stereoisomers. Additionally, a few monosaccharide muropeptides identified as the loss of GlcNAc could be recognized as in-source fragments by exact co-elution.</p>

<p>In the <italic>E. coli</italic> data, the most abundant muropeptides were disaccharide-tetrapeptide (Tetra monomer) and disaccharide-tetrapeptide-disaccharide-tetrapeptide (Tetra-Tetra dimer).

The most abundant cross-linked dimer was disaccharide-tetrapeptide-disaccharide-pentapeptide, which contains a total of ten Gly residues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> We also characterized the known modifications and structural variations within <italic>S. aureus</italic> peptidoglycan, such as <italic>O-</italic>acetylation of MurNAc, the presence of D-iGlu (non-amidated) in the stem peptides, and the length variation of the interpeptide bridge. The high-throughput analysis allowed for the identification of monomeric muropeptides consisting of one to nine Gly residues and dimeric muropeptides containing a total of five to fourteen Gly residues in a single analysis. However, due to the insufficient structural information in the peptide backbone provided by the HCD fragmentation spectra, the exact number of Gly residues harbored in each PGN unit could not be determined. Hence, further careful analysis and manual verification are required to confirm the identity of identified muropeptides, particularly for low-score dimers and trimers. Collectively, these results provide valuable insights into the PGN compositions and architectures.</p>

<title>Characterizing Gut Bacterial PGN Compositions and Resolving Isomeric Muropeptides</title>
<p>Over the past two decades, an increasing number of gut microbial species have been found to be associated with human health. In addition, emerging evidence has supported the notion that gut microbial muropeptides work as signaling molecules that mediate host−microbiome interactions in metabolism, gut homeostasis, and immunity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> However, little has been discussed about the structures of PGN fragments due to the diversity and complexity of gut bacterial PGNs and the lack of an efficient analytical tool.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> To date, most of the structural information on gut bacterial peptidoglycan comes from reports published between 1970 to 2000,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> whereas that of the health-promoting gut microbes discovered in the last two decades have been rarely reported. Therefore, we utilized the HAMA platform to investigate the specific PGN structures of several common gut bacterial species from <italic>Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus,</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic>. We collected LC-MS/MS data of purified peptidoglycans from ten gut bacterial species and identified those with the self-built species-specific muropeptide databases. Overall, the base peak chromatograms of each species showed approximately 70% of peaks were annotated as muropeptides, and these elution profiles reflected the actual composition and organization within the peptidoglycan architecture. Additionally, the structural compositions of these purified peptidoglycans are consistent with previous reports, listed in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The muropeptide profiles of the species in this study are summarized in Supplementary Table 3-12.</p>

<p>In the identification results of Gram-positive gut bacterial peptidoglycans, the main muropeptide sequence is GlcNAc – MurNAc – L-Ala – D-iGln – L-Lys – D-Ala – D-Ala, in which the second amino acid of the stem peptide is usually amidated to D-iGln from D-iGlu. This chemical modification is done by the MurT or GatD biosynthetic enzyme and is supposed to control the PGN cross-linking levels, which has recently been demonstrated using labeled PGN stem mimics in certain species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> Another unique feature is L-ornithine (L-Orn) at the third position of the stem peptide. Unlike L-lysine, which is a usual feature of Gram-positive peptidoglycans, L-Orn is a non-proteinogenic amino acid and has been found in the peptidoglycan of certain <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> species before.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> As anticipated, we identified the L-Orn-harbored muropeptides in <italic>B. bifidum</italic> and <italic>B. longum</italic> peptidoglycans. The most species-specific variation among Bifidobacterial PGN was the architecture of the interpeptide bridge, such as Gly, Ser-Asp, and Ser-Ala-Thr-Ala, which corresponded to <italic>B. breve, B. bifidum,</italic> and <italic>B. longum</italic> species. This structural diversity arouses our interest in the relationship between the length of an interpeptide bridge and the physical property of the bacterial cell envelope, which will be discussed in a later section.</p>
<p>In the peptidoglycans of <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5), we observed the monomeric structure of GlcNAc – MurNAc – L-Ala – D-iGln – L-Lys – D-Ala – D-Ala, which harbored an interpeptide bridge of asparagine (D-Asn) or aspartate (D-Asp), shortened as B-M-l(-A-Q-(N-)K-A-A) or B-M-l(-A-Q-(D-)K-A-A). In this part, we found that both B-M-l(-A-E-(N-)K) and B-M-l(-A-Q-(D-)K) had identical molecular weights since the mass difference (+ 0.984 Da) between Asn (N) and Asp (D) is the same as between Gln (Q) and Glu (E). This kind of isomeric muropeptides makes identification more complicated, but it can still be addressed by MS/MS <italic>in silico</italic> fragmentation matching under an appropriate separation chromatography. For example, two disaccharide-tripeptides separately eluted at 6.18 min and 7.02 min were found as structural isomers that existed in <italic>E. faecium</italic> peptidoglycan (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and Supplementary Table 4). Through <italic>in silico</italic> MS/MS fragmentation matching, these two isomers can be discriminated and identified as the sequences of B-M-l(-A-E-(N-)K) and B-M-l(-A-Q-(D-)K), respectively. To validate the correctness of the automated platform, we also extracted the experimental data of those isomers and manually inspected the MS/MS spectra (Supplementary Figure 2). However, this strategy did not work for the identification of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> peptidoglycan whose interpeptide bridge is composed of two alanine residues (Supplementary Table 3). In this case, two structurally isomeric muropeptides, a disaccharide-tripeptide with a bridge (B-M-l(-A-Q-(A-A-)K)) and a disaccharide-pentapeptide (B-M-l(-A-Q-K-A-A)), have similar <italic>in silico</italic> MS/MS fragmentation patterns, which often leads to misidentification. Nevertheless, the retention time still gave us information to identify them. We annotated the peak at a retention time of 3.66 min as disaccharide-pentapeptide (B-M-l(-A-Q-K-A-A)) by comparing it to an identical sequence that appeared in <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> peptidoglycan with a similar retention time (3.61 min). Therefore, the other peak at a retention time of 6.39 min could be determined as disaccharide-tripeptide with a bridge (B-M-l(-A-Q-(A-A-)K)), which had a longer retention time than the linear structure one.</p>

<title>Inferring PGN Cross-linking Types Based on Identified PGN Fragments</title>
<p>The substrates and catalyzed enzymes involved in muropeptide cross-linking have been targets for antibiotic development and antimicrobial resistance studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> Consequently, we sought not only to identify the PGN structures but also to explore the peptide cross-linking types within these gut bacterial PGNs. In general, there are two types of PGN cross-linkage: 4-3 cross-links generated by D,D-transpeptidases (Ddts) and 3-3 cross-links created by L,D-transpeptidases (Ldts) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). Transpeptidation involves two stem peptides which function as acyl donor and acceptor substrates, respectively. As the enzyme names imply, the donor substrates that Ddts and Ldts bind to are terminated as D,D-stereocenters and L,D-stereocenters, which structurally means pentapeptides and tetrapeptides. During D,D-transpeptidation, Ddts recognize D-Ala<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>-D-Ala<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> of the donor stem (pentapeptide) and remove the terminal D-Ala<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> residue, forming an intermediate. The intermediate then cross-links the NH<sub>2</sub> group in the third position of the neighboring acceptor stem, forming a 4-3 cross-link. Following this distinctive rule of PGN biosynthesis, the possible combinations of 4-3 cross-linked dimers are disaccharide-tetrapeptide– disaccharide-pentapeptide (D45) and disaccharide-tetrapeptide–disaccharide-tetrapeptide (D44). During L,D-transpeptidation, Ldts cleave the terminal D-Ala<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> residue of the donor stem (tetrapeptide) and generate a peptide bond between the third residue and the NH<sub>2</sub> group in the third position of acceptor stem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> The possible structures of 3-3 cross-linked dimers are disaccharide-tripeptide–disaccharide-pentapeptide (D35), disaccharide-tripeptide–disaccharide-tetrapeptide (D34), and disaccharide-tripeptide–disaccharide-tripeptide (D33). Hence, we could infer the possible PGN cross-linkage types and the involved enzymes based on the main PGN fragments.</p>

These results suggested that 3-3 cross-links and 4- 3 cross-links might be predominant in the peptidoglycans of ATCC 15700 and CSCC 1900 strains, respectively.

<title>Exploring the Bridge Length-dependent Cell Envelope Stiffness in <italic>B. longum</italic> and <italic>B. breve</italic></title>
<p>Peptidoglycan, a protective exoskeleton around cells, provides structural integrity to the cell.

We wondered whether the length of interpeptide bridges may be related to the bacterial cell envelope’s mechanical properties and hypothesized that the cross-linking with shorter bridges may form a tighter meshwork in peptidoglycan layers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to explore the above relevance, we selected six <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> bacteria with similar cell morphology as research objects, including three <italic>B. breve</italic> strains and three <italic>B. longum</italic> strains. We summarized the muropeptide compositions of these species (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). A slightly higher abundance of peptide-linked dimers in <italic>B. breve</italic> than in <italic>B. longum</italic> implies a higher degree of PGN cross-linking level in <italic>B. breve</italic>. Next, we directly measured the cell stiffness (defined by Young’s modulus, E) of these six bacteria using the single-cell atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique. High-resolution elasticity maps of representative cells were recorded within the central regions to avoid edge effects (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>). Overall, all <italic>B. breve</italic> were stiffer than <italic>B. longum</italic> with five times higher Young’s modulus values (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>B. breve</italic> also showed a slower enzymatic hydrolysis rate in purified PGNs, implying that the cell wall structure of <italic>B. breve</italic> is characterized by a compact PGN architecture (Supplementary Figure 4). Since <italic>B. breve</italic> strains have shorter interpeptide bridges (one instead of four amino acids in <italic>B. longum</italic>), these data may suggest that the compactness of PGN and the cell stiffness are correlated. Interestingly, among three <italic>B. breve</italic> strains, the ATCC 15700 strain showed significantly stiffer than the other strains, and it also contained more abundant 3-3 cross-linkages in its PGN (i.e., more M3b muropeptides). Computational modeling suggested a more rigid stem peptide in the conformation of L,D-cross-linking, implying the 3-3 cross-linkages may strengthen the PNG layer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> Taken all together, we speculate that a tight peptidoglycan network woven by shorter interpeptide bridges or 3-3 cross-linkages could give bacteria stiffer cell walls. However, it is important to note that cell stiffness is a mechanical property that also depends on PGN thickness, overall architecture, and turgor pressure. These parameters may vary among different bacterial strains. Hence, carefully controlled, genetically engineered strains with similar characteristics will be needed to dissect the role of cross-bridge length in cell envelope stiffness.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to develop an automated platform for identifying and analyzing the muropeptide compositions of gut bacterial PGNs. Using high-resolution MS data, we characterized PGN structures of common gut microbes, investigated their PGN cross-linking types, and evaluated the effect of bridge-length variants on the stiffness of bacterial cell walls.</p>
<p>In early 1970s, the amino acid compositions of PGN stem peptides were characterized in many bacteria species, including certain gut microorganisms. At that time, PGNs were purified and hydrolyzed under harsh acidic conditions and then separated by two-dimensional paper chromatography to determine the amino acid sequence. Based on this characterization work, Schleifer and Kandler proposed a bacterial PGN classification system that is still used today.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> In the <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillu</italic>s genera, only type A PGNs were identified, representing 4- 3 cross-linking through interpeptide bridges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> However, our study of <italic>B. breve</italic>, <italic>B. longum</italic>, and <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> revealed a significant abundance of M3b and D34 in their muropeptide compositions, implying the incorporation of 3-3 cross-linkage type within PGN network. This cross-linking type is catalyzed by penicillin-insensitive L,D-transpeptidases. We speculate that this finding may be influenced by the comprehensive mass spectrometric approaches we employed or by variations in growth condition. Moreover, we utilized the well-established enzymatic method involving mutanolysin to cleave the β-<italic>N</italic>-acetylmuramyl-(1,4)-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine linkage, which preserves the original peptide linkage in intact PGN subunits. Importantly, our HAMA platform provides a powerful tool for mapping peptidoglycan architecture, giving structural information on the PGN biosynthesis system. This involves the ability to infer possible PGN cross-linkages based on the type of PGN fragments obtained from hydrolysis. For instance, the identification of 3-3 cross-linkage formed by L,D-transpeptidases (Ldts) is of particular significance. Unlike 4-3 cross-linkages, the 3-3 cross-linkage is resistant to inhibition by β- lactam antibiotics, a class of antibiotics that commonly targets bacterial cell wall synthesis through interference with 4-3 cross-linkages. Therefore, by elucidating the specific cross-linkage types within the peptidoglycan architecture, our approach offers insights into antibiotic resistance mechanisms.</p>
<p>In most Gram-positive bacteria, the interpeptide bridges vary depending on the species and are likely associated with the PGN architectures. Although the chemical structure of PGN units has been extensively studied, the physical structure and 3-D architecture remain open questions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> A previous review by Kim et al. suggested that the length of interpeptide bridges is a key factor in determining different PGN architectures and proposed three PGN-bridge length-dependent architectures based on the orientations of cross-linked peptide stems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> The parallel-stem model, which has the smallest pore size and the highest cross-linking level, is suited for bacteria with long-length bridges. The perpendicular-stem model, with intermediate pore size, is proposed for bacteria with intermediate-length bridges, while the antiparallel-stem model, which has the largest pore size, is for bacteria without bridges. Notably, our study suggested a potential correlation between the cell stiffness and the compactness of bacterial cell walls in <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> species (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). <italic>B. longum</italic>, which predominantly harbors tetrapeptide bridges (Ser-Ala-Thr-Ala), exhibits a trend towards lower stiffness, whereas <italic>B. breve</italic>, characterized by PGN cross-linked with monopeptide bridges (Gly), demonstrates a trend towards higher stiffness. These findings suggested that it may be correlated between the increased rigidity and the more compact PGN architecture built by shorter cross-linked bridges. Future studies on the effect of quantitatively changing the PGN-bridge length on stiffness will require intensive research, considering the cross-linking densities, glycan strand lengths, PGN architecture models, and other biomolecules on the cell wall, such as lipoprotein, wall teichoic acids, and lipoteichoic acids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> These studies may provide further insight into the physical structure and architecture of PGN, which would contribute to a better understanding of the factors determining bacterial cell wall properties.</p>
<p>In the HAMA platform, simplifying muropeptide structures into sequences has facilitated the generation of <italic>in silico</italic> MS/MS fragments for spectra matching, enabling the structural resolving of isomeric muropeptides. However, there are several limitations to our study design. Our species-specific PGN database is built based on known structures and modifications reported previously. While the identified muropeptides cover approximately 70% of peak area in the base peak chromatograms, certain low-abundant muropeptides composed of uncoded amino acids or saccharides required additional MS/MS identification with manual analysis. For peptide-linked multimers, the current <italic>DBuilder</italic> only builds up 4-3 cross-linked sequences because including the 3-3 cross-link type results in severe misidentifications, as it produces similar <italic>in silico</italic> MS/MS fragmentation patterns as the 4-3 cross-links (about 88-90% similarity). However, we can infer possible PGN cross-linkages based on the type of PGN fragments obtained from hydrolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> The primary limitation is that MS/MS spectra generated by HCD fragmentation carry mostly structural information from disaccharide moiety (glyco-oxonium ions) without providing sufficient peptide fragment ions to derive peptide sequence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> making it difficult to accurately identify multimers and determine the position of modifications. Nevertheless, accurate monoisotopic masses acquired from high-resolution mass spectrometry are still informative in peptidoglycan compositional components. Alternative approaches can be considered to elucidate branched structures of muropeptides, such as breaking down PGN with cell wall amidases (cleaving the amide bond between MurNAc and L-Ala residue) to target stem peptide analysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> acquiring MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> spectra to obtain fragmentation maps, or using electron transfer dissociation (ETD) fragmentation mode to leave more peptide fragments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> Additionally, strategies commonly used in glycopeptide identification, such as multi-fragmentation modes (CID, HCD, and ETD), could also be applied to PGN identification to provide more information on peptide sequences and disaccharide structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> To achieve a more comprehensive identification of muropeptides, future work is needed to generate an expanded database, <italic>in silico-based</italic> fragmentation patterns, and improved MS/MS spectra acquisition.</p>
<p>HAMA is an innovative automated platform that constructs species-specific muropeptide databases, validates structural identification using <italic>in silico</italic> MS/MS analysis, and provides visualized results for efficient and reliable identification of muropeptides, greatly reducing the time-consuming task of manual interpretation of LC-MS/MS data. The HAMA platform has the potential to be a valuable tool for various research fields, including microbiology, pathology, molecular biology, and immunology. It has potential applications in identifying activation ligands for antimicrobial resistance studies, characterizing key motifs recognized by pattern recognition receptors for host-microbiota immuno-interaction research, and mapping peptidoglycan in cell wall architecture studies. With the ease and efficiency offered by HAMA, we believe that muropeptide analysis will become more accessible and contribute to a deeper understanding of cell wall biology.</p>

<p>This study reports a new approach to determine the architecture of peptidoglycan (PG), the primary component of the bacterial cell wall, validating the pipeline through an architectural analysis of several members of the human gut microbiota. The technique is potentially <bold>valuable</bold> for this sub-field as it would enable researchers interested in peptidoglycan in a range of organisms to easily assess muropeptide composition in an easy, automated manner. However, there is some uncertainty about whether the pipeline was fully automated and it was noted that the pipeline requires prior knowledge of the peptidoglycan composition of an organism. Additionally, the use of the technique to investigate whether PG cross-bridge length is a determinant of cell wall stiffness produced evidence that would need more direct support and is therefore so far <bold>incomplete</bold>.</p>

<p>The paper from Hsu and co-workers describes a new automated method for analyzing the cell wall peptidoglycan composition of bacteria using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS) combined with newly developed analysis software. The work has great potential for determining the composition of bacterial cell walls from diverse bacteria in high-throughput, allowing new connections between cell wall structure and other important biological functions like cell morphology or host-microbe interactions to be discovered. A downside to the method is that it does require some prior knowledge of an organisms peptidoglycan composition to generate the database for automated analysis. Nevertheless, the automation will allow rapid analysis of peptidoglycan composition under a variety of conditions and/or between closely related organisms once the general peptidoglycan structure is known. The methodology described will therefore be useful for the field.</p>
<p>The potential connection between the structure of different cell walls from bifidobacteria and cell stiffness proposed in the report is weak. The cells analyzed are from different strains such that there are many possible reasons for the change in physical measurements made by AFM. Conclusions relating cell wall composition to stiffness would be best drawn from a single strain of bacteria genetically modified to have an altered content of 3-3 crosslinks.</p>

<p>The authors introduce &quot;HAMA&quot;, a new automated pipeline for architectural analysis of the bacterial cell wall. Using MS/MS fragmentation and a computational pipeline, they validate the approach using well-characterized model organisms and then apply the platform to elucidate the PG architecture of several members of the human gut microbiota. They discover differences in the length of peptide crossbridges between two species of the genus Bifidobacterium and then show that these species also differ in cell envelope stiffness, resulting in the conclusion that PG &quot;compactness&quot; determines stiffness.</p>
<p>The pipeline is solid and revealing the poorly characterized PG architecture of the human gut microbiota is worthwhile and significant. However, it is unclear if or how their pipeline is superior to other existing techniques - PG architecture analysis is routinely done by many other labs; the only difference here seems to be that the authors chose gut microbes to interrogate.</p>
<p>I do not agree with their conclusions about the correlation between compactness and cell envelope stiffness. These experiments are done on two different species of bacteria and their experimental setup therefore does not allow them to isolate crossbridge length (which they propose indicates more or less compact PG) as the only differential property that can influence stiffness. These two species likely also differ in other ways that could modulate stiffness, e.g. turgor pressure, overall PG architecture (not just crossbridge length), membrane properties, teichoic acid composition etc.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The paper from Hsu and co-workers describes a new automated method for analyzing the cell wall peptidoglycan composition of bacteria using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS) combined with newly developed analysis software. The work has great potential for determining the composition of bacterial cell walls from diverse bacteria in high-throughput, allowing new connections between cell wall structure and other important biological functions like cell morphology or host-microbe interactions to be discovered. In general, I find the paper to be well written and the methodology described to be useful for the field. However, there are areas where the details of the workflow could be clarified. I also think the claims connecting cell wall structure and stiffness of the cell surface are relatively weak. The text for this topic would benefit from a more thorough discussion of the weak points of the argument and a toning down of the conclusions drawn to make them more realistic.</p>

<p>Thank you for your thorough and insightful review of our manuscript. We greatly appreciate your positive and constructive feedbacks on our methodology.
We have carefully reviewed your comments and have responded to each point as follows:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Specific points:</p>
<p>1. It was unclear to me from reading the paper whether or not prior knowledge of the peptidoglycan structure of an organism is required to build the &quot;DBuilder&quot; database for muropeptides. Based on the text as written, I was left wondering whether bacterial samples of unknown cell wall composition could be analyzed with the methods described, or whether some preliminary characterization of the composition is needed before the high-throughput analysis can be performed. The paper would be significantly improved if this point were explicitly addressed in the main text.
We apologize for not making it clearer. The prior knowledge of the peptidoglycan structure of an organism is indeed required to build the “DBuilder” database to accurately identify muropeptides; otherwise, the false discovery rate might increase. While peptidoglycan structures of certain organisms might not have been extensively studied, users still remain the flexibility to adapt the muropeptide compositions based on their study, referencing closely related species for database construction. We have addressed this aspect in the main text to ensure a clearer understanding.</p>

Based on their known (or putative) PGN structures, all possible combinations of GlcNAc, MurNAc and peptide were input into DBuilder to generate a comprehensive database that contains monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric muropeptides (Figure 1b).&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The potential connection between the structure of different cell walls from bifidobacteria and cell stiffness is pretty weak. The cells analyzed are from different strains such that there are many possible reasons for the change in physical measurements made by AFM. I think this point needs to be explicitly addressed in the main text. Given the many possible explanations for the observed measurement differences (lines 445-448, for example), the authors could remove this portion of the paper entirely. Conclusions relating cell wall composition to stiffness would be best drawn from a single strain of bacteria genetically modified to have an altered content of 3-3 crosslinks.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand your concern regarding the weak connection between cell wall structure and cell stiffness. We will make a clear and explicit statement in the main text to acknowledge that the cells analyzed are derived from different strains, introducing the possibility of various factors influencing the observed changes in physical measurements as determined by AFM. Furthermore, we greatly appreciate your suggestion to consider genetically modified strains to investigate the role of cross-bridge length in determining cell envelope stiffness. In this regard, we are in the process of developing a CRISPR/Cas genome editing toolbox for Bifidobacterium longum, and we plan on this avenue of investigation for future work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors introduce &quot;HAMA&quot;, a new automated pipeline for architectural analysis of the bacterial cell wall. Using MS/MS fragmentation and a computational pipeline, they validate the approach using well-characterized model organisms and then apply the platform to elucidate the PG architecture of several members of the human gut microbiota. They discover differences in the length of peptide crossbridges between two species of the genus Bifidobacterium and then show that these species also differ in cell envelope stiffness, resulting in the conclusion that crossbridge length determines stiffness.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your thoughtful review of our manuscript and your recognition of the potential significance of our work in elucidating the poorly characterized peptidoglycan (PGN) architecture of the human gut microbiota.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The pipeline is solid and revealing the poorly characterized PG architecture of the human gut microbiota is worthwhile and significant. However, it is unclear if or how their pipeline is superior to other existing techniques - PG architecture analysis is routinely done by many other labs; the only difference here seems to be that the authors chose gut microbes to interrogate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize if this could have been clearer. The HAMA platform stands apart from other pipelines by utilizing automatic analysis of LC-MS/MS data to identify muropeptides. In contrast, most of the routine PGN architecture analyses often use LC-UV/Vis or LC-MS platform, where only the automatic analyzing PGFinder software is supported. To our best knowledge, a comparable pipeline on automatically analyzing LC-MS/MS data was reported by Bern et al., which they used commercial Byonic software with an in-house FASTA database and specific glycan modifications. They achieved accurate and sensitive identification on monomer muropeptides, but struggled with cross-linked muropeptides due to the limitations of the Byonic software. We believe that our pipeline introducing the automatic and comprehensive analysis on muropeptide identification (particularly for Gram-positive bacterial peptidoglycans) would be a valuable addition to the field. To enhance clarity, we have adjusted the context as follows:</p>
<p>(Introduction) … Although they both demonstrated great success in identifying muropeptide monomers, the accurate identification of muropeptide multimers and other various bacterial PGN structures still remains unresolved. This is because deciphering the compositions requires MS/MS fragmentation, but it is still challenging to automatically annotate MS/MS spectra from these complex muropeptide structures.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I do not agree with their conclusions about the correlation between crossbridge length and cell envelope stiffness. These experiments are done on two different species of bacteria and their experimental setup therefore does not allow them to isolate crossbridge length as the only differential property that can influence stiffness. These two species likely also differ in other ways that could modulate stiffness, e.g. turgor pressure, overall PG architecture (not just crossbridge length), membrane properties, teichoic acid composition etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding the conclusions drawn about the correlation between cross-bridge length and cell envelope stiffness, we understand your point and appreciate your feedback. We revisit this section of our manuscript and tone down the conclusions drawn from this aspect of the study. We also recognize the importance of considering other potential factors that could influence stiffness, as you mentioned above. In light of this, we mentioned the need for further investigations, potentially involving genetically modified strains, in the main text to isolate and accurately determine the impact of bridge length on cell envelope stiffness.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>1. One thing to consider would be testing the robustness of the analysis pipeline with one the well-characterized bacteria studied, but genetically modifying them to change the cell wall composition in predictable ways. Does the analysis pipeline detect the expected changes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion and would like to provide a clear response. Regarding to testing the pipeline with genetically modified strains, our lab previously worked on genetically modified S. maltophilia (KJΔmrdA).1 Inactivation of mrdA turned out the increasing level of N-acetylglucosaminyl-1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-meso-diamnopimelic acid-D-alanine (GlcNAc-anhMurNAc tetrapeptide) in muropeptide profiles, which is the critical activator ligands for mutant strain ΔmrdA-mediated β-lactamase expression. In this case, our platform could provide rapid PGN analysis for verifying the expected change of muropeptide profiles (see Author response image 1). Besides, if the predictable changes involve genetically modifications on interpeptide bridges within the PGN structure, for example, the femA/B genes of S. aureus, which are encoded for the synthesis of interpeptide bridges,2 our current HAMA pipeline is capable of detecting these anticipated changes. However, if the genetically modifications involve the introduce of novel components to PGN structures, then it would need to create a dedicated database specific to the genetically modified strain.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Lines 400-402: Is it possible the effect is related to porosity, not &quot;hardness&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. The possibility of the slower hydrolysis rate of purified PGN in B. breve being related to porosity is indeed noteworthy. While this could be a potential factor, we would like to acknowledge the limited existing literature that directly addresses the relation between PGN architecture and porosity. It is plausible that current methods available for assessing cell wall porosity may have certain limitations, contributing to the scarcity of relevant studies. In light of this, we would like to propose a speculative explanation for the observed effect. It is plausible that the tighter PGN architecture resulting from shorter interpeptide bridges in B. breve could contribute to its harder texture. This speculation is grounded in the concept that a more compact PGN structure might lead to increased stiffness, aligning with our observations of higher cell stiffness in B. breve.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Lines 403-408: See point #2 above.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have explicitly addressed this point in the main text:</p>
<p>“(Section Exploring the Bridge Length-dependent Cell Envelope Stiffness in B. longum and B. breve) … Taken all together, we speculate that a tight peptidoglycan network woven by shorter interpeptide bridges or 3-3 cross-linkages could give bacteria stiffer cell walls. However, it is important to note that cell stiffness is a mechanical property that also depends on PGN thickness, overall architecture, and turgor pressure. These parameters may vary among different bacterial strains. Hence, carefully controlled, genetically engineered strains with similar characteristics will be needed to dissect the role of cross-bridge length in cell envelope stiffness.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Lines 428-429: It is not clear to me how mapping the cell wall architecture provides structural information about the synthetic system. It is also not clear how antibiotic resistance can be inferred. More detail is needed here to flesh out these points.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. To provide further clarity on these important aspects, the context in the manuscript has been revised.</p>
<p>“(Discussion) …Importantly, our HAMA platform provides a powerful tool for mapping peptidoglycan architecture, giving structural information on the PGN biosynthesis system. This involves the ability to infer possible PGN cross-linkages based on the type of PGN fragments obtained from hydrolysis. For instance, the identification of 3-3 cross-linkage formed by L,D-transpeptidases (Ldts) is of particular significance. Unlike 4-3 cross-linkages, the 3-3 cross-linkage is resistant to inhibition by β-Lactam antibiotics, a class of antibiotics that commonly targets bacterial cell wall synthesis through interference with 4-3 cross-linkages. Therefore, by elucidating the specific cross-linkage types within the peptidoglycan architecture, our approach offers insights into antibiotic resistance mechanisms.”</p>

<p>We apologize for not making this clearer. The panel a and c in Figure 2 were directly generated by the Analyzer as a software screenshot of the peak annotations on chromatogram. Our intention was to present a comprehensive PGN mapping (approximately 70% of the peak area was assigned to muropeptide signals) using this platform. We understand the label density might affect clarity, so we have added the output tables of the whole muropeptide identifications as source data (Table 1–Source Data 1&amp;2). Additionally, we have uploaded the Analyzer output files (see Additional Files), which can be better visualized in the Viewer program, and it also allows users zoom in for detailed labeling information.</p>

<p>1. Please read the manuscript carefully for spelling errors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your careful review of our manuscript. We have thoroughly rechecked the entire manuscript for spelling errors and have made the necessary corrections to ensure the accuracy and quality of the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Line 46 - &quot;multilayered&quot; is likely only true for Gram-positive bacteria.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer #2 for bringing up this concern. Indeed, Gram-negative bacteria mostly possess single layer of peptidoglycan, but could be up to three layers in some part of the cell surface.3, 4 In order to reduce the confusion, we have rewritten the context as follow:
“(Introduction) …PGN is a net-like polymeric structure composed of various muropeptide molecules, with their glycans linearly conjugated and short peptide chains cross-linked through transpeptidation.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Methods section: It seems like pellets from a 10 mL bacterial culture were ultimately suspended in 1.5 L (750 mL water + 750 mL tris) - why such a large volume? And how were PG fragments subsequently washed (centrifugation? There is no information on this in the Methods).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the mislabeling on the units. The accurate volume should be “1.5 mL (750 µL water + 750 µL tris)”. We have updated the correct volume in the Methods section (lines 99-100). For the washing process of purified PGN, we added 1 mL water, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes, and removed supernatant. This information has added to the Methods section (lines 95-98).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Line 183 - why were 6 modifications chose as the cutoff? Please make rationale more clear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer #2 for the comments. We set the maximum modification number of 6 in the assumption of one modification on each sugar of a trimeric muropeptide. A lower cutoff could effectively limit the identification of muropeptides with unlikely numbers of modifications, whereas a higher cutoff could allow for having multiple modifications on a muropeptide. In our hand, muropeptide modifications of E. coli are mostly N-deacetyl-MurNAc and anhydro-MurNAc, and modifications of gut microbes used here are mostly N-deacetyl-GlcNAc, anhydro-MurNAc, O-acetyl-MurNAc, loss of GlcNAc, and amidated iso-Glu. While we recommend starting data analysis with the cutoff of 6 modifications, users are free to adjust this based on their studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Line 339 - define donor vs. acceptor here (can be added in parentheses after explaining the relevant chemical reactions further above in the text)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. To provide greater clarity regarding the roles of the donor and acceptor substrates in the transpeptidation process, we have revised the content in the manuscript as follows:</p>
<p>“(Section Inferring PGN Cross-linking Types Based on Identified PGN Fragments) …In general, there are two types of PGN cross-linkage…. Transpeptidation involves two stem peptides which function as acyl donor and acceptor substrates, respectively. As the enzyme names imply, the donor substrates that Ddts and Ldts bind to are terminated as D,D-stereocenters and L,D-stereocenters, which structurally means pentapeptides and tetrapeptides. During D,D-transpeptidation, Ddts recognize D-Ala4-D-Ala5 of the donor stem (pentapeptide) and remove the terminal D-Ala5 residue, forming an intermediate. The intermediate then cross-links the NH2 group in the third position of the neighboring acceptor stem, forming a 4-3 cross-link.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Line 366 following - can you calculate % crosslinks based on these numbers? What does &quot;high abundance&quot; of 3,3 crosslinks mean in this context? Is this the majority of PG?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your questions. Calculating the percentage of crosslinks based on the muropeptide compositional numbers is a valid consideration. However, it's important to note that the muropeptides we analyzed were hydrolyzed by mutanolysin, and as such, deriving an accurate % crosslink value from these data might not provide a true representation of the crosslinking percentage within the PGN network. For a more precise determination of % crosslinks, methods such as solid-phase NMR on purified peptidoglycan would be required. Our research provides insights into the characterization of PGN fragments and allows us to infer potential PGN cross-linkage types and the enzymes involved based on the dominant muropeptide fragments. Regarding the phrase &quot;high abundance&quot; in the context, it indicates that the M3b/M4b monomer and D34 dimer muropeptides represent a significant portion of the hydrolysis products. These muropeptides are major constituents within the PGN fragments obtained from the enzymatic hydrolysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Line 375 - I am not sure PG is a meaningful diffusion barrier for drugs and signaling molecules, give that even larger proteins can apparently diffuse through the pores.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this point. Peptidoglycan indeed possesses relatively wide pores that allow for the diffusion of larger molecules, including proteins.5 Research has provided a rough estimate of the porosity of the PGN meshwork, suggesting that it allows for the diffusion of proteins with a maximum molecular mass of around 50 kDa.6 Considering this, we acknowledge that PGN may not serve as a significant diffusion barrier for drugs and signaling molecules. The porosity of the PGN scaffold, which is defined by the degree of cross-linking, plays a role in influencing the transport of molecules to the cell membrane. Thus, while PGN may not serve as a strict diffusion barrier, its structural characteristics still impact bacterial cell mechanics and interactions. We have revised the manuscript to reflect this understanding:</p>
<p>“(Section Exploring the Bridge Length-dependent Cell Envelope Stiffness in B. longum and B. breve) …The porosity of the PGN scaffold, defined by the degree of cross-linking, influences the transport of larger molecules such as proteins. Therefore, modifications to PGN structure are anticipated to significantly affect bacterial cell mechanics and interactions.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Line 400 - what does &quot;slower hydrolysis rate&quot; refer to, is this chemical hydrolysis or enzymatic (autolysins?). also, I am not sure hydrolysis rate of either modality allows for solid conclusions about how hard (line 402) the PG is.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. The hydrolysis rate here refers to the enzymatic hydrolysis, specifically the mutanolysin cleaving the β-N-acetylmuramyl-(1,4)-N-acetylglucosamine linkage. Indeed, there is no direct correlation between the hydrolysis rate and the hardness of PGN architecture, although the structure rigidity is a key determinant in protein digestion.7 Considering the enzymatic hydrolysis rate depending on the accessibility of the substrate to the enzyme, we proposed that the tighter PGN architecture could also lead to a slower hydrolysis rate. This speculation aligns with our observations of higher cell stiffness or more compact PGN structure of B. breve and its slower hydrolysis rate. We understand this is indirect proof, so the revised sentence now reads:</p>
<p>“(Section Exploring the Bridge Length-dependent Cell Envelope Stiffness in B. longum and B. breve) …Furthermore, B. breve also showed a slower enzymatic hydrolysis rate in purified PGNs, implying that the cell wall structure of B. breve is characterized by a compact PGN architecture.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Line 424 - I am not convinced this pipeline can detect PG architectures that other pipelines cannot; likely, the difference between previous analyses and theirs is due to different growth conditions (3,3 crosslink formation is often modulated by environmental factors/growth stage). In the next sentence, it sounds like mutanolysin treatment is a novelty in PG analysis (which it is not).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize if this could have been clearer and we have revised the paragraph to describe our study more accurately. We agree that different growth conditions could influence PGN architecture and other pipelines could manually identify the PGN architectures or automatically identify them if they are not too complex. Our original intention was to highlight the ability of the HAMA program to automatically identify unreported PGN structure. Here are the revised sentences:</p>
<p>“(Discussion) …We speculate that this finding may be influenced by the comprehensive mass spectrometric approaches we employed or by variations in growth conditions. Moreover, we utilized the well-established enzymatic method involving mutanolysin to cleave the β-N-acetylmuramyl-(1,4)-N-acetylglucosamine linkage, which preserves the original peptide linkage in intact PGN subunits.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Line 440- 442: As outlined in more detail above: I don't think you can conclude something about the relationship between bridge length and envelope stiffness based on these data.
Thank you for your valuable feedback. We agree that our data may not definitively support the direct conclusion about the relationship between bridge length and envelope stiffness in Bifidobacterium species. Instead, we will rephrase this section to accurately present the observed correlations without overgeneralizing:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>“(Discussion) … Notably, our study suggested a potential correlation between the cell stiffness and the compactness of bacterial cell walls in Bifidobacterium species (Figure 5). B. longum, which predominantly harbors tetrapeptide bridges (Ser-Ala-Thr-Ala), exhibits a trend towards lower stiffness, whereas B. breve, characterized by PGN cross-linked with monopeptide bridges (Gly), demonstrates a trend towards higher stiffness. These findings suggested that it may be correlated between the increased rigidity and the more compact PGN architecture built by shorter cross-linked bridges.”</p>
