<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron loss. Importantly, non-neuronal cell types such as astrocytes also play significant roles in disease pathogenesis. However, mechanisms of astrocyte contribution to ALS remain incompletely understood. Astrocyte involvement suggests that transcellular signaling may play a role in disease. We examined contribution of transmembrane signaling molecule ephrinB2 to ALS pathogenesis, in particular its role in driving motor neuron damage by spinal cord astrocytes. In symptomatic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (a well-established ALS model), ephrinB2 expression was dramatically increased in ventral horn astrocytes. Reducing ephrinB2 in the cervical spinal cord ventral horn via viral-mediated shRNA delivery reduced motor neuron loss and preserved respiratory function by maintaining phrenic motor neuron innervation of diaphragm. EphrinB2 expression was also elevated in human ALS spinal cord. These findings implicate ephrinB2 upregulation as both a transcellular signaling mechanism in mutant SOD1-associated ALS and a promising therapeutic target.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Astrocytes are glial cells that play critical roles in central nervous system (CNS) function and dysfunction, including in neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. In ALS, loss of upper motor neurons (MNs) in the brain and lower MNs of spinal cord and brainstem results in progressive muscle paralysis and ultimately in death, usually in only 2-5 years after diagnosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The majority of ALS cases are sporadic, while 10% are of the familial form; these familial cases are linked to a variety of genes such as Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and others.</p>
<p>While ALS is characterized primarily by MN degeneration, studies with human ALS tissue and experiments in animal and in vitro models of ALS demonstrate that cellular abnormalities are not limited to MNs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In particular, non-neuronal cell types such as astrocytes play significant roles in disease pathogenesis. Findings suggest that transcellular signaling between astrocytes and MNs may represent an important regulatory node for MN survival and disease progression in ALS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. However, the mechanistic contributions of astrocytes to ALS remain incompletely understood, hampering development of effective therapies for targeting this cell population and for treating the disease.</p>
<p>One family of proteins linked to both transcellular signaling and ALS are the erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular receptors (Ephs) and the Eph receptor-interacting proteins (ephrins) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Ephs are transmembrane signaling molecules and the largest known family of receptor tyrosine kinases in the mammalian genome. Ephs bind to and are activated by ephrins, which are either glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked (ephrin-As) or are transmembrane proteins (ephrin-Bs) also capable of signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Eph-ephrin transcellular signaling regulates many events in the developing and mature nervous system that are mediated by cell contact dependent mechanisms, including: dendritic spine formation, dendritic filopodia dependent synaptogenesis, axon guidance, control of synapse maintenance and density, and synaptic localization of glutamate receptor subunits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Eph- ephrin signaling is an important mediator of signaling between neurons and non-neuronal cells in the nervous system. Neuronal EphA binding to glial ephrin plays an important role in the morphogenesis of dendritic spines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In the peripheral nervous system, axons expressing EphA are guided to their correct target via ephrin-Bs expressed in the limb bud. Moreover, during development EphA4 is expressed by MNs undergoing programed cell death <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, while blockade of EphA4 signaling can limit cell death in models of stroke <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Thus, Eph-ephrin transcellular signaling is a potent modulator of neuronal function and survival.</p>
<p>In the mature CNS, dysregulation of Eph and ephrin signaling has been linked to a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. Expression of EphA4 in MNs significantly contributes to MN degeneration and overall disease pathogenesis in both rodent and zebrafish animal models of ALS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, while reduction of ephrinA5 worsens disease outcome in an ALS mouse model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, increased EphA4 expression levels and EphA4 signaling capacity correlate with the degree of human ALS disease severity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. While antisense oligonucleotide <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> or ubiquitous genetic knockdown <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> of EphA4 in ALS mouse models does not affect disease phenotype, inhibition of EphA4 signaling using EphA4-Fc partially preserves motor function and MN-specific genetic knockdown delays symptomatic onset and protect MNs in ALS mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In search of new targets to modulate Eph-ephrin signaling, we chose to explore ephrinB2 given previous work showing its role in astrocytes in the disease pathology of other neurological conditions such as traumatic spinal cord injury <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. We find that ephrinB2 expression in ventral horn astrocytes increases with disease progression in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS. Patients ultimately succumb to ALS because of respiratory compromise due in part to loss of respiratory phrenic MNs (PhMNs) that innervate the diaphragm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. We therefore tested in the current study viral vector-based small hairpin RNAs (shRNA) knockdown of ephrinB2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> in the ventral horn of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> cervical spinal cord <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. We evaluated <italic>in vivo</italic> effects on key outcomes associated with human ALS, including protection of cervical MNs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, maintenance of diaphragm function and innervation by PhMNs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, and overall phenotypic disease extension <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Collectively, data from our study provides insights into both disease mechanisms governing MN loss in mutant SOD1 ALS and a potential therapeutic target.</p>

<title>Increase in ventral horn ephrinB2 with disease progression</title>
<p>Eph receptor signaling has been implicated in ALS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>; however, the involvement of specific ephrin ligands in disease remains unresolved. To begin to address this question, we assessed ephrinB2 expression over the course of disease in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice at pre-symptomatic (60 days), symptomatic (120 days) and endstage time points using ephrinB2 immunohistochemistry (IHC). We focused in particular on the cervical ventral horn, as it is the location of PhMNs critical to maintaining diaphragm function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. In age-matched wild-type (WT) littermates, ephrinB2 was expressed at relatively low levels. Compared to WT controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>), there was pronounced up-regulation of ephrinB2 in ventral horn even at the late pre-symptomatic (60 day) time point (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>). EphrinB2 expression dramatically increased over disease course in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice as seen at the symptomatic (120 day) time point (Fig1 c) and at disease endstage (Fig1 d). Quantification of ephrinB2 expression in the cervical spinal cord ventral horn showed an increase in expression at 60 days (18.58 Â± 8.42 a.u. fold increase; WT vs. 60d: p = 0.048), 120 days (41.83 Â± 26.67 a.u. fold increase; WT vs. 120d: p = 0.21; 60d vs. 120d: p = 0.32) and endstage (63.42 Â± 10.99 a.u. fold increase; WT vs. endstage: p = 0.015; 60d vs. endstage: p = 0.017; 120d vs. endstage: p = 0.3) compared to WT age-matched controls (1.00 Â± 0.40 a.u.) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1e</xref>; n = 3-4 mice per group). Compared to WT control, ephrinB2 expression was also significantly increased at endstage in the thoracic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1f, g</xref>) and lumbar (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1h-k</xref>) ventral horn. Increases in ephrinB2 expression were localized to spinal cord gray matter. Higher magnification imaging from lumbar spinal cord revealed that the vast majority of ephrinB2-expressing cells within the ventral horn displayed an astrocyte-like morphology (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1j-k</xref>). These data indicate that ephrinB2 expression is upregulated in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice and suggest that increases in ephrinB2 expression might be localized to glia.</p>

<title>EphrinB2 was upregulated in ventral horn astrocytes</title>
<p>We next asked whether ephrinB2 was expressed in astrocytes. Expression of ephrinB2 was determined in neurons and astrocytes within ventral horn at disease endstage using double-IHC for ephrinB2 along with lineage-specific antibodies for reactive astrocytes (GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein) and for neurons (NeuN: neuronal nuclear protein) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. EphrinB2 upregulation was localized to GFAP-expressing astrocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1o-q</xref>) and was not co-localized to NeuN-expressing neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1l</xref>- n) (n = 3 mice). Thus, ephrinB2 expression is dramatically and selectively increased in reactive astrocytes of the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse spinal cord in areas of MN loss.</p>

<title>EphrinB2 knockdown in astrocytes of cervical ventral horn</title>
<p>Given that both ALS patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and mutant SOD1 rodents <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> succumb to disease due in part to diaphragmatic respiratory compromise, we next sought to focally reduce ephrinB2 expression in astrocytes in the region of the spinal cord containing respiratory PhMNs. To begin to test whether the increased expression of ephrinB2 might impact disease progression, we injected 60 day old SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice with either lentivirus-GFP control vector or lentivirus that transduces an ephrinB2 shRNA expression cassette <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Virus was injected bilaterally into the ventral horn at 6 sites throughout the C3-C5 region to bilaterally target the region of the spinal cord containing the diaphragmatic respiratory PhMN pool (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a-b</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. We have shown previously that this shRNA construct selectively targets ephrinB2 and that knockdown effects of the shRNA on ephrinB2 levels are rescued by expression of a shRNA-insensitive version of ephrinB2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>

Injections were made bilaterally into 6 sites throughout C3-C5 to target the PhMN pool (<bold>b</bold>). 30 Âµm transverse tissue sections of the cervical spinal cord show robust expression of the GFP reporter bilaterally within the ventral horn (<bold>c</bold>); scale bar: 500 Âµm. Cell lineage of viral transduction was assessed using three markers: neuronal marker NeuN, oligodendrocyte lineage marker Olig2, and astrocyte marker GFAP. Spinal cord tissue collected from SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> injected with Lenti-GFP vector was sectioned at 30 Âµm and immunostained for NeuN (<bold>d</bold>-<bold>f</bold>), Olig2 (<bold>g</bold>-<bold>i</bold>) and GFAP (<bold>j</bold>-<bold>l</bold>); scale bar: 150 Âµm. Quantification of transduction lineage was assessed by counting the total numbers of GFP+ cells that were co-labeled with each lineage-specific marker and expressing this as a percentage of the total number of GFP+ cells (<bold>m</bold>). We assessed the amount of knockdown achieved by the Lenti-shRNA-ephrinB2 vector by immunostaining endstage SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> cervical spinal cord tissue with an anti-ephrinB2 antibody in both Lenti-GFP control (<bold>o, q</bold>) and Lenti-shRNA-ephrinB2 (<bold>p, r</bold>) tissue; scale bar: 100 Âµm.

<p>We first determined whether our knockdown approach efficiently transduced astrocytes and reduced ephrinB2 expression in spinal cord astrocytes. Transverse sections of endstage SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse cervical spinal cord show robust expression of the GFP reporter bilaterally within ventral horn following intrapsinal injection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>). To evaluate cell lineage of viral transduction, we performed IHC on lenti-GFP transduced spinal cord tissue at disease endstage. The majority of GFP-expressing cells in ventral horn were GFAP+ reactive astrocytes; these GFAP+/GFP+ astrocytes also expressed high levels of ephrinB2, demonstrating that the lentiviral constructs targeted reactive astrocytes that included those with upregulated ephrinB2 expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2j-l</xref>). On the contrary, there was little-to-no co-labeling of the GFP reporter with NeuN+ neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2d-f</xref>) or cells positive for oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (Olig2) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2g-i</xref>), demonstrating that the injected viral constructs did not target a large portion of neurons or cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage within the ventral horn. We quantified the percentage of transduced GFP+ cells that co-labeled with GFAP, NeuN or Olig2 and found that the majority of transduced cells were astrocytes (NeuN: 3.54 Â± 1.09 % labeled cells, n = 3; Olig2: 0.18 Â± 0.18 % labeled cells, n = 3; GFAP: 56.53 Â± 5.30 % labeled cells, n = 3 mice; GFAP vs. NeuN: p = 0.023; GFAP vs. Olig2: p = 0.018) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2m</xref>). We next determined whether the lenti-shRNA vector effectively reduced ephrinB2 expression in ventral horn astrocytes. Compared to lenti-GFP control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2o, q</xref>), the lenti-shRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2p, r</xref>) reduced ephrinB2 expression by approximately a factor of 5 (Lenti-GFP: 86.92 Â± 22.35 GFP+/ephrinB2+ cells, n = 3 mice; Lenti-shRNA: 16.67 Â± 1.76 GFP+/ephrinB2+ cells, n = 3 mice mice; t-test, p = 0.035) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2n</xref>). Together, these results show that viral transduction was anatomically-targeted to the cervical ventral horn, was relatively-specific to the astrocyte lineage, and was able to significantly reduce ephrinB2 expression levels within the C3-C5 ventral horn of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice.</p>

<title>Protection of MNs in the cervical spinal cord</title>
<p>Loss of motor neurons (MNs) in spinal cord is a hallmark of ALS. To determine whether knockdown of ephrinB2 in astrocytes might impact MN survival selectively in the region of ephrinB2 knockdown, we quantified MN somata within the C3-5 spinal cord. Using cresyl violet staining of transverse cervical spinal cord sections, the number of neurons with a somal diameter greater than 20 Âµm and with an identifiable nucleolus was determined (MNs, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.

<title>Effects on disease onset, disease duration or animal survival</title>
<p>We chose to perform anatomically-targeted shRNA delivery to only the ventral horn of the cervical (C3-C5) spinal cord in order to specifically target the critically-important phrenic nucleus and to use this motor circuit as a model system to examine the impact of knocking down astrocyte ephrinB2 expression on PhMN degeneration and diaphragm innervation. As expected, given that injections were delivered only to levels C3-5, ephrinB2 knockdown in astrocytes had no impact on overall disease phenotype, including limb motor function, disease onset and progression, and animal survival, as assessed by a battery of established measurements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.

Additionally, overall disease onset as determined by the timing of weight loss onset was unaffected, with both the lenti-GFP and lenti-shRNA groups showing similar onset as determined by Kaplan- Meier analysis (Lenti-GFP: 123.5 days; Lenti-shRNA-ephrinB2 125.0 days, chi square: 0.017, p = 0.90, Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test; n = 8-9 mice per group) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref>).

We also used these grip strength measurements to calculate hindlimb and forelimb disease onsets.

There was some donor-to-donor variability; while all of the non-ALS control samples showed similarly lower levels of ephrinB2 protein expression in the lumbar spinal cord, dramatic ephrinB2 upregulation in the SOD1 mutation samples was observed with only two of the three ALS donors. The absence of ephrinB2 upregulation in the one ALS sample may be related to the anatomical progression of disease in this particular donor.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have shown that ephrinB2 is expressed predominantly by ventral horn astrocytes and that ephrinB2 up-regulation coincided with progression of MN loss and overall disease phenotype in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS. Furthermore, we found that reducing ephrinB2 expression in ventral horn astrocytes of the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse cervical spinal cord maintained diaphragmatic respiratory function by protecting cervical spinal cord MNs and preserving PhMN innervation of the diaphragm. Despite the significant impact that ephrinB2 knockdown had on functional diaphragm innervation, we did not observe effects on limb motor function, disease onset, phenotypic progression of disease post-onset, or overall animal survival. Measures such as disease duration and animal survival also depend on other MN populations such as those present in lumbar spinal cord, brainstem and motor cortex, while our targeted strategy only addresses cervical MN loss (and more specifically those MNs located only at C3-C5). That being said, PhMN preservation plays a critical role in both SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> models and human disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, and we have previously shown that focal protection of cervical enlargement MNs using glial progenitor transplantation does extend overall disease phenotype in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> rodents <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, in future work aimed at addressing more translational considerations, we can extend this approach to delivery strategies such as intrathecal injection to target ephrinB2 throughout the spinal cord neuraxis. These data with focal ephrinB2 knockdown demonstrate the important role played by ephrinB2 in MN health and muscle function in mutant SOD1-associated ALS pathogenesis and suggest that ephrinB2 is a promosing target for further investigation.</p>
<p>Other than in a relatively small number of studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, the role of Eph-ephrin signaling in ALS has not been extensively examined. Our findings suggest that astrocyte ephrinB2 may play a non-cell autonomous role in ALS, in particular in mutant SOD1-associated disease. A substantial body of work has demonstrated that astrocytes are involved in ALS pathogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, both via loss of critically-important functions such as extracellular glutamate uptake <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and toxic gain-of-function such as altered transforming growth factor Î² (TGFÎ²) signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. The dramatic increase of ephrinB2 expression observed in ventral horn astrocytes may represent an additional toxic property.</p>
<p>What is the mechanism by which astrocyte ephrinB2 contributes to MN pathology in ALS? EphA4 receptor expression and signaling capacity correlate with the degree of human ALS disease severity, and EphA4 significantly contributes to MN degeneration in several animal models of ALS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. EphA4 receptor can be activated by ephrinA and ephrinB ligands including ephrinB2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, suggesting that astocyte ephrinB2 serves as a ligand mediating pathogenic actions in ALS. Consistent with this model, ephrinB2 is upregulated in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model and reduction of ephrinB2 expression increases MN surivival near the site of ephrinB2 knockdown. Going forward, we could explore this potential interaction in vivo and in astrocyte-MN co-cultures using approaches such cell type-specific knockout of ephrinB2 and EphA4 expression, preventing ephrinB2-EphA4 binding, and EphA4 receptor kinase activity indicators.</p>
<p>Previous findings suggest that EphA-ephrinB signaling may contribute to ALS pathogenesis. Initial results showed that EphA4 plays a significant role in both ALS animal models and in the human ALS population <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Subsequent work in mouse models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> showed that genetic reduction of EphA4 in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice or intracerebroventricular delivery of an antisense oligonucleotide directed against EphA4 in both SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> and PFN1<sup>G118V</sup> mouse models of ALS did not impact disease measures. In contrast, manipulations that target EphA4 signaling such as administration of an EphA4 agonist to mutant SOD1 mouse increased both disease duration and animal survival <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. In addition, delivery of soluble EphA4-Fc that blocks ligand binding to EphA4 results in partial preservation of motor function in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Importantly, these inhibitors act via blocking the Eph-ephrin interaction or disrupt bidirectional Eph-ephrin signaling. Thus, these data are consistent with a model where reverse or bidirectional EphA-ephrinB signaling via the interaction of EphA4 with ephrinB2 may be involved in ALS. Supporting this notion, genetic knockdown of ephrinA5 (an EphA4 ligand) in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model accelerates disease progression and hastens animal death <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, which may be explained by an enhancement of the EphA4-ephrinB2 interaction in the absence of ephrinA5. While other agents are also being developed to manipulate binding of ephrins with EphA4 for ALS therapeutics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, our results suggest that directly targeting ephrinB2 is a promising strategy to modulate both Eph- ephrin signaling and astrocyte-MN interactions in ALS. Unlike the effects of knocking down EphA4 expression in ALS animal models, we observe significant MN protection, maintenance of NMJ innervation and preservation of diaphragm muscle function following ephrinB2 reduction.</p>
<p>In addition to EphA4, ephrinB2 could signal via another Eph-family protein in ALS. Consistent with this model, ephrin-B upregulation in chronic pain models results in increased NMDA receptor function and pathological synaptic plasticity via interaction with EphBs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. EphBâs are centrally involved in regulating subcellular localization of ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits to excitatory synapses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, raising the intriguing possibility that enhanced ephrinB2-EphB2 signaling results in increased glutamate receptor activation in MNs and consequently may be contributing to excitotoxicity that plays a well-known role in ALS. Thus, ephrinB2 upregulation provides a number of potential avenues for aberrant circuit plasticity that could enhance neuronal damage and contribute to ALS pathogenesis.</p>
<p>In this study, we did not examine Eph receptor expression in the PhMN pool, but only focused on ephrinB2 in the surrounding astrocytes. Nevertheless, there are several pieces of evidence to suggest that PhMNs do express a variety of Eph receptors, which are possible candidates through which astrocyte ephrinB2 exerts its actions on PhMN health. EphrinB2 binds and activates EphBs, as well as EphAs such as EphA4. Importantly, previous studies have linked expression of EphA4 in MNs to the rate of ALS progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Consistent with these studies, single-nucleus RNAseq on mouse cervical spinal cord shows that alpha MNs of the cervical spinal cord express various EphA and EphB receptors (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://spinalcordatlas.org/">http://spinalcordatlas.org/</ext-link>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. In addition, this dataset identifies a PhMN-specific marker (ErbB4); by specifically looking at the expression profile of only the ErbB4-expressing cervical alpha MNs, the data reveal that PhMNs express a number of EphAâs and EphBâs, including EphA4. To validate the expression specifically of EphA4, we find via IHC analysis that large ventral horn neurons are positive for phosphorylated EphA4 (a marker of activated EphA4) in C3-C5 spinal cord sections from the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice injected with shRNA-ephrinB2 vector or control vector (data not shown).</p>
<p>These cervical spinal cord levels include MN pools in addition to just the PhMNs; therefore, this result by itself does not conclusively show that PhMNs at this location express EphA4, though they likely do since we find EphA4 expression in most large neuron cell bodies in C3-C5. Collectively, these RNAseq and IHC data show that PhMNs express a number of Eph receptors, which could be involved in direct cell-cell signaling with surrounding ephrinB2-expressing astrocytes.</p>
<p>EphrinB2 contribution to ALS is likely an astrocyte-mediated phenomenon given the pronounced upregulation that occurs almost entirely in ventral horn astrocytes. Nevertheless, our shRNA vector does not exclusively target only astrocytes. While the majority of transduced cells are astrocytes, we did not identify the lineage of a portion of the transduced cells, which could consist of cell types such as microglia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, endothelial cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> and others, some of which have been linked to ALS pathogenesis. It is therefore possible that the effects of ephrinB2 knockdown may not only be due to effects on astrocytes. However, we observed (1) dramatic ephrinB2 upregulation in the ventral horn of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice that appears to be astrocyte-specific, (2) transduction predominately of astrocytes with our vector, and (3) significant reduction of ephrinB2 expression almost entirely in astrocytes in shRNA-treated animals. These data suggest that the effect of ephrinB2-shRNA treatment was primarily due to changes in astrocytes and that astrocyte expression is the likely mechanism underlying ephrinB2âs action in mutant SOD1-associated ALS. In future work, could address this point by employing alternative vector-based strategies or cell type-specific knockout mouse models to selectively target astrocytes alone. In the present study, we used a viral vector with the U6 type-III RNA polymerase III promotor given its utility for persistently expressing high levels of non-coding RNA transcripts such as shRNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Despite being a promotor that is not lineage-specific, we found that the majority of tranduced cells were GFAP-positive, though this transduction was still not completely limited to astrocytes. In our previous work, we instead used the Gfa2 promotor to direct highly astrocyte-specific transduction in the adult rodent spinal cord <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, which is an example of an approach moving forward to achieve astrocyte ephrinB2 knockdown in ALS animal models.</p>
<p>We previously showed that there is a modest increase in astrocyte number in ventral horn of the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model at time points following phenotypic disease onset <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. It is therefore possible that the increased ephrinB2 expression observed across the ventral horn in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> animals in the present study was due to this increased astrocyte number. However, this is unlikely to be the case, as astrocytes (and all other spinal cord cell types) in wild-type mice and in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice prior to disease onset express very low levels of ephrinB2. Throughout disease course in these SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, ephrinB2 level in individual astrocytes dramatically increases (including across most or all astrocytes), suggesting that the total increase in ephrinB2 expression across the ventral horn was not due to just this small increase in astrocyte numbers but was instead due to the dramatically elevated ephrinB2 expression observed across the astrocyte population.</p>
<p>In this study, we have shown that ephrinB2 protein expression is significanty increased in the lumbar spinal cord of postmortem samples from human ALS donors with an SOD1 mutation compared to non-diseased human samples, suggesting that this disease mechanism is also relevant to the human condition and is not restricted to only the mutant SOD1 mouse model. ALS is heterogeneous both with respect to its genetic basis and its clinical disease course (e.g., age and site of onset; severity/progression) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The majority of patients have sporadic disease that is not linked to a known heritable genetic cause, while the remaining cases are linked to a known familial genetic mutation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these familial cases are associated with mutations in a number of different genes. In addition, patients (even with mutations in the same gene) show variability in their clinical disease manifestation such as the rate of disease progression depending on, for example, the specific SOD1 mutation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms underlying this heterogeneity in human disease progression are not understood. An important consideration is whether ephrinB2âs function is specific to mutant SOD1-mediated disease or extends to more subtypes of ALS, including other disease-associated genes and sporadic ALS. To address whether ephrinB2 is a general modifier of ALS, future studies should focus on post-mortem tissue samples and pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes and MNs derived from patients with various subtypes of the disease, as well as on animal models involving other ALS-associated genes. Previous work in ALS8-linked ALS (a form of familial ALS associated with the VAMP-associated protein B gene) suggests the possible relevance of Eph/ephrin biology to ALS pathogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. In addition, EphA4 knockdown can protect against the axonal damage response elicited by expression of ALS-linked mutant TDP-43 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. These data suggest that altered Eph-ephrin signaling may not be limited to only mutant SOD1-assocated ALS, though more extensive investigation is necessary to support this idea.</p>
<p>Respiratory function involves the contribution of a number of other muscle groups, and these muscles are innervated by various lower MN pools located across a relatively-large expanse of the CNS neuraxis. While CMAP recording is a powerful assay of functional innervation of diaphragm muscle by phrenic motor axons, it does not directly measure overall respiratory function. There are assays to test outcomes such as ventilatory behavior and gas exchange (e.g., whole-body plethysmography, blood gas measurements, etc.) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. As we focally targeted our ephrinB2 knockdown to only a small area (the phrenic nucleus), we would not expect an effect on these other functional assays, which is why we restricted our functional testing to CMAP recording to specifically study the effects of ephrinB2 knockdown on the PhMN pool.</p>
<p>Interesingly, we observed relatively robust effects of focal ephrinB2 knockdown in the cervical enlargement on functional diaphragm innervation, but did not similarly find effects on forelimb motor function using the forelimb grip strength assay, despite forelimb-innervating MN pools also residing in the cervical spinal cord. However, this functional assay is impacted more by distal forelimb muscle groups controlled by MN pools located at more caudal locations of the spinal cord (i.e. low cervical and high thoracic), likely explaining the lack of effect on grip strength. The localized â yet robust â effects of ephrinB2 knockdown are consistent with the model that ephrinB2 is a target worth further exploration and validation.</p>
<p>In summary, we found astrocyte-specific upregulation of ephrinB2 expression in the ALS spinal cord, and we demonstrated that knocking down ephrinB2 in the ventral horn in an anatomically-targeted manner significantly preserved diaphragmatic respiratory neural circuitry in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice.</p>
<p>Importantly, ephrinB2 knockdown exerted significant protective effects on the centrally-important population of respiratory PhMNs, which translated to maintenance of diaphragm function <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also report significantly increased ephrinB2 expression in the disease affected spinal cord of mutant SOD1 human ALS samples. In conclusion, our findings suggest that astrocyte ephrinB2 upregulation is both a signaling mechanism underlying astrocyte pathogenicity in mutant SOD1-associated ALS and a promising therapeutic target.</p>

<title>Intraspinal injection</title>
<p>For the intraspinal injections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, mice were first anesthetized with 1% isoflurane in oxygen, and the dorsal surface of the skin was shaved and cleaned with 70% ethanol. A half-inch incision was made on the dorsal skin starting at the base of the skull, and the underlying muscle layers were separated with a sterile surgical blade along the midline between the spinous processes of C2 and T1 to expose the cervical laminae. Paravertebral muscles overlying C3-C5 were removed using rongeurs, followed by bilateral laminectomies of the vertebrae over the C3-C5 spinal cord. A 33-gauge (G) needle on a Hamilton microsyringe (Hamilton, Reno, Nevada) was lowered 0.8 mm ventral from the dorsal surface just medial to the entry of the dorsal rootlets at C3, C4 and C5. After inserting the needle into the ventral horn, we waited three minutes before injecting the viral constructs. 2 uL of Lenti-shRNA-ephrinB2 or Lenti-Control virus were delivered to the spinal cord over 5 minutes, controlled by an UltraMicroPump and Micro4 Microsyringe Pump Controller (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, Florida). After injection, the needle was left in place for 3 minutes before being slowly removed. Following intraspinal injection, dorsal muscle layers were sutured with 4-0 silk sutures (Covidien, Minneapolis, Minnesota) and the skin was closed with surgical staples (Braintree Scientific, Braintree, Massachusetts). The surface of the skin was treated with a topical iodine solution. Immediately following the procedure, mice were given 1 mL of Lactated Ringerâs solution (Hospira, San Jose, California) and cefazolin (6 mg) (Hospira, San Jose, California) via subcutaneous injections. Mice were placed in a clean cage on a surgical heating pad set to 37Â° C (Gaymar, Orchard Park, New York). At 12 and 24 hours after surgery, each animal was given an additional dose of buprenorphine hydrochloride (0.05mg/kg) and monitored for pain/distress. Mice were 60 days old at the time of virus injection.</p>

<title>Weight and grip-strength test</title>
<p>Weights were measured for each animal biweekly prior to forelimb and hindlimb testing.

Grip strength was measured by allowing the animals to tightly grasp a force gauge bar using both forepaws or both hindpaws, and then pulling the mice away from the gauge until both limbs released the bar.

<p>At 117 days of age, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (Piramal Healthcare, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania) at a concentration of 1.0-1.5% in oxygen. Animals were placed supine, and the abdomen was shaved and cleaned with 70% ethanol. Phrenic nerve conduction studies were performed with stimulation of the phrenic nerve via needle electrodes trans-cutaneously inserted into the neck region in proximity to the passage of the phrenic nerve <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. A reference electrode was placed on the shaved surface of the right costal region. Phrenic nerve was stimulated with a single burst at 6mV (amplitude) for a 0.5 millisecond duration. Each animal was stimulated between 10-20 times to ensure reproducibility, and recordings were averaged for analysis. ADI Powerlab8/30stimulator and BioAMPamplifier (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO) were used for both stimulation and recording, and Scope 3.5.6 software (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO; RRID: SCR_001620) was used for subsequent data analysis.

<p>For analysis of human postmortem tissue, we examined three non-ALS and three ALS donors. Non-diseased samples were obtained from the NIH NeuroBioBank. Age of death for these three non-ALS donors was 67, 70 and 70 years. For the ALS samples, all three donors had an SOD1 mutation (donor 1: D102H mutation; donor 2: A4V; donor 2: V87A) and all did not have a C9orf72 repeat expansion. Two of these SOD1 ALS samples were obtained from Project ALS, and the third sample was obtained from the biorepository of the Jefferson Weinberg ALS Center. These three donors succumbed to ALS at 42 (female), 55 (male) or 58 (male) years of age.</p>

<title>Immunoblotting of postmortem tissue</title>
<p>100 mg of fresh-frozen human autopsy sample (lumbar spinal cord or frontal cortex) were homogenized in 1% SDS using a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4 C to remove debris. Clear supernatant was then used to estimate total protein content using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce BCA kit #23225; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts). 30 Âµg of protein were loaded onto 10% stain- free gel (#4568034; Bio-Rad, Hercules, California). After the run, gels were activated using UV light to crosslink protein and transferred to 0.22 Âµm nitrocellulose membrane. After transfer, membrane was exposed to chemiluminescence light to image total protein. Membrane was then blocked using 5% fat-free milk in tris-buffered aaline with tween (TBST) for one hour at room temperature. Anti-ephrinB2 antibody (Cat# ab131536, RRID: AB_11156896; Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts) at 1:500 dilution in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST was incubated overnight, followed by three washes with TBST on the shaker for 15 minutes each. Anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP) secondary (#NA9340V, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) at 1:5000 dilution was prepared in 5% fat-free milk and added to membrane for one hour at room temperature with shaking. Membranes were washed 3x for 15 minutes on a shaker with TBST. Chemiluminescence signal was imaged using super signal west Atto (#38554; Bio-Rad, Hercules, California). The same membrane was used to probe for GFAP using anti-GFAP antibody (#610566; BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey) at 1:2000 dilution overnight. Membrane was washed 3x the next day with TBST and incubated with anti-mouse HRP (#NXA931V; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) at 1:5000 dilution for 1 hour at RT and washed, and then chemiluminescence was imaged as described above. Quantification for ephrinB2 was performed by normalizing to total protein using Bio-rad Image Lab software (RRID:SCR_014210).</p>

<title>Reagents</title>
<p>We authenticated relevant experimental regents to ensure that they performed similarly across experiments and to validate the resulting data. Whenever we used a new batch of the vector, we verified that the virus performed equivalently from batch-to-batch by confirming in every animal that the vector transduced predominantly GFAP-positive astrocytes and induced similar expression of the GFP reporter for each batch. For Alexa-conjugated Î±-bungarotoxin and for all antibodies used in the immunohistochemistry studies, we always verified (when receiving a new batch from the manufacturer) that labeling in the spinal cord and/or diaphragm muscle coincided with the established expression pattern of the protein. We have provided Research Resource Identification Initiative (RRID) numbers for all relevant reagents (i.e. antibodies and computer programs) throughout the Materials and Methods section.</p>

<title>Experimental design and statistical analysis</title>
<p>Before starting the study, mice were randomly assigned to experimental groups, and the different vectors used within a given experiment were randomly distributed across these mice (and within a given surgical day). For all of the phenotypic analyses, we repeated the experiment for both virus groups in two separate cohorts. All surgical procedures and subsequent behavioral, electrophysiological and histological analyses were conducted in a blinded manner. In the Results section, we provide details of exact nâs, group means, standard error of the mean (SEM), statistical tests used and the results of all statistical analyses (including exact p-values, t-values and F-values) for each experiment and for all statistical comparisons. Statistical significance was assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparisons <italic>post hoc</italic> test. T-test was used for analysis involving only two conditions. Graphpad Prism 6 (Graphpad Software Inc.; LaJolla, CA; RRID: SCR_002798) was used to calculate all analyses, and <italic>p</italic> Ë 0.05 was considered significant. While we included both male and female mice, our analyses are under-powered to examine possible sex-specific effects. Given that males make up a larger portion of the human ALS population, it will be important in follow up work to explore the possible sex-specific role of ephrinB2 in ALS pathogenesis.</p>

<body>
<p>This is a <bold>valuable</bold> study of Eph-Ephrin signaling mechanisms generating pathological changes in amyotropic lateral sclerosis. There are exciting findings bearing on the role of glial cells in this pathology. The study emerges with <bold>solid</bold> evidence for a novel astrocyte-mediated mechanism for disease propagation. It may help identify potential therapeutic targets.</p>

<p>In the manuscript by Urban et al., the authors attempt to further delineate the role with which non-neuronal CNS cells play in the development of ALS. Towards this goal, the transmembrane signaling molecule ephrinB2 was studied. It was found that there is an increased expression of ephrinB2 in astrocytes within the cervical ventral horn of the spinal cord in a rodent model of ALS. Moreover, reduction of ephrinB2 reduced motoneuron loss and prevented respiratory dysfunction at the NMJ. Further driving the importance of ephrinB2 is an increased expression in the spinal cords of human ALS individuals. Collectively, these findings present compelling evidence implicating ephrinB2 as a contributing factor towards the development of ALS.</p>

<p>The contribution of glial cells to the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is of substantial interest and the investigators have contributed significantly to this emerging field via prior publications. In the present study, authors use a SOD1G93A mouse model to elucidate the role of astrocyte ephrinB2 signaling in ALS disease progression. Erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular receptors (Ephs) and the Eph receptor-interacting proteins (ephrins) signaling is an important mediators of signaling between neurons and non-neuronal cells in the nervous system. Recent evidence suggests that dysregulated Eph-ephrin signaling in the mature CNS is a feature of neurodegenerative diseases. In the ALS model, upregulated Eph4A expression in motor neurons has been linked to disease pathogenesis. In the present study, authors extend previous findings to a new class of ephrinB2 ligands. Urban et al. hypothesize that upregulated ephrinB2 signaling contributes to disease pathogenesis in ALS mice. The authors successfully test this hypothesis and their results generally support their conclusion.</p>
<p>Major strengths of this work include a robust study design, a well-defined translational model, and complementary biochemical and experimental methods such that correlated findings are followed up by interventional studies. Authors show that ephrinB2 ligand expression is progressively upregulated in the ventral horn of the cervical and lumbar spinal cord through pre-symptomatic to end stages of the disease. This novel association was also observed in lumbar spinal cord samples from post-mortem samples of human ALS donors with a SOD1 mutation. Further, they use a lentiviral approach to drive knock-down of ephrinB2 in the central cervical region of SOD1G93A mice at the pre-symptomatic stage. Interestingly, in spite of using a non-specific promoter, authors note that the lentiviral expression was preferentially driven in astrocytes.</p>
<p>Since respiratory compromise is a leading cause of morbidity in the ALS population, the authors proceed to characterize the impact of ephrinB2 knockdown on diaphragm muscle output. In mice approaching the end stage of the disease, electrophysiological recordings from the diaphragm muscle show that animals in the knock-down group exhibited a ~60% larger amplitude. This functional preservation of diaphragm function was also accompanied with the preservation of diaphragm neuromuscular innervation. However, it must be noted that this cervical ephrinB2 knockdown approach had no impact on disease onset, disease duration, or animal survival. Furthermore, there was no impact of ephrinB2 knockdown on forelimb or hindlimb function. This is an expected result, given the fairly focal approach of ephrinB2 knockdown in C3-C5 spinal segments.</p>
<p>The major limitation of the study is the conclusion that the preservation of diaphragm output following ephrinB2 knockdown in SOD1 mice is mediated primarily (if not entirely) by astrocytes. The authors present convincing evidence that a reduction in ephrinB2 is observed in local astrocytes (~56% transduction) following the intraspinal injection of the lentivirus. However, the proportion of cell types assessed for transduction with the lentivirus in the spinal cord was limited to neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Microglia comprise a large proportion of the glial population in the spinal grey matter and have been shown to associate closely with respiratory motor pools. This cell type, amongst the many other that comprise the ventral gray matter, have not been investigated in this study. Nonetheless, there is convincing evidence to suggest astrocytes play a significant role, as compared to oligodendrocytes in promoting ALS pathogenesis.</p>
<p>In summary, this study by Urban et al. provides a valuable framework for Eph-Ephrin signaling mechanisms imposing pathological changes in an ALS mouse model. The role of glial cells in ALS pathology is a very exciting and upcoming field of investigation. The current study proposes a novel astrocyte-mediated mechanism for the propagation of disease that may eventually help to identify potential therapeutic targets.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This is a valuable study of Eph-Ephrin signaling mechanisms generating pathological changes in amyotropic lateral sclerosis. There are exciting findings bearing on the role of glial cells in this pathology. The study emerges with solid evidence for a novel astrocyte-mediated mechanism for disease propagation. It may help identify potential therapeutic targets.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response to Editorâs decision letter:  Drs. Huang and Zaidi: Thank you for considering this re-revision of our manuscript for potential publication in eLife. We have addressed the remaining comments of reviewer #2. We have included detailed response-to-reviewer comments below to address each of these remaining specific points from reviewer #2, and we have highlighted all the changes in the manuscript text (using a red font color) made in response to these comments. Based on the reviewersâ critiques, we feel our re-working of the manuscript has made for a greatly improved study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Reviewer comment:  All questions/concerns have been addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  We thank Reviewer #1 for the previous helpful comments that we used to improve our manuscript. As Reviewer #1 has no new comments, we have provided no additional responses to address this reviewerâs input. Instead, we only focus (in this new âResponse to Reviewer Commentsâ document) on the remaining points from Reviewer #2 below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Overall, the authors have addressed most concerns raised in the prior review. A couple of very minor points remain, which would improve the clarity of the report.</p>
<p>Reviewer comment 1:  The abstract has not been edited and still emphasizes that astrocyte-mediated upregulation in ephrinB2 signaling underlies pathogenicity in mutant SOD1-associated ALS. There is certainly sufficient evidence to suggest a large role for astrocytes, however, without a thorough investigation of other key cell types in the spinal cord, this cannot be concluded specifically.
Especially given that a non-specific promoter (U6) was employed in the viral constructs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  We apoplogize for this mistake. In response to the reviewerâs previous comment in the first round of review, we made changes throughout the manuscript to address this issue; however, we failed to do this in the Abstract. In this re-revised manucript, we now also make the necessary changes to the Abstract.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reviewer comment 2:  It is interesting to note that a non-specific promoter, U6, exhibited such large specificity to astrocytes in the cord as compared to neurons (Fig 2M). This is worth discussing briefly in the discussion and how this result compares to those in the literature.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  We have now added a brief discussion of this issue to the Discussion section, including describing our previous studies that used the Gfa2 promotor to achieve astrocyte-specific transduction when employing viral vectors in the rodent spinal cord.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reviewer comment 3:  I appreciate the authors including a supplemental figure on the expression of ephrinA4 receptors in the cervical ventral horn. Unfortunately, the quality of this image is very poor in conveying the receptor expression. The detailed discussion point on the expression of EphB receptors in the cervical ventral horn should be sufficient for readers to take into consideration.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  We have now removed this supplemental figure and keep only the text from the rerevised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reviewer comment 4:  A few instances of motor neuron diameter being attributed to a 200Î¼m2 size remain (e.g. pg 14).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  We have corrected this issue throughout the re-revised manuscript. The correct information is: somal diameter greater than 20 Î¼m.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reviewer comment 5:  It is still a little unclear in the result text as to when assessment of lentiviral transduction was conducted following intraspinal injections.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  We have now added this detail about the time point of assessing transduction to both the Results section and the Materials/Methods section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reviewer comment 6:  Some figures are missing markers of significance (e.g. Fig 2M).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  Below are our comments about significance markers for each graph in all figures.</p>
<p>Figure 1:</p>
<p>Panel E: We have now added asterisks for any statistically-significant comparisons. In addition, we provide the details of this statistical analysis in the text of the re-revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Figure 2:</p>
<p>Panel M: We have now added asterisks for statistical comparisons, as well as details in the text.</p>
<p>Panel N: The asterisk was already shown in the previous version of the figure.</p>
<p>Figure 3:</p>
<p>Panels B and G: The asterisks were already shown in the previous version of the figure.</p>
<p>Figure 4:</p>
<p>All panels: There are no significant differences; therefore, no asterisks are needed.</p>
<p>Figure 5:</p>
<p>Panel F and G: The asterisks were already shown in the previous version of the figure.</p>
<p>Panel H: The difference is not statistically-signficant.</p>
<p>Figure 6:  No graphs are shown in this figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reviewer comment 7:  Since a wild type mouse control has not been included in the quantification of diaphragm NMJ innervation with and without ephrin knock-down, it would be useful to include a description or discussion on the phenotype of NMJ denervation exhibited in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response:  We have now added description of diaphragm NMJ denervation that occurs in
SOD1G93A mice, in particular at the age/time point of our NMJ analysis.</p>
