<title>Abstract</title><p>Maintaining motor behaviors throughout life is crucial for an individual’s survival and reproductive success. The neuronal mechanisms that preserve behavior are poorly understood. To address this question, we focused on the zebra finch, a bird that produces a highly stereotypical song after learning it as a juvenile. Using cell-specific viral vectors, we chronically silenced inhibitory neurons in the pre-motor song nucleus called the high vocal center (HVC), which caused drastic song degradation. However, after producing severely degraded vocalizations for around 2 months, the song rapidly improved, and animals could sing songs that highly resembled the original. In adult birds, single-cell RNA sequencing of HVC revealed that silencing interneurons elevated markers for microglia and increased expression of the Major Histocompatibility Complex I (MHC I), mirroring changes observed in juveniles during song learning. Interestingly, adults could restore their songs despite lesioning the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum (LMAN), a brain nucleus crucial for juvenile song learning. This suggests that while molecular mechanisms may overlap, adults utilize different neuronal mechanisms for song recovery. Chronic and acute electrophysiological recordings within HVC and its downstream target, the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), revealed that neuronal activity in the circuit permanently altered with higher spontaneous firing in RA and lower in HVC compared to control even after the song had fully recovered. Together, our findings show that a complex learned behavior can recover despite extended periods of perturbed behavior and permanently altered neuronal dynamics. These results show that loss of inhibitory tone can be compensated for by recovery mechanisms partly local to the perturbed nucleus and do not require circuits necessary for learning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All animal species display behaviors crucial for reproduction and survival that are challenged by a changing environment. These behaviors rely on activity in brain circuits with an appropriate balance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity (E/I balance). Once disturbed, brain circuits strive to restore E/I balance<sup>1</sup>as its loss leads to abnormal neuronal firing patterns, which are implicated in several brain diseases, including epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. In this study, we explore how brain circuits react to extensive and long-term perturbation of inhibition.</p>
<p>Zebra finches produce a highly stereotyped song with minimal variability over extended periods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, underpinned by temporally precise neural activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. To chronically perturb the E/I balance, we genetically blocked inhibitory neurons in HVC, a premotor brain nucleus of the male zebra finch involved in song production. HVC contains two main types of excitatory neurons that project into two downstream targets: Area X (proper name) and nucleus RA. HVC also contains inhibitory neurons whose axons do not leave HVC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Previous work has shown that acute pharmacological blocking of interneurons in the HVC of adult finches perturbs song for a few hours until the chemical is washed out, after which normal behavior is restored<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Transient perturbations do not help us understand the outcome of prolonged E/I imbalances, such as long-term adaptations that the system might undergo. To investigate whether an adult motor circuit can overcome extended periods of perturbation, we used viral vectors carrying the light chain of tetanus toxin to chronically silence inhibitory neurons in the HVC of adult zebra finches. The persistent loss of inhibitory tone altered brain activity and severely perturbed song production for several weeks, during which animals produced degraded, variable songs. Most surprisingly, the song completely recovered around two months after being perturbed. While the song was degraded, we observed increased expression in MHC I and microglia marker genes within HVC, suggesting the potential involvement of inflammatory and immune signaling pathways in neural circuit reorganization.</p>
<p>To study how the chronic silencing of interneurons affects circuit dynamics, we performed acute and chronic recordings in HVC and its downstream target, nucleus RA. Surprisingly, although the neuronal activity within HVC or RA remained abnormal even two months after the perturbations, the song was fully restored. In addition, in adult animals subjected to perturbation of interneurons in HVC, the song degraded and recovered after lesioning LMAN, a song nucleus essential for song learning in juveniles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. This indicates that the mechanisms by which song recovers in adults after perturbation differ from those used by juvenile animals to learn the song.</p>
<p>Our findings indicate that an adult motor circuit can regain the original complex learned behavior without restoring the original neuronal dynamics after extended periods of drastic E/I imbalance. Together with our previous work perturbing HVC excitatory neurons, these observations suggest that loss of either inhibitory or excitatory tone in a brain nucleus can recover by mechanisms that are likely in part local and homeostatic since they do not require practice or inputs from nuclei necessary for song learning such as LMAN.</p>

<title>Long-term song degradation after genetic muting of local inhibitory neurons in the zebra finch</title>
<p>To functionally mute interneurons, we used the light chain of tetanus toxin (TeNT), which blocks the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic terminals, thereby preventing neurons from communicating with their postsynaptic partners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. We used an AAV viral vector expressing TeNT under the human dlx5 promoter, which is selective for HVC inhibitory interneurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The virus was injected stereotaxically into the HVC of adult male zebra finches. The expression of TeNT does not directly alter the ability of interneurons to fire action potentials but effectively prevents synaptic release, thereby muting them. As a control, a second group of animals was injected with an AAV carrying the green fluorescent protein NeonGreen driven by the ubiquitous cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer fused to the chicken beta-actin promoter (CAG). Throughout various time points after virus injection, we recorded songs, measured changes in gene expression at single-cell resolution, and obtained electrophysiological measurements (chronic and acute within HVC).</p>
<p>An average male zebra finch song contains 4 to 7 units called syllables. These syllables are fixed in order and make up a so-called motif. The motif is repeated multiple times to form a bout <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, defined as the set of vocalizations produced by a bird without pauses (&gt; 200 msec) between them. Throughout all experiments, we continuously monitored the songs of individually housed animals from 7-20 days before virus injection to 60-100 days post-injection (dpi) using sound-isolated chambers. In control animals, the song did not change at any time after the viral injection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). For the first 24-48 hours, the song of TeNT-treated animals was identical to their original song. However, starting at 2-5 dpi, the song of TeNT-treated animals began to degrade, both in its acoustic and temporal features (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). By 5-10 dpi, the song of TeNT-treated animals was highly degraded and bore no resemblance to the original song before viral injection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>During the first few days of song degradation, TeNT-treated animals produced instances of syllables with abnormally long durations far outside the range of any adult syllable duration observed in control animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> shows one such vocalization at 5 dpi; examples of syllable length distribution are shown in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). By 8 to 30 dpi, vocalizations became very short (&lt; 100 msec) with inter-syllable intervals of varying lengths (100 msec to 1 sec) (spectrogram examples in <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). At 20-30 dpi, the song of TeNT-treated animals was highly variable between renditions and lacked the typical organization of motif and bout (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>).</p>
<p>In previous work, we showed that silencing of projecting neurons in HVC using a similar approach induced a transient song degradation with full recovery after 2 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Based on this finding, we anticipated that the time course for song recovery should be similar when perturbing the inhibitory neurons of the same circuit. However, even 4 weeks after genetic muting of HVC interneurons, the song did not recover. Although inactivation of projection neurons leads to song degradation and recovery in two weeks, the loss of inhibitory tone in HVC did not result in song recovery within a month of perturbation, suggesting permanent behavioral damage.</p>

<title>Chronic interneuron inactivation in adult songbirds increases the expression of MHC I and the number of microglia in HVC</title>
<p>To understand the molecular mechanisms caused by interneuron muting, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) of HVC from control (n=2) and TeNT-treated (n=2) adult male zebra finches at 25 dpi, around the time of peak song distortion. HVC from both hemispheres of all four birds were dissected based on retrograde tracer fluorescence (injected retrograde tracer into area X) and dissociated to prepare single-cell suspensions, which were indexed and pooled. This allowed the construction of a combined dataset containing results from all animals and conditions without the need for batch correction (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Following quality control, we retained a total of 35,804 single-cell profiles from four animals.</p>
<p>While cell type abundance was highly concordant between replicates of the same condition (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures 10</xref>, <xref rid="figs16" ref-type="fig">16A</xref>), we found that TeNT-treated animals displayed a three-fold increase in the number of microglia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). In addition, we found a significant increase in the expression of the α chain of MHC I and β2-microglobulin (B2M) genes across several neuronal cell types in TeNT-treated animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1c and d</xref>). This increase in microglia and MHC I was not due to an inflammatory reaction caused by the surgical procedure or the AAV injection since control animals also received a viral injection with an identical serotype viral backbone that did not affect neuronal activity. Thus, we hypothesize that the increase in microglia and MHC I in TeNT-treated animals results from the chronic muting of inhibitory neurons.We also confirmed the increase in MHC I and microglia by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures 12</xref>, <xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous works have shown that MHC I and microglia are involved in the synaptic reorganization of brain circuits, especially during postnatal development in mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In addition, several studies have demonstrated the upregulation of microglia following seizure-like activity in mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Our finding suggests that the increase of microglia and MHC I expression caused by chronic silencing of interneurons may be involved in the synaptic reorganization of HVC.</p>

<title>Near-perfect behavioral recovery after prolonged zebra finch song degradation</title>
<p>Silencing HVC interneurons drastically degraded the song, leaving its structure unrecognizable within 2-3 weeks. Notably, the song remained highly variable even three weeks after the manipulation, with differences observed between renditions produced on the same day. (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures 1</xref>). This is unlike the abnormal vocalizations observed after other irreversible song circuit manipulations, such as tracheosyringeal nerve resection or deafening, which result in song production that eventually becomes degraded but stable between renditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We wondered whether the songs from animals in which we permanently inactivated inhibitory neurons would eventually stabilize into a fixed degraded song or whether the song would keep changing without ever stabilizing. To this end, we decided to record their behavior for an extra 4 weeks. Unexpectedly, after 40-70 days of degraded song production, the original song started to re-emerge. By around 70 dpi, the song of all TeNT-treated animals was highly similar to the song produced before viral injection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we asked whether the transcriptomic changes observed at 25 dpi persisted after song restoration. To this end, we performed ISH using a probe against RGS10, a microglia marker gene, at 25 dpi (when the song is fully degraded) and 90 dpi (after the song has recovered). At 25 dpi, the number of RGS10+ cells significantly increased in TeNT-treated animals compared to control animals (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures 12 A</xref>, <xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">13 A</xref>, and B) and returned to normal levels by 90 dpi.</p>
<p>To ask whether long-term loss of inhibitory tone results in similar transcriptomic changes in HVC as during song learning, we counted the number of RGS10+cells in HVC at different times during song learning in naive (untreated) juvenile birds using ISH. The number of microglia in the HVC of juveniles was high during the early stages of song learning (20-50 days post-hatching (dph)) and decreased after that (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures 12 B</xref>, <xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">13 C</xref>, and D). These observations suggest that microglia might be involved in fine-tuning brain circuits to achieve appropriate function during song learning and behavioral recovery following perturbation. However, the increase in microglia after silencing inhibitory neurons in adult animals could account for two opposite scenarios. The increased inhibitory tone in HVC and the number of microglia could induce synaptic changes that contribute to degraded song production. Alternatively, the rise in microglia could be part of the recovery response to produce synaptic changes needed to regain the song following perturbation.</p>

<title>Chronic muting of interneurons in HVC results in long-term abnormal neuronal dynamics that recover in parallel with song quality</title>
<p>Next, we sought to understand the neuronal dynamics within HVC during behavioral perturbation and recovery due to the loss of inhibitory tone. Towards this end, we continuously recorded the behavior and neuronal activity in HVC for 90 days in freely moving animals after injection of interneuron muting (TeNT) or control viral vectors.</p>
<p>We implanted a 4-shank electrode array containing a total of 16 recording sites in both in TeNT-treated and control animals. We simultaneously collected electrophysiological data, head movement (recorded with the accelerometer built into the head stage), and audio recordings for 90 dpi. We found that single units were detectable for only 24-48 hours, after which the signal irreversibly degraded. However, these electrodes allowed us to record local field potential (LFPs) for several weeks. LFP recordings capture local field oscillations caused by synaptic events and action potentials from many neurons and neurites in a volume around the electrode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. We analyzed the spectral decomposition of the LFPs during song production from degraded vocalizations in TeNT-treated or control animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2d</xref> and e, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures 6 A</xref> and B). As expected from prior work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, both the song behavior and LFP features remained stable in control animals: the electrical activity during singing showed voltage deflections of small amplitude, which were present throughout the song (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref> B). In contrast, at 5 dpi, TeNT-treated animals produced abnormally long vocalizations that were preceded by large voltage deflections, not present in control animals (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref> A). Between 10 and 70 dpi, the songs of TeNT-treated animals were highly variable, both between renditions and across days (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Due to this behavioral instability, the vocalizations of perturbed animals could not be reliably aligned across trials. To find a stable measure allowing to compare neuronal activity between control and experimental groups, we focused on electrophysiological events occurring during nighttime (lights-off periods when the animals are not moving or singing) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>, 2g (right)). The neuronal activity recorded during the nighttime period will be referred to as “offline” or “lights-off” throughout this manuscript.</p>
<p>HVC activity during sleep is hypothesized to be a form of replay of neuronal firing similar to that occurring while the animal sings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Therefore, analyzing electrophysiological activity in HVC during offline periods throughout the perturbation could reveal disruptions related to degraded behavior. As observed during singing, during offline periods, the voltage deflections seen in TeNT-treated animals were more frequent and of larger amplitude than in the control group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1B</xref>). At 5 dpi, the average amplitude of the voltage deflections was around 3-fold higher in TeNT-treated than in control animals (-530 µV and -140 µV in TeNT-treated and control animals, respectively), with a 280% increase in TeNT-treated animals (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In addition, in TeNT-treated animals, these large amplitude deflections at night occurred more frequently when the song was most degraded (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref> right panel). In TeNT-treated animals, the rate of deflections returned to those seen in control animals as the song regained stereotypy around 50 dpi (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref>).</p>
<p>Offline deflection events were further characterized by spectral decomposition of the LFPs in the 1-200 Hz frequency range. At 5 dpi, we observed increased power only in the low gamma band (30-70 Hz) in TeNT-treated animals, which returned to control levels as the songs regained stereotypy (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref> C and D). These findings suggest a relationship between behavioral recovery and the return to control-like offline electrophysiological activity, supporting the hypothesis that offline activity may correlate with the quality of song execution.</p>

<title>Offline neuronal activity in HVC remains abnormal even after the song recovers</title>
<p>To examine local neuronal activity at single-neuron resolution during song degradation and recovery, we performed acute head-fixed recordings. High-density silicon probes (Neuropixels)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> allowed the simultaneous recording of neurons in HVC, RA, and intervening brain areas (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). As described above, we obtained the most reliable measurements of abnormal brain activity in TeNT-treated animals during offline periods, given the variable song production. Therefore, we performed Neuropixel recordings in head-fixed animals when the lights were off during their natural sleep cycle. We focused on acute recordings obtained within a few hours after probe insertion to achieve the best possible signal-to-noise ratio. To understand how neuronal activity evolves as the song degraded and recovered, we performed acute recordings at 3-6, 20-22, and 70-77 dpi in TeNT-treated and 10 and 30 dpi in control animals. To control for potential artifacts caused by the surgery or viral injection, we included recordings from one naïve animal (not injected with any virus).</p>

<p>Loss of inhibitory tone led to seven events resembling seizure-like activity in HVC (n=3 TeNT-treated animals at 3-20 dpi), which propagated downstream into the nucleus RA (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 9</xref> B). These seizure-like events in HVC resemble the bursts of increased activity previously reported in rodents after acute pharmacological blockade of interneurons or during seizure events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> We investigated spontaneous offline activity to understand the overall HVC and RA dynamics after perturbation. For the first 3-4 dpi, HVC started with a heightened level of spontaneous offline activity (likely due to the loss of inhibition). However, after 20 dpi, activity decreased to a level below that of control animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). Surprisingly, the activity in HVC in TeNT-treated animals remained substantially reduced relative to the control animals (<italic>p = 0.57*10<sup>-11</sup></italic>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>) even after song recovery. While activity in HVC in TeNT-treated animals was initially elevated and eventually decreased, RA showed the opposite trend (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). This observation is consistent with a prior study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> showing acute changes in RA firing patterns in single neurons upon stimulation of HVC in brain slices. These observations suggest that HVC may directly increase the activity of RA interneurons. According to this model, the initial increase in overall activity in HVC (caused by blocking of HVC interneuron activity) would activate interneurons in RA, thereby reducing overall activity in RA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3c</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). In contrast, when the overall activity in HVC was permanently reduced, the activity in RA increased to keep the overall sum of HVC-RA output constant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3c</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). However, it is essential to note that our recordings in RA do not allow us to identify whether the recorded activity originated from excitatory or inhibitory neurons.</p>

<title>Degradation of behavioral stereotypy is paralleled by loss of local neuronal firing precision to specific phases of alpha oscillations</title>
<p>We used acute Neuropixel recordings to understand the relationship between neuronal activity and LFP oscillations during offline voltage deflection events, which seem to change on the same time scale as the behavioral recovery. This readout could explain the relationship between input into a circuit, the local neuronal dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, and the execution of the recovered behavior.</p>
<p>We found acute offline voltage deflections similar to those we observed with our chronic recordings (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). We detected comparable changes during the perturbation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>) as in the chronic recordings (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref> C and D). We observed significant differences in the LFP signatures of voltage deflections between TeNT-treated and control animals, namely in the alpha (1-10 Hz) and the low gamma ranges (30-40 Hz) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that local neuronal dynamics cause low gamma oscillations and that synaptic inputs may cause alpha oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. This could mean low gamma oscillations represent local neuronal activity, while alpha is a readout of inputs into HVC, highlighting their importance in circuit dynamics.</p>
<p>Next, further confirming the findings of the chronic recordings, acute Neuropixels recordings revealed that after an initial increase in the power of the low gamma range (30-40 Hz), it returned to control levels around 70 dpi (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 9</xref> A). The phase relationship between alpha and gamma oscillations was variable during song degradation but returned to resemble controls after song recovery (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 9</xref> C-E). In contrast to the gamma oscillations’ power, alpha oscillations stayed significantly higher in TeNT-treated animals, even after the song recovered at 70 dpi (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 9</xref> A).</p>
<p>To further study the relationship between local neuronal activity and LFP dynamics, we compared the timing of single neuron firing with the alpha and low gamma LFP phase during offline deflections. We employed methods previously used to characterize sharp-wave ripple events during offline activity in the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. The neuronal firing within HVC locked tightly to specific phases of the alpha and low gamma LFPs in control animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3e and f</xref>; <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8A</xref>). This phase-locking relationship remained unchanged in RA and in the local neuronal precision locked to a specific phase of gamma LFPs within HVC during the interneuron manipulation (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). However, the precision of local neuronal firing to alpha oscillations between 60 to 140 degrees was lost or broadened during the song degradation period (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e and f</xref>). The animals’ songs started to recover at the same time as the local neuronal firing in HVC locked again to a specific phase of the alpha oscillations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> e and f).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found that restoration in behavioral stereotypy was accompanied by the return to normal of several aspects of neuronal dynamics, such as the low gamma LFP power and spike-locked alpha oscillation in HVC. However, even after the song recovered, several features of offline HVC dynamics remained abnormal, including alpha LFP power in HVC and spontaneous activity both in HVC and RA. These observations indicate that the adult brain can overcome extended periods of abnormal neuronal activity and perturbed behavior and precisely restore a complex behavior without recovering the original neuronal dynamics. This suggests that HVC may transition into a new state capable of producing the original behavior despite the persistence of altered neuronal dynamics.</p>

<title>Song degradation and recovery in adults do not require a brain nucleus essential for juvenile learning</title>
<p>Our transcriptomic results suggested that some mechanisms might be shared between song learning in young animals and recovery after inhibitory circuit manipulation in adults. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether LMAN, a brain nucleus essential for song learning, is involved in song degradation and recovery after interneuron manipulation in adults.</p>
<p>Juvenile animals start singing a highly variable and unstructured song. By continuous trial and error over 2-3 months and thousands of practice renditions, their song “crystallizes” into a stable motif with minimal variability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Song learning in juveniles requires LMAN, another nucleus in the song system that provides input to RA, the downstream target of HVC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. During learning, LMAN injects noise into RA to enable the exploration of different states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> and gates the plasticity of synapses from HVC to RA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In addition to its role in learning, LMAN is necessary for song modification in adult animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Deafening adult animals causes a progressive degradation of their songs over several weeks, which can be blocked by prior LMAN lesioning. A previous study reported that adult HVC microlesions led to days-long song degradation that was preventable by prior lesioning of LMAN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is possible that the ‘noisy’ input from LMAN to RA becomes more dominant when HVC is perturbed in adult animals. This noisy LMAN input into RA could underlie the production of degraded songs after manipulation of HVC activity.</p>
<p>To test whether the change in LMAN input is the main cause of degraded song production (given our findings about decreased HVC activity) and is necessary for song recovery after interneuron perturbation, we chemically lesioned LMAN by bilateral ibotenic acid injection, and 10 days later, we injected AAV-dlx-TeNT into HVC (n=3). The song degraded and recovered similarly in all TeNT-treated animals, regardless of the presence of an intact or lesioned LMAN. This observation indicates that song degradation after HVC interneuron perturbation is not simply due to an exacerbated LMAN influence on RA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> &amp; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>-<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In addition, previous works have demonstrated that the modification of the dynamics of RA requires input from LMAN, both in juveniles and adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Our results revealed that perturbation of HVC caused profound changes in the activity of RA during song degradation and recovery. Thus, the ability of the song to recover after LMAN lesioning suggests that in adult animals, RA can modify its dynamics without the participation of LMAN. These findings indicate that nuclei of the song system play different roles during adult song degradation and recovery following HVC perturbation and juvenile song learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The brain must balance excitation and inhibition to maintain the appropriate levels of physiological activity needed to execute reliable behaviors. We found that permanently muting inhibitory neurons in a pre-motor circuit in adult songbirds severely disrupt their song for an extended period (40-70 days). However, despite this long-term disruption, animals eventually recovered and produced a version of the song that was highly similar to the original.</p>
<p>To understand the cellular mechanisms underlying this behavioral recovery, we investigated the transcriptomic and electrophysiological changes induced by this perturbation. Our sc-RNA sequencing data revealed a threefold increase in microglial marker genes compared to control animals, which returned to normal levels as the song recovered. In mammals, microglia are known to play a role in synaptic changes during the assembly of brain circuits in the embryonic and perinatal brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Consistent with their suggested role in developmental plasticity, we observed an increase in microglia during song learning in juveniles. Additionally, seizures have been shown to elevate the number of microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Our findings suggest that microglia could participate in reorganizing HVC after chronic perturbation of inhibitory neurons. However, whether microglia aid or delay the recovery process remains an open question for future studies.</p>
<p>To understand how prolonged perturbation of interneuron activity affected brain dynamics, we performed long-term electrophysiological recordings in HVC during both song degradation and recovery. We detected changes in the electrophysiological properties of offline events, which are known to be important for a replay of the song in HVC. During song degradation, we observed an increase in the rate and amplitude of these deflection events, which returned to normal levels once the song regained its stereotypy. To investigate neuronal dynamics with greater resolution, we analyzed single and multi-neuronal activity within HVC and its downstream nucleus RA in acute recordings with Neuropixel probes. Following the muting of interneurons in HVC, we observed two persistent changes in HVC dynamics that remained abnormal even after the song had fully recovered: (i) a decrease in offline single neuron firing and (ii) an increase in alpha frequency power. Alpha frequency oscillations have been suggested to result from synaptic inputs into a brain region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, we posit that the decreased neuronal firing in HVC may have initiated a compensatory increase in the synaptic inputs originating from upstream nuclei projecting into HVC (such as Uva and Nif). This could account for the observed increase in alpha power. Alternatively, this increase in alpha power could originate from synaptic inputs from neurons within HVC. However, we believe this scenario is unlikely because we found decreased local neuronal activity in HVC. Future experiments will be necessary to understand how the perturbations of HVC affect the dynamics of other nuclei in the song system and the cell types within HVC.</p>
<p>To investigate the relationship between LFP oscillations and local neuronal dynamics in HVC, we measured the precision of single neuronal firing to specific phases of alpha and gamma oscillations, called spike locking. We observed significant changes upon the muting of inhibitory neurons. In control animals, HVC neuronal firing locked to alpha and gamma oscillations during offline voltage deflections. In contrast, single neuronal firing did not lock to alpha frequency oscillations during the peak song distortion. As the song recovered, the spike locking to alpha (input-driven) oscillations returned to normal.</p>
<p>The relationship between single neuronal firing and alpha oscillations in the song system is not yet understood. We hypothesize that this relationship could represent how the local HVC circuit responds to inputs from other brain areas. In this scenario, during song degradation, when stereotypy of the song is lost, the local HVC circuit cannot correctly respond to synaptic inputs from upstream nuclei (mainly Nif and Uva) in the song system, resulting in the observed desynchronization of spikes to alpha oscillations. As the song recovers, spike-field coherence becomes more precise even though the power of the alpha oscillations remains permanently elevated. These findings suggest that the motor circuit can execute behavior properly despite permanent changes in its neuronal dynamics.</p>
<p>We observed superficial similarities between juvenile song learning and adult song recovery after HVC interneuron perturbation, such as variable song production and increased microglia numbers. However, a fundamental difference exists between these processes. In juveniles, song learning requires input from LMAN to RA, and it has been hypothesized that LMAN injects noise into RA, allowing HVC inputs into RA to explore different states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Previous studies have also shown that LMAN is required to enable song modifications in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Here, we found that in adult animals without LMAN, the song degraded following the inactivation of inhibitory neurons in HVC and recovered after several weeks. Further studies are necessary to find both the commonalities and differences in mechanisms of brain reorganization following HVC perturbation in adults and the development of the song circuit in juveniles.</p>
<p>In our previous work, we observed that the song was drastically degraded and recovered after permanent genetic muting of a large fraction of projection neurons in HVC in adult animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In the present study, we observed that chronically inactivating a large fraction of interneurons in HVC also causes song degradation and eventual recovery. Our results reveal that HVC can produce reliable songs, a complex learned behavior, after significantly reducing the fraction of its active excitatory or inhibitory neurons. These studies highlight this nucleus’s unique resilience by demonstrating that HVC can restore behavioral dynamics after two “orthogonal” perturbations to the circuit. Our current and previous studies show that extensive perturbations of HVC can recover by mechanisms that are likely, in part, local and homeostatic since they do not require practice or inputs from nuclei necessary for song learning, such as LMAN. Furthermore, our findings indicate that behavior can be recovered after a severe and prolonged brain E/I balance perturbation without restoring the initial dynamics. Instead, it appears that HVC adapts and reorganizes into a new state capable of producing the original behavior. This adaptive process may be crucial for maintaining motor behaviors over long periods and could represent a key feature of brain resilience.</p>

<p>Birds were anesthetized with isoflurane (0.5% for initial induction, 0.2% for maintenance) and head-fixed on a stereotaxic apparatus. First, to inject a retrograde tracer in area X, craniotomies were made bilaterally and fluorescent tracers (fluoro-ruby 10%, 100-300 nL) were injected through a glass capillary (tip size ∼25 μm) into the corresponding nuclei (coordinates from dorsal sinus in mm – area X: Anteroposterior (AP) 3.3-4.2, Mediolateral (ML) 1.5-1.6, Deep (D): 3.5-3.8). To deliver the virus (AAV) into HVC, a second surgery was performed 7-10 days after retrograde tracer injection. By then, HVC was strongly labeled by fluorescence and visible through a fluorescent stereoscope. AAVs diffuse extensively (∼500 µm), and a single injection (∼100 nL) in the center of HVC was sufficient to label enough cells. All injections in HVC were performed at ∼20 nL/min to minimize physical damage.

A small opening was cut on the dura (just big enough to fit the electrode array) to lower the electrodes manually. The reference and ground were a gold screw pin placed into the cerebellum. The skin was removed from the surface of the skull for the majority of the surface, in order to secure the implant. Before implantation, the skull and the craniotomies were cleaned with saline and dried and the skull was prepared according to the protocol of the C&amp;B Metabond cement system. Post implantation we covered the craniotomies with kwik-sil. Once hardened, we covered the whole skull, and the part of the electrode still exposed, with metabond. The head stage (Intan RHD Part # C3335) was connected to the probe before implantation and securely metabonded to the connection between the probe and head stage in order to prevent detachment when the bird is moving. SPI interface cables (Intan Part #C3203, #C3213) were connected to the acquisition board (Open Ephys). Data was recorded at 30,000 Hz with the Open Ephys software system. Animals were freely moving with a passive counterweight-based commitator system.</p>

<title>Acute electrophysical recordings</title>
<p>Animals (n=10, 140-250 dph) went through the same surgical procedure as described for a stereotaxic viral injection. However, at the end of the surgery the skin was removed from the skull, and the whole skull was pre-treated and covered in metabond except for the craniotomies over HVC that were covered with kwik-cast until the day of the acute recording session. Shortly before the recording session, a head-bar was glued on top of the frontal surface of the metabonded skull to allow the head-fixation of the bird for the recording session. Then, the kwik-cast was removed from the craniotomy over HVC (left or right hemisphere or both depending on the animal) and a small incision was made in the dure over HVC, which was identified by the retrograde tracer previously injected. The ground was placed into the cerebellum. Then the high-density silicone probe (Neuropixel) was lowered with a motorized arm over hours for 2.6-3 mm deep into the brain. The head stage and acquisition board was connected to the computer and data was recorded with the Open Ephys software. Once the probe settled in the brain, we had 4 distinct recording sessions. Post-perfusion histology images were obtained to locate electrode array within HVC for each animal (<xref rid="figs16" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 16</xref>). Recording sessions: lights on silence (10 min), followed by playback of the bird’s own song (3-10 min); lights-off silence (10 min), followed by playback of the bird’s own song (3-10 min); microinjection of 100 nL 250 µM Gabazine (Hellobio, HB0901), followed by the same protocol of lights-off and on without Gabazine.</p>

<sec id="s4g1">
<title>Song feature parameterization</title>
<p>Continuous audio recordings (44.1 kHz) were segmented into individual bouts manually. We used the open-source Matlab software package, Sound Analysis Pro 201<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> to generate spectrograms and derive non-linear, time-varying song parameterizations. The time-varying features were: pitch, goodness of pitch, Wiener entropy, log-power of the spectrogram, mean frequency, and the maximum power in each quadrant of the frequency range 0-11 kHz (labeled power 1, power 2, power 3, and power 4). These features were computed across the entire bout every 1 ms. These time-varying features were the base from which various portions of the song were further characterized.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g2">
<title>Syllable parameterization</title>
<p>To quantify the change in the acoustic structure of the song, we tracked song features over the course of the perturbation. In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, we took the average feature values over all song segments in the three closest days of recorded song for each day plotted. We extracted the average mean frequency, average pitch, maximum goodness of pitch, maximum log power, minimum entropy, and entropy variance over the first 50 ms of each song segment, or the entire song segment if the segment was less than 50 ms. We centered and normalized feature values by the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of feature values in syllables five days pre-perturbation to compare trends across birds.</p>
<p>To visualize how the population of song segments evolved relative to the original syllable structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), we plotted song segments as points in the first 2 principal components of the 7-dimensional acoustic feature space composed of: average mean frequency, average pitch, maximum goodness of pitch, maximum log power, minimum entropy, and entropy variance over the first 50 ms of each song segment, and the full duration of each song segment. 500 syllables recorded pre-perturbation were labeled by hand, and contour plots were made at the mean of each labeled stereotyped syllable type for visual reference as the song degrades and recovers. Principal component dimensions were computed on the 500 labeled syllables, and subsequent song segments were projected into this principal component space.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g3">
<title>Syllable segmentation</title>
<p>We identified syllables and silences within each bout by imposing thresholds on the time-varying, total log-power of the spectrogram. We selected the threshold based on manual inspection for each bird. We then performed a smoothing step wherein periods of silence less than 15 ms were converted to song segments. Song segments less than 20 ms were excluded from the analysis. Segmentation was further checked by eye by random sampling across both stereotyped motifs and degraded song. We then applied the power threshold to the entire course of song recordings for each bird.</p>
<p>A note on terminology: we refer to song segments to indicate continuous periods of singing. In the unperturbed song, these song segments are termed syllables. Because this is a continuous recovery process, these terms sometimes overlap in our usage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g4">
<title>Syllable timing distributions</title>
<p>Syllable durations were extracted from the syllable segmentation process. Discrete distributions of syllable durations were computed by normalizing each distribution of all song segment durations within individual days such that the sum of each daily distribution over all binned durations equaled one. Distributions for individual days were then assembled into a matrix wherein the columns represented normalized distributions for individual days. This matrix was plotted as a heat map in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>We generated continuous visualizations of bouts across the entire perturbation trajectory as shown in the graphical abstract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. We randomly sampled 100 bouts from single days of recording to build a representative sample of the song over the course of the experiment. For each bout, we slid a 150 ms window in 3 ms steps along the bout length. We then generated a high-dimensional, acoustic parameterization of each 150 ms song window by taking the moving average in 20 ms segments every 5 ms of six song features (mean frequency, pitch, goodness of pitch, power 4, power 2, and summed log power of the spectrogram). We performed principal component analysis on this high-dimensional set across all bouts to reduce the feature set to 30 dimensions.</p>

<title>Preprocessing of Data</title>
<p>Bad channels were removed from the analysis by visual inspection of the first minute of each recording. Three of the four birds studied had one channel that had behavior that was an order of magnitudes larger than all others, and data from this channel was removed for further analysis. Furthermore, channels that appeared out or close to the edge of HVC based on histology were also eliminated from further analysis.</p>

<title>Detection of sharp waves</title>
<p>Accelerometer and electrophysiology data were resampled to 125 Hz from the original 30,000 Hz using the Matlab resample function. Since accelerometer data was not zero-centered, the mean was subtracted before resampling and then added back to avoid edge effects from the lowpass filtering during resampling. Sharp waves were detected from the downsampled data using a procedure adapted from a zebra finch sleep study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> and were only detected during periods of low movement. This was determined by setting a threshold on the moving standard deviation of the velocity as movement events appeared as large fluctuations in the velocity data. Briefly, the local field potential (LFP) traces were averaged across all electrodes and bandpassed from 1 to 40 Hz using MATLAB’s bandpass function. Putative events were detected by peaks in the inverted (-1x) trace and were in the lowest 5% of all values during non-movement, were at least 10 ms long, and were 80 ms apart. These putative events were used to construct a template by taking the average 80 ms trace centered on each event. Cross-correlating this template with the entire overnight LFP trace and taking the z-score (mean and SD from only non-movement times) revealed events that closely matched the template. Peaks were detected in the z-scored cross-correlation and defined as events if they were above a given threshold and were at least 80 ms apart. Notably, thresholds were not tuned across birds or recordings but a constant threshold was sufficient in all birds to detect events. Extraction of sharp waves. The detected events were used to index the original 30,000 Hz data. 500 ms of data was extracted for each event and recentered on the minimal value in the center 100 ms. An equal number of 500 ms non-sharp wave events were extracted from a random selection of times without movement or sharp waves. Sharp waves with clear electrical noise were omitted from further analysis.</p>

<title>Multi-unit activity (MUA)</title>
<p>MUA was detected using an established method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Briefly, channels were common averaged referenced, bandpassed from 600 to 6,000 Hz, and upsampled to 50,000 Hz. The square root of the local energy operator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> was taken and then Gaussian smoothed (σ= 0.4). Thresholding this trace and then downsampling back to 30,000 Hz gave the times of high MUA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h4">
<title>Time-frequency analysis</title>
<p>The continuous wavelet transform was used to compute the spectra for each sharp wave. Percent increase relative to mean power spectra were averaged within each day and bird. The spectrum of average power in the center 33 ms of each event was used to compute the percent increase in power relative to non-sharp wave events at each frequency. To determine the presence of phase-amplitude coupling between low-frequency (10-20 Hz) and gamma-frequency (30-40Hz) bursts, the phase of the low-frequency band, and power of the high-frequency band were extracted using the Hilbert transform of the band-passed signal. Determining whether the peak gamma activity occurred at a consistent phase of the low-frequency oscillation, could suggest phase-amplitude coupling. To further assess this, we asked at what time and frequency a max in the spectrum occurred for each event, relative to the minima of each sharp wave. We also wanted to ask whether the power of deflections in different frequency bands differed significantly across control and experimental birds. We computed the relative increase in power in the frequency bands of interest (15-30 Hz, and 30-70 Hz) during a deflection relative to non-deflection times. We then used a t-test to statistically test whether power differed significantly across birds for a given day.</p>

<title>Analysis of the acute electrophysiology recordings</title>
<p>The low-frequency electrophysiology data was recorded at 2,500 Hz while the high-frequency data was recorded at 30,000 Hz. A MATLAB script was written to analyze the low- and high-frequency oscillations. All low-frequency data was high pass filtered (1-300 Hz) and median subtracted. All high-frequency data was common average referenced and low-pass filtered (300-7,000 Hz). For deflection event detection, we used two methods. One to use a template per animal for extraction of deflection and non-deflection events with template matching in a semi-automated manner. Second, manually picked out peaks that were 9 standard deviations away from the average raw signal, then further manually curated these events. Most of our further analysis was done using the deflection events that resulted from template matching (except <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 10A</xref> for the difference in power between deflection and non-deflection event calculation). For spike detection, we used two separate methods, one to threshold the high-frequency data to only consider spikes that are 9 standard deviations above the average signal in a 2-minute window. The second method used for spike detection was using the Kilosort software v2.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> to extract spikes from the raw data. Next, we manually curated the dataset to capture the waveform and firing rate of neurons. The thresholded spiking data was used to generate spiking related figures. We performed statistics (Wilcoxon, rank sum test) to show statistically significant firing rates related to control in HVC and RA in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>.</p>
<p>To calculate the power difference between deflection and non-deflection events in the acute recording in <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 11</xref> A, we used a script developed for the chronic recordings with the use of the built-in MATLAB function <italic>pwelch</italic>. To analyze the spectral decomposition of the LFP signature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) in control and TeNT-treated animals during the experimental timeline we calculated the Morse continuous wavelet transform using the built-in MATLAB function. From this finding, we obtained the mean oscillation at the alpha range (1-10 Hz) and at low gamma (30-70 Hz). Then, we performed an iterative alignment process of these two oscillations and calculated the angle of the low-frequency oscillation (from obtaining the Hilbert transform) at the peak amplitude of the high-frequency oscillation (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 11BC</xref>). Then we proceeded to align the single neuronal firing (obtained from Kilosort) to the alpha and the low gamma oscillations and plotted the normalized probability distribution (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>) of neurons firing at a specific phase (angle) of the alpha or low gamma oscillations. We performed the Kolgomorov-Smirnov test on the cumulative density function (CDF) (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 11D</xref>) to assess if the change in probability distribution in the relationship between alpha and low gamma oscillations is statistically significant from control distributions at 3-6, 20, and 70 dpi.</p>

<title>Dissociation and cDNA generation</title>
<p>Animals were anesthetized with a mix of ketamine-xylazine (0.02 mL / 1 gram) and quickly decapitated, then the brain was placed into a carbogenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) NMDG-ACSF petri dish on ice. The brains were dissected on a petri dish with NMDG-ACSF surrounded by ice under an epifluorescent microscope guided by the fluoro-ruby retrograde tracing from Area X to HVC.</p>
<p>We used the commercially available Worthington Papain Dissociation system with some minor changes and add-on steps. We followed all the steps included in the Worthington protocol with a final concentration of 50 U/mL of papain. To match the intrinsic osmolarity of neurons in zebra finches we used NMDG-ACSF (∼310 mOsm) instead of the EBSS for post-dissection and STOP solution.</p>
<p>Another modification was to add 20 µL of 1 mg/mL Actinomycin D (personal communication from Allan-Hermann Pool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>) into 1 mL of the post-dissection medium and the STOP solution in which trituration occurred. Papain digestion occurred for an hour on a rocking \surface with constant carbogenation in a secondary container above the sample vial at RT. We performed trituration with increasingly smaller diameter glass pasteur pipettes. Trituation was performed inside the papain solution. Then, once the tissue was fully dissociated, we centrifuged the samples at 300 g RT for 5 minutes and resuspended them in STOP solution. Next, we used a 40 µm Falcon cell strainer pre-wet with the STOP solution and centrifuged again at 300 g RT for 5 min. Finally, we resuspended the cell pellet in 60µl of STOP solution and proceeded to barcoding and cDNA synthesis.

<p>The concatenated data was mapped to a lower dimensional space by PCA applied to the log-normalized counts filtered for highly variable genes using Scanpy’s <italic>highly_variable_genes</italic>.

<p>Initially, this approach was performed on the control and TeNT datasets separately.

For both conditions, equal contribution from both datasets indicated that there was minimal batch effect, as expected since the data was sequenced in a pooled sequencing run. We also performed batch correction using scVI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> which did not change the contribution of each dataset per cluster. As a result, we continued the analysis using the data that was not batch-corrected with scVI. Next, we concatenated all four datasets and followed the approach described above. This resulted in the identification of 21 Leiden clusters, which we also refer to as cell types (<xref rid="figs16" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 16A</xref>). Each cluster was manually annotated with a cell type based on the expression of previously established marker genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>.

<p><bold>a</bold> Averaged spectrogram of degraded vocalization (n=5) 5 days post-electrode-implantation in a chronically recorded TeNT-treated animal. The plot below the spectrogram shows the raw averaged trace of extracellular recording. Below the raw trace is the averaged continuous wavelet transform of the local field potentials (LFP, 1-300Hz). The plots show a large deflection event (similar to those seen during lights-off in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) right before the onset of the vocalization in the TeNT-treated animal. <bold>B</bold> Averaged song spectrogram (n=5) 5 days post-electrode-implantation from a chronically recorded control animal. The plot below the spectrogram shows the raw averaged trace of extracellular recordings. Below the raw trace is the averaged continuous wavelet transform of the local field potentials (LFP, 1-300 Hz). The averaged control song shows more and smaller amplitude deflections mostly during the vocalization compared to the TeNT-treated vocalization. <bold>C-D</bold> Spectral decomposition of local field potentials (LFPs) of the averaged deflections during night time at 5, 20, and 60 dpi in one control (C) and one TeNT-treated animal (D). The vertical red line depicts the trough of the raw deflection trace. The % increase is the relative increase compared to non-deflection events in the same recording timeframe of the same animal (Methods). Deflections of TeNT-treated animals in the 15-30 Hz range were approx. 27 times larger than those in control animals at 5 dpi. These differences are statistically significant between control and TeNT-treated groups, but not within the control group (p=0.7631 between controls, p&lt;10<sup>-35</sup> between all other pairs). The deflections across all animals and frequencies become more similar by 60 dpi (15-30 Hz: p=0.1371 between controls, p&lt;10<sup>-</sup> <sup>6</sup> between all other pairs; 30-70 Hz: p=0.7493 between controls, p&lt;10<sup>-2</sup> between all other pairs).

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study demonstrates that silencing of inhibitory interneurons in zebra finch HVC, a premotor nucleus critical for song production, disrupts song. However, song naturally recovers in a way that is surprisingly independent of LMAN, a distinct premotor nucleus required for normal song plasticity. The authors provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence that disruption is associated with microglial activation, activation of MHCI, synaptic changes, and altered neural dynamics in HVC. However, the manuscript would benefit from a clearer narrative structure, contextualization of the microglial results, and quantitative analyses to fully characterize song syntax and recovery after LMAN lesions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Torok et al. takes a creative approach to studying circuit perturbations in a sensorimotor region for vocalization control, in a songbird species, the zebra finch. By expressing the light chain of tetanus toxin in neurons in a sensorimotor region HVC, the authors constrain neural firing and study the resulting degradation and then recovery of song, after a protracted (&gt; 70-day) period. Recording data suggest a form of synaptic homeostasis emergent in both HVC and RA as a result of the profound loss of (inhibitory?) tone in HVC. The methods to analyze changes in song are particularly strong here, using dimension reduction and visualization techniques. Single-cell sequencing data showed accompanying changes in microglia abundance, as well as several other markers that were not observed in control viral injections. LFP analyses in birds during the tetanus onset phase showed clear dysregulation of typical voltage deflections and spectral power, each of which showed recovery in parallel with song recovery. Lastly, the authors present data indicating that the anterior forebrain region LMAN is not critical for the song degradation process, pointing instead to the direct relationship between HVC and RA in song plasticity in adults. The methods are generally well established, but my main concerns regard the validation of the viral construct, the lack of direct confirmation of tetanus toxin on inhibitory neurons or E/I balance in HVC, and a missed opportunity to look at song syllable sequence degradation and recovery.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The species under investigation is the premier model for the neural basis of vocal learning, and the telencephalic brain regions investigated are well mapped out for their control of vocal learning behavior. The methods for electrophysiology recording and analysis, song analysis, scRNAseq, and in situ hybridization pose no concern as they are well established for this group of co-authors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The introduction lays out a case for pursuing long-term E/I imbalances, vis-à-vis transient perturbations that have shown effects on the behavior. However, the rationale is not clearly stated. Why should the reader care that &quot;prolonged E/I imbalances&quot; may occur? Do they occur naturally or in some disease states (as alluded to in the first paragraph)? Without this rationale, the reader is left with an impression that the experiments were done because of a technical capability rather than a conceptual thrust.</p>
<p>The cited works for the statement the &quot;AAV viral vector expressing TeNT undre the human dlx promoter, which is selective for HVC inhibitory interneurons&quot; (reference 5 Kosche et al., 2016; and reference 10 Vallentin et al 2016) do not substantiate the targeting of this dlx5 promoter for interneurons in zebra finch HVC. Neither of these cited studies used viral vectors, and so this is a misattribution of the dlx5 promoter as targeting HVC inhibitory interneurons. However, the original development of this enhancer by Gord Fishell and others did have solid expression in HVC (Dimidschstein et al., 2016, Nature Neuroscience), and the enhancer was used to successfully target inhibitory neurons in nearby nidopallium NCM (Spool et al., 2022, Curr Biol). Citing these two studies would improve the standing of this viral approach. Nevertheless, the specific construct used here is not the same as the published studies mentioned above (AAV9-dlx-TeNT). The authors therefore need to show expression of the virus using some histological confirmation to cement the idea that they are indeed targeting inhibitory interneurons with this manipulation. The methods statement &quot;a single injection (~100 nL) in the center of HVC was sufficient to label enough cells&quot; is not convincing in the absence of quantified photomicrographs.</p>
<p>The authors present no physiological confirmation of TeNT on E/I balance directly, and so we don't have a clear picture of how/whether HVC interneurons are physiologically altered by this manipulation. That said, the Npix recordings show that there was a tremendous increase in gamma power following TeNT manipulation, which subsides as the protracted song recovery unfolds. This finding is somewhat counterintuitive, given that gamma oscillations are typically driven by inhibitory neurons in many systems (including songbird pallium) while the TeNT manipulation is purported to cause *reductions* in inhibitory neurotransmitter release within HVC. Some interpretation of these incongruent results would be useful in the Discussion.</p>
<p>The degradation and recovery of song is based mainly on the measures of duration of syllables and inter-syllable intervals, but HVC is also a key locus for song syllable sequence coding. The supplementary figures show some changes in sequences. It would improve the interpretation of both the degradation and recovery of the song to know whether syllable sequences (iiiABCCDDEF) truly recovered or were morphed in some way (e.g., iiiCDDDBEF). The PCA analyses (that the authors conducted) for these two potential outcomes would likely be very similar, but the actual songs would differ greatly under these two scenarios in terms of syllable sequence. From the representative spectrograms, it appears that the song syllable sequence does indeed recover well in these examples (perhaps less so in Supplementary Figure 3). A simple Markov-chain analysis of the syllable sequences across birds in the study would provide important confirmation of these insights.</p>

<p>This article addresses the question of how complex behavior is maintained despite perturbations in underlying motor circuits. Using zebra finch song production as a model system, the authors employ a genetic approach to perturb activity in GABAergic neurons within the vocal control nucleus HVC. Specifically, they use AAV to deliver the tetanus toxin light chain (TeNT) under the interneuron-specific DLX promoter, with the goal of silencing interneurons. This manipulation causes rapid degradation of song, followed by recovery over several weeks.</p>
<p>The authors characterize the recovery using a combination of transcriptomic analysis, electrophysiology, and lesion studies. Notably, the recovery does not require the lMAN, which is typically considered critical for vocal learning and plasticity. The authors speculate that homeostatic mechanisms within the motor pathway - potentially involving microglial remodeling -may mediate this recovery.</p>
<p>The strength of the study lies in the striking behavioral effects - both degradation and recovery - resulting from a specific circuit perturbation, and the use of complementary approaches (gene expression, neurophysiology, behavior, and lesions) to link circuit changes to behavior. The approach is creative, and the findings are intriguing. More detailed comments are provided below that may help enhance the manuscript's value to the community.</p>
<p>(1) In Figure 1b, the authors show changes in the relative abundance of cell types following TeNT expression in HVC. The most prominent change, as noted by the authors, is an increase in microglia. However, there are also apparent changes in the proportions of other cell types-particularly decreases in neurons and radial glia. How do the authors interpret the observed reductions in GABAergic and glutamatergic cells, as well as radial glia? Are these decreases statistically significant? Given the magnitude of these changes, could they reflect sampling differences (e.g., inclusion of tissue outside HVC) or neuronal cell death? Alternatively, is it possible that the absolute number of mature neurons remains constant, and increases in other cell types shift the relative proportions? The authors should clarify how to interpret the Y-axis of this plot. It appears to reflect relative abundance rather than absolute cell numbers, which has important implications for interpretation.</p>
<p>(2) The authors appear to define their own cell type clusters and labels, rather than using standard classifications (e.g., Colquitt et al. 2021; Colquitt et al. 2023). This makes cross-study comparisons difficult. For example, Colquitt describes four classes of putative immature neurons (pre2-pre4, GABA-pre). In contrast, the authors refer to &quot;neuroblasts&quot; in Figure 1b. Are these equivalent to pre2-pre4 and/or to &quot;GABA-pre&quot;? What about &quot;migrating neuroblasts&quot; in Supplementary Figure 11? The authors could consider using the standard nomenclature, or if they disagree with that classification, explain why an alternative scheme is warranted.</p>
<p>(3) The transcriptomic data are underexplored. Many genes appear differentially expressed (e.g., in Figure 1c), however, the main text contains little discussion of differential gene expression beyond MHC I and B2M. It would be useful to discuss whether transcriptomic data support or rule out any other specific mechanistic hypotheses for recovery.</p>
<p>(4) The authors attribute increased microglial markers to interneuron silencing rather than inflammation from viral injection, based on control virus results (lines 143-146). However, is it plausible that TeNT expression itself, or batch variability, could drive differences in inflammation? The authors could address these alternatives with additional evidence or discussion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript investigates at behavioral and mechanistic levels the recovery of zebra finch song production after a genetically targeted insult to HVC, a vocal premotor nucleus known to generate stereotyped neural sequences that drive the correspondingly stereotyped song. This study is a close follow up to past work, published in Nature Neuroscience last year (Wang et al, 2024), in which custom lentiviruses were used to deliver a persistently active sodium channel, NacBAC or TeNT to block synaptic release, specifically to the excitatory projection neurons in HVC. In this past work, these manipulations resulted in rapid degradation of song, followed by a slow recovery that, remarkably, did not require practice. Song recovery was associated with synaptic remodeling that appeared to homeostatically bring the affected neurons back to a normal firing regime. This past paper was important because it clearly demonstrated behaviorally and mechanistically how neural plasticity can restore a learned behavior without practice, showing that dominant reinforcement learning models of birdsong are not the full story.</p>
<p>This past work sets the context for the current paper, which instead targets the inhibitory neuronal population in HVC for silencing via viral-mediated expression of TeNT. Again, this sophisticated targeting of HVC interneurons resulted in rapid degradation of song, followed by a much slower but seemingly full recovery.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this paper has several strengths. First, it provides yet another convincing example of non-canonical vocal learning in the zebra finch because LMAN (a nucleus required for trial and error song learning) is not required for song recovery. Second, its targeting of interneurons clarifies the extent to which inhibition in HVC is essential for vocal patterning (not surprising but important to show). Third, by using RNAseq of HVC at the time of peak song disruption, it zeroes in on specific genetic/cellular activations associated with a lack of inhibition (e.g., microglial activation and MHC1 expression), opening up new avenues for future study. Using in vivo electrophysiology it also characterizes some gross circuit-level abnormalities in HVC-RA transmission and during sleep.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Yet the paper also has several areas for improvement, primarily:</p>
<p>Main issues</p>
<p>(1) Narrative-level confusion, a mix of results, many hanging threads</p>
<p>The arc of this paper is very hard to follow, new experiments arise without a clear setup or connection to past ones. Concepts jump around unpredictably. The reading experience would be dramatically improved if there were a clear single line of logic going through the entire paper, which could be accomplished by inserting a paragraph at the end of the intro section that walks the reader step-by-step through what they are going to see. I don't recommend this for all papers - but this paper requires it, in my opinion, because we have such an unusual combination of experimental approaches, outcomes, and data formats (behavior, RNA seq, targeted tests of microglial activation in the setting of adult impairment and song development, electrophysiology during sleep. It's very difficult for me to tie this all together into a crisp narrative that sticks with me days after reading the paper. Instead, it feels like some disconnected factoids. Examples:</p>
<p>
a) Characterization of degradation and slow recovery (much slower than targeting of projection neurons form past work (Wang et al, 2024).</p>
<p>
b) Activation of microglia and MHC1 during the degraded period; microglia return to normal at recovery.</p>
<p>
c) Developmenta profile of microglia expression.</p>
<p>
e) Sleep replay in HVC is perturbed during the degraded state. Mostly returns to normal following recovery, but *some* aspects are still abnormal.</p>
<p>
f) Detailed ephys analysis of HVC excitability and RA suppression, invoking ideas that HVC drives RA inhibition.</p>
<p>
g) LMAN lesions do not block degradation or recovery.</p>
<p>There are at least three threads of this paper - it therefore reads like three different papers stitched together into one - united only by the method of HVC interneuron targeting. In my view, a pretty major overhaul is required, even if it means cutting out specific details and figures that distract from the paper's message (for example there is a whole sub-section analyzing HVC impact on RA that vaguely invokes ideas of HVC engagement of RA</p>
<p>(2) Interpretation of microglia is confusing and unresolved</p>
<p>Microglia activation is measured at peak song disruption, and returns to normal following recovery. To test if this phenomenon is associated with learning or degradation, the authors measure microglia during development.</p>
<p>&quot;The increased inhibitory tone in HVC and the number of microglia could induce synaptic changes that contribute to degraded song production. Alternatively, the rise in microglia could be part of the recovery response to produce synaptic changes needed to regain the song following perturbation.&quot;</p>
<p>This is a great if/then statement on how to interpret the microglial activation at the core of the paper. But it remains unresolved. Is there a causal experiment that could distinguish these possibilities?</p>
<p>(3) The quantification of song dynamics during the recovery process in LMAN lesioned birds is required to support claims. Perhaps the most interesting claim of the paper - that recovery happens without LMAN, is not sufficiently supported by data analyses. This is a major problem.</p>
<p>The same analysis used in the LMAN-intact degradation/recovery dataset should be used for the LMAN dataset. At present, there are no quantification, only example spectrograms. Also, Supplementary Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 5 are identical, suggesting a lack of proofreading in this part of the manuscript. For example the reader cannot even ascertain if the key aspect of song degradation - the production of exceedingly long syllables - is occurring in the LMAN lesioned animals.</p>
