<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The Bile Acid Sodium Symporter (BASS) family transports a wide array of molecules across membranes, including bile acids in humans, and small metabolites in plants. These transporters, many of which are sodium-coupled, have been shown to use an elevator mechanism of transport, but exactly how substrate binding is coupled to sodium ion binding and transport is not clear. Here we solve the crystal structure at 2.3 Å of a transporter from <italic>Neisseria Meningitidis</italic> (ASBT<sub>NM</sub>) in complex with pantoate, a potential substrate of ASBT<sub>NM</sub>. The BASS family is characterised by two helices that cross-over in the centre of the protein in an arrangement that is intricately held together by two sodium ions. We observe that the pantoate binds, specifically, between the N-termini of two of the opposing helices in this cross-over region. During molecular dynamics simulations the pantoate remains in this position when sodium ions are present but is more mobile in their absence. Comparison of structures in the presence and absence of pantoate demonstrates that pantoate elicits a conformational change in one of the cross-over helices. This modifies the interface between the two domains that move relative to one another to elicit the elevator mechanism. These results have implications, not only for ASBT<sub>NM</sub> but for the BASS family as a whole and indeed other transporters that work through the elevator mechanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Bile Acid Sodium Symporter (BASS) family of secondary transporters is synonymous with its founding members, the apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) and the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Geyer et al., 2006</xref>). These proteins harness the sodium gradient to transport bile acids across the plasma membranes of enterocytes of the terminal ileum and hepatocytes, respectively. They are both targets of drugs currently in the clinic; ASBT as the target of drugs to alleviate chronic constipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Karpen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Khanna &amp; Camilleri, 2021</xref>) and NTCP as a target for Hepatitis B and D virus entry inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wedemeyer et al., 2022</xref>). Both proteins also influence drug distribution. The BASS family, however, transports a wide array of substrates other than bile acids. In mammals, the sodium-dependent organic anion transporter (SOAT) transports sulphated steroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Grosser et al., 2013</xref>) and others are putative neurotransmitter transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Burger et al., 2011</xref>). In plants sodium-coupled BASS transporters transport small metabolites such as pyruvate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Furumoto et al., 2011</xref>) and glycolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">South et al., 2017</xref>) across the plastidial membrane.</p>
<p>The first detailed structural information on the BASS transporters came though crystal structures of two bacterial transporters, one from <italic>Neisseria Meningitidis</italic> (ASBT<sub>NM</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hu et al., 2011</xref>) and one from <italic>Yersinia Frederiksinii</italic> (ASBT<sub>YF</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Though neither protein is likely to transport bile acids physiologically, <italic>in vitro</italic> both transporters have been shown to catalyse the sodium dependent transport of the bile acid taurocholate (TCH) and have provided an initial structural framework through which the extensive site-directed mutagenesis studies carried out on ASBT and NTCP could be mapped. The bacterial transporters are built from 10 transmembrane helices, with a 5-fold inverted repeat arranged in two domains, a core domain, and a panel domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The core domain is characterised by two extended helices that cross over at the centre with residues within the extended region contributing to two sodium ion binding sites (Na1 and Na2). The residues forming the sodium binding site in ASBT<sub>NM</sub> are conserved in many members of the BASS family including ASBT and NTCP (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). ASBT<sub>NM</sub> was crystallised in the presence of TCH and this bile acid is observed to bind in an inward-facing cavity between the core and panel domains in a binding mode that remains stable during molecular dynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Alhadeff et al., 2015</xref>). Secondary transporters function by the alternating access mechanism in which conformational changes to the transporter enable the substrate binding site to switch between the opposing sides of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Beckstein &amp; Naughton, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Drew &amp; Boudker, 2016</xref>). The structure of ASBT<sub>YF</sub> was solved in both an inward-facing state, similar to ASBT<sub>NM</sub>, and an outward-facing state. Based on these structures an elevator type model of transport was proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). In such mechanisms it is expected that the substrate binds to one domain, which moves with respect to another so that the substrate can be carried across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Drew &amp; Boudker, 2016</xref>). In the ASBT<sub>NM</sub> structure, however, the position of the TCH is not entirely consistent with such a model, as though there are specific interactions only with residues of the core domain, the TCH is not primarily embedded within that domain and is not set as deeply within the cleft as might be expected. This may be partly due to the protein binding to the inward-facing state of the protein where the substrate should be released, but it is also likely that the bile acids do not bind optimally to the bacterial transporters. More recently, structures of human NTCP have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Asami et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Goutam et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Park et al., 2022</xref>). Though NTCP lacks the first transmembrane helix of the bacterial transporters, the overall fold of the proteins is the same and similar conformations of outward and inward-facing states consistent with an elevator mechanism of transport are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Park et al., 2022</xref>). The structure of NTCP was also solved with glyco-chenodeoxycholic but even though the structure is outward-facing and NTCP binds bile acids physiologically, the interactions of the bile acid with the core of the protein are rather weak leading the authors of the paper to propose an alternative mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). To gain further insight the mechanism of BASS family of transporters, and in particular the 10-transmembrane helix transporters, we therefore sought to find a likely substrate for the bacterial transporters that would enable us to understand how substrates bind.</p>

PanS has been implicated in the transport of the coenzyme A precursors, ketopantoate and pantoate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ernst &amp; Downs, 2015</xref>). ASBT<sub>NM</sub> and ASBT<sub>YF</sub> are also similar to BASS1 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>) and it has been shown that BASS1 from <italic>A. thaliana,</italic> can transport pantoate, at least <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore decided to investigate whether the coenzyme A precursors would also bind to ASBT<sub>NM</sub>.</p>
<p>Here we demonstrate that pantoate, but not ketopantoate or pantothenate, binds to ASBT<sub>NM</sub>. We solve the crystal structure of the protein in complex with pantoate and show that the pantoate makes specific interactions with residues in the cross-over region of the protein consistent with the elevator mechanism of transport. Molecular dynamics shows that this binding mode is more stable when sodium ions are present in their respective binding sites. Binding of pantoate causes a subtle conformational change within the core region of the protein, which may trigger the more widespread movements of the protein that would enable transport to occur. This suggests a more specific mechanism for ASBT<sub>NM</sub>, much more in line with the classical alternating access model of transport, than has recently been suggested for NTCP.</p>

<title>Pantoate binds to ASBT<sub>NM</sub></title>
<p>To assess whether pantoate and its derivatives are likely substrates for ASBT<sub>NM</sub> we first used a dye-based stability assay in which stability is used as a surrogate for binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alexandrov et al., 2008</xref>). Whereas pantoate stabilised the protein to a similar amount to taurocholate, neither ketopantoate nor pantothenate had any effect under the conditions tested (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). To verify binding and obtain a more reliable estimate of the affinity of pantoate for ASBT<sub>NM</sub> Isothermal Calorimetry (ITC) was then used, giving a measured K<sub>D</sub> of 127 μM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Although we were unable to obtain a reliable estimate of the K<sub>D</sub> of taurocholate using ITC due to its detergent-like properties, the K<sub>D</sub> of pantoate is similar to the K<sub>M</sub> reported for TCH (50 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hu et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Structure of ASBT<sub>NM</sub> with pantoate</title>
<p>To understand how pantoate binds to ASBT<sub>NM</sub> we solved the structure of the protein in the presence of pantoate using X-ray crystallography (ASBT<sub>NM(Pan)</sub>). Crystals were grown using the <italic>in-meso</italic> method of crystallisation and the structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined at a resolution of 2.3 Å (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Density consistent with pantoate, and sodium ions in both ion binding sites is evident in the resulting maps (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). There is also evidence of a lipid like molecule within the binding site. The transporter adopts an inward-facing conformation as seen for the structure of ASBT<sub>NM</sub> with taurocholate present (ASBT<sub>NM(TCH)</sub>; 3ZUX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hu et al., 2011</xref>) and the two structures can be superposed with a root mean square deviation RMSD of 0.6 Å for 263 out of 308 C<sub>α</sub> atoms within 2 Å after superposition (see Methods). The most substantial difference in the conformation of the two structures is seen for TM1. In the ASBT<sub>NM(TCH)</sub> structure, TM1 bounds one side of the crevice between the panel and core domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In this structure the helix is kinked at residue Thr 14 so that it splays out and enlarges the cavity on the inward-facing side of the protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In the ASBT<sub>NM(Pan)</sub> structure TM1 is still kinked although the whole helix has moved as an approximate rigid body by ∼75° pivoting around Ile 11 such that residues 1 to 10 move over the cytoplasmic entrance to the cavity to partially occlude it from the inward-facing side, and residues 12 to 28 move away from TM10. This creates an opening into the crevice from the membrane between the panel and core domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B and C</xref>, Movie S1).</p>

<p>The pantoate binds between the two cross-over helices TM4b and TM9b (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The carboxylic acid of the pantoate interacts with the main chain nitrogen atoms of Thr 112 and Ala 113 of TM4b and the 2-hydroxyl oxygen is within hydrogen bonding distance of the main chain nitrogen of Gly 267 of TM9b and the amino oxygen of Asn 265. The hydroxyl oxygen of the methyl-propanol moiety also interacts with His 294 and Asn 295, which reside on TM10. These residues are all within the core domain. The closest residues to the pantoate on the panel domain are Ile 203 and Ile 47 that interact with the methyl propanol. The sodium binding sites in ASBT<sub>NM</sub> are also located at the cross-over region of the two helices, behind the pantoate when viewed from the crevice between the core and panel domains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The ions are clearly defined in the electron density (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>) and there is very little change in their coordination in the ASBT<sub>NM(Pan)</sub> structure with respect to that of ASBT<sub>NM(TCH)</sub> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the region of the sodium and pantoate binding sites the most obvious change in the pantoate-bound structure relative to ASBT <sub>NM(TCH)</sub> is that the main chain nitrogen of Thr 112 is displaced by ∼1 Å and the C<sub>ψ</sub> by 2.4 Å. In fact, there is a slight movement of the whole of TM4b, which includes the sodium ion ligands, Ser 114 and Asn 115, towards the pantoate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, Movie S1). On the panel domain Ile 203, located at the centre of TM7, is also displaced slightly (∼1.2 Å) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D and E</xref>) enabling the pantoate to be accommodated easily. The conformational change of TM1 may be triggered by this displacement given that Ile 203 would clash with Phe 15 if TM1 had adopted the same conformation as in ASBT<sub>NM(TCH)</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Structure of ASBT<sub>NM</sub> without substrate</title>
<p>Given that the subtle conformational changes between the pantoate and taurocholate bound structures would be consistent with mechanistic changes upon substrate binding, with ASBT<sub>NM(TCH)</sub> representing a non-substrate bound structure, we also solved the structure without taurocholate or pantoate present (ASBT<sub>NM(ns)</sub>) at 2.1Å using the <italic>in-meso</italic> method of crystallisation (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Overall, ASBT<sub>NM(ns)</sub> is very similar to ASBT<sub>NM(TCH)</sub> with an RMSD of 0.5 Å for 293 out of 308 C<sub>α</sub> atoms (see Methods) and an almost identical coordination of the sodium ions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A-C</xref>). There are only two regions where there are slightly larger changes. The first, again, centres on TM1. However, the change is much more subtle than to the pantoate bound structure, pivoting ∼15° at Thr 14 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref> and B). The second is in the loop between TM5 and TM6, which links the core to the panel domain where the loop takes a conformation more similar to that seen in the ASBT<sub>NM(Pan)</sub> structure. In flexing between the inward-and outward-facing structures, as reported for ASBT<sub>YF</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), this loop changes conformation as it allows the panel to move with respect to the core. Overall, therefore, it appears that the binding of pantoate, rather than either the absence of TCH or the difference in crystallisation method, causes the change in position of TM4b.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Specificity of pantoate binding</title>
<p>To probe the specificity of binding we used two approaches. Firstly, we mutated the two residues for which the side chains are within hydrogen bonding distance of the pantoate in the ASBT<sub>NM(Pan)</sub> structure and tested the affinity of pantoate for the resultant proteins by ITC. Whereas the mutation of Asn 265 to alanine caused the binding of pantoate to be abolished (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), mutation of Thr 112 to either valine or alanine, surprisingly resulted in an increase in affinity to 86μM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) and 11μM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) respectively, though noticeably the latter was entropy driven. Secondly, because much of the molecular recognition involves the main chain atoms, we used a structure activity relationship approach, testing whether a panel of similar compounds would stabilise the protein (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). None of the compounds tested stabilised the protein as much as pantoate, showing the importance of the hydroxy-acetate group, which interacts with the main-chain atoms. Just replacing the hydroxyl oxygen with a ketone as in ketopantoate appears to disrupt binding, likely due to an unfavourable interaction with Asn 265. The only other residues that possess the hydroxy-acetate moiety are isocitrate and D-malate. Both compounds have additional charged groups that may make them less favourable for binding.</p>

<title>Molecular Simulations show greater stability of pantoate when sodium ions are present</title>
<p>To gain insight into the effect of sodium ions on the binding of pantoate, molecular simulations were carried out. Over 0.5 µs of MD simulations, pantoate remains in the crystallographic binding position (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). With sodium ions present in both the Na1 and Na2 sites the hydrogen bonds between pantoate and the main chain nitrogen atoms of T112 and A113 at the N-terminus of TM4b and G267 at the N-terminus of TM9b remain intact (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) with more fluctuating interactions with the side chain atoms. On the other hand, in the absence of sodium ions the pantoate is more mobile (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig S6A</xref>) with the interactions with the main-chain atoms more intermittent (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Over the course of the simulations with the sodium ions, the ions remain stably bound in or close to the Na1 and Na2 sites although the simulations indicate that there is an alternative sodium ion binding position close to the crystallographic Na1 site (labelled Na1* in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). In the simulations without bound sodium ions, ions enter the inward-facing funnel and approach the Na1* binding site, but do not settle into the same binding mode seen in the bound simulations (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>), although complete binding events may occur on longer time scales.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ASBT<sub>NM</sub> binds pantoate, consistent with this compound being suggested as a substrate for the homologous PanS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ernst &amp; Downs, 2015</xref>) and BASS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Huang et al., 2018</xref>) proteins. The results from the molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the importance of the sodium ions in stabilising the binding mode of the pantoate at the N-termini of the cross-over helices (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) and might suggest that the ions structure the region in readiness for substrate binding. This conclusion is supported by the sodium-free wild-type structures of ASBT<sub>YF</sub>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>) where the region equivalent to 110-116 in ASBT<sub>NM</sub> and the pantoate interacting residues Thr 112 and Ala 113 adopt varying positions. While it would appear from the molecular dynamics simulations that the interaction that the pantoate makes with the side chain of Asn 265 is less conserved than those involving the main chain atoms, the mutagenesis studies highlight the importance of the residue in binding. Asn 265 also caps TM4b so could potentially stabilise the structure of the binding site as well as interacting with the substrate.</p>
<p>The pantoate is firmly nestled within the core domain and the only interactions it makes with the panel domain are van der Waals interactions with Ile 47 and Ile 203. These residues are conserved in PanS and ASBT<sub>YF</sub> but in BASS1 are replaced with a valine and a threonine respectively (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). The binding of the pantoate appears to cause a displacement of Ile 203, which in turn displaces Phe 15 on TM1. The novel position of TM1 appears to partly occlude the pantoate in the binding site. It would be tempting to think that the partially occluded conformation we observe here is mechanistic as transporters often go through one or more occluded conformations during their mechanistic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Beckstein &amp; Naughton, 2022</xref>). However, while Phe 15 is conserved in PanS, ASTB<sub>YF</sub> and BASS1, and there is some flexing of this region in ASBT<sub>YF</sub> as the protein changes conformation from outward to inward-facing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), there is little conservation at the N-terminus amongst the proteins, suggesting that the position of the N-terminus may not be critical for transport.</p>
<p>Zhou et al have demonstrated that ASBT<sub>YF</sub> is likely to go through an elevator mechanism as is also observed for other proteins with the same fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Park et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ung et al., 2022</xref>). As a sodium-coupled symporter, the pantoate should bind to the outward-facing form of the protein and trigger movement to the inward-facing state where it can be released. Modelling the outward-facing state of the ASBT<sub>NM(Pan)</sub> structure based on the ASBT<sub>YF</sub> structure shows that the pantoate could easily be accommodated in the outward-facing form (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). The position of the pantoate observed here, therefore, is consistent with an elevator mechanism. It is possible that with the constraints of the membrane, the interaction of Ile 207 with the pantoate as the protein moves to the inward-facing state would trigger the release of the pantoate, rather than resulting in the movement of TM1. In binding the pantoate the position of Thr 112 moves by 2.4 Å. The position of this residue is intriguing because in morphing between the putative outward and inward states of the protein, Thr 112 comes within 2 Å of Met 48 on the panel domain. The interaction between Thr112 and Met48 may, therefore, block the protein from switching conformations. It can be speculated that the movement of the threonine side-chain may unlock the transporter, allowing it to switch from outward to inward-facing (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

<p>The pantoate binding mode seen for ASBT<sub>NM</sub> can easily be extrapolated to the plant BASS transporters, which transport similar substrates. In addition to BASS1, which has been suggested to transport pantoate as discussed above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Huang et al., 2018</xref>), BASS2 transports pyruvate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Furumoto et al., 2011</xref>), BASS6 glycolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">South et al., 2017</xref>) and BASS5 chain-elongated 2-keto acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gigolashvili et al., 2009</xref>). The sodium binding sites are conserved throughout these BASS transporters with high conservation within the cross-over regions. Each of these molecules would be able to form hydrogen bonds with the main chain nitrogen atoms of TM4b and TM9b as observed with pantoate. While the pantoate transporter BASS1 contains an asparagine and threonine at the positions of Asn265 and Thr112 respectively, in the other BASS transporters these are replaced by serine and glutamine respectively. This may allow the keto-acids to bind. It would be expected, therefore, that a similar mechanism and binding mode may be seen throughout the BASS transporters.</p>
<p>It also seems plausible that in the human bile acid transporters, the substrate would also form specific interactions with the main chain nitrogen atoms of the cross-over helices. As we observe for pantoate binding to ASBT<sub>NM</sub>, for human ASBT it has been shown that uptake of TCH is abolished when the equivalent of Asn 265 (Asn 266) is mutated to a cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Banerjee et al., 2008</xref>) and increases when Thr 112 (Thr 110 in ASBT<sub>NM</sub>) is changed to the same residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hussainzada et al., 2008</xref>). In NTCP mutation of Asn 262 also abolishes uptake of TCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yan et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests there may be some similarity in the mechanisms but exactly how these proteins are able to bind to the wide variety of primary, secondary and conjugated bile acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Grosser et al., 2021</xref>) that have been reported as substrates is difficult to say. Liu and co-workers have modelled two bile acids into density that they observe when they solved the structure of human NTCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). In this structure, while the glycine head group of the bile acid is near to the cross-over helices, the interactions with it are rather weak and the density associated with this moiety is also rather poorly defined. As the authors of this study have pointed out, it is hard to reconcile this binding mode with the elevator mechanism, which others have demonstrated since that paper was submitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Park et al., 2022</xref>). It may well be that the binding mode observed for NTCP is a non-productive mode and a greater interaction with the residues of the cross-over region, linking the sodium ions with substrate binding, will be required to elicit a conformational change. Given that pantoate does not interact with TM1, it seems unlikely that the absence of this helix in the bile acid transporters would affect the elevator mechanism unduly.</p>
<p>In conclusion the elucidation of pantoate-bound ASBT<sub>NM</sub> provides new insight into the mechanism of the BASS family of transporters. Pantoate binding to the cross-over region of the sodium-bound protein causes subtle changes to Thr 112 and TM4b. Thr 112 is located in the centre of the protein near to the panel domain and its repositioning could unlock the transporter, enabling it to swap between outward and inward facing states. In the absence of sodium ions these residues are likely to be more flexible, which may enable the transporter to switch from one conformation to another without requiring the conformational change mediated by the substrate. While the exact binding mode of bile acids in the human proteins remains unclear, the high conservation of residues involved in this area suggests that the interaction with residues on the cross-over region may follow a similar mechanism.</p>

Site-directed mutations were introduced by PCR (Quikchange II, Agilent Technologies). Cultures were grown in Lemo21 (DE3) cells in PASM-5052 media following the MemStar protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, the cells were grown at 37 <sup>◦</sup>C with shaking at 200 rpm. At an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5, 0.4mM IPTG and 0.25mM L-rhamnose were added and the temperature was decreased to 25<sup>◦</sup>C for overnight induction. Cell pellets were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 <italic>g</italic> for 15min at 4<sup>◦</sup>C and resuspended in PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.8 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) with 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, DNaseI, and 0.5 mM Pefabloc (Roche). Cells were lysed by passing them twice through a cell disruptor at a pressure of 25 kpsi. Unbroken cells and cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 <italic>g</italic> for 13 min and the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 200,000 <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 1h to pellet the membranes. Membrane pellets were resuspended in PBS, 15 ml per 1 l of culture, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at -80°C.</p>
<p>Membranes were solublised in 1x PBS, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole and 1% (w/v) DDM supplemented with 0.5 mM Pefabloc (Roche) for 2hrs at 4°C. Insolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 200,000 <italic>g</italic> for 45 min and the supernatant was added to HisPur Ni-NTA superflow agarose, (ThermoFisher) (1ml per 1 mg GFP-tagged protein). The slurry was gently stirred for 3 h to allow binding and then loaded into a glass Econo-Column (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 10 Column Volumes (CV) of wash buffer (1x PBS, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% DDM) containing 20 mM imidazole, followed by 10 CV with the imidazole augmented to 30 mM. 3C protease (1:1 stoichiometry with ASBT<sub>NM</sub>-GFP) was added to the resin and cleavage was performed overnight at 4°C. The protein was eluted with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.03% DDM and passed over a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the same buffer. The flow through was collected and concentrated to 6-10 mg/ml using a 100 kDa molecular weight (MW) cutoff centrifugal concentrator (Sartorius) and loaded onto a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.03% DDM.

Isothermal calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed on a MicroCal PEAQ-ITC (Malvern Panalytical, UK). The protein solution (220 μM) was filled into the sample cell and the pantoate solution (5mM in the dialysis buffer) into the syringe. The cell temperature was set to 10<sup>◦</sup>C with a stirring speed of 750 rpm and a reference power of 10 μcal/sec. 20 injections were performed with an initial delay of 250 s. The initial injection was performed for 0.8 s with an injection volume of 0.4 μl. The later injections were performed for 4 s with an injection volume of 2 μl. 180 s spacing was left between each injection. The data were analysed using the “one set of sites” model within the MicroCal PEAQ-ITC software (Malvern) iterated using the Lavenberg-Marquardt algorithm after subtraction of the control experiment (pantoate titrated into buffer).

<p>The manuscript represents a <bold>valuable</bold> contribution to an ongoing discussion about the substrate binding site and mechanism of the Bile Acid Sodium Symporter (BASS) family of transporters. Structural and biochemical analysis of a bacterial homolog, ASTBnm, in complex with its native substrate (not bile acids, but a vitamin A precursor, pantoate) show a new binding site that is consistent with classical proposals for elevator-type transport mechanisms. Molecular simulations highlight the improved stability for the substrate in the active site when ions are present, suggesting a binding order during the transport cycle. The structural studies, binding assays, and MD simulations are <bold>convincing</bold>, although support for the transport mechanism is <bold>incomplete</bold> without a pantoate transport assay.</p>

<p>The current manuscript provides a timely contribution to the ongoing discussion about the mechanism of the apical sodium/bile acid transporter (ASBT) transporters. Recent structures of the mammalian ASBT transporters exhibited a substrate binding mode with few interactions with the core domain (classically associated with substrate binding), prompting an unusual proposal for the transport mechanism. Early structures of ASBT homologues from bacteria also exhibit unusual substrate binding in which the core substrate binding domain is less engaged than expected. Due to the ongoing questions of how substrate binding and mechanism are linked in these transporters, the authors set out to deepen our understanding of a model ABST homolog from bacteria N. meningitidis (ABST-NM).</p>
<p>The premise of the current paper is that the bacterial ASBT homologs are probably not physiological bile acid transporters, and that structural elucidation of a natively transported substrate might provide better mechanistic information. In the current manuscript, the authors revisit the first BASS homologue to be structurally characterized, ABST-NM. Based on bacteriological assays in the literature, the authors identify the coenzyme A precursor pantoate as a more likely substrate for ABST-NM than taurocholate, the substrate in the original structure. A structure of ASBT-NM with pantoate exhibits interesting differences in structure. The structures are complemented with MD simulations, and the authors propose that the structures are consistent with a classical elevator transport mechanism.</p>
<p>The structural experiments are generally solid, although showing omit maps would bolster the identification of the substrate binding site. One shortcoming is that, although pantoate binding is observed, the authors do not show transport of this substrate, undercutting the argument that the pantoate structure represents binding of a &quot;better&quot; or more native substrate. Mechanistic proposals, like the proposed role of T112 in unlocking the transporter, would be much better supported by transport data.</p>

<p>The manuscript starts with a demonstration of pantoate binding to ASBTnm using a thermostability assay and ITC, and follows with structure determinations of ASBTnm with or without pantoate. The structure of ASBTnm in the presence of pantoate pinpoints the binding site of pantoate to the &quot;crossover&quot; region formed by partially unwinded helices TMs 4 and 9. Binding of pantoate induces modest movements of side chain and backbone atoms at the crossover region that are consistent with providing coordination of the substrate. The structures also show movement of TM1 that opens the substrate binding site to the cytosol and mobility of loops between the TMs. MD simulations of the ASBT structure embedded in lipid bilayer suggests a stabilizing effect of the two sodium ions that are known to co-transport with the substrate. Binding study on pantoate analogs further demonstrates the specificity of pantoate as a substrate.</p>
<p>The weakness of the manuscript includes a lack of transport assay for pantoate and a lack of demonstration that the observed conformational changes in TM1 and the loops are relevant to the binding or transport of pantoate.</p>
<p>Overall, the structural, functional and computational studies are solid and rigorous, and the conclusions are well justified. In addition, the authors discussed the significance of the current study in a broader perspective relevant to recent structures of mammalian BASS members.</p>

<p>The manuscript describes new ligand-bound structures within the larger bile acid sodium symporter family (BASS). This is the primary advance in the manuscript, together with molecular simulations describing how sodium and the bile acids sit in the structure when thermalized. What I think is fairly clear is that the ligands are more stable when the sodiums are present, with a marked reduction in RMSD over the course of repeated trajectories. This would be consistent with a transport model where sodium ions bind first, and then the bile acid binds, followed by a conformational change to another state where the ligands unbind.</p>
<p>While the authors mention that BASS transporters are thought to undergo an elevator transport mechanisms, this is not tested here. In my reading, all the crystal structures describe the same conformational state, and the simulations do not make an attempt to induce a transition on accessible simulation timescales. Instead, there is a morph between two states where different substrates are bound, which induces a conformational change that looks unrelated to the transport cycle.</p>
<p>Instead, the focus is on what kinds of substrates bind to this transporter, interrogating this with isothermal calorimetry together with mutations. With a Kd in the micromolar range, even the best binder, pantoate, actually isn't a particularly tight binder in the pharmaceutical sense. For a transporter, tight binding is not actually desirable, since the substrate needs to be able to leave after conformational change places it in a position accessible to the other side.</p>
<p>There is one really important point that readers and authors should be aware of. In Figure 2A, the names are not consistent with the chemical structure. &quot;-ate&quot; denotes when a carboxylic acid is in the deprotonated form, creating a charged carboxylate. What is drawn is pantoic acid, ketopantoic acid, and pantoethenic acid. Less importantly, the wedges and hashes for the methyl group are arguably not appropriate, since the carbon they are attached to is not a chiral center. For the crystallization, this makes no difference, since under near-neutral pKas the carboxylic acid will spontaneously deprotonate, and the carboxylate form will be the most common. However, if the structures in Figure 2A were used for classical molecular simulation, that would be a big problem, since now that would be modeling the much rarer neutral form rather than the charged state. I am reasonably sure based on Figure 5 that the MD correctly modeled the deprotonated form with a carboxylate, but that is inconsistent with Figure 2A. Otherwise, the structure and simulation analysis falls into the mainstream of modern structural biology work.</p>
