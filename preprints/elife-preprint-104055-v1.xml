<title>Abstract</title><p>Human brain development is a complex process that requires intricate coordination of multiple cellular and developmental events. Dysfunction of lipid metabolism can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders. Lowe syndrome (LS) is a recessive X-linked disorder associated with proximal tubular renal disease, congenital cataracts and glaucoma, and central nervous system developmental delays. Mutations in OCRL, which encodes an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, lead to the development of LS. The cellular mechanism responsible for neuronal dysfunction in LS is unknown. Here we show depletion of mitochondrial DNA and decrease in mitochondrial activities result in neuronal differentiation defects. Increased astrocytes, which are secondary responders to neurodegeneration, are observed in neuronal (iN) cells differentiated from Lowe patient-derived iPSCs and an LS mouse model. Inactivation of cilia-related sonic hedgehog signaling, which organizes the pattern of cellular neuronal differentiation, is observed in an OCRL knockout, iN cells differentiated from Lowe patient-derived iPSCs, and an LS mouse model. Taken together, our findings indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction and impairment of the ciliary sonic hedgehog signaling pathway represent a novel pathogenic mechanism underlying the disrupted neuronal differentiation observed in LS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lowe syndrome (LS) (OMIM #309000) is a rare X-linked disorder characterized by bilateral congenital cataracts and glaucomatous optic nerve degeneration, renal tubular dysfunction, and intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Murdock and Chou, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Nusbaum et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Schaub et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Shah et al., 2024</xref>). Mutations in the oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL) gene are responsible for Lowe syndrome. This gene encodes an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase that preferentially cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI<sub>(4,5)</sub>P<sub>2</sub>) to generate PI<sub>4</sub>P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Lewis et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Luscher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Prosseda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Sakakibara et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>). Neurologically, patients with LS often exhibit developmental delays, intellectual disability, absent deep tendon reflexes, and hypotonia (Bökenkamp and Ludwig, 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Lewis et al., 1993</xref>). Seizures and behavioral issues such as hyperactivity and aggression are also common and difficult to treat. MRI findings frequently show structural brain abnormalities, including dilated periventricular spaces and small cystic lesions, in later stages of the disease. However, the differential diagnoses in LS are broad and include diverse metabolic and neuronal disorders, especially when neurologic impairment is prominent. Importantly, recent case reports have suggested the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of LS. For example, a 5-year-old boy with LS caused by OCRL mutation was initially diagnosed as a mitochondriopathy with electron microscopic evidence of mitochondrial changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dumic et al., 2020</xref>). Another patient suspected to have chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) due to mitochondrial disease showed a missense mutation in OCRL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ali et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Craigen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Eliyan et al., 2023</xref>). Despite these isolated reports of mitochondrial defects in OCRL mutated patients, no clear mechanism explains the neurological anomalies in LS.</p>
<p>Increasing evidence shows that neuron stem cell (NSC) differentiation toward either the neuronal or astroglial lineage is determined by reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Adusumilli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Shahin et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, mtDNA integrity and mitochondrial complex I activity are involved in the NSC differentiation, suggesting that mitochondrial damage is one of the first signals for elevated astrogliosis and decreased neurogenesis during pathological development of the central nervous system (CNS) and after neuronal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ignatenko et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Wang et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Astrocytes play an essential role in maintaining ionic balance, blood-brain barrier integrity, synapse function, and metabolic homeostasis in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Cabezas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">McNeill et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Oksanen et al., 2019</xref>; Pociūtė et al., 2024). In response to CNS injury, disease, or infection, they undergo a diverse array of morphological, molecular, and functional changes that are referred to as reactive astrogliosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Escartin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Matusova et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Zamanian et al., 2012</xref>). Despite their crucial role in CNS metabolism, however, it remains unclear how they are affected by metabolic stress. Previously we discovered increased astrogliosis in the neuronal retinal cells in the eye in LS.</p>
<p>Here, we hypothesize that mitochondrial dysfunction may cause defective neurogenesis in LS with differentially regulated neuronal-astrocyte development. To test this hypothesis, we used a rapid single-step procedure to convert induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), derived from a LS patient, into neurons (iN) and determined whether the failure of mitochondria to meet the energy required for normal CNS development accounts for impaired neuronal differentiation in this illness.</p>

<title>Distinct differentiation of neuronal stem cells and neuronal progenitor cells (NSPCs) in OCRL knockout and LS iPSCs</title>
<p>LS patients with <italic>OCRL</italic> mutations develop a wide range of neurologic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ramadesikan et al., 2021</xref>). To determine whether <italic>OCRL</italic> mutations influence neuronal development, we developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> system of functional induced neuron (iN) cells differentiated from Lowe syndrome patient-derived iPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Patient-specific iPS cells came from a boy with LS; familial controls came from his normally developing brothers. LS 100 is a 17-year-old with Lowe syndrome who was delivered after a 36-week pregnancy and diagnosed by genetic sequencing of OCRL mutations. LS200 is his older brother who was 22 years old when he provided blood for iPS cell generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Barnes et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to the patient- and sibling - originated iPSCs, we used iPSCs produced from two sources by gene editing, including an OCRL KO line (690 KO) generated using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing from a previously described control (690 Ctrl) that was unrelated to the LS subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Barnes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ran et al., 2013</xref>). We applied the pluripotency markers, Nanog and Oct-4a, to our iPSCs to validate their stemness and proliferative potential. Our <italic>OCRL</italic> knockout and <italic>OCRL</italic> mutation iPSC models showed highly efficient proliferation and stemness (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a and b</xref>). No <italic>OCRL</italic> protein expression was observed in <italic>OCRL</italic> knockout iPSCs; <italic>OCRL</italic> protein expression was markedly lower in LS-patient derived iPSCs (LS 100) than in WT-<italic>OCRL</italic> expressing iPSCs (LS 200) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Barnes et al., 2018</xref>). We used the rapid single-step method to convert iPSCs into iN cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ran et al., 2013</xref>). To identify the cellular processes controlling the differentiation of NSPCs into neurons and astrocytes, we used immunostaining to verify the stages of neuron differentiation. We found more astrocytes among cells originating in <italic>OCRL</italic> knockout and LS-patient derived iPSCs than in those from wild-type and control iPSCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d and e</xref>). We also used qPCR to assess the expression of individual genes characteristic of neurons and astrocytes, <italic>FOXG1</italic> (neurons)<italic>, NEUN</italic> (neurons)<italic>, BRN2</italic> (astrocytes) <italic>and GFAP</italic> (astrocytes). Surprisingly, we discovered that levels of the astrocytic genes in <italic>OCRL</italic> knockout and mutations iPSCs were markedly higher than in control cells, whereas, in comparison, neuron-specific genes were highly expressed in wild-type and control iPSCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f and g</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that OCRL - deficient neuronal progenitor cells preferentially favor the astrocytic lineage rather than the neuronal lineage.</p>

<title>Decreased functional mitochondrial activities during neurogenesis in OCRL knockout and LS-patient derived iN cells</title>
<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, including progressive Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Bantle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Klemmensen et al., 2024</xref>), and is known to impact astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ignatenko et al., 2023</xref>). Based on the clinical observation of mitochondrial defects in LS kidney samples, we hypothesized that OCRL deficiency may lead to mitochondrial defects in neurons. To test whether mitochondrial activity is defective during neurogenesis in LS, we examined mitochondrial activities in OCRL knockout and LS-patient-derived iN cells. Using qPCR, we measured mtDNA gene expression<italic>, COX2</italic> and <italic>DLOOP</italic> and found markedly decreased mtDNA gene expression in OCRL knockout and LS-patient-derived iN cells as compared to wild-type and controlled iN cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2a</xref>). Assessment of oxidative stress in these cells using immunostaining of 8-oxo-dg revealed positive oxidative stress signals in OCRL knockout and LS-patient-derived iN cells as compared to wild-type and controlled iN cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2b</xref>, c and d). Because these results suggested that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is defective in LS, we examined the functional properties of mitochondria during neurogenesis, focusing on mitochondrial OXPHOS levels. In a parallel approach to assess mitochondrial function, we also measured the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) using seahorse metabolic profiling. We discovered that mitochondrial OCR was significantly lower in OCRL knockout and LS-patient-derived iN cells than in wild-type and non-affected sibling control iN cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>).</p>

<title>Elevated astrocytic reaction during the differentiation of NSPCs in the Lowe syndrome (IOB) mouse model</title>
<p>Based on our iPSC models, we hypothesized that CNS development in the LS mouse model would exhibit higher levels of astrocytic progenitor cells than neuronal progenitor cells. We previously described the ocular phenotype of the humanized Lowe syndrome (IOB) mouse model. Here, we examined the differentiation of NSPCs into neurons and astrocytes in brain sections of the IOB mouse model (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Bothwell et al., 2011</xref>). Brain size was smaller in IOB mice than in WT mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). We examined the gene expression of neurons (<italic>Neun</italic>, <italic>Pax6</italic>) and astrocytes (<italic>Brn2</italic>, <italic>Gfap)</italic> and discovered more gene expression of astrocytic genes in brain sections of IOB than WT mice at the same age cohort (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure. 3b and c</xref>). We also examined the outcome of NSPC differentiation in brain sections of IOB and WT and found that the ratio of astrocytes was higher in IOB than in WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure. 3d and e</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that, as in the iPSC cell models of LS, the IOB mouse model for LS also shows greater differentiation into astrocytes than WT controls.</p>

<title>Decreased levels of mitochondrial function in CNS development in LS mouse model</title>
<p>We further assessed whether changes in mitochondrial activity are involved in the altered differentiation of stem cells and progenitor cells in the LS mouse model. Based on the metabolic studies on LS-patient derived cells, we hypothesized that OCRL deficient LS mouse model would similarly show altered mitochondrial functions. Examination with qPCR revealed less expression of the mtDNA genes <italic>mito1 and cox1</italic> in brain tissues of IOB than WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure. 4a</xref>). We also assessed the oxidative stress levels in OCRL deficient and WT brain sections by measuring 8-oxo-dg, a validated measure for oxidative damage. Positive oxidative stress signals were significantly higher in the brain sections of 3-month-old IOB mice than of WT mice of the same age (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b and c</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that the brains of the OCRL-deficient LS mouse model, in which levels of astrocytes but not neurons are increased, also demonstrate an increased level of mitochondrial oxidative stress and decreased mtDNA levels.</p>

<title>Defective ciliary homeostasis underlies neuronal dysfunction in Lowe syndrome</title>
<p>Mitochondrial defects have been shown to disrupt ciliary homeostasis in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ignatenko et al., 2023</xref>). The primary cilium plays a crucial role in Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction, which is essential for the proper development and function of the central nervous system and neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ho and Stearns, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nozawa et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we determined the sonic hedgehog (Shh) ciliary signal, which is involved in neuronal differentiation, in <italic>OCRL</italic> knockout iN cells and <italic>OCRL</italic> mutation iN cells. We used qPCR to assess genes involved in the Shh pathway, including <italic>SHH, GLI1</italic> and <italic>PATCH1.</italic> Shh signaling was markedly lower in <italic>OCRL</italic> knockout and LS-patient derived iN cells than in wild-type and unaffected LS sibling-derived iN cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure. 5a</xref>, b and c).

<p>Taken together, the results of the present studies of iPSCs derived from an LS patient and the IOB mouse model of LS show that mitochondrial activities, mtDNA loss and ciliary homeostasis are involved in neuronal development in Lowe syndrome. We also show an increase of astrocytes but not of neurons in the IOB mouse model of Lowe syndrome brain and neuronal cultures that supports a novel role of OCRL as a critical switch for controlling neuronal-astrocyte differentiation: the loss of OCRL results in a decreased neuron: astrocyte ratio (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure. 6</xref>). In addition, our findings present evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in neuronal development in Lowe syndrome model systems and reveal a link between mitochondria and cilia signaling. This research offers a therapeutic perspective for patients with Lowe syndrome.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Lowe syndrome, an X-linked disorder caused by OCRL mutations, leads to neurodevelopmental delays and other issues. Here, we showed that a depletion of mitochondrial DNA and a decline in mitochondrial activity is associated the altered differentiation, leading to defects in the differentiation of neuronal cells. We found that induced neuronal (iN) cells derived from mutant-OCRL iPSCs are more responsive to differentiation to astrocytes than iPSCs derived from wild-type OCRL and that a Lowe syndrome mouse model that lacks OCRL shows a similar pattern. Further, OCRL knockout mice, mutant iPSC-derived iN cells derived from OCRL knockout mice, and the IOB Lowe syndrome mouse model showed a decrease in the activity of the cilia-related sonic hedgehog pathway that organizes the pattern of cellular neuronal differentiation. Our findings suggest mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired ciliary sonic hedgehog signaling as novel mechanisms contributing to altered neuronal differentiation in Lowe syndrome.</p>
<p>Astrocytes play an active role in regulating synapse formation, maturation, and elimination during neuronal development, contributing to the establishment of proper neuronal circuits and brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Akdemir et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Clavreul et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Farhy-Tselnicker and Allen, 2018</xref>). Mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes leads to abnormal structure and signaling of primary cilia. This dysfunction, which includes depletion of mitochondrial DNA in astrocytes, induces the transcription factors FOXJ1 and RFX, which are master regulators of ciliogenesis, and chronic activation of the mitochondrial integrated stress response (ISRmt) in astrocytes drives anabolic metabolism and is proposed to promote this ciliary elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Bear and Caspary, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ignatenko et al., 2023</xref>). It remains unclear, however, whether metabolic ciliopathy is a novel pathogenic mechanism in mitochondria-related neurodegenerative diseases, involving disrupted cilia structure and signaling due to mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes.</p>
<p>Shh signaling is crucial for astrocyte development, contributing to the generation of cortical astrocytes. Additionally, it regulates diverse astrocyte functions, including synapse modulation, neuronal activity, and metabolic processes, in a region-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Garcia, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Gingrich et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hill et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">2019</xref>). Nevertheless, more research is needed in order to determine whether Shh signaling regulates mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics, and function in neurons, as well as mediating astrocyte-neuron interactions.</p>
<p>Our findings provide evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction and impairments of the ciliary sonic hedgehog signaling pathway may represent a novel pathogenic mechanism contributing to the abnormal neuronal differentiation observed in Lowe syndrome.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Lo et al. seeks to explain the cellular defects underlying the brain phenotypes of Lowe syndrome (LS). There have been limited studies on this topic and hence this is a timely study.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Studies such as these can contribute to an understanding of the cellular and developmental mechanisms of brain disorders.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This study by Lo et al. seeks to explain the cellular defects underlying the brain phenotypes of Lowe syndrome (LS). There have been limited studies on this topic and hence this is a timely study.</p>
<p>The study uses two models: (1) an LS IOB knockout mouse and (2) neurons derived from iPSC lines from LS patients. These two models are used to present three separate findings: (1) altered mitochondria function, (2) altered numbers of neurons and glia in both models, and (3) some evidence of altered Sonic Hedgehog signaling projected as a defect in cilia.</p>
<p>Conceptually, there are some problems of serious concern which must be carefully considered:</p>
<p>
(1) The IOB mouse was very extensively phenotyped when it was generated by Festa et.al HMM, 2019. It does not have any obvious phenotypes of brain deficits although the studies in this paper were very detailed indeed.</p>
<p>
(2) Reduced brain size is reported as a phenotype of the IOB mouse in this study. Yet over the many clinical studies of LS published over the years, altered brain size has not been noted, either in clinical examination or in the many MRI reports of LS patients.</p>
<p>While reading through these results it is striking that the link between the three reported phenotypes is at least tenuous, and in fact may not exist at all. The link between mitochondria and neurogenesis is based on a single paper that has been cited incorrectly and out of context. There is no evidence presented for a link between the Shh signaling defect reported and the mitochondrial phenotype.</p>
<p>General comments</p>
<p>(1) The preparation of the manuscript requires improvement. There are many errors in the presentation of data.</p>
<p>
(2) The use of references needs to be re-considered. Sometimes a reference is used when in fact the results included in that paper are the opposite of what the authors intend.</p>
<p>
(3) The authors conclude the paper by claiming that mitochondrial dysfunction and impairments of the ciliary SHH contribute to abnormal neuronal differentiation in LS, but the mechanism by which this sequence of events might happen hasn't been shown.</p>
<p>Final comments:</p>
<p>(1) Phenotype of increased astrocytes:</p>
<p>
The phenotype of increased astrocytes in both the IOB mouse brain or iPSC-derived cultures iN cells requires clarification as one of the markers used as an astrocyte marker, BRN2, is commonly used as a neuronal marker. As LS is a neurodevelopmental disorder, and the phenotype in question is related to differentiation, it is crucial to shed light on the developmental timeline in which this phenotype is seen in the mouse brain.</p>
<p>(2) Ciliary homeostasis:</p>
<p>
Mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes has been shown to induce a ciliogenic program. However, almost the opposite is shown in this paper, with regards to ciliation. Morphology of the cilia was not assessed either, which is an important feature of ciliary homeostasis. The improper ciliary homeostasis here appears to be the improper Shh signalling, which has not been shown to be related to mitochondrial dysfunction. This leaves one wondering how exactly the different phenotypes shown in this paper are connected.</p>
<p>(3) This paper lacks a clear mechanistic approach. While the data validates the 3 broad phenotypes mentioned, there is a lack of connection between these phenotypes or an answer to why these phenotypes appear. While the discussion attempts to shed light on this by referencing previous studies, some of the referenced studies show contradicting results. Hence, it would be beneficial to clarify these gaps with further experiments and address the larger question of the connection between the mitochondria, Shh signalling, and astrocyte formation.</p>
<p>(4) Most importantly, there is no mention of how the loss of OCRL, a 5-phosphatase enzyme, results in the appearance of the mentioned phenotypes. Since there are multiple studies in the field of Lowe Syndrome that shed light on the various functions of OCRL, both catalytic and non-catalytic, it is important to address the role of OCRL in resulting in these phenotypes.</p>
<p>(5) There are numerous errors in the qPCR experiments performed with regard to the genes that were assayed. The genes mentioned in the text section do not match those indicated in the graphs or legends. This takes away the confidence of the reader in this data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript investigates how neural cell development is affected in Lowe syndrome. Using neural cultures differentiated from human iPSCs carrying either an LS mutation or a genetically engineered mutation in OCRL, the authors show a depletion of mitochondrial DNA and a decrease in mitochondrial activities that correlate with an increased formation of astrocytes at the expense of neurons. Similar effects on mitochondria and on astrocyte development were observed in an LS mouse model. Moreover, these mutant brain cells are less likely to be ciliated and show a reduction in Sonic Hedgehog signalling.</p>
<p>Strengths/Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study derives strength from the analyses of two different models of Lowe syndrome, both reaching similar conclusions. However, the observed changes in mitochondrial defects, neuronal/astrocytic development, and primary cilia are only correlated, with no attempt to investigate a causal relationship. Moreover, the mouse model is only analysed at the adult stage providing no insights into the development of the defects. Different brain regions are analysed with immunostainings and qRT-PCR making it challenging to draw clear correlations between these findings. The quality of the corresponding figures is often poor and the selection of markers is frequently inappropriate. Taken together, these limitations complicate the interpretations of the data and significantly limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the study.</p>
