<abstract>
<p>Cancer immunotherapy by checkpoint blockade (ICB) is effective for various cancer types, yet its clinical use is encumbered by a high variability of patient response. Several studies have reported that the number of non-synonymous mutations (Tumor Mutational Burden, TMB), can predict patient response to ICB. This belief has become widespread and led to the FDA approval of immunotherapy patient prioritization based on TMB levels. The notion that TMB is predictive of response to immunotherapy is rooted in the neoantigen theory which stipulates that cancer-specific mutations can form neoantigens, which can be recognized by the immune system. Hence, the more mutations a tumor has, the more likely the immune response can be triggered. Here we revisit the data underlying the reported TMB/ICB response association and the neoantigen theory. First we assembled the largest pan-cancer dataset of immunotherapy patients with sequencing and clinical data. Surprisingly, we find little evidence that TMB is predictive of response to ICB. We demonstrate that associations similar to the ones reported previously can be observed in shuffled data, suggesting that previous studies suffered from the lack of correction for multiple hypotheses testing and confounding disease subtypes. Second, we revisit the neoantigen theory and demonstrate that a simple mathematical model can be consistent with both immunogenicity of neoantigens and the lack of association between TMB and response. Our analysis shows that the use of TMB in clinical practice is not supported by available data and can deprive patients of treatment to which they are likely to respond.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatments such as anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1, which target regulatory pathways in T-lymphocytes to enhance anti-tumour immune responses, have already proven to elicit durable clinical responses for some patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). However, the genetic determinants of response to immunotherapy have yet to be found. Several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) suggested that Tumour Mutational Burden (TMB), computed as the total number of nonsynonymous somatic mutations, is correlated with response to immunotherapy in cancer. The underlying hypothesis posits that a fraction of nonsynonymous mutations become exposed as epitopes and constitute neoantigens, which can trigger an anticancer response by the immune system. The association between high mutational burden and response to immunotherapy, within and across cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), has been widely reported in the scientific literature and the media. As a result, TMB is currently discussed as the most clinically advanced biomarker of response to immune checkpoint blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), and the FDA approved the use of TMB to identify patients most likely to derive clinical benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). These studies also triggered a search for inexpensive assays to evaluate TMB directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), as well as TMB-derived measures, such as neoantigens, neoepitopes, and mutation clonality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), which are all currently under investigation to further stratify patients most likely to respond to immunotherapy. Our analysis focuses on TMB itself, as this is the most widely used and only FDA-approved measure.</p>

<title>Data aggregation</title>
<p>To evaluate the association of TMB with response to ICB across a broader range of cancer types, we aggregated and analysed data for 882 immunotherapy patients with publicly available pre-treatment whole-exome sequencing data (referred below as CPI800+, <bold>Table S1</bold> and <bold>Material and Methods</bold>). We included patient-level data from an aggregate of early seminal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) as well as recent clear cell renal cell cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), non-small cell lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), bladder cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) and melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) ICB-treated cohorts. For every dataset examined, we retrieved TMB levels and survival data (Progression-Free Survival (PFS) or Overall Survival (OS)) for each patient. The original studies provided response classification for most patients.</p>
<p>We also leveraged 1283 patients (termed CPI1000+) who underwent immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), have unified TMB (n=1083) and response definition, as well as survival measures for some patients (n=545 with OS data). Furthermore, we obtained gene panel data (MSK-IMPACT) for 1662 patients (<bold>Table S1</bold>) who underwent immunotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, together this dataset constitutes the largest pan-cancer aggregate of ICB-treated patients with sequencing and clinical data, which allow a robust unified statistical assessment of TMB as a predictor of ICB response</p>

<title>Is TMB associated with response after treatment?</title>
<p>First, we compared the TMB in patients that have been classified as responders and non-responders based on a number of clinical characteristics. All datasets show not only a considerable overlap in TMB between responders and non-responders, but the lack of considerably elevated TMB for responders and a large range of TMB values in each group.</p>
<p>Consistent with previous studies we find no difference in TMB between responders and nonresponders for major cancer types (clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma, Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Breast Cancer), with only melanoma (mel1 and mel2, p=0.04 p=0.04) and non-small cell lung cancer datasets (lung1 and lung2, p=8.3×10<sup>-6</sup> and p=7.7×10<sup>-3</sup>) yielding significant differences as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref></bold>). Analysis in CPI1000+ revealed similar results, yet colorectal cancer, and bladder cancers showed significance of elevated TMB for responders (p=0.044 and p=5.4×10<sup>-7</sup>, respectively) (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref></bold>). We also found, consistent with previous studies, that this small elevation of TMB for responders is due to confounding effects of cancer subtypes, i.e. due to the different response rates of cancer subtypes with different TMB ranges (see <bold>Supplemental Text)</bold>. When we revisit a study that reported pan-cancer correlation between response rate and TMB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), we found that association was driven largely by overall high response in melanoma and subtypes of colorectal cancer (MSI+) with extreme differential response (see <bold>Supplemental Text</bold>). No association between TMB and response rate across all other cancer types is present in available data.</p>

<p>We also examined potential correlations between TMB and survival, rather than using a binary response variable (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>). Strikingly, plots of survival versus TMB do not show a visible correlation, trend or TMB cutoff that could differentiate longer and shorter surviving patients. There is a considerable and non-diminishing fraction of patients with long survival, even for lower ranges of TMB values. As we demonstrate below, attempts to find a TMB cutoff value to differentiate long- and short-survivals on such data can be prone to misinterpretation and require careful correction for multiple hypothesis testing.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next we investigated whether (i) small differences in TMB between responders and non-responders for some cancer types can be of clinical use, even when p-value&gt;0.05; (ii) there is a potential TMB cutoff that can predict groups of patients with a significant difference in survival; (iii) these clinical data can be reconciled with the neoantigen theory.</p>

<title>TMB is a poor predictor of response</title>
<p>The key component for validating a biomarker is acceptable classification accuracy, i.e. the biomarker’s capacity to correctly classify a patient’s response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). ROC curves analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref></bold>) is a standard tool used across disciplines for measuring the quality of a predictor; it provides a comprehensive quantification of specificity and sensitivity over all possible cutoffs, with the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) being an aggregate measure of predictor performance (AUC=0.5 for a predictor performing as well as random). Our ROC-curve analysis shows the (i) lack of a clear TMB cutoff that could be used in the clinic; (ii) poor performance of the TMB-based predictor of response to ICB, as evident from the low AUC in most datasets: mel1 and mel2 yielding of 0.62 and 0.59, and lung2 has an AUC of 0.68. Lung1, however, has the highest AUC of 0.85, which, as we show below, is still insufficient to select patients for ICB. ROC curve analysis on CPI1000+ cohort, with unified TMB, also shows a similarly poor AUC of 0.6 (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></bold>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="260265v3_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Using a poor predictor for treatment decisions can lead to patient misclassification, i.e. patients who could benefit from the therapy would be deprived of it (responders below the TMB threshold), and patients who get the treatment but don’t benefit from it (non-responders above the threshold). To quantify the shortcomings of TMB-based selection of patients for treatment we computed the proportion of misclassified patients based on the recent FDA approval of 10 mutations/Mb threshold to select patients for ICB (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</bold> We find that, on average across the non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma datasets, 62% of responders were below the treatment prioritization threshold and 19% of non-responders were above. While these misclassification rates vary across datasets, fractions of potential responders under the TMB threshold remain high. Moreover, the poor predictive power of TMB indicates that current efforts of choosing a single TMB measure for all cancer types (so call “harmonizing” TMB) would not address fundamental limitations of TMB as the biomarker of response. Indeed, our ROC analysis shows that even the optimal cutoff (Youden index associated cutoff) for each dataset would result in approximately 25% of responders ending up below the treatment prioritization threshold and thus discouraged from receiving a potentially efficacious and life-extending treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). As such, the main challenge in using TMB in the clinic is the inherently poor association between TMB and response to treatment.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>TMB cannot detect groups of patients with different survival post-immunotherapy</title>
<p>To evaluate the use of TMB for prioritizing patients, and to go beyond the binary response classification, we examined an association between TMB and survival time (Overall Survival, OS and Progression-free Survival PFS). Since survival data is “censored” i.e. only lower bound on survival is known for some patients that didn’t show progression or dropped out of the study, standard correlation-based methods cannot be used to evaluate such association. Nevertheless, groups of patients can be compared using survival analysis methods. Hence we tested whether it is possible to find a TMB threshold that can separate patients into groups with significantly distinct survival.</p>
<p>Scatterplots of survival versus TMB (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3B</xref></bold>) show no evidence of such TMB threshold. Nevertheless, several studies reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) a seemingly statistically significant difference in survival between patients below and above a particular threshold. One caveat of this approach is that choosing the threshold value suffers from inherent multiple hypothesis testing, i.e. when the TMB thresholds have been selected among numerous possible alternatives multiple hypotheses are being tested. This inherent multiple hypothesis testing would require further correction of the p-values; a step that is missing in other studies. However, standard approaches (e.g., Bonferroni correction, FDR correction) for multiple hypotheses testing could be too stringent because the hypotheses generated by comparing survival in two groups at multiple TMB thresholds are not independent.</p>
<p>To address this challenge we used a randomization approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), similar to earlier studies that examined cutoff selection for dose-response in epidemiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). We generate 1000 randomized datasets by shuffling TMB among patients, while keeping survival and censored labels unchanged for each patient. First, for each dataset (real or randomized) we determined the optimal threshold that maximizes the difference in survival for groups of patients above and below the threshold. This was done by trying all possible threshold values, computing the difference in survival by logrank test for the groups above and below the threshold; and selecting the optimal threshold that maximizes the difference in survival (i.e. minimize the logrank p-value). Second, we compared the optimal p-value for the real data, <italic>p<sub>real</sub></italic>, with the distribution of those for shuffled datasets <italic>f(p<sub>shuf</sub>)</italic> and computed the <italic>corrected p-value</italic> as the fraction of shuffled datasets below the real (p<sub>shuf</sub> &lt; p<sub>real</sub>) <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>)</bold>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Applied to the melanoma and lung cancer data, this approach (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>) shows that the majority (∼60-70%) of randomly shuffled datasets produced <italic>p<sub>shuf</sub></italic>below the standard 0.05 threshold, creating a seemingly significant TMB-survival association and emphasizing the need for multiple hypothesis correction. Applied to lung, melanoma and across CPI1000+ dataset (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref></bold>), our correction for multiple hypothesis testing reveals the lack of a significant TMB threshold that can classify patients into groups with different survival. In particular for lung cancer, for which we previously observed a significant association between TMB and response (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>), we obtained no significant threshold for TMB. We also ran our analysis using OS (for datasets where both OS and PFS are available: mel1, mel2 and lung1) instead of PFS as an endpoint and showed similar results, suggesting that survival definitions do not drive the results of our analysis (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref></bold> and <bold>S5B</bold>).</p>
<p>We further obtained consistent results for 1662 patients of MSK-IMPACT cohort treated with ICB but genotyped with gene panels rather than whole-exome sequencing (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref></bold>). Most of the 10 cancer types tested had a non-significant p-value including colorectal cancer (p=0.088) and melanoma (p=0.093) which have marginally significant p-values, except for non-small cell lung cancer (p=0.034). This study did not provide additional information such as tumor location for melanoma, Microsatellite Instability (MSI) status for colorectal cancer, or COPD for non-small cell lung tumors, which, as we showed above, can confound the association of TMB with response 24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Taken together, our analysis shows the lack of TMB thresholds that can establish a high-TMB group with a significantly longer survival.</p>

<title>Model reconciles neoantigen theory and data</title>
<p>Neoantigen theory is widely used to argue that cancers with high TMB are more likely to elicit an immune response upon ICB. Although our results show the lack of such dependence, we demonstrate that the effect we observe can nevertheless be explained by a simple mathematical model of neoantigens and immunogenicity (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Our model aims to explain (i) the lack of association between TMB and response; (ii) response by cancers with even very low TMB; and (iii) the lack of detectable selection against neoantigens(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Response to ICB treatment requires that cancers elicits an immune response, hence the probability of clinical response can be written as</p>
<p><italic>P</italic>{<italic>clinical response</italic>} = <italic>P</italic>{<italic>clinical response</italic>|<italic>immune response</italic>} · <italic>P</italic>{<italic>immune response</italic>},</p>
<p>Where <italic>P</italic>{<italic>clinical response</italic>|<italic>immune response</italic>} is the probability of clinical response, given that cancer elicits an immune response. Since clinical response is complex and depends on many variable we focus on the probability of cancer to elicit an immune response <italic>P</italic>{<italic>immune response</italic>}. For simplicity assume that every non-synonymous mutation has the same probability <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1 to be immunogenic (i.e. to be expressed, presented, interact with MHC, and trigger an immune response). Due to immunodominance, only a few <italic>k<sub>crit</sub></italic> immunogenic mutations are sufficient to elicit a full immune response. Hence, the probability for a cancer with <italic>N</italic> (=TMB) mutations to elicit an immune response is then the probability of having mutations:</p>
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="260265v3_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<p><bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref></bold> show <italic>P</italic>{<italic>immune response</italic>} as a function of <italic>N</italic> (TMB) for a range of <italic>p</italic> and <italic>k<sub>crit</sub></italic> values. The model shows two different behaviors. If individual mutations are unlikely to be immunogenic <italic>p</italic> ≪ 1, e.g. due to a low probability of being presented,, the probability of response increases gradually with TMB. The neoantigen theory generally expects such gradual increase in immunogenicity of cancer with TMB. Yet, available data (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>) don’t show such a trend.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if single mutations are more likely to be immunogenic <italic>p</italic>∼0. 1, the probability of response quickly saturates for TMB ≥ 1/<italic>p</italic>∼10, making such tumors respond to ICB irrespective of TMB, as we observed above in clinical data. In the case of <italic>k<sub>crit</sub></italic> = 1, even a single immunogenic mutation can trigger the response yielding <italic>P</italic>{<italic>immune response</italic>} = 1 − (1 − <italic>p</italic>)<sup><italic>N</italic>-1</sup>≈ 1 − <italic>exp</italic>(− <italic>pN</italic>). It is easy to see that for this case <italic>P</italic>{<italic>immune response</italic>} saturates when the total number of mutations approaches <italic>N</italic>∼1/<italic>p</italic>. In the data we observe about the same probability of response to ICB for cancers with as little as 10-20 mutations (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>). To achieve about constant <italic>P</italic>{<italic>immune response</italic>} for <italic>N</italic> &gt; 10 – 20 mutations, one needs <italic>p</italic>∼0. 1 for <italic>k</italic> = 1, and <italic>p</italic>∼0. 2 for <italic>k<sub>crit</sub></italic> &gt; 1. Together this argues that individual non-synonymous mutations have considerable chance for triggering an immune response, allowing cancers with as little as mutations to be treated with ICB.</p>
<p>For <italic>P<sub>immunogenic</sub></italic> in the range estimated in silico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) (0.22 for weak binders to T cells, and 0.64 for strong binders<italic>)</italic> and <italic>k<sub>crit</sub></italic> ≃ <italic>1-2,</italic> the probability of eliciting a response quickly approaches 1 for TMB≥10 and stays constant and independent of TMB. (<bold>Materials and Methods).</bold> The model further suggests that for the regime consistent with the data (<italic>P<sub>immunogenic</sub></italic>=0.2-0.6; <italic>k<sub>crit</sub></italic>≃<italic>1-2</italic>) (i) &gt;90% of tumours with as little as 10 non-synonymous mutations are immunogenic; (ii) when 90% of tumours are immunogenic they have on average as few as 2 immunogenic mutation. Such saturation of immunogenicity with low TMB in our model suggests that further immunogenic mutations experience weak negative selection (i.e. threshold epistasis), i.e. weak if any immunoediting(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). These results are also consistent with recently observed immunodominance hierarchies of the T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>): low TMB tumours can mount responses as robust as high TMB tumours since only a small subset of neoantigens are targeted by T cells.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our model also explains a puzzling observation that immunoediting, i.e. negative selection against immunogenic mutations, is inefficient, allowing tumors to accumulate a high TMB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Indeed, once a cancer accumulates mutations making it immunogenic, additional mutations incur at no additional selective disadvantage i.e. show “the epistasis of diminishing return”, and hence accumulate as neutral or weakly damaging passenger mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Moreover, according to this argument, a cancer should develop means to suppress the immune response early in its development, a prediction that can be tested in future studies of cancer clonal evolution. Taken together, our model and analysis of the available data indicate that cancer with even very few mutations can be immunogenic, suggesting that patients with low TMB might also mount robust immune responses, as has been recently shown for paediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Tumor Mutational Burden, a measure of the total somatic nonsynonymous mutations in a tumor, recently became a popular biomarker of response to ICB, notably because of its relative simplicity to assess.</p>
<p>However, this paradigm is largely based on a series of early papers that examined response in melanoma and lung cancer that we show here to be potentially problematic statistically and further confounded by tumor subtype. Several recent studies have also reported poor association of TMB with response for specific cancer types, and highlighted TMB and its expression/presentation-based derivatives as problematic for clinical cohort classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). In particular for melanoma, recent analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) and our results indicate that the site location can explain the observed association between TMB and response to ICB. For lung cancer, our analysis points to the possibility that co-occurrence with COPD may explain the association between TMB and response to ICB among smokers. Overall we demonstrate that while most cohorts and cancer types show the lack of association of TMB and response or survival, the remaining statistical signal in some cohorts can arise due to confounders such as clinical subtypes. Future studies can examine the underlying biology of TMB and neoantigens, aiming to explain the better responses to ICB in certain clinical and cancer subtypes.</p>
<p>Critically, even if responders show significantly but slightly elevated TMB, such associations do not imply the suitability of TMB as a biomarker of response. In particular, we show that no TMB cutoff can distinguish groups of patients with significantly different survival rates. Besides, we show that TMB has poor accuracy as a classifier of response, even in the best-case scenario (Youden optimal cutpoint). This result challenges the FDA approval of TMB for prioritizing patients for ICB. If implemented, such TMB-based clinical decision making would deprive many patients who can benefit from ICB from receiving a life-extending treatment.</p>
<p>An ICB clinical trial that used FDA-approved TMB threshold (KEYNOTE-158) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>) has focused on rare cancers, excluding melanoma and lung cancer. While claiming a higher response rate among high-TMB patients, the trial observed little, if any, difference in overall survival of high-TMB and other patients, putting in question the clinical use of TMB-based prioritization.</p>
<p>We also put forward a simple model that reconciles our findings with the neoantigen theory. Our model shows that if each mutation has a high chance of triggering an immune response, then only a few new mutations make a cancer immunogenic, consistent with the observed immunodominance i.e. the immune response is mounted against only a few of the neoantigens. This result is also consistent with the observed lack of association between antigen density and T-cell presence previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Moreover, our model suggests that most cancers are immunogenic, arguing that failures of ICB likely arise due to factors independent of cancer immunogenicity. Quantitative measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) and modelling of neo-antigenic effects can deepen our understanding of cancer development and response to immunotherapy.</p>
<p>Although attractive and scalable, TMB does not consider the effect of specific mutations (missense, frameshift etc), their presentation and clonality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), nor the state of the tumour, its microenvironment, and interactions with the immune system that can be integrated into potentially better predictors of response to ICB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). For the biology of oncoimmunity, our analysis suggests that, contrary to the neoantigen theory, cancer immunogenicity does not increase with the growing load of neoantigens, and that clinical subtypes can underlie better response to ICB.</p>
<p>Altogether, our analysis indicates that low TMB should not be used to deprive otherwise eligible patients for immunotherapy treatment, and stimulates further research into other determinants of response to immunotherapy.</p>

<p>In their manuscript entitled: &quot;Is tumor mutational burden predictive of response to immunotherapy?&quot;, Gurjao and colleagues discuss the use of tumor mutational burden (TMB) as a predictive biomarker for cancer patients to respond to immune checkpoint blockage (ICB). By analyzing a large cohort of 882 patient samples across different tumor types they find either little or no association of TMB to the response of ICB. In addition, they showed that finding the optimal cutoff for patient stratification lead to a severe multiple testing problem. By rigorously addressing this multiple testing problem only non-small cell lung cancer out of 10 cancer types showed a statistically significant association of TMB and response to ICB. Nevertheless, it is clearly shown that in any case the rate of misclassification is too high that TMB alone would qualify as a clinically suitable biomarker for ICB response. Finally, the authors demonstrate with a simple mathematical model that only a few strong immunogenic mutations would be sufficient for an ICB response, thereby showing that also patients with a low TMB score could benefit from immunotherapy. The manuscript is clearly written, the results are well presented and the applied methods are state-of-the-art.</p>

<p>The manuscript points out that TMB cut-offs are not strong predictors of response to immunotherapy or overall survival. By randomly shuffling TMB values within cohorts to simulate a null distribution of log-rank test p-values, they show that under correction, the statistical significance of previously reported TMB cut-offs for predicting outcomes is questionable. There is a clinical need for a better prediction of treatment response than TMB alone can provide. However, no part of the analysis challenges the validity of the well-known pan-cancer correlation between TMB and immunotherapy response. The failure to detect significant TMB cut-offs may be due to insufficient power, as the examined cohorts have relatively low sample sizes. A power analysis would be informative of what cohort sizes are needed to detect small to modest effects of TMB on immune response.</p>
<p>The manuscript provides a simple model of immunogenicity that is tailored to be consistent with a claimed lack of relationship between TMB and response to immunotherapy. Under the model, if each mutation that a tumor has acquired has a relatively high probability of being immunogenic (~10%, they suggest), and if 1-2 immunogenic mutations is enough to induce an immune response, then most tumors produce an immune response, and TMB and response should be uncorrelated except in very low-TMB tumors. The question then becomes whether the response is sufficient to wipe out tumor cells in conjunction with immunotherapy, which is essentially the same question of predicting response that motivated the original analysis. While TMB alone is not an excellent predictor of treatment response, the pan-cancer correlation between TMB and response/survival is highly significant, so the model's only independent prediction is wrong. Additionally, experiments to predict and validate neoepitopes suggest that a much smaller fraction of nonsynonymous mutations produce immune responses1,2.</p>
<p>A key idea that is overlooked in this manuscript is that of survivorship bias: self-evidently, none of the mutations found at the time of sequencing have been immunogenic enough to provoke a response capable of eliminating the tumor. While the authors suggest that immunoediting &quot;is inefficient, allowing tumors to accumulate a high TMB,&quot; the alternative explanation fits the neoepitope literature better: most mutations that reach high allele frequency in tumor cells are not immunogenic in typical (or patient-specific) tumor environments. Of course, immunotherapies sometimes succeed in overcoming the evolved immune evasion of tumors. Higher-TMB tumors are likely to continue to have higher mutation rates after sequencing; increased generation of new immunogenic mutations may partially explain their modestly improved responses to therapy.</p>
