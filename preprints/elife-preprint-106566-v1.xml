<title>Abstract</title><p>Somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin variable (V) regions modulates antibody-antigen affinity is initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Transcription is essential for SHM and AID target genes harbor activating chromatin marks and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) stalling, leading to the model that these features favor higher rates of mutagenesis. However, whether such relationships exist within V regions is undetermined. Here, we directly compared SHM and nascent transcription across four V regions and 275 non-immunoglobulin SHM targets at single-nucleotide resolution using precision run-on sequencing (PRO-seq). Although locales of Pol II enrichment and zones of Pol II stalling were detected within V regions, their correlation with SHM was not statistically significant. Moreover, SHM was robust against major reductions of activating epigenetic marks and transcription. This data suggests that SHM patterns and spectra are established independently of specific local nascent transcriptional features.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Somatic hypermutation (SHM) is the molecular basis for the diversification of antibodies in response to pathogens and vaccines and is hence indispensable for robust long-term immunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. SHM occurs in activated B cells within microanatomical structures called germinal centers in secondary lymphoid tissue upon engagement with antigens and helper T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Mutations are generated in the V regions of the immunoglobulin (IG) heavy (<italic>IGH</italic>) and light chain (<italic>IGK</italic>, <italic>IGL</italic>) genes by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> which acts co-transcriptionally on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. AID preferentially deaminates cytosine residues within WR<underline>C</underline>H motifs (where W = A or T, R = A or G and H = A, C or T) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. AID also acts at the <italic>IGH</italic> switch regions triggering a reaction cascade leading to class switch recombination (CSR) which yields the various antibody isotypes essential for effector functions following antigen binding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, SHM occurs at several transcribed non-IG genes and has been directly linked with B cell genome instability and cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A longstanding question in the field is the relationship of SHM with the nascent transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes. AID is recruited to the transcriptional machinery via specific enhancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and can subsequently associate with Pol II and the generic transcriptional machinery, including elongation factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and RNA processing proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. SHM and CSR have also been correlated with the presence of activating histone modifications typical of transcribed genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Given that AID is a very weak enzyme <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, it has been suggested that higher rates of mutation may be favored under specific conditions that cause increased ssDNA exposure. For instance, AID can mutate both DNA strands <italic>in vitro</italic> when the substrate is negatively supercoiled but is far less active on relaxed substrates, leading to the idea that negative supercoils in the wake of transcribing Pol II can provide a transient source of ssDNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. SHM has also been correlated with features where the speed of Pol II may be reduced, resulting in longer steady-state exposure of ssDNA. These features include transcription initiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, transcription termination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, convergent transcription <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, and most prominently, promoter-proximal paused Pol II and slowly elongating Pol II in gene bodies, which we refer to henceforth as Pol II stalling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Moreover, it has been suggested that ssDNA patches detected in V regions and non-IG SHM targets may correspond to ssDNA within the Pol II holoenzyme or from negative supercoils upstream of stalled Pol II <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The idea that stalled Pol II may play a role in SHM was first proposed nearly three decades ago <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Subsequently, Pol II was shown to accumulate in IG switch regions during CSR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> and the Pol II stalling factor, SPT5, was found to be required for efficient AID targeting to IG switch regions and non-IG AID target genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Pol II accumulation in V regions was also found to be higher in SHM-competent germinal center B cells but not in SHM-incompetent primary B cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Recently, studies using model reporter substrates have found that SHM driven by mutation enhancers correlated with an increase in the frequency of ssDNA patches along with increased SPT5 and Pol II stalling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Indeed, high levels of Pol II and SPT5 were found to be sufficient to identify new AID target genes via a machine learning approach <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Collectively, this leads to a model suggesting that the likelihood of SHM is higher in the vicinity of zones of stalling and/or convergent transcription due to increased time and access to ssDNA, relative to the neighboring DNA lacking any such feature <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Importantly, however, the nascent transcriptional landscape of V regions has not been determined and hence a systematic comparison between transcriptional and SHM patterns is lacking. There is evidence for Pol II stalling in V regions based on the accumulation of Pol II observed with chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. However, due to the very short length of V regions (∼500 bp) coupled with the low resolution of ChIP-qPCR and ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq), one cannot ascertain if Pol II is stalled across the entire V region or at specific locations, and therefore, whether sites of recurrent stalling correlate with zones of increased mutagenesis.</p>
<p>Here, we address this question by using precision run-on sequencing (PRO-seq) and the related method, PRO-cap, in combination with a customized bioinformatics pipeline to map reads to V regions. By identifying the precise 3’ end of nascent RNA within engaged Pol II complexes, PRO-seq provides a map of the location and orientation of actively transcribing Pol II genome-wide at single nucleotide resolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. PRO-cap identifies the 5’ ends of capped nascent RNAs that are associated with engaged Pol II molecules and hence provides maps of the location and orientation of transcription initiation sites at single nucleotide resolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. For these reasons, PRO-seq and PRO-cap are amongst the most widely used assays for studying nascent transcriptional profiles genome-wide and they have been particularly important in identifying recurrent sites of Pol II stalling and initiation at promoters, enhancers and within gene bodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. The single nucleotide resolution of the assay means that PRO-seq can identify recurrent sites of Pol II stalling within the short V regions. With this approach, we could ask whether and to what extent the discrete SHM patterns in V regions and non-IG SHM targets can be plausibly explained by recurrent stalling, initiation or convergent/antisense transcription. The same approach was used to study the relationship between the levels of activating chromatin marks with SHM within V regions. We found weak and inconsistent correlations between mutation rate and any of these co-transcriptional features or epigenetic marks at all four human and mouse V regions analyzed as well as 275 previously-identified AID target loci in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Thus, despite the global correlation between AID targeting and such features, when probed at the single nucleotide level, there does not appear to be a strong relationship between them, raising the possibility that ssDNA associated with these transcriptional features may not be the major source of ssDNA for AID.</p>

<title>V gene locales harbor an atypical chromatin landscape</title>
<p>As a model system of SHM, we chose Ramos, an IgM-positive human Burkitt lymphoma-derived cell line where the single functional, pre-recombined <italic>IGH</italic> V region consists of the V gene, VH4-34, the diversity segment, DH3-10, and the joining segment, JH6. Ramos cells constitutively express AID and undergo low levels of SHM mostly at C:G residues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. However, SHM can be significantly boosted in these cells upon overexpression of AID variants, and widely used for the study of SHM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To determine the chromatin landscape of the Ramos <italic>IGH</italic> locus, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) for histone modifications associated with active promoters and enhancers (histone H3 acetylated on lysine 27, H3K27ac or trimethylated on lysine 3, H3K4me3) and transcription elongation in gene bodies (H3 trimethylated on lysine 36, H3K36me3). At active genes, H3K27ac and H3K4me3 are enriched at nucleosomes flanking the transcription start site. Surprisingly, given that <italic>IGH</italic> is highly transcribed, we observed that the V region is characterized by relatively low levels of all marks that, importantly, was not due to decreased nucleosome occupancy as judged by the levels of histone H3 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). As a result, the first nucleosome from the transcription start site has the lowest levels of H3K27ac and H3K4me3 which is contrary to what is usually observed at highly active genes where the first nucleosome harbors the highest levels of these marks. In contrast, much higher levels of all marks were observed in the intronic regions flanking the Eμ enhancer with an expected decrease at Eμ itself where nucleosomes are occluded by the presence of transcription factors (Fig. S1A) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. Importantly, these atypical profiles were also observed at the murine <italic>Igh</italic> in primary B cells expressing the B1-8<sup>hi</sup> V region and activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin 4(IL4) and RP105 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup> (Fig. S1B). We conclude that V regions are marked by relatively low levels of activating histone marks and that this landscape is conserved between the human Ramos and mouse B1-8<sup>hi</sup> V regions.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>The Eμ enhancer regulates the levels of chromatin marks in the flanking intronic DNA but not within the V region</title>
<p>The fact that the highest enrichments of chromatin marks were seen on either side of the Eμ enhancer suggested that this element may be responsible for the deposition of these marks. This raised the question of whether deletion of Eμ (Eμ<sup>−/−</sup>) would alter the levels of these marks and affect SHM. SHM results in the loss of WR<underline>C</underline>H motifs (hotspot saturation) as well as a gain of new hotspot motifs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>, hence continuous SHM in AID-sufficient Ramos cells can confound subsequent analysis of SHM profiles. To ensure that all cells have the same V gene sequence prior to SHM, we ablated <italic>AICDA</italic>, encoding AID, in Ramos cells (AID<sup>−/−</sup>) and subsequently deleted Eμ to obtain AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cell lines (Fig. S1C). Specifically, we used CRISPR-mediated editing to delete a 583 bp region corresponding to the peak of chromatin accessibility measured by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) at Eμ in AID<sup>−/−</sup> cells (AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup>) (Fig. S1C). Based on PRO-cap analysis of transcription start sites (see below), this deletion eliminates the Iμ promoter that encodes the sterile germline <italic>IGHM</italic> transcript and antisense transcription start sites residing in Eμ (Fig. S1C). We chose two independent clones, AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> c1 and AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> c2, for subsequent experiments (Fig. S1D).</p>
<p>To comprehensively visualize profiles of these histone marks across the V region and flanking sequences, we performed ChIP followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) for H3K27ac, H3K4me3 and H3K36me3. We generated a custom chromosome spanning the Ramos V region and promoter. Importantly, the Ramos V region is highly mappable and hence there is minimal loss of reads due to multimapping with other V gene families (see later section). The results in AID<sup>−/−</sup> Ramos cells were consistent with ChIP-qPCR in that the levels of all marks were lowest in the promoter-proximal region and gradually increased into the V region, peaking in the intronic sequences flanking Eμ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). This analysis also revealed the absence of bimodal distributions of H3K27ac and H3K4me3 at the VH4-34 promoter, which is commonly observed at highly active divergently transcribed genes. In AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cells, all three marks were decreased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A and B), a finding that we confirmed by ChIP-qPCR, and which was not due to changes in nucleosome occupancy as determined by histone H3 measurements (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Using antibodies against pan-H3 and pan-H4 acetylation, we observed a significant decrease in histone acetylation across the locus in AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Moreover, another mark of transcription elongation, H3K79me3, was also reduced in AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). All marks in AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cells were significantly reduced up to 4-fold in the intron where they are normally at their peak levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A to C). However, within the V region, where these marks are normally at their lowest levels, there was no significant change in AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cells <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, A to C).</p>

<p>Consequently, AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cells harbor a chromatin landscape wherein the levels of all marks appear to be comparable between the V region and the intron (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, compare the measurements from amplicons 2, 3 and 5 in AID<sup>−/−</sup> and AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cells).

<p>These changes in the chromatin landscape in AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cells were accompanied by a 2-4-fold decrease of nascent transcription in the V region and intron, as well as a 2-fold decrease of the spliced <italic>Igh</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A and B). The decrease in transcription within the V region and intron implies that Eμ regulates optimal transcription initiation from the V gene promoter. Nevertheless, despite these decreases in <italic>Igh</italic> transcripts, surface IgM levels were unaffected in Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cells suggesting a lack of absolute correlation between mRNA and protein levels (Fig. S1E). We conclude that Eμ positively and significantly regulates nascent transcription in the V region but has no significant impact on its epigenetic landscape.</p>

<title>SHM frequency does not correlate with the levels of nascent transcription or activating histone marks in the V region locale</title>
<p>AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cells provide an ideal system to ask whether changes in the levels of nascent transcription and chromatin marks directly impact on SHM without any contribution from secondary, indirect effects. Hence, we sequenced the V region as well as the JH6 intron immediately downstream (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, upper panel). This analysis allowed us to compare SHM between a region where chromatin marks were normally low and Eμ-independent (V region) and a region where the marks were normally high and strongly Eμ-dependent (JH6 intron). To measure SHM, we infected AID<sup>−/−</sup> and AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cells with AID (JP8Bdel), a C-terminal truncation mutant of AID that results in nuclear retention and major increase in mutation rates after 6 days <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. As a control, we also infected cells with a catalytically inactive AID mutant (E58Q) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. As discussed in a later section, similar SHM spectra and profiles were obtained upon infection with a hyperactive mutant of AID (m7.3), which retains the C terminal domain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. However, since AID (m7.3) required much longer culturing post-infection (21 days), we used AID (JP8Bdel) for our analyses.</p>
<p>In both the V region and JH6 intron, we observed a small (∼20%) decrease in SHM frequency in AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> relative to AID<sup>−/−</sup> cells expressing AID (JP8Bdel) that was not statistically significant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). This result is consistent with mouse studies where loss of Eμ caused only modest decreases in SHM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. As an alternative readout of SHM activity, we assayed for the loss of surface IgM, which occurs due to AID-induced stop codons or frameshifts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. The results showed that the magnitude of IgM loss was similar between the control and Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cells suggesting that the minor decreases in SHM do not translate into equivalent changes in surface IgM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> D and E). We conclude that the Eμ enhancer is dispensable for robust SHM in Ramos cells.</p>
<p>By comparing the levels of chromatin marks with SHM frequencies in the V region and JH6 intron, we can draw three major conclusions: First, we infer that the levels of SHM do not correlate with those of activating histone marks. Indeed, SHM frequency is slightly lower in the intron (1.6 x 10<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>), which harbors the highest level of these marks, than in the V region (1.86 x 10<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>), which has the lowest levels of these modifications (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Second, as exemplified by the JH6 intron, SHM is resistant to major decreases in these marks. Third, we attribute the small reduction in SHM in AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cells to the decrease in nascent transcription although, here too, the decrease of SHM (∼20%; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) is considerably smaller than that of nascent transcription which is reduced up to 70% in the JH6 intron of AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, amplicons 2-5).</p>
<p>We conclude that although epigenetic modifications mark loci undergoing SHM and may contribute to SHM, their levels do not correlate with SHM frequencies and their significant reduction does not have a major impact on mutation rates, at least in this system.</p>

<title>Elucidating the nascent transcriptional landscape of the Ramos V region</title>
<p>We next asked whether SHM patterns are dictated by local features of nascent transcription landscape that could transiently lead to increased ssDNA exposure, such as during transcription initiation, stalling and/or convergent/antisense transcription. Since V genes occur as families with varying degrees of sequence identity, mapping of next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads to recombined V regions using standard alignment workflows eliminates reads which map to more than one location in the genome (multimappers) and only align reads mapping uniquely (typically allowing 2-3 mismatches). In Ramos cells, visual inspection of PRO-seq tracks on the UCSC genome browser revealed robust coverage within the VH4-34 gene with uniquely-mapping reads indicating that this V gene is highly mappable (not shown). To address this more systematically, we retrieved the normally discarded, multimapping reads and allowed them to re-align to the recombined Ramos V region with the important proviso that they only multimap to annotated V, D or J segments and not elsewhere in the genome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Separate tracks were created for uniquely mapping reads and the recalled multimapping reads, which were then combined to obtain the total profile (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>We measured nascent transcriptional activity with PRO-seq and capped initiation sites with PRO-cap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. For simplicity, we refer to relative accumulation of PRO-seq signal within the gene body as Pol II stalling or stalled Pol II in order to differentiate it from promoter-proximal pausing which is also reported by PRO-seq as the enrichment of signal typically 40-80 bp from transcription start sites. Most notably, promoter-proximal pausing occurs via the binding of NELF, which inhibits elongation whereas elongating Pol II lacks NELF and contains additional proteins such as SPT6 and the PAF complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. Accumulation of Pol II signal in gene bodies may arise due to the slowing down of Pol II as a result of steric barriers such as secondary structures or premature termination signals. However, initiation events within gene bodies could also give rise to a paused Pol II state akin to promoter-proximal pausing and can be identified if PRO-seq accumulation is associated with upstream PRO-cap enrichments.</p>
<p>Our mapping pipeline revealed that the Ramos V region is predominantly covered by uniquely-mapping reads with very few multimapping reads (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Of note, the same pipeline was used for the ChIP-seq analysis of Ramos cells described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> above. Therefore, this approach allowed us to delineate the transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of IG V regions. In contrast to the lack of a bimodal peak of activating histone marks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), the Ramos VH4-34 promoter showed clear bidirectional transcription and promoter-proximal pausing, the latter being noticeable as the PRO-seq enrichments shortly downstream of the promoter-associated PRO-cap initiation signals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Next, we infected cells with AID (JP8Bdel) and analyzed SHM patterns in the V region using an optimized version of mutation analysis with paired-end deep sequencing (MutPE-seq) of a PCR-amplified fragment corresponding to the V region <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Mutations occurred robustly at C:G residues within WR<underline>C</underline>H motifs with weak targeting of A:T residues, as expected from Ramos cells. Moreover, the cold spot motif, SY<underline>C</underline> (where S = C or G and Y = C or T) was poorly mutated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> F-H). A similar mutation profile and spectrum was observed when cells were infected with the hyperactive AID mutant, AID (m7.3) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>, for 21 days, indicating that the absence of the C terminal sequence in AID (JP8Bdel) does not alter its targeting to the V region or its motif preferences (Fig. S2A-D).</p>
<p>Visual comparison of the profiles of SHM and nascent transcription at the Ramos V region showed that some residues with relatively high mutation rates were associated with increased PRO-seq densities in the neighborhood, such as in the framework region between CDR2 and CDR3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). However, other mutations did not occur in the vicinity of higher PRO-seq signals or internal initiation events as measured by PRO-cap. For example, the region of highest PRO-seq read density at the 3’ end of the V region is not preferentially mutated over upstream C:G motifs where PRO-seq signal is much weaker (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> D and E). Indeed, the most mutated residue is located near the 5’ end of the V region where nascent transcription signals are lower than the 3’ end (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>SHM frequency does not significantly correlate with Pol II stalling or transcriptional strength at the Ramos V region</title>
<p>To statistically evaluate the relationship between mutations and Pol II stalling, we mapped stalling sites as per the definition used in previous studies, namely, as positions covered by at least five PRO-seq reads and where the signal is &gt;3 standard deviations greater than the mean of the flanking 200 bp region <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup> (see Methods). Stalling sites were extended by 3 bp on either side to create 7 bp stalling zones (Fig. S3A). This window size was chosen to reflect the approximate length (6-8 bp) of the transcription bubble in elongating Pol II complexes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. Next, overlapping stalling zones were merged and only those stalling zones lying within the MutPE-seq amplicon (displayed as black boxes in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) were considered for further analysis. All regions within the MutPE-seq amplicon that were not defined as stalling zones were termed non-stalling zones. Finally, the normalized mutation rate (mutations/width of zone) was calculated for each stalling and non-stalling zone (Fig. S3A). Mutation frequencies between stalling and non-stalling zones were compared, and statistical significance determined by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Fig. S3B). The results showed no statistically significant difference in mutation frequency between stalling and non-stalling zones (<italic>P</italic> = 0.56, Fig. S3B). Importantly, similar results were obtained when the analysis was performed with larger stalling zones (up to 21 bp).</p>
<p>As an alternative to identifying stalling zones, we asked whether C:G residues with higher mutation frequencies occurred in locales having higher PRO-seq densities, that is, whether mutation frequency corelated with local transcriptional strength. We divided all C:G residues in the Ramos V region into unmutated and mutated residues (Fig. S3C). Next, we measured PRO-seq read counts (RPM) in a 7 bp window centered at each C:G pair, that is, C:G ± 3 bp, and selected only non-overlapping windows for analysis (Fig. S3C and Methods). We further divided the mutated group into ten equal sub-groups (deciles) such that sub-group 1 contained the least mutated residues and sub-group 10 contained the most mutated residues. The results, displayed as box plots, showed that there was no discernible increase in PRO-seq density with increasing mutation frequency (Fig. S3D, first row). A Wilcoxon rank sum test following multiple testing correction revealed a lack of statistical significance (defined as <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) between the unmutated and any mutated group, as well as between any pair of mutated groups.</p>
<p>Conversely, we asked whether mutated C:G residues within locales of higher transcription were likely to have higher mutation rates than mutated C:G pairs in locales with lower transcription. To do so, we divided all the 7 bp windows from the mutated group in Fig. S3C into deciles such that sub-group 1 contained the least transcribed windows and sub-group 10 contained the most transcribed windows (Fig. S3E). We then generated boxplots for the mutation frequency of the central C:G residue within the 21 bp windows. The results showed that there was no discernible increase in mutation frequency with increasing PRO-seq density, and no statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 using the Wilcoxon rank sum test) was observed between any pair of sub-groups (Fig. S3F). Collectively, these analyses suggest that mutation frequency is unrelated to local Pol II stalling or local transcription strength.</p>
<p>PRO-seq in AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cells revealed that nascent sense transcription was uniformly decreased across the V region and intron (Fig. S4A). Of note, PRO-seq showed that the Eμ enhancer harbors the start sites of an antisense transcript, substantially (∼6-7-fold) weaker than the sense transcript (note the Y axis scale in Fig. S4A and quantification in Fig. S4B). This antisense transcript initiates at the 5’ boundary of Eμ and terminates within the V region, resulting in convergent transcription within the V region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C and D). Importantly, the decrease in antisense transcription in AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cells (6-10-fold) is considerably stronger than sense transcription (∼2-fold) suggesting that convergent transcription is strongly reduced in the V region and intron (Fig. S4B). Given the weak SHM phenotype in AID<sup>−/−</sup> Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), this suggests that convergent transcription may not be a major player in V region SHM, in agreement with a recent study wherein SHM on model reporter substrates occurred without substantial antisense transcription <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We conclude that although some mutations may result from the presence of recurrent stalled Pol II species in their locales, in general, the SHM patterns bear no significant relationship with zones of Pol II stalling, Pol II accumulation or convergent transcription. In addition, SHM is resistant to major decreases in Pol II levels within the V region and intron in both sense and antisense orientations.</p>

<title>Absence of correlation between Pol II stalling and SHM at two additional human V regions</title>
<p>To determine the transcriptomic profiles of other human V regions, we developed a strategy to replace the endogenous <italic>IGH</italic> V region of Ramos cells with any V region of choice using CRISPR editing (Fig. S5 A and B, and Methods). We chose two V regions corresponding to the unmutated precursors of broadly neutralizing antibodies identified in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV1). One V region consisted of VH4-59*01, DH2-02 and JH6*03 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup> and the other of VH3-30*18, DH2-02 and JH6*02 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>, which we henceforth refer to as VH4-59 and VH3-30, respectively. In both cases, the sequences upstream and downstream of the new V regions, including the VH4-34 promoter, leader peptide and intron are identical to the endogenous Ramos <italic>IGH</italic> sequence. Sub-regions of both VH4-59 and VH3-30 harbored multimapping reads with the most prominent being the framework region 3 preceding CDR3 in VH4-59 which was entirely covered with multimapping reads (Fig. S5 C and D).</p>
<p>We analyzed the transcriptional and mutational landscape of these two V regions using PRO-seq, PRO-cap and MutPE-seq (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-F</xref>). At VH4-59, we observed an increase in PRO-seq enrichment towards the 3’ end of the V region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A and B), reminiscent of Pol II stalling and akin to that seen at the endogenous Ramos V region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B and C). Such enrichments were absent within the VH3-30 V region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D and E). A reasonable explanation is that VH4-59 and VH4-34 belong to the same V gene family (VH4) and hence share higher sequence identity than VH3-30 which is phylogenetically more distant from the VH4 family <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>. It is also apparent from these analyses that there is no conserved V region transcriptional signature. It is plausible that sequence-intrinsic features may be responsible for the distinct nascent transcription profiles of the different V regions.</p>

<p>At VH4-59, the location of some highly mutated residues correlated with increased Pol II stalling in their locales, such as in the framework region between CDR2 and CDR3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, many other similarly mutated residues within and between CDR1 and CDR2 did not show elevated Pol II stalling in their locales (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Similarly, at VH3-30, the most highly mutated residues located in CDR1 and CDR3 were not associated with Pol II stalling (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). To analyze this systematically, we defined stalling zones in VH4-59 and VH3-30 and compared mutation frequencies between these and non-stalled zones, as described above. For both V regions, there was no significant difference in mutation load between stalled and non-stalled zones (Fig. S3A-B; <italic>P</italic> = 0.6 for VH4-59 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.26 for VH3-30). We also compared mutation frequencies and PRO-seq densities in the neighborhood of C:G pairs at VH4-59 and VH3-30, which revealed that locales with higher rates of mutations did not show a statistically significant correlation (based on the Wilcoxon rank sum test) with transcriptional strength (Fig. S3C-D). Conversely, locales with higher transcription were not more likely to harbor highly mutated C:G residues (Fig. S3E-F).</p>
<p>Of note, when comparing the mutation patterns between all three V regions analyzed here, the strong bias for C:G mutations typical of Ramos cells is seen in all cases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D and F). Moreover, there appears to be some bias of mutation load in the CDRs although several major mutation hotspots are also located within the intervening framework regions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D and F). The coldspot SY<underline>C</underline> motifs are weakly targeted or untargeted by AID, as expected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> E and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, D and F). Finally, the differential mutability of WR<underline>C</underline>H motifs by AID, ranging from highly mutated to unmutated, is seen in all the analyzed V regions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D and F) and is in line with observations in previous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In sum, the results from VH4-34, VH4-59 and VH3-30 analyses lead us to conclude, firstly, that recurrent Pol II stalling is not present across the entire length of V regions but is restricted to specific sub-regions. Secondly, antisense and convergent transcription is much weaker than sense transcription within V regions. Finally, the data suggest that although Pol II stalling may contribute towards mutagenesis in some locales, in general, the discrete SHM profiles of V regions cannot be explained by recurrent patterns of stalling or Pol II accumulation generally.</p>

<p>PRO-seq analysis from homozygous B1-8<sup>hi</sup> mice showed that the VH1-72 gene used in the B1-8<sup>hi</sup> recombined V region shares strong homology with other V genes in the murine <italic>Igh</italic> locus resulting in a very high degree of multimapping (Fig. S5E). Importantly, the CDR3 region was covered with uniquely mapping reads since this region is formed via the junction of the V, D and J segments during VDJ recombination resulting in a unique sequence in the genome (Fig. S5E). PRO-seq and PRO-cap showed that there were no striking differences at the B1-8<sup>hi</sup> V region between GCBs and primary B cells activated with LPS, IL-4 and RP105 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Moreover, we observed local zones of Pol II accumulation, internal initiation events and antisense/convergent transcription, but these did not necessarily correlate with zones of mutation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We note that the PRO-seq read densities at the B1-8<sup>hi</sup> V region from GCBs was substantially lower than those seen at the V regions analyzed in Ramos cells. We attribute this to the fact that GCBs are more fragile than primary cells or cell lines resulting in considerable loss of viability and quality during cell sorting. Consequently, the efficiency of the run-on reaction from isolated GCB nuclei, the first step of PRO-seq, is much less efficient resulting in lower numbers of aligned reads in the final libraries. These weak signals precluded a robust identification of stalling sites and hence we were unable to perform the comparative analysis of mutation frequency and stalling zones as we did for the other V regions described earlier.</p>
<p>As noted previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>, SHM profiles of B1-8<sup>hi</sup> GCBs are not identical to primary B cells because GCBs exhibit 5-10 fold higher frequencies of SHM and substantial mutagenesis of A and T residues arising from error-prone DNA repair of AID-induced mismatches at neighboring C:G residues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B and C). The palindromic AGCT hotspot in CDR3 is selectively mutated with high frequency in primary cells, in line with a former report showing that this hotspot is the earliest targeted motif both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>. Importantly, however, closer inspection showed that even in primary B cells, the same WR<underline>C</underline>H motif appears to be mutated as in GCBs suggesting that AID targeting specificity is not substantially different between primary B cells and GCBs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B and C), in line with their comparable transcriptional landscapes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). AID activity is linked to cell division <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup> and in our experiments, GCBs were harvested after 10 days of immunization whereas primary cells were harvested after 4 days of 4-HT treatment. Hence, it is plausible that GCBs may have acquired higher rates of mutation, in part, due to more rounds of cell division within germinal centers compared to primary cultures.</p>
<p>We conclude that the differences in mutation frequency between primary B cells and GCBs cannot be explained by underlying nascent transcriptional features. Consequently, as in the case of human V regions described above, the nascent transcriptional landscape of the B1-8<sup>hi</sup> V region is not predictive of the patterns or frequencies of SHM.</p>

<title>Analysis of non-IG AID target loci reveals no correlation between SHM and transcription strength</title>
<p>To extend our analysis to non-IG AID targets, we made use of a previously available SHM dataset from murine GCBs where mutation frequencies at 275 AID target genes were identified by deep sequencing the first 500 bp from the annotated transcription start site (TSS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In this study, mutation analysis was performed in GCBs from mice deficient in base excision and mismatch repair pathways (<italic>Ung</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>Msh2</italic><sup>−/−</sup>). In these mice, the processing of AID-induced U:G mismatches is abolished and, consequently, DNA replication over these lesions leads to C to T and G to A transition mutations that represent the direct targets of AID <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup>. By comparing these data with PRO-seq and PRO-cap obtained from GCBs, we could compare mutation profiles with those of nascent transcription. Importantly, at many genes, initiation sites or zones defined by PRO-cap are often located at considerable distances from the annotated TSS (defined by the RefSeq database and labeled as TSS in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, Fig. S6 and Fig. S7). Consequently, the 500 bp segment sequenced for mutational analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> often begins further upstream or downstream of the initiation sites newly defined by PRO-cap.</p>
<p>The large number of genes in this analysis led to new and unexpected observations regarding the nature of AID targeting. At virtually all genes, the differential mutation of WR<underline>C</underline>H motifs was evident in that many such motifs were mutated to varying degrees with many others being unmutated. Moreover, several non-WR<underline>C</underline>H cytidines were as efficiently mutated as WR<underline>C</underline>H cytidines (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref> and several additional examples in Fig. S6 and Fig. S7). In V and switch regions, mutations initiate ∼100-150 bp after the promoter suggesting that AID may be excluded from initiating or early elongating Pol II <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref></sup>. However, we identified a set of genes where the highest mutation frequencies were observed within 100-150 bp of the initiation site defined by PRO-cap (<italic>Il4ra</italic> in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref> and additional examples in Fig. S6A). Indeed, in some of these genes, the most mutated residues were in very close proximity to the initiation site, such as <italic>Mcm7</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). In some other genes, strongly mutated residues coincided with the strongest peak of initiation (Fig. S6B). These observations indicate that AID can act at the early stages of the transcription cycle at least at some genes, suggesting that AID is not <italic>per se</italic> excluded from initiating or early elongating Pol II.</p>
<p>As we observed in V regions, mutation frequencies at individual nucleotides and mutation zones did not necessarily correlate with enrichments of PRO-seq or PRO-cap (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, Fig. S6 and Fig. S7). For example, at <italic>Bcl6</italic>, the major zone of mutation lies in a region of low PRO-seq signal where many mutations are not in WR<underline>C</underline>H motifs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). At <italic>Myc</italic>, mutations are observed upstream of the initiation site defined by PRO-cap indicating that mutagenesis can also occur in the antisense orientation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Thus, as at V genes, SHM does not correlate with local nascent transcriptional features.</p>
<p>To systematically determine if mutation frequency corelated with local transcriptional strength, we divided all C:G residues from Alvarez-Prado et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> into three groups. Group 1 contained C:G residues in unmutated genes, group 2 contained unmutated C:G within the mutated genes and group 3 contained the mutated C:G residues (Fig. S8A). The C:G residues in group 3 were ranked from lowest to highest mutation frequency and further divided into ten equal groups (deciles) where residues in sub-group 1 were the least mutated and those in sub-group 10 were the most mutated. Next, we counted PRO-seq reads in a 7 bp window centered at each C:G residue (C:G ± 3 bp) (Fig. S8A) and plotted the results as box plots (Fig. S8B).</p>
<p>There was no visible trend of higher PRO-seq density in groups with higher mutation frequency although statistical analyses showed that the PRO-seq densities in group 1 were significantly lower than most, but not all, other groups, in line with the fact that mutation rates are higher in more transcribed genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (Fig. S8B). However, the difference in mean PRO-seq values between group 1 and other groups ranged between 1.2-1.9-fold. Based on our results from Eμ<sup>−/−</sup> cells where &gt;2-fold differences did not have a major impact on SHM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), we infer that the reason for the absence of mutation in group 1 is not solely due to lower transcription.</p>
<p>Group 2 showed a significant difference in PRO-seq density only with sub-group 8 within group 3. Moreover, the PRO-seq densities in group 3, sub-group 10, the most mutated group, were actually lower than in many other groups and even showed statistically significant differences in some cases (Fig. S8B). This suggests that, within AID target genes, highly mutated C:G residues are not generally located in genomic neighborhoods harboring higher levels of transcription and Pol II occupancy.</p>
<p>Conversely, we asked whether C:G residues within locales of higher transcription were likely to have higher mutation rates. As was done previously for V regions (Fig. S3E-F), we divided all the 7 bp windows from group 3 above into deciles such that sub-group 1 contained the least transcribed and sub-group 10 contained the most transcribed windows, respectively (Fig. S8C). We then generated boxplots for the mutation frequency of the central C:G residue within the 7 bp windows (Fig. S8 C and D). The results showed no trend of higher mutation frequency in groups with higher PRO-seq values with only one pair (group 3 versus group 10) showing a statistically significant difference (Fig. S8D). We conclude that the level of local transcription within mutated genes is not predictive of C:G mutability.</p>

<title>SHM targeting of the murine B1-8<sup>hi</sup> V region is retained in the context of the human <italic>IGH</italic> locus</title>
<p>To determine whether the gene regulatory context affects the patterns of SHM and transcription, we replaced the endogenous V region in Ramos cells with the entire murine B1-8<sup>hi</sup> V region (Ramos<sup>B1–8hi</sup>) using the strategy described earlier (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> and Fig. S4, A and B). In this scenario, transcription and SHM of the murine B1-8<sup>hi</sup> V region would be under the control of the Ramos VH4-34 promoter and the human Eμ and 3’ <italic>IGH</italic> super-enhancers. This allowed us to ask whether the targeting of SHM to the B1-8<sup>hi</sup> V region was influenced by differences in the human versus the mouse enhancers and promoters. Importantly, when placed in the context of the human <italic>IGH</italic> locus, the B1-8<sup>hi</sup> sequence was covered almost exclusively by uniquely mapping reads (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>), which is in sharp contrast to the extensive multimapping observed within B1-8<sup>hi</sup> at the murine <italic>Igh</italic> locus (Fig. S4E). This is because the VH1-72 gene used in the B1-8<sup>hi</sup> sequence is much less homologous with the human V genes than the mouse V genes.</p>

<p>PRO-seq and PRO-cap revealed that the nascent transcriptional profile of the B1-8<sup>hi</sup> sequence in Ramos<sup>B1–8hi</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>) shared similarities with the B1-8<sup>hi</sup> sequence in the murine <italic>Igh</italic> context (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). For example, similarities were noted in CDR3 and flanking sequences, for instance, the presence of the antisense initiation site (PRO-cap track) and shared spikes of nascent transcriptional activity (PRO-seq) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). More importantly, MutPE-seq following AID (JP8Bdel) infection revealed a very similar SHM pattern in Ramos<sup>B1–8hi</sup> cells compared to the murine B1-8<sup>hi</sup> context, especially with primary murine B cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Of note, the dominant, palindromic AGCT hotspot in CDR3 was the most mutated residue exactly as in B1-8<sup>hi</sup> murine primary cells and GCBs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). The other mutated C:G residues in the Ramos<sup>B1–8hi</sup> sequence were largely the same as those mutated in the murine context albeit the relative mutation rates within each V region varied (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>, compare with <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B and C). Stalled Pol II zones within the Ramos<sup>B1–8hi</sup> V region bore no significant relationship with mutation frequency compared to non-stalled zones (Fig. S3A-B; <italic>P</italic> = 0.83). Analysis of PRO-seq density in the neighborhood of mutated and unmutated C:G pairs revealed a lack of statistical significance between mutation frequency and local transcriptional strength (Fig. S3C-F). Thus, as in the case of the other V regions analyzed here, there is no significant relationship between Pol II stalling, Pol II occupancy and local SHM at the Ramos<sup>B1–8hi</sup> V region.</p>
<p>We note that mutation frequencies in murine GCBs and AID (JP8Bdel)-expressing Ramos cells were comparable (note the Y axes scales in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>) with the major difference being the weak A:T mutagenesis typical of Ramos cells. Of note, the sense PRO-cap peak in CDR3 in the murine B1-8<sup>hi</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), located just 3 bp upstream of the strong AGCT hotspot, is absent in Ramos<sup>B1–8hi</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>) implying that this initiation site is not essential for the high mutation frequency of this hotspot motif. In sum, the nascent transcriptional and SHM patterns of the B1-8<sup>hi</sup> V region in mouse B cells are largely retained in Ramos<sup>B1–8hi</sup> cells.</p>
<p>Collectively, our results lead us to conclude that, following AID recruitment via IG enhancers and its association with Pol II-associated factors, the discrete and reproducible mutation patterns in V regions and non-Ig SHM target genes are apparently “hard-wired” into the DNA sequence rather than the result of the local Pol II stalling, convergent transcription or activating chromatin marks.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we explored the relationship between transcription and V region SHM by performing a detailed comparative analysis of SHM with nascent transcription and activating chromatin marks.</p>
<p>Our analysis of the epigenetic landscape showed that major decreases in activating chromatin marks and nascent transcription, via deletion of the Eμ enhancer, do not have a significant impact on SHM. Although this does not rule out a role for these marks in creating an optimal chromatin environment for SHM, it does suggest that the absolute levels of these marks do not correlate with SHM. Intriguingly, compared to other highly active genes, including non-Ig AID targets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref></sup>, the V region chromatin locale is unusual for two reasons. First, it does not harbor the typical bimodal distribution of H3K27ac and H3K4me3 at the TSS despite robust bidirectional transcription and normal nucleosome occupancy as measured by the levels of histone H3. Second, the V gene body is marked by relatively low levels of these marks. However, it remains unclear whether this locale contributes to making the V genes among the most favored targets of AID in B cells.</p>
<p>The key conclusion of our study is that local patterns and frequencies of SHM, either in V regions or non-Ig AID targets, cannot be predicted from, nor do they appear to be derived from, sites of Pol II stalling, internal initiation or convergent transcription. Our approach clearly detected all these features within all four V regions analyzed here, in line with the global gene-level correlations previously noted <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. However, by accurately mapping the precise locations of these features within V regions and non-IG SHM target loci, our study revealed that at the local sequence level, the presence of these features did not generally correlate with increased local SHM. Indeed, several zones of elevated SHM in different V regions and non-Ig AID target loci appeared to be entirely devoid of any discernible transcriptional features. This implies that these features may not be major players in SHM and, therefore, that the ssDNA associated with them may not be the major substrate for AID. Moreover, the nascent transcription landscapes of the four V genes that we report in this study are quite dissimilar, which argues against any conserved V region nascent transcriptional signature. Finally, the murine B1-8<sup>hi</sup> V region retains its characteristic SHM profile <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and in both murine and human <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory contexts. Altogether, these results suggest that the discrete SHM patterns of individual V regions may be influenced by local sequence context, rather than specific local transcriptional features.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>What is the role of transcription in SHM?</title>
<p>The consistent lack of correlation between transcriptional features and SHM reported here begs the question of what role transcription plays in SHM. SHM depends on the availability of ssDNA, but the source(s) of accessible ssDNA for AID remains a major unresolved question. It has been proposed that ssDNA within transcribing Pol II complexes could be a substrate for AID, especially when Pol II is paused or stalled, an event that would lead to increased ssDNA exposure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. However, we found no significant correlation between SHM frequency and Pol II stalling zones or Pol II accumulation, which prompted us to take a closer look at the structures of paused and elongating Pol II complexes. This analysis showed that of the ∼11 nucleotide non-template ssDNA in the structure, about half lies buried within Pol II <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Importantly, the exposed portion (∼5 nt) is entirely covered by SPT5 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). The PAF complex and SPT6 are located further away from this site <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Under such structural constraints, it is difficult to conceive how AID could access the ∼5 nt exposed ssDNA and catalyze deamination even if Pol II were paused or stalled. Thus, it appears unlikely that the transcription bubble within an actively elongating Pol II holoenzyme, including a stalled complex, serves as an optimal substrate for AID.</p>

Proteins are shown as surfaces (Pol II, grey; DSIF, salmon; SPT6, brown; PAF complex, yellow) and nucleic acids as cartoons (DNA template strand, blue; DNA non-template strand, cyan; RNA, red). The right panel highlights the trajectory of DNA and RNA buried within Pol II. The exposed non-template strand of the transcription bubble is occluded from interactions with AID due to it being completely covered by SPT5. <bold>(B)</bold> Proposed model for SHM that incorporates various known aspects of SHM biology. The cartoon diagram of the Pol II elongation complex reflects the actual structure described in (A) above and in the main text. AID is recruited to the Pol II complex via super-enhancers in the context of a transcriptional hub (step 1) and is then retained via interactions with elongation factors, SPT5, PAF and SPT6 (step 2). The next step is the availability of ssDNA (step 3). We support the idea that premature transcription termination may be an important source of ssDNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. This event is not associated with stalling but occurs randomly within the first 2-3 kb from the TSSs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref></sup>. A slower-moving terminating Pol II may provide a more stable source of upstream, negative supercoiled DNA favoring higher AID activity. Upon dissociation of Pol II, the non-template strand is likely available as ssDNA for some time since the DNA:RNA hybrid would prevent immediate reannealing. The RNA is removed by RNA helicases and RNaseH followed by degradation of the RNA by the RNA exosome, which is known to associate with AID and provide access to the template strand. In this manner, AID can access ssDNA through various means all in the context of termination.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="492925v3_fig7.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Nevertheless, various studies have provided important insights into potential alternative sources of ssDNA. For instance, supercoiled DNA, but not relaxed DNA, can serve as efficient substrates for AID <italic>in vitro</italic> in biochemical assays and <italic>in vivo</italic> in bacterial SHM assays in the complete absence of transcription <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. In fact, untranscribed supercoiled plasmids can be mutated <italic>in vitro</italic> at rates comparable to those seen in V regions <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. The proposition is that negatively supercoiled DNA, which occurs in the wake of transcribing Pol II and is inherently prone to transient melting, can generate ssDNA patches on either strand as substrates for AID <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Indeed, transcription-dependent ssDNA patches have been detected in SHM model substrates, V regions and other AID target loci <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Importantly, however, these studies revealed that the location and frequency of ssDNA patches did not correlate with the patterns and spectra of SHM, implying that the incidence of ssDNA as detected by these assays is not a predictor of SHM patterns <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Another key insight is the fact that significant mutational asymmetry is observed upon depletion of RNA Exosome subunits or the DNA:RNA helicases, Mtr4, Senataxin and others <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref></sup>, which implies that one of the major species targeted by AID is an RNA:DNA hybrid. Indeed, the V region sense transcript is a substrate of the RNA exosome and the latter is required for optimal mutation of the template strand in the B1-8<sup>hi</sup> V region, findings that directly implicate the processing of DNA:RNA hybrids, or short transient R loops, in directing the patterns of SHM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, because all the above-mentioned features are continuously associated with transcription, they cannot, by themselves, explain the distinct and highly reproducible SHM profiles of V regions, nor can they explain why SHM spectra are restricted to a ∼2 kb window starting from the V gene promoter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. To reconcile these observations, we support a model centered on premature transcription termination, which, as proposed below, can define the boundaries of SHM and also provide a source of ssDNA, the latter having been suggested previously in the context of RNA exosome-mediated AID targeting <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> as well as SHM on plasmid substrates and in the Ramos V region <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>).</p>
<p>It is now appreciated that pervasive termination occurs near the 5’ ends of all active genes and enhancers resulting from the activity of the Integrator endonuclease complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup>. Specifically, the depletion of Integrator subunits manifests as an increase in Pol II and nascent transcript levels within the first 3-4 kb from TSSs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup>, which, intriguingly, encompasses the known spectrum of SHM at V regions, that is, ∼2 kb from the V gene promoters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. A similar process would be expected to occur at the 5’ ends of non-IG AID target genes or at divergently transcribed enhancers that are targets of AID <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref></sup>. Importantly, we note that accumulation of Pol II in V regions that we (this study) or others <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> have detected cannot be inferred as termination zones because the ChIP and nascent transcript profiling assays used therein do not provide information on the fate of the detected Pol II species. Studies to date reveal no specific locations for premature termination, rather suggesting that such events are stochastic and an inherent feature of early elongation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Another attractive aspect of premature termination in the context of SHM is that it can potentially provide multiple avenues for AID to access ssDNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Firstly, the speed of a terminating Pol II is expected to be lower than a rapidly elongating one, which would increase the steady-state availability of upstream, negatively supercoiled DNA for AID to access. Secondly, although the structural details of how Pol II terminates and dissociates off DNA have not been resolved, it is conceptually plausible that the collapse of the elongation complex could release ssDNA on the non-template strand while the nascent RNA is still hybridized to the template strand, which provides another source of ssDNA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, step 4). Finally, the RNA would have to be unwound by DNA:RNA helicases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref></sup> and/or digested with RNaseH followed by degradation from the 5’ end by Xrn2 and from the 3’ end by the RNA exosome, thereby providing AID access to the template strand <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, step 4). Given that IG loci are amongst the most highly expressed in activated B cells, the combined effect of having multiple rounds of transcription per cell cycle coupled with stochastic termination within the first 2-3 kb from V gene promoters can plausibly explain the empirically observed boundary of SHM, that is, ∼2 kb from V gene promoters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. The model can also explain why, at some non-IG SHM target loci, we observed mutations overlapping with, or in close proximity to, the transcription initiation zone. Most importantly, such stochastic events will not be detected by standard population-based approaches, which can explain the lack of correlation between local SHM frequency and any transcriptional feature, be it Pol II stalling, internal initiation, convergent transcription or ssDNA patches.</p>
<p>Although SHM-specific enhancers could explain why AID does not target all transcribed genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> and the termination model could explain the spectrum of SHM, they do not explain why WR<underline>C</underline>H motifs are differentially mutated. Indeed, the same motif can show high variation in mutation frequency depending on its location within a given V region <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref></sup>, a feature that is also evident in the V regions and non-Ig genes analyzed in this study. This implies that, beyond AID recruitment and ssDNA availability, the DNA sequence context may determine whether ssDNA containing a WR<underline>C</underline>H motif is mutated and to what extent. This notion is supported by a biochemical study of SHM on reporter cassettes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref></sup>, <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses of SHM in V regions from mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>, computational modeling studies of V regions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref></sup> and by altering the nucleotide context of AGCT hotpot motifs <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> which suggested that a sequence locale enriched in pyrimidine dimers can promote AGCT mutagenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref></sup>. In this regard, our study is important in showing that the molecular basis of this sequence context dependency of SHM does not lie at the level of Pol II stalling or any other nascent transcriptional feature, which was one of the initial hypotheses that motivated the present study. In sum, further work is necessary to determine whether sequence context regulates SHM patterns <italic>in vivo</italic> and what the underlying mechanism(s) may be.</p>

Alignment to the reference genome was done with Bowtie <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">121</xref></sup>. The NCBI GRCm38.6 assembly was used as the mouse reference. To this we added the sequence of the recombined locus containing the V region as an additional chromosome. Similarly, for human data, the Hg38 assembly was used, with the relevant V region sequence added as a chromosome. Where applicable, the dmr6 assembly of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> from Flybase (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">122</xref></sup> release 6.27) was used as the spike-in reference and was added to the alignment index. During alignment, up to three mismatches were allowed. To accommodate mapping to the repetitive <italic>IGH/Igh</italic> locus, a high degree of multimapping was allowed (194 potential V segments annotated for GRCm38.6). In the case of alignment with spike-ins, only reads mapping exclusively to either genome were considered. For PCR deduplication, UMIs were identified and filtered with UMI-tools (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">123</xref></sup> v1.0.0). No sequence differences were allowed in UMIs when collapsing the duplicates. Multimapping reads were then filtered to identify those specific to the V region sequence, taking into account the repetitiveness of the reference <italic>IGH/Igh</italic> locus. Reads mapping to the fixed V region sequence were allowed to multimap only to the native <italic>IGH/Igh</italic> locus (mouse chr12:113572929-116009954 or human chr14:105836764-106875071). The native loci were defined as the region between the earliest position belonging to an annotated V segment and the latest position belonging to an annotated J segment. Reads with a mapped location outside these areas were rejected. This filtering was implemented in a custom Python script. The qualifying reads were then classified as reads mapping uniquely to the particular V region sequence and reads mapping to both the V region sequence and to the native <italic>IGH/Igh</italic> region.

<p>Reads were split by strand, and strand labels for PRO-seq were inverted in order to match the strand designations of the respective PRO-cap reads. For both data types, only the first 5’ base of the strand-adjusted reads was used for the tracks. Additionally, the 5’ end of PRO-seq reads was shifted by 1 nucleotide downstream, to compensate for the fact that the last nucleotide in the RNA was incorporated during the run-on reaction.

All C:G residues were extended by 3 bp on either side to create 7 bp windows. For the mutated C:G group, overlapping windows were merged. If a mutated window overlapped an unmutated one, the mutated window was retained and the unmutated window was discarded from the analysis. In this manner, only non-overlapping mutated and unmutated windows were compared.

<caption><title>Generation of Ramos cell lines expressing exogenous V regions.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematic representation of the workflow for generating Ramos cells expressing new V regions using CRISPR-based editing. An IgM-negative line was made by excising the endogenous V region in AID<sup>−/−</sup> cells (AID<sup>−/−</sup>ΔV) and replacing it with a unique small guide RNA (sgRNA)-targeting sequence (green). Subsequently, an sgRNA targeting this site is combined with Cas9 and homology repair templates harboring any new V regions.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors take a closer look at whether AID-mediated SHM occurs at stalled RNA polII complexes. Through experimental and bioinformatic overlaps, authors observe that AID target sites really do not overlap with RNA polII stalling, convergent transcription, or H3K27Ac marks. Rather, AID target sites just exist around transcription start sites. The authors thus bring up an important argument, that RNA poll II stalling is not the driving mechanism for AID targeting. This is important since research groups work with the assumption that transcription stalling drives AID access to single-strand DNA. The authors are also clarifying their previous studies, where they suggested that stalled Spt5-associated RNA polII recruits AID DNA deamination activity.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>Transcription start sites (TSS) of promoter genes. Most AID mutations occur at the first 500 pbs to 1 kb from the TSS of promoters or enhancers, but not in the rest of the transcription module or gene body. To this end, existing literature (including work done by the author(s)) has suggested that transcription stalling or pausing of elongating RNA polymerase and/or chromatin modifications such as H3K27Ac (markers of promoters and enhancers) have something to do with helping AID see single-strand DNA substrates for SHM. These conclusions, initially being drawn from AID's functional interaction with Spt5 and RNA exosome -two factors involved in the resolution of stalled RNA polII - and further supported through co-relative data of AID SHM sites overlapping S2-P RNA polII. As with genomics data, these observations were drawn through the bioinformatic window of overlap by the respective authors of the previously published studies.</p>
<p>In this study, the authors take a closer look at these overlaps and observe that AID target sites really do not overlap with RNA polII stalling, convergent transcription, or H3K27Ac marks. Rather, AID target sites just exist around transcription start sites that accumulate promoter-proximal terminated transcripts. The authors thus bring up an important argument, that RNA poll II stalling is not the driving mechanism for AID targeting. This is important since research groups work with the assumption that transcription stalling drives AID access to single-strand DNA.</p>
<p>The authors are clarifying the models and literature that they themselves had set earlier, and are doing this with quite detailed analyses, with some well-done experiments. I feel they need to be heard. The experiments are well done, and the text is well written. Since the study is associative (versus being directly mechanistic) due to constant use of bioinformatics overlaps of SHM genomics data with ChIP data, some concerns will remain (and have been outlined by the authors), but that will be future work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Pavri and colleagues examine in-depth how the local transcriptional landscape affects somatic hypermutation (SHM) of variable region genes. They use the human Burkitt lymphoma Ramos cell line as a model system to examine AID-induced SHM.</p>
<p>The authors delete Emu and demonstrate that the epigenetic marks at the Ig loci do not correlate with their mutability. They define algorithms to map the V gene promoters and their mutational load in Ramos cells overexpressing AID and failed to find a correlation between mutation frequency and nascent transcription or transcription strength or between mutation frequency and polII stalling. Additionally, the authors show that convergent transcription may not be a major player for SHM. The authors additionally knock-in two other human V genes into the endogenous Vh gene in Ramos cells, and again failed to observe any significant correlation between PolII stalling and SHM. The authors also observe a similar lack of correlation between SHM (at the B-18 gene) and nascent transcription features in germinal center B cells. Overall, the authors conclude that mutation patterns in V genes are not linked to transcriptional features but are rather hard-wired into the sequence. The authors propose that premature transcription termination might have a role in promoting AID recruitment and activity at Ig genes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The mechanisms that allow AID recruitment to Ig genes during SHM are very poorly understood. Many mechanisms have been proposed, with most invoking transcriptional features, including stalling, convergent transcription, etc. This work, demonstrating the lack of correlation with the proposed models, is of much importance to the field. The experiments are well done, and even though the results are generally &quot;negative&quot;, they are highly relevant to our current understanding of SHM.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors propose premature transcription termination as a possible mechanism to determine V gene mutability, but the study does not experimentally address such possibilities.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>(1) It would be important for the authors to compare their results in Figure S1 at the B1-8 locus with those reported several years ago by Schatz and colleagues (Odegard et al, Immunity, 2005) and discuss if the results are different from what the authors report here. This is important as the first two figures essentially corroborate previous results that the Emu enhancer is important for transcription through the V genes.</p>
<p>(2) The authors mention that AID recruitment is facilitated by Ig enhancers. Is endogenous AID recruited to the V genes in the absence of Emu in the Ramos cells?</p>
<p>(3) The authors should explain how their results are different from those reported by the Schatz lab in their recent study (Wu et al, Mol Cell, 2025), demonstrating that ELOF1-mediated transcriptional pausing might promote SHM.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Schoeberlet et al. aims to elucidate the relationship between somatic transcription and nascent transcription. Using PRO-seq data across V regions and 275 non-immunoglobulin targets, the authors show that there is no statistically significant correlation with SHM hotspots and localized Pol II enrichment within V regions. They further confirm this conclusion by comparing SHM levels with reduced transcription and reduced activating epigenetic marks. They have revised the model for SHM regulation to emphasize transcription-independent targeting.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>(1) The sum of the mutation class percentages in Figure 3G should be one hundred percent.</p>
<p>(2) A quantitative bar of transcription and mutation levels could be added to make it clear across these V regions.</p>
<p>(3) The authors propose that transcriptional termination may contribute to the boundaries of the SHM (e.g., the ~2 kb from the V promoters). If this is the case, the slowing of Pol II velocity prior to termination would theoretically provide more opportunities for AID to access ssDNA, which should lead to higher mutation rates in regions upstream of termination sites (3-4 kb from TSSs). However, the observed SHM peaks in the V(D)J region, and declines exponentially within 1-2 kb downstream, which seems contradictory. The related statement could be revised.</p>
<p>(4) Recent ELOF1 stories published by the Schatz and Meng labs should be discussed. ELOF1 could be listed in the model in Figure 7.</p>
