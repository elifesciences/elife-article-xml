<title>Abstract</title><p>Class-B1 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are an important family of clinically relevant drug targets that remain difficult to investigate via high-throughput screening and in animal models. Here, we engineered PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>, a novel genetically-encoded sensor based on a class-B1 GPCR (the human PAC1 receptor, hmPAC1R) endowed with high dynamic range (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = 1100%), excellent ligand selectivity and rapid activation kinetics (τ<sub>ON</sub> = 1.15 sec).

Demonstrating its use in animal models, we show robust expression and fluorescence responses upon exogenous ligand application ex vivo and in vivo in mice, as well as in living zebrafish larvae.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Class-B1 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent an important sub-group of peptide-sensing GPCRs, that are the focus of intense and rapidly-expanding drug development efforts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, driven by extremely successful examples of peptide agonists used in the clinical treatment of metabolic human diseases, such as type-2 diabetes and obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. One such peptide-GPCR system that has shown growing potential for targetability in the treatment of human disorders is the Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase Activating Peptide (ADCYAP1 or PACAP) and its receptors. PACAP is an endogenous 38-amino acid peptide that is amongst the most phylogenetically-conserved peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Its shorter C-terminally-truncated form (i.e. PACAP<sub>1-27</sub>) has 68% homology with the vasoactive-intestinal-peptide (VIP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In fact, VIP and PACAP share a subfamily of class-B1 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), of which the two receptors VPAC1 and VPAC2 can both be equipotently activated by VIP and PACAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The third receptor in this subfamily, i.e. the PAC1 receptor (PAC1R, also known as ADCYAP1R1), however, has a reported affinity for PACAP that is 100-1000-fold higher than its affinity to VIP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The tissue distribution of PACAP and its receptors is widespread and they can be found throughout the central and peripheral nervous system, the immune system, in endocrine glands as well as in other organ systems and in many cancerous tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. A large body of evidence has linked the PACAP/PAC1R system to protective functions in the nervous and immune systems, as well as to stress- and anxiety-related behaviors (in particular post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)), migraine, nociception, thermoregulation, sleep/wake cycles, and reproductive functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, making it a peptide signaling system of high clinical relevance.</p>
<p>Recently, genetically-encoded GPCR-based sensors have been developed that enable the direct optical detection of GPCR activation by agonist ligands with high sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. While these tools hold great potential for drug development, pharmacology and neuroscience applications, only a few of them are built from class-B1 peptide-sensing GPCRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Thus, the development of new biosensors based on peptide-sensing GPCRs would greatly benefit the community and serve as a powerful resource for drug screening and life sciences.</p>
<p>In this work we engineered PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>, an ultrasensitive indicator based on the human PAC1 receptor (hmPAC1R). To establish this as a tool for peptide drug screening, we thoroughly characterized its dynamic range, as well as its optical, kinetic, signaling and pharmacological properties in vitro. We further generated stable cell lines and compared them to transfected cells for ligand-induced fluorescence responses using flow cytometry. Additionally, we tested the potential of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> as a tool to study ligand binding and diffusion in animal models. To this end, we examined the sensitivity and specificity of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> in acute mouse brain slices. Moreover, we verified ligand detection in vivo using fiber photometry recording and intracerebral microinfusions in behaving mice.</p>
<p>Finally, we demonstrate that the sensor expresses well and produces a large fluorescent response to PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> following microinjection in the brain of living zebrafish larvae, opening new opportunities for the development and testing of drugs targeting this receptor in the central nervous system.</p>
<p>Overall, our new sensor expands the class of genetically-encoded optical tools that can be used for GPCR-targeted HTS assays, reducing the demands on time and costly reagents, and provides new opportunities for functionally testing drugs that target the PAC1R pathway directly in living animals.</p>

<title>Development of an ultrasensitive PAC1R-based sensor</title>
<p>To develop a highly-sensitive indicator of hmPAC1R activation, we followed a protein engineering approach that we and others recently established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. We used the human PAC1Rnull splice isoform as a protein scaffold (hmPAC1R) and constructed an initial sensor prototype in which we replaced the entire third intracellular loop (ICL3, residues Q336-G342) with a module containing circularly-permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP) from dLight1.3b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref></bold>). This initial prototype construct, named PAClight0.1, was expressed on the surface of HEK293T cells, but showed clear intracellular retention and a very weak average fluorescent response to bath application of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = 43.4%, <bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref></bold>). Using this sensor as template, we conducted a small-scale screen to identify the optimal insertion site by reintroducing amino acids from the original ICL3 of hmPAC1R on both sides of the cpGFP-module. This led us to the identification of a second mutant, in which Q336 was reintroduced before the cpGFP-module, that showed improved average fluorescent response to the ligand (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = 343%, <bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref></bold>). To improve membrane expression of the PAClight mutants, we next investigated the effect of point mutations on their C-terminus, via site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation into alanine of residue T468, a reported post-translational modification (PTM) site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phosphosite.org">www.phosphosite.org</ext-link>) on the C-terminus of the receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, improved the overall surface expression of the sensor in HEK293T cells and further increased the observed average fluorescent response (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = 516%, <bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1f</xref></bold>). To further improve the fluorescent response of PAClight, we screened a subsequent library of sensor variants with mutations targeted to the second intracellular loop (ICL2). A similar approach was previously shown to boost the fluorescent response of other GPCR-based sensors, for example dLight1.3b or OxLight1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Our functional screen of a library of ICL2 mutants led to the identification of one variant comprising three point mutations (F259K/F260K/P261K) that displayed a largely improved fluorescent response to PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = 942%, <bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref></bold>). Upon introduction of the C-term T468A mutation on the ICL2 F259K/F260K/P261K background, we obtained an improved version of the sensor, named PAClight1, with excellent surface expression and fluorescent response (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = 1037%, <bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1g</xref></bold>). Given the high degree of sequence and structural similarity, as well as the broad activation of endogenous VPAC receptors by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and PACAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, we next asked whether the hmPAC1R-based sensor would also respond to VIP. Indeed, application of a high concentration of VIP onto sensor-expressing cells caused a large fluorescent response, corresponding to more than half of the response to PACAP<sub>1- 38</sub> (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = 654%, <bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref></bold>). In an effort to eliminate the response to VIP and obtain a PACAP-specific sensor, we screened a small library of sensors containing single- point mutations into alanine that were inspired by simulations on the binding free energy of PACAP and VIP on the PAC1R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Furthermore, at this stage we included the naturally occurring splice mutant PAC1s into the extracellular ligand-binding domain (ECD) of the sensor (this is a short ECD mutant reported to have lower affinity towards VIP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>), as well as two structure-guided point-mutants. Through this screening, we identified a single mutation (P78A) that abolished the sensor response to VIP while leaving unaltered the response to PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref></bold>). The final sensor construct, named PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a,b</xref></bold>), includes all the above-mentioned mutations and combines a very large dynamic range with excellent PACAP selectivity and good membrane expression, and was thus selected for further <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization.</p>

<title>In vitro characterization of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub></title>
<p>The newly developed PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> sensor displays an average fluorescent response of 1109% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> in HEK293T cells (n=3, 5 ROIs each) to bath application of 10μM PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b-d</xref></bold>). We verified that sensor expression and function is not drastically affected by the cell type in which it is expressed by testing it in primary cultured neurons. Neurons were virally transduced using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) for expressing the PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> sensor under control of a human synapsin-1 promoter. 2-3 weeks after transduction we verified excellent expression of the probe on the plasma membrane of the neurons with no appreciable intracellular retention. Under these conditions, the sensor showed a fluorescence response of approximately 730% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> upon bath application of the PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> ligand (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c,d</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We next set out to determine the sensor’s excitation and emission spectra in vitro in HEK29T cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref></bold>). The excitation maxima in the absence and presence of 10μM PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> were identified at 504nm and 498nm respectively. The isosbestic point at which the excitation is independent of the absence or presence of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> is located at 420nm. The maxima for the emission spectra in the absence of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> was identified at 520nm and in the presence of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> at 514nm.</p>
<p>Our previous work on the development of another class-B1 sensor based on the GLP1 receptor, led us to discover that the kinetics of the sensor’s response can be used to infer the occupancy of the ECD by an antagonist peptide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Given that all class-B1 GPCRs share a similar ECD high- affinity ligand binding mechanism, we performed similar experiments to determine whether PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> could also be used in a similar manner. To do so, we monitored the sensor’s response during application of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> alone or in the presence of PACAP<sub>6-38</sub>, an antagonist peptide, in the buffer surrounding the cells. We then determined the activation time constant of the fluorescent response in both conditions. The PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> response was strikingly slower (approximately 4-fold) in the presence of the extracellular antagonist, and was in the range of 1 second in its absence <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f,g</xref>)</bold>. Thus, the kinetics of PACligth1<sub>P78A</sub> response could be used to investigate or screen for factors that influence the ECD-PACAP interaction and potentially the speed of signal transduction through conformational activation of the receptor.</p>
<p>To investigate the stability of the fluorescent response to bath application of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub>, a long-term imaging experiment was performed at room temperature with 1 frame (1024x1024 pixels, 2x line-averaging) acquired every minute over the time course of 150 min (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref></bold>). After bath application of 200nM PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (slow diffusion of the peptide with 10x dilution from 2μM to 200nM) there was no decrease in signal, nor any internalization observed. After &gt;100 frames of acquisition. we applied a saturating bolus of the peptide PAC1R-antagonist Max.d.4. Within 45-50 frames after application of the PAC1R antagonist, the signal intensity steadily decreased and started to plateau slightly above baseline levels. This indicates, that Max.d.4 can outcompete PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> at PACligth1<sub>P78A</sub>, albeit not to a full extent under the specified experimental conditions.</p>

<p>Next, we screened a range of different peptides at saturating concentrations (10μM) for potential activation of the PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> sensor (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref></bold>). Mammalian PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> displayed the strongest potency in PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> activation (1052% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>(3)</sub>= 40.31, 95% CI [9.69, 11.35], <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Because the amino acid sequence of PACAP is rather well conserved throughout phylogeny, we also tested chicken PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (chPACAP38), as well as the zebrafish PACAP2<sub>1-27</sub> (zfPACAP2) for potency on the PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> sensor. Both of these homologues of the mammalian PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> activated the PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> sensor with strong but slightly reduced potency (chPACAP38: 896% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>(4)</sub>= 11.17, 95% CI [6.73, 11.19], <italic>p</italic>= 0.0066; zfPACAP2: 898% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>(3)</sub>= 11.49, 95% CI [6.46, 11.41], <italic>p</italic>= 0.024). Furthermore, we also screened the sand fly salivary gland derived peptide Maxadilan, which was previously identified to be a specific ligand of the PAC1R but not to the VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Consistent with the reported activity of Maxadilan on the hmPAC1Rnull receptor, we detected activation of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> by Maxadilan, however, with lower potency than mammalian PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (416% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>(3)</sub>= 9.47, 95% CI [2.76, 5.56], <italic>p</italic>= 0.04). The reduced potency of Maxadilan for PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> might be a consequence of the ligand specificity determining point-mutation (P78A) introduced into the extracellular domain of the PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> sensor. The drosophila gene <italic>amn</italic> (amnesiac) was previously shown to be homologous to the mammalian gene encoding PACAP (<italic>Adcyap1</italic>) and <italic>amn</italic> drosophila mutants show memory impairments similar to rodent PACAP/PAC1R mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We therefore also tested whether this insect peptide encoded by <italic>amn</italic> would activate PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>, but no significant activation above baseline was observed (26% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>(2)</sub>= 3.2, 95% CI [-0.09, 0.61], <italic>p</italic>= 0.69). As shown above (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref></bold>) PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> was specifically optimized for VIP non-responsive properties. Therefore, the response of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> to VIP in this specificity screen was also not significantly above baseline (57% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>(2)</sub>= 11.09, 95% CI [0.35, 0.79], <italic>p</italic>= 0.12). Other peptides tested in this screen included other class B1 GPCR ligands (corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)), as well as some peptidergic class A GPCR ligands (oxytocin (OXY), orexin-A and -B (OXA-OXB), melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), dynorphin (DYN), enkephalin (ENK), nociception (N-OFQ), neuropeptide FF (NPFF), neuropeptide S (NPS), neurotensin (NT), and neuromedin B (NB)). None of these neuropeptides activated the PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> sensor above baseline level (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref></bold>). Taken together, these results highlight the broad potential applicability of the PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> sensor for use in model systems across the phylogenetic tree, as well as its high selectivity for PACAP ligands over VIP and other peptide GPCR ligands.</p>
<p>In order not to induce artificial PACAP signaling and potentially interfere with downstream readouts when using PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>, it is important to verify that the sensor does not recruit G- proteins and/or β-arrestin. To monitor the capacity of PACLight1<sub>P78A</sub> to engage these intracellular signaling partners, we performed split NanoLuc complementation assays as in our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, using either PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>-SmBiT or, as a positive control, PAC1R-SmBiT fusion constructs, together with LgBiT-miniGs (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref></bold>), LgBiT-miniGsq (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref></bold>), or LgBiT-β-arrestin2 (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref></bold>). As expected, we observed significant miniGs, miniGsq, and β-arrestin2 recruitment to the wild-type PAC1R upon activation with 1 μM of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub>. Yet, we did not detect recruitment of either miniGs, miniGsq, or β-arrestin2 in PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>-expressing cells upon stimulation with PACAP<sub>1-38</sub>. These results indicate that expression of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> does not artificially induce PACAP-mediated intracellular signaling and is not likely to interfere with endogenous signaling pathways.</p>

<title>Development of non-responsive PAClight1 control sensors</title>
<p>When employing GPCR-sensors in intact living tissue (e.g., when used in animal models) it is often desirable to make use of an appropriate control sensor, in which ligand-binding is abolished by virtue of one or more point mutations in the GPCR binding pocket. To engineer such control sensors for our PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> and PAClight1 sensors, we targeted key residues in the hmPAC1R that interact with residue D3 in PACAP. The carboxylic group of D3 was shown to be crucial for binding affinity and biological activity of PACAP to all three receptor types (i.e. PAC1, VPAC1, and VPAC2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the cryo-EM structure of the hmPAC1R in interaction with PACAP identified residues Y161 and R199 of the hmPAC1R to interact with residue D3 of PACAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Residue Y161 forms a hydrogen bond with D3, while R199 forms an electrostatic interaction with D3 (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref></bold>). To abolish these interactions, we first mutated R199 into alanine (R199A) on the backbone of PAClight1. This single point mutant showed drastically reduced average fluorescent response (PAClight1: 1075% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, PAClight1_R199A: 41.9% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, <bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref></bold>) to 10μM PACAP<sub>1-38</sub>. To further abolish the remaining response, we additionally mutated Y161 into alanine (Y161A) on the previous backbone (i.e. PAClight1_R199A_Y161A) and named the construct “PAClight1-ctrl”. This completely reduced the fluorescent response to PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> to baseline levels (PAClight1-ctrl: 2.87% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>). Next, we cloned these two point mutations into the backbone of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> and observed an equally abolished fluorescent response to PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>: 1034% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>-ctrl: 10.44% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>(4.03)</sub> = 37.89, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, 95% CI [1098.63, 949.02], two-sided two-sample Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test, <bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref></bold>) in transfected HEK293T cells, as well as in virally-transduced rat primary neuron cultures (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4f</xref>)</bold>. No drastic differences in basal brightness were observed between PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> and PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>-ctrl constructs (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4e</xref>)</bold>. In summary, we have developed double point-mutant sensor constructs for both PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> and PAClight1 with fully abolished responses to bath application of saturating concentrations of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub>.</p>

<title>Comparison between transient and stable expression of the sensor</title>
<p>During the development and validation of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>, we noticed higher basal brightness levels of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> compared to other GPCR-based fluorescent sensors. To obtain a quantitative comparison, we decided to produce a stable T-Rex HEK293 cell line for inducible expression of PAClight1 (mutant missing P78A ECD mutation). We then used flow cytometry to record multiple replicates of 100,000 cells, and compared their fluorescence intensity to that of a similarly generated cell line expressing the indicator dLight1.3b, which we previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c-d</xref></bold>). Visualization of the fluorescent readouts clearly showed a shift of the density curves towards higher fluorescence for HEK293_PAClight1 cells compared to the HEK293_dLight1.3b. Statistical comparison of the distributions of the two cell lines shows 2.15- fold higher basal brightness of PAClight1 over dLight1.3b (<italic>t</italic><sub>(4.74)</sub>= −19.254, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, 95% CI [− 1.30, −0.99], two-sided two-sample Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Among the most important potential advantages of using stable cell lines expressing GPCR sensors for pharmacological assays are the homogeneity of expression, reproducibility, and ease of use. To verify that this is indeed the case, we analyzed PACLight1<sub>P78A</sub> expressing stable cells and compared them to transfected cells using flow cytometry. While a large proportion of cells from the transfected condition expressed the sensor at very low levels or not at all (i.e., were left shifted in the density plot), we also observed a significant proportion of very bright and strongly expressing cells from within the same condition. In fact, there is higher abundance of very bright and strongly expressing cells in the transfected condition than in the induced stable cell line condition (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref></bold>). The combination of the higher abundance of very low expression levels and very high expression levels within the transfected condition leads to a significantly increased variability of observed expression levels compared to the induced stable cell line condition. The median of the standard deviation in the FITC-A channel across the titration series was 62.6% smaller in the stable PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> relative to the transfected PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> condition (<italic>p</italic>= 0.0142, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref></bold>).

The difference of 8.6% (even though statistically unsignificant) might partially be explained by slightly different performance of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> vs. PAClight1 in dynamic range. <italic>P</italic> values represent the result of Dunnett’s test for correction of multiple comparison that was performed after the statistically significant results of an omnibus ANOVA (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2,30)</sub>= 4.321, <italic>p</italic>= 0.0224).</p>

<p>With the stable cells and their improved homogeneity of expression levels, we then determined the affinities of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> and PAClight1 towards PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> and VIP. For each peptide concentration of a titration series 100,000 events were acquired, gated for cell clusters and for singlets. The FITC-A median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the events in the singlet gate were used for dose-response fitting. A representative PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> titration series replicate on stable HEK293_PAClight1 cells is shown in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref></bold>. The titration dataset reveals a slightly lower affinity of the PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> sensor (EC50= 29.91nM) than the PAClight1 sensor (EC50 = 22.97nM) towards PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref></bold>). The affinity of the PAClight1 sensor (non-specific mutant) towards VIP (EC50 = 1.238μM) is much lower than its affinity towards PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref></bold>). This 100-1000x difference is well in accordance with previous reports on the differential affinities of VIP and PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> on the PAC1R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.

<p>In conclusion, our data show that in acute mouse brain slices, PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> detects concentrations of &gt;300nM of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> in superfused bath application, while not reacting to other neuropeptides tested.</p>

<title>In vivo PACAP detection in behaving mice</title>
<p>To test whether PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> can be used to characterize ligand binding and diffusion in vivo in behaving mice, we implanted fiberoptic cannula into the neocortex of mice expressing PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> or PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>-ctrl to image in vivo fluorescence dynamics while microinjecting PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> through nearby cannula (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4f</xref></bold>). Microinfusion of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (300 µM, 200 nl) led to peak fluorescence increases of 126% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> in PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>-expressing mice. The fluorescence peaked at 28 min and dropped to 88% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> 1 hour after, when injections were positioned in average approximately 350µm from the recording site. In contrast, PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>- ctrl-expressing mice showed a fluorescence increase of only 16% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4g</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we show that PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> can be a useful tool to detect PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> in vivo with a dynamic range that allows for the detection of drug injections even in the presence of intact endogenous PACAP systems in mice. Moreover, our data suggest that PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> diffuses efficiently across hundreds of µm, with slow extracellular degradation in neocortical brain areas of mice.</p>

<title>Two-photon validation of the sensor in living zebrafish</title>
<p>Zebrafish larvae are an important animal model that has long been recognized for its utility and applicability to drug discovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Moreover, PAC1 signaling has been associated with the adaptive stress response of zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. The high degree of amino acid sequence conservation of PACAP across the phylogenetic tree, as well as the <italic>in vitro</italic> response of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> to zebrafish PACAP that we observed, motivated us to also functionally validate our sensor for use in live zebrafish larvae. Based on a publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, we identified the olfactory region of 4 day post-fertilization (dpf) old zebrafish larvae to express high levels of <italic>Adcyap1b</italic> in ∼75% of cells composing the olfactory region. The presence of <italic>Adcyap1b</italic> expression in the olfactory region was further confirmed with data obtained by Fransworth et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref></bold>). To induce expression of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> in the olfactory region, we used the gal4 driver line Tg(GnRH3:gal4ff), which can strongly drive expression (e.g. of GCaMP6s) in the olfactory bulbs (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref></bold>). In conjunction with this gal4 driver line, we used Tol2-mediated integration of a UAS-promoted PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> construct. At 4dpf we immobilized the larvae with low-melting point agarose and performed two-photon volumetric imaging of the olfactory region for 5 consecutive 3D volumes as baseline. The immobilized zebrafish larvae were then placed onto a micromanipulator platform to inject 50nL of a 1mM PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> in saline solution or 50 nL of saline only (negative control) into the ventricular space (i.e. ICV injection). Subsequently, the larvae were re-imaged for 15 additional 3D volumes to record potential alterations in the pixel intensity values emitted by the PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> sensor (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>’</bold>). We observed a strong increase in PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> fluorescence already at ∼120 seconds post-ICV injection with ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> levels continuously rising until the end of the post-ICV injection recordings (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>’’</bold>). Peak ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> levels and the Area Under the Curve significantly differed between PACAP<sub>1-38</sub>/saline and saline-only injected animals (n<sub>saline</sub>= 5, n<sub>PACAP1-38</sub>= 5, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test <italic>p</italic>=0.0079, <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>’</bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work we engineered a new family of genetically-encoded fluorescent sensors using the human PAC1R as a GPCR scaffold. Two of the sensors that we developed (PAClight1 and PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>) exhibit a very high dynamic range (above 1000% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>), excellent expression at the cell surface, high basal brightness, and retain the pharmacological profile and ligand-binding profile of the parent receptor, with the exception of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> whose response to VIP is intentionally abolished via a single point mutation. As part of this sensor family, we also introduced a control sensor harboring the two point mutations R199A and Y161A, in which the response to PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> is abolished. Given the higher PACAP-selectivity of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>, this sensor variant is intended to be employed when there is an experimental need to ensure maximal selectivity of the response for the endogenous ligand PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (for example if the sensor is to be used for attempting the detection of endogenous PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> release). For all other experimental scenarios, PAClight1 can be a better choice, as it retains the original wild-type sequence in its ECD and thus most closely represents the natural ligand-binding profile of the human PAC1 receptor.</p>
<p>Importantly, we demonstrate successful expression and functionality of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> and PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>-ctrl in the mouse brain through stereotactic injection of AAVs encoding the sensor. Additionally, our experiments in zebrafishes, showed intriguing inter- and intraindividual differences in maximal sensor response to ICV injection of the peptide ligand. These could potentially be explained by differences in the expression density of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> within single cells. An intriguing alternative explanation – that receives support from the observation of continuously increasing ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> levels – could be differential diffusion rates of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> from the ventricular spaces into the brain parenchyma. Furthermore, there could be a dependence of the extent of the fluorescent response on the spatial distance between PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> -expressing cells and the ventricular wall. Under more controlled experimental conditions, PAClight1- expressing zebrafishes (or PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>, respectively) could therefore potentially be used to investigate and validate diffusion properties of PAC1R ligands in live organisms at a relatively high-throughput or to screen for novel small-molecule or peptide PAC1R agonists and antagonists with improved penetration properties across the ventricular wall.</p>
<p>In line with the zebrafish experiments, PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> microinjections into mouse cortex revealed slow increases in ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> levels even when PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> was injected only 100s of µm away from the recording site, substantiating the hypothesis of slow diffusion of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> through brain tissue. These results show that the new tools introduced in this study can be valuable assets to investigate real-time dynamics of PAC1 receptor activation in response to specific PAC1 receptor agents at a cellular level and in vivo in zebrafish and in the mammalian brain. The in vivo validation of our sensor demonstrates its ability to reveal localized drug or peptide actions and characterize their diffusion dynamics within brain tissue. We therefore suggest that this tool can be employed in applications such as studying the diffusion of novel PAC1-targeting drugs and peptides to provide mechanistic insights into the localization of drug actions in the brain.</p>
<p>Notably, in this work we did not demonstrate the use of any of our PAClight sensors for the detection of endogenous PACAP release in tissues or animal models, as our focus was deliberately set on the characterization and validation of the tools for applications to drug screening and/or development across species. Future work could focus on employing these tools to test whether or not they could be suitable for detecting endogenous PACAP/VIP dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution in tissues or awake behaving animals.</p>

<sec id="s4a">
<title>Molecular cloning</title>
<p>A synthetic DNA geneblock for the human PAC1R-null receptor sequence (PAC1R) was designed and ordered (Life Technologies) based on the NCBI protein data bank entry “NP_001109.2”. The protein-coding sequence was codon optimized and flanked by HindIII (5’) and NotI (3’) restriction sites for cloning into a pCMV plasmid (Addgene #60360). A hemagglutinin (HA) signal peptide (MKTIIALSYIFCLVFA) was introduced 5’ to the PAC1R coding sequence. Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning (CPEC) was used to replace the intracellular loop 3 (Q336-G342) of PAC1R with a cpGFP module from dLight1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. For sensor optimization, libraries of sensor variants were created through site-directed mutagenesis. For signaling assays, a linker + SmBit sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> (GNSGSSGGGGSGGGGSSGG + VTGWRLCERILA) was cloned at the 3’end of both the PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> and the PAC1R sequence. The XhoI cleavage site from within the SmBit linker sequence and the first 4 residues of the SmBit linker (GNSG) were first cloned into the 3’end of the PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> and PAC1R sequences using PCR. Subsequently, a restriction digest using XhoI and XbaI restriction enzymes was performed on the SmBit containing plasmid (B2AR-SmBit) as well as on the pCMV_PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> and pCMV_PAC1R plasmids. Ligation of the linker+SmBit insert into the linearized backbones was performed after gel extraction and purification of the insert. For generation of stably expressing and inducible Flp-In T-REx 293 cells, the PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> and PAClight1 sequences were cloned into the pcDNA5/FRT/TO backbone, respectively, using restriction digest with BamHI and NotI restriction enzymes. Agonist and antagonist plasmids (i.e. PURE_FLAG-TEV-PACAP1-38 and PURE_FLAG-TEV_PACAP6-38 respectively) used for validation of the microfluidics platform were obtained by cloning the nucleotide sequences for PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> and PACAP<sub>6-38</sub> (obtained as synthetic geneblocks) into the PURE_deGFP backbone using Gibson Assemby. Subsequently, a FLAG-tag (DYKDDDDK) as well as the first 5 residues of the recognition sequence for the TEV protease (ENLYFQ) were cloned upstream of the PACAP sequences into the obtained plasmid. Single colonies were picked and sequence verified. PCR reactions were performed using a Pfu-Ultra II Fusion High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Agilent), whereas Gibson Assembly was performed using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs). All sequences were verified using Sanger sequencing (Microsynth).</p>

<p>HEK293T cells (ATCC #CRL-3216) were cultured in DMEM medium (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher) and 1x Antibiotic-Antimycotic (100 units/mL of penicillin, 100µg/mL of streptomycin, and 0.25 µg/mL of Amphotericin B, Thermo Fisher) and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were transfected at 50-60% confluency in glass-bottomed dishes using the Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer instructions, and imaged 24-48h after transfection, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Primary cultured hippocampal neurons were prepared and transduced as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Before imaging, all cells were rinsed with 1mL of Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Life Technologies) supplemented with Ca<sup>2+</sup> (2mM) and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (1mM). Time-lapse imaging was performed at room temperature (22° C) on an inverted Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope using either a 40x oil-based or a 20x air objective. Longer-term imaging for determination of internalization/stability as well as reversibility was performed using a 10x air objective, with 1 frame (1024x1024 pixels) acquired every minute (2x pixel averaging). Imaging was performed using a 488nm laser as excitation light source for PAClight1 sensors. During imaging, ligands were added in bolus on the cells using a micropipette to reach the final specified concentrations of ligands on the cells. For quantification of recordings in single dishes, regions of interest (ROI) were selected manually using pixel-intensity based thresholding in Fiji to isolate the cell membrane. Sensor response (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>) was calculated as the following: (F(t)-F_base)/F_base with F(t) being the ROI fluorescence value at each time point (t), and F_base being the mean fluorescence of the 10 time points prior to ligand addition.</p>

Flp-In T-REx 293 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), 100µg/mL zeocin (ThermoFisher Scientific), and 15µg/mL blasticidin (ThermoFisher Scientific). To obtain a cell line with stably-integrated PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> or PAClight1 expression cassettes, cells were grown in T150 flasks (Corning) until 70% confluency, were then transfected with 0.6µg of pcDNA5/FRT/TO- PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> DNA vector and 5.4µg pOG44 vector using Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen). Two days after transfection, cells were split and the medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 200µg/mL Hygromycin B (Sigma), and 15µg/mL blasticidin. The medium was then replaced twice a week until individual colonies were visible. An individual colony was manually selected and expanded for subsequent experiments.

<p>One-photon spectral characterization of the PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> sensor was performed using PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>-transfected HEK293T cells before and after addition of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (10µM). One- photon fluorescence excitation (λ<sub>em</sub> = 560nm) and emission (λ<sub>exc</sub> = 470nm) spectra were determined on a Tecan M200 Pro plate reader at 37°C. 24 hours after cell transfection in 6-well format (linear PEI), ∼1 million cells were dissociated with addition of TrypLE Express (ThermoFisher) and thoroughly washed with PBS. Next, cells were resuspended in 300µl of PBS and aliquoted into two individual wells of a 96-well microplate with or without PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (10µM), together with two wells containing the same amount of non-transfected cells to account for autofluorescence and a single well containing PBS for subtraction of the Raman bands of the solvent.</p>

<p>HEK293T cells and stable HEK293_PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>/PAClight1 cells were seeded into T175 flasks and grown to 50-60% confluency under culture conditions described above. HEK293T cells were then transfected with 20µg of pCMV_PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> or pCMV_PAClight1 using linear PEI (Sigma-Aldrich; #764965) and a PEI-to-plasmid ratio of 3:1. Stable HEK293_PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>/PAClight1 cells were induced with 1µg/mL doxycycline (Sigma) at 50- 60% confluency. Two days after transfection or induction, cells were washed in 1x PBS before detachment with TrypLE Express (ThermoFisher) and subsequent centrifugation at 150xG for 3 minutes. Palleted cells were then resuspended in ice-cold FACS buffer containing 1xPBS, 1mM EDTA, 25mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 1% fetal bovine serum and diluted to 4-4.8×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. A dilution series of PACAP<sub>1-8</sub> and VIP was prepared in FACS buffer. 125µL of peptide solution was pipetted into a 96-well format and another 125ul of cell suspension was added to each well. The 96-well U-bottom plate was then loaded into a BD FACS Canto II cytometer equipped with a high- throughput sampler for 96-well format sampling. Voltage for the photomultiplier tubes was set to 200V for the forward scatter detector, to 400V for the side scatter detector, and to 350V for the FITC channel fluorescence detector. Excitation was performed at 488nm, while emission was directed through a 502LP mirror and a 530/30 band pass filter. Sampling from 96-well format wells was performed with an initial mixing step (3x 100µl mixes at 150µL/s) followed by sample acquisition of 200µL at a flow rate of 1-3µL/s. Sampling was performed until 100K events were recorded per well. After sample acquisition of each well, a 800µL wash step of the sampling line was performed. Sample acquisition within a dilution series replicate was performed from low-to- high concentrations to minimize potential peptide carry-over into the neighboring wells. Furthermore, a minimum of six wells without PACAP or VIP present were sampled between each replicate of the same construct. Raw data was exported in FCS3.1 format and further processed for analysis within R. The following R packages were used for the analysis and visualization of the flow cytometry experiments: flowCore, flowAI, ggcyto, dplyr, tidyr, forcats, purrr, stringr, openCyto, openxlsx, svglite, ggprism, ggnewscale, and glue. After import of the raw datasets, a rectangular gate (“Cells”) was defined on a FSC-A vs. SSC-A scatter plot with the limits being set to 25K-infinity and 15K-infinity, respectively. Next, a “Singlet” gate within the parent gate “Cells” was created automatically using the openCyto::singletGate function based on the FSC-A vs. FSC- H scatter plot. Median fluorescence intensities (MFI) of the FITC-A channel for all recorded events within the “Singlet” gate were calculated for each well. The MFI values were then normalized (“NormFITC_A”) within each titration replicate to the average of the 0nM peptide condition. Dose- response-curves and EC<sub>50</sub> values were obtained by first grouping datasets by construct and peptide conditions.

<p>Rat embryos (E17) obtained from timed-pregnant Wistar rats (Envigo) were used for preparing primary hippocampal neuronal cultures. Wild-type C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, 6-10 weeks old) of both sexes were used in this study. Mice were kept in standard enriched cages with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to chow and water on either normal or reversed 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle. Mice were housed in cages of 2-5 animals.</p>
<p>All procedures in mice were performed in accordance with the guidelines of Medical University of Vienna and under approved licenses by the Austrian Ministry of Science.</p>
<p>Zebrafish were maintained and bred by standard protocols and according to FELASA guide- lines. All experiments using zebrafish were approved by the Weizmann Institute’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Application number 06340722-1).</p>

<title>Stereotactic surgeries</title>
<p>For ex vivo slice imaging and validation of mouse brain expression, 6 to 10-week-old male and female C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier) were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and maintained under stable anesthesia during the surgery (1.3-2% isoflurane). Lidocaine (3.5mg/kg; Gebro Pharma, #100562 1404) and Carprofen (4mg/kg; Zoetis, #256684) were administered subcutaneously for local anesthesia and general analgesia. A small craniotomy was made bilaterally, targeting the temporal neocortex (Injection site at −4.1 mm posterior to bregma, as lateral as possible and 1.2 mm ventral to the pial surface). A glass micropipette was used for virus delivery and inserted slowly into the brain. Before and after virus delivery, the micropipette was kept in place for a waiting time of 8 min. 200nL of AAV9.hSyn.PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> or AAV9.hSyn.PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>-ctrl were injected, with an injection rate of 40nL/min using a microsyringe pump (KD Scientific; #788110). The pipette was withdrawn slowly and the skin of the skull was sutured. The mice were allowed to recover for 4 weeks before being used for the experiments, with Carprofen (4 mg/kg) being administered on the two consecutive days after the surgery.</p>

<title>Slice imaging</title>
<p>The mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane before being sacrificed by a transcardial perfusion with 30mL cooled sucrose solution (212mM sucrose, 3mM KCl, 1.25mM Na2H2PO4, 26mM NaHCO3, 1mM MgCl2, 0.2mM CaCl2, 10mM glucose) oxygenated with carbogen gas. The mice were decapitated and the brain was dissected out. 300µM coronal slices were prepared using a Leica VT1200 vibratome in cold oxygenated sucrose solution (0.12 mm/s, 0.8 mm amplitude). The slices were incubated in oxygenated Ringer’s solution (125mM NaCl, 25mM NaHCO3, 1.25mM NaH2PO4, 2.5mM KCl, 2mM CaCl2, 1mM MgCl2, 25mM glucose) at 37°C for 10min and afterwards kept at room temperature. The slices were imaged using an Olympus BX51WI microscope with an ORCA-Fusion Digital CMOS camera (Hamamatsu, #C14440-20UP) and a 10x objective (UMPLFLN10XW objective, Olympus). An EGFP filterset was used to control emission and excitation spectra (470/40, 525/50; AFH #F46-002). Micromanager software <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> was used to synchronize the excitation LED with the camera shutter. Videos were taken at 4 Hz framerate using 100 ms exposure time per frame. Cortical areas with clearly visible baseline fluorescence were selected for imaging. Baseline recordings of 10-20 min were performed prior to data acquisition to allow the slices to accustom to the conditions. Bath temperature was set to ∼31°C. The experimental recording was 20 min long, with the respective peptide being infused from minute 3-5. The following peptides were used: PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (30-3000nM; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals; #052-05), VIP (3000nM; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals; #064-16), CRF (3000nM; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals; #019-06), and Met-Enkephalin (3000nM; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals; #024-35). Of note, since our preliminary data suggested a decrease in PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> fluorescence in response to 3 µM CRF, we enriched the Ringer’s solution with synaptic transmission and neuronal activity blockers (NBQX, CPP, CGP 55845, Gabazine, and TTX) to prevent recruitment of neuronal circuits that could lead to endogenous PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> release (Tocris, biotechne; #Tocris 1262/50, #Tocris 0373/50, # Tocris0247/50, #Tocris 1248/50, #Tocris 1069/1).</p>
<p>Data analysis was performed using a custom-written Matlab script. Movement correction as well as bleaching correction was performed. The average fluorescence across the whole imaging window was normalized to the baseline fluorescence measured during the first 3 min of the recording prior to peptide infusion to calculate ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>: (F(t)-F_base)/F_base with F(t) being the fluorescence value at each time point (t), and F<sub>0</sub>_base being the mean fluorescence of the first 3min. 6 slices from at least 3 different mice were averaged for calculating the dose-response curve. For PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> responses to VIP, CRF and ENK, 3 slices from 3 different mice were averaged.</p>

<title>In vivo photometric imaging and microinfusion</title>
<p>Craniotomies were made as described for stereotactic injections. Tapered fiberoptic cannula implants (MFC_200/230-0.37_2mm_MF1.25_A45) with low autofluorescence epoxy were implanted into the right neocortex at 0.9mm depth with the angled (uncoated) side of the fiber tip facing towards the left. The implant was stabilized with cyanoacrylate glue.</p>
<p>Cannula were surgically implanted to locally infuse PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> into the cortex. Stainless steel guide cannulae (26 gauge; C315GA/SPC, InVivo One, Roanoke, VA, USA) were positioned in cortical L1, such that the tip of the internal cannula terminated 400µm medial to an the fiberoptic cannula. The implant was secured with cyanoacrylate glue. Dummy cannulae that did not extend beyond the guide cannulae (C315DC/SPC, InVivo One) were inserted to prevent clogging.</p>

<sec id="s4n">
<title>Mice were handled for 7 days prior to drug infusions</title>
<p>For photometric recordings, a 200µm diameter and 0.37 NA patchcord (MFP_200/220/900- 0.37_5m_FCM-MF1.25, low autofluorescence epoxy, Dorics) was used to connect the implanted fiberoptic cannulae to a Dorics filter cube for blue (465-480nm) excitation light. Emission light was detected by built-in photodetectors (500-540nm). Signals from the photodetectors were amplified with Dorics built-in amplifiers and acquired using a Labjack (T7). LJM Library (2018 release) was used to allow communication between MATLAB and Labjack. The voltage output from the LED drivers was amplitude modulated at 171 Hz (sine wave) as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> Amplitude modulation was programmed in MATLAB. 470 nm LEDs (M470F3, Thorlabs; LED driver LEDD1B, Thorlabs) were used. Light power at the patchcord tip was set to an average of 45µW. Fluorescence was calculated with custom-written MATLAB scripts based on a previous publication (Owen and Kreitzer, 2019). Photometry data were sampled at 2052 Hz.</p>
<p>For drug infusions, dummy cannulae were replaced by internal cannulae (33 gauge; C315LI/SPC, InVivo One) that extended 1 mm beyond the guide cannulae and were connected to a microinfusion pump. After a recovery time of 5-10 min, PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (200nl; 300µM diluted in normal Ringer solution, NRR) was infused at 100 nl/min (NRR in mM: 135 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 5 HEPES, 1.8 CaCl2, pH 7.2 adjusted with KOH, sterile-filtered with 0.2μm pore size).</p>

<title>Histology</title>
<p>To verify expression of the sensor in the mouse cortex and hippocampus, virus injections were performed with stereotactic surgeries as described above. The virus was allowed to express for four weeks, before the mice were transcardially perfused with PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde, before the brain was dissected and processed into 50µm coronal slices using a Leica VT1000S vibratome. Slices were immunostained with chicken anti-GFP antibodies (Abcam Cat# ab13970, RRID:AB_300798; 1:500 diluted). In brief, slices were permeabilized and blocked for 1 h with PBS containing 5% NGS and 0.2% Triton X-100, followed by a 24 h antibody incubation at 4°C in PBS containing 5% NGS and 0.2% Triton X-100. Sections were washed in PBS and then incubated for 1 h in 1:500 diluted goat anti-chicken IgG (H+L) cross-adsorbed secondary antibody (Alexa fluor 488; Fisher Scientific A11039). The mounted slices were imaged using a Leica SP8 X confocal microscope equipped with a 63x 1.3 NA glycerol immersion objective.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>For pairwise analysis of sensor variants, the statistical significance of their responses was determined on a case-by-case basis using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing was followed by pairwise comparison with correction for multiple comparison with either Dunnett’s correction or Hochberg correction. For data not meeting assumptions of normality or homoscedasticity, Mann-Whitney-U tests followed by Bonferroni corrections were applied. All p-values are indicated either in the results section or in the figure legends. Data of sensor screening and validation experiments is displayed as mean +/- 1 standard deviation. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size in cultured cells. Power calculations were performed to determine sample size for experiments using mice.</p>

<caption><title>Optimizing the fluorescent response of PAClight sensors</title>
<p><bold>a)</bold> Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of the TM5, ICL3, and TM6 domains of the human orexin 2 receptor (OX2), the human D1 dopamine receptor (DRD1), and of the human PAC1Rnull (PAC1). The sequences replaced by the cpGFP module in the OxLight1, dLight1.3b, and PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> sensors are highlighted in magenta. The OX2 and DRD1 receptor sequences align well due to the fact that they both belong to the class A GPCRs. The PAC1Rnull belongs to the class B1 family of GPCRs and hence aligns less well to the OX2 and DRD1 backbones. We therefore guided the initial design and site of cpGFP module insertion by protein structure rather than by amino acid sequence. <bold>b)</bold> Pseudo-colored confocal micrograph of HEK293T cells expressing the prototypical PAClight_V0.1. Plasma membrane expression can be detected, but a significant amount of sensor protein is retained intracellularly. <bold>c)</bold> Scatterplot representing insertion site variants screened for maximum dynamic range. Reinsertion of the glutamine on the N-terminal side of the cpGFP module (PAClight_V0.2) drastically increased the dynamic range to 343% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> (compared to 43.4% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> in PAClight_V0.1). <bold>d)</bold> Point mutations in the intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) further improved the dynamic range to 588% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> for PAClight_V0.3 (point mutations: F259K/F260K) and to 942% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> for PAClight_V0.4 (point mutations: F259K/F260K /P261K). <bold>e)</bold> On the backbone of the improved ICL2 variant PAClight_V0.3 we screened again for the optimal insertion site of the cpGFP module. To this end we performed serial deletions as well as insertions of charged residues on the residues n-terminal to the cpGFP module. This small- scale screen identified a mutant with a glutamine and arginine insertion before the cpGFP module (PAClight_V0.3+QR-cpGFP) with improved dynamic range (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = 844%) compared to the PAClight_V0.3 backbone. <bold>f)</bold> To abolish β-Arrestin recruitment and further improve membrane localization, we further screened C-terminus mutants. We included mutants in this screen in which we replaced the C-terminus with the tail of the kappa opioid receptor (KORt), as well as point mutants of known post-translational modification sites and serine residues. The point mutation of the T468 to alanine further improved plasma membrane localization (data not shown) and improved the dynamic range from 942% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> (in PAClight_V0.4) to 1037% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>. The resulting construct was named PAClight1. <bold>g)</bold> Since the insertion of QR in front of the cpGFP module had a positive effect on dynamic range on the backbone of PAClight_V0.3 <bold>(e)</bold>, we also tested this insertion of QR on the PAClight1 backbone. However, the QR insertion did not yield improved dynamic range on the PAClight1 backbone (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = 953%) and was hence rejected. Each datapoint represents the average of the maxΔF/F<sub>0</sub> within one ROI.

<p>This <bold>fundamental</bold> paper reports a new biosensor to study G protein-coupled receptor activation by the pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) in cell culture, ex vivo (mouse brain slices), and in vivo (zebrafish). <bold>Convincing</bold> data are presented that show the new sensor works, albeit at very high (non-physiological) concentrations of exogenous PACAP. The sensor has not yet been used to detect endogenously released PACAP, raising questions about whether the sensor can be used for its intended purpose. While further work must be pursued to achieve broad in vivo applications under physiological conditions, the new tool will be of interest to cell biologists, especially those studying the large GPCR family.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript &quot;Engineering of PAClight1P78A: A High-Performance Class-B1 GPCR-Based Sensor for PACAP1-38&quot; by Cola et al. presents the development of a novel genetically encoded sensor, PAClight1P78A, based on the human PAC1 receptor. The authors provide a thorough in vitro and in vivo characterization of this sensor, demonstrating its potential utility across various applications in life sciences, including drug development and basic research.</p>
<p>The diverse methods to validate PAClight1P78A demonstrate a comprehensive approach to sensor engineering by combining biochemical characterization with in vivo studies in rodent brains and zebrafish. This establishes the sensor's biophysical properties (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, kinetics, and spectral properties) and demonstrates its functionality in physiologically relevant settings. Importantly, the inclusion of control sensors and the testing of potential intracellular downstream effects such as G-protein activation underscore a careful consideration of specificity and biological impact.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The fundamental development of PAClight1P78A addresses a significant gap in sensors for Class-B1 GPCRs. The iterative design process -starting from PAClight0.1 to the final PAClight1P78A variant - demonstrates compelling optimization. The innovative engineering results in a sensor with a high apparent dynamic range and excellent ligand selectivity, representing a significant advancement in the field. The rigorous in vitro characterization, including dynamic range, ligand specificity, and activation kinetics, provides a critical understanding of the sensor's utility. Including in vivo experiments in mice and zebrafish larvae demonstrates the sensor's applicability in complex biological systems.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript shows that the sensor fundamentally works in vivo, albeit in a limited capacity. The titration curves show sensitivity in the nmol range at which endogenous detection might be possible. However, perhaps the sensor is not sensitive enough or there are not any known robust paradigms for PACAP release. A more detailed discussion of the sensors's limitations, particularly regarding in vivo applications and the potential for detecting endogenous PACAP release, would be helpful.</p>
<p>There are several experiments with an n=1 and other low single-digit numbers. I assume that refers to biological replicates such as mice or culture wells, but it is not well defined. n=1 in experimental contexts, particularly in Figure 1, raises significant concerns about the exact dynamic range of the sensor, data reproducibility, and the robustness of conclusions drawn from these experiments. Also, ROI for cell cultures, like in Figure 1, is not well defined. The methods mentioned ROIs were manually selected, which appears very selective, and the values in Figure 1c become unnecessarily questionable. The lack of definition for &quot;ROI&quot; is confusing. Do ROIs refer to cells, specific locations on the cell membrane, or groups of cells? It would be best if the authors could use unbiased methods for image analysis that include the majority of responsive areas or an explanation of why certain ROIs are included or excluded.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The PAClight1 sensor was developed using an approach successful for the development of other fluorescence-based GPCR sensors, which is the complete replacement of the third intracellular loop of the receptor with a circularly-permuted green fluorescent protein. When expressed in HEK cells, this sensor showed good expression and a weak but measurable response to the extracellular presence of PACAP1-38 (a F/Fo of 43%). Additional mutation near the site of insertion of the linearized GPF, at the C-terminus of the receptor, and within the second intracellular loop produced a final optimized sensor with F/Fo of &gt;1000%. Finally, screening of mutational libraries that also included alterations in the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the receptor yielded a molecule, PAClight1P78A, that exhibited a high ligand-dependent fluorescence response combined with a high differential sensitivity to PACAP (EC50 30 nM based on cytometric sorting of stably transfected HEK293 cells) compared to its congener VIP, (with which PACAP shares two highly related receptors, VPAC1 and VPAC2) as well as several unrelated neuropeptides, and significantly slowed activation kinetics by PACAP in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of the PAC1 antagonist PACAP6-38. A structurally highly similar control construct, PAClight1P78Actl, showed correspondingly similar basal expression in HEK293 cells, but no PACAP-dependent enhancement in fluorescent properties.</p>
<p>PAClight1P78A was expressed in neurons of the mouse cortex via AAV9.hSyn-mediated gene transduction. Slices taken from PAClight1P78A-transfected cortex, but not slices taken from PAClight1P78Actl-transfected cortex exhibited prompt and persistent elevation of F/Fo after 2 minutes of perfusion with PACAP1-38 which persisted for up to 14 minutes and was statistically significant after perfusion with 3000, but not 300 or 30 nM, of peptide. Likewise, microinfusion of 200 nL of 300 uM PACAP1-38 into the cortex of optical fiber-implanted freely moving mice elicited a F/Fo (%) of greater than 15, and significantly higher than that elicited by application of similar concentrations of VIP, CRF, or enkephalin, or vehicle alone. In vivo experiments were carried out in zebrafish larvae by the introduction of PAClight1P78A into single-cell stage Danio rerio embryos using a Tol2 transposase-based plasmid with a UAS promoter via injection (of plasmid and transposase mRNA), and sorting of post-fertilization embryos using a marker for transgenesis carried in the UAS : PAClight1P78A construct. Expression of PAClight1P78A was directed to cells in the olfactory bulb which express the fish paralog of the human PAC1 receptor by using the Tg(GnRH3:gal4ff) line, and fluorescent signals were elicited by intracerebroventricular administration of PACAP1-38 at a single concentration (1 mM), which were specific to PACAP and to the presence of PAClight1P78A per se, as controlled by parallel experiments in which PAClight1P78Actl instead of PAClight1P78A was contained in the transgenic plasmid.</p>
<p>Major strengths and weaknesses of the methods and results:</p>
<p>The report represents a rigorous demonstration of the elicitation of fluorescent signals upon pharmacological exposure to PACAP in nervous system tissue expressing PAClight1P78A in both mammals (mice) and fish (zebrafish larvae). Figure 4d shows a change in GFP fluorescence activation by PACAP occurring several seconds after the cessation of PACAP perfusion over a two-minute period, and its persistence for several minutes following. One wonders if one is apprehending the graphical presentation of the data incorrectly, or if the activation of fluorescence efficiency by ligand presentation is irreversible in this context, in which case the utility of the probe as a real-time indicator, in vivo, of released peptide might be diminished.</p>
<p>Appraisal of achievement of aims, and data support of conclusions:</p>
<p>Small cavils with controls are omitted for clarity; the larger issue of appraisal of results based on the scope of the designed experiments is discussed in the section below. An interesting question related to the time dependence of the PACAP-elicited activation of PAClight1P87A is its onset and reversibility, and additional data related to this would be welcome.</p>
<p>Discussion of the impact of the work, and utility of the methods and data:</p>
<p>Increasingly, neurotransmitter function may be observed in vivo, rather than by inferring in vivo function from in vitro, in cellular, or ex vivo experimentation. This very valuable report discloses the invention of a genetically encoded sensor for the class B1 GPCR PAC1. PAC1 is the major receptor for the neuropeptide PACAP, which in turn is a major neurotransmitter involved in brain response to psychogenic stress, or threat, in vertebrates as diverse as mammals and fishes. If this sensor possesses the sensitivity to detect endogenously released PACAP in vivo it will indeed be an impactful tool for understanding PACAP neurotransmission (and indeed PACAP action in general, in immune and endocrine compartments as well) in future experiments.</p>
<p>However, the sensor has not yet been used to detect endogenously released PACAP. Until this has been done, one cannot answer the question as to whether the levels of exogenously perfused/administered PACAP used here merely to calibrate the sensor's sensitivity are indeed unphysiologically high. If endogenous PACAP levels don't get that high, then the sensor will not be useful for its intended purpose. The authors should address this issue and allude to what kind of experiments would need to be done in order to detect endogenous PACAP release in living tissue in intact animals. The authors could comment upon the success of other GPCR sensors that have been used to observe endogenous ligand release, and where along the pathway to becoming a truly useful reagent this particular sensor is.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript introduces PAClight1P78A, a novel genetically encoded sensor designed to facilitate the study of class-B1 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), focusing on the human PAC1 receptor. Addressing the significant challenge of investigating these clinically relevant drug targets, the sensor demonstrates a high dynamic range, excellent ligand selectivity, and rapid activation kinetics. It is validated across a variety of experimental contexts including in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models in mice and zebrafish, showcasing its utility for high-throughput screening, basic research, and drug development efforts related to GPCR dynamics and pharmacology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The innovative design of PAClight1P78A successfully bridges a crucial gap in GPCR research by enabling real-time monitoring of receptor activation with high specificity and sensitivity. The extensive validation across multiple models emphasizes the sensor's reliability and versatility, promising significant contributions to both the scientific understanding of GPCR mechanisms and the development of novel therapeutics. Furthermore, by providing the research community with detailed methodologies and access to the necessary viral vectors and plasmids, the authors ensure the sensor's broad applicability and ease of adoption for a wide range of studies focused on GPCR biology and drug targeting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>
To further strengthen the manuscript and validate the efficacy of PAClight1P78A as a selective PACAP sensor, it is crucial to demonstrate the sensor's ability to detect endogenous PACAP release in vivo under physiological conditions. While the current data from artificial PACAP application in mouse brain slices and microinfusion in behaving mice provide foundational insights into the sensor's functionality, these approaches predominantly simulate conditions with potentially higher concentrations of PACAP than naturally occurring levels.</p>
<p>Although the sensor's specificity for the PAC1 receptor and its primary ligand is a pivotal achievement, exploring its potential application to other GPCRs within the class-B1 family or broader categories could enhance the manuscript's impact, suggesting ways to adapt this technology for a wider array of receptor studies. Additionally, while the sensor's performance is convincingly demonstrated in short-term experiments, insights into its long-term stability and reusability in more prolonged or repeated measures scenarios would be valuable for researchers interested in chronic studies or longitudinal behavioral analyses. Addressing these aspects could broaden the understanding of the sensor's practical utility over extended research timelines.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the current in vivo experiments involving microinfusion of PACAP near sensor-expressing areas in behaving mice are based on a relatively small sample size (n=2), which might limit the generalizability of the findings. Increasing the number of subjects in these experimental groups would enhance the statistical power of the results and provide a more robust assessment of the sensor's in vivo functionality. Expanding the sample size will not only validate the findings but also address potential variability within the population, thereby reinforcing the conclusions drawn from these crucial experiments.</p>
