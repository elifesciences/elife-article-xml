<title>Abstract</title><p>Contractility and cell motility depend on accurately controlled assembly of the actin cytoskeleton. Formins are a large group of actin assembly proteins that nucleate new actin filaments and act as elongation factors. Some formins may cap filaments, instead of elongating them, and others are known to sever or bundle filaments. The Formin HOmology Domain-containing protein (FHOD)-family of formins is critical to the formation of the fundamental contractile unit in muscle, the sarcomere. Specifically, mammalian FHOD3L plays an essential role in cardiomyocytes. Despite our knowledge of FHOD3L’s importance in cardiomyocytes, its biochemical and cellular activities remain poorly understood. It has been proposed that FHOD-family formins act by capping and bundling, as opposed to assembling new filaments. Here, we demonstrate that FHOD3L nucleates actin and rapidly but briefly elongates filaments after temporarily pausing elongation, <italic>in vitro</italic>. We designed function-separating mutants that enabled us to distinguish which biochemical roles are req՝uired in the cell. We found that human FHOD3L’s elongation activity, but not its nucleation, capping, or bundling activity, is necessary for proper sarcomere formation and contractile function in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The results of this work provide new insight into the mechanisms by which formins build specific structures and will contribute to knowledge regarding how cardiomyopathies arise from defects in sarcomere formation and maintenance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Higher order actin-based structures, such as the sarcomere, are the foundation for specific cellular functions that demand precise spatial and temporal coordination. Other examples of actin-based structures, including filopodia, stress fibers and the cytokinetic furrow, are also required for a wide range of processes, such as cell migration, adhesion, and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blanchoin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Svitkina, 2018</xref>). Hundreds of actin-binding proteins, and specific combinations thereof, coordinate to assemble these complex structures by accelerating actin assembly, crosslinking and bundling filaments, and stabilizing and/or disassembling actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dominguez and Holmes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lappalainen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pollard, 2016</xref>). There are three known classes of actin nucleators that stimulate <italic>de novo</italic> filament assembly. Each class functions by a distinct mechanism, resulting in a unique starting point for the structure it initiates. One such class of actin nucleators, known as formins, mediates both nucleation and continued elongation of actin filaments. Formins are defined by their Formin Homology (FH) domains 1 and 2. The FH2 domain is highly conserved and forms a donut-shaped homodimer, which is sufficient to nucleate new filaments. After nucleation, the FH2 domain remains processively associated with the faster-growing barbed-end of actin filaments, modifying the rate of elongation. The FH1 domain is less well conserved but contains proline-rich tracts that bind profilin-actin to facilitate elongation of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Courtemanche, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Paul and Pollard, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">2009</xref>). The regulatory domains for most formins are on either side of these FH domains and an intramolecular interaction leads to autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Goode and Eck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li and Higgs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schonichen and Geyer, 2010</xref>). The timing and strength of formin activity differ between formins, allowing for distinct roles within a given cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Homa et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Multiple classes of formins have been linked to sarcomere structure, including Dishevelled Associated Activator Of Morphogenesis (Daam1, 2), Diaphanous (Diaph1-3), Formin HOmology Domain–containing protein (FHOD1, 3), and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Deng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Iskratsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mi-Mi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Molnár et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rosado et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sanger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shwartz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sundaramurthy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>). There are two mammalian isoforms in the FHOD family of formins, FHOD1 and FHOD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bechtold et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kanaya et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schonichen and Geyer, 2010</xref>). FHOD1 is widely expressed and assembles stress fibers that contribute to adhesion and motility of various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gasteier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Iskratsch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Koka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Schulze et al., 2014</xref>). Despite its localization to intercalated discs, structures important for rapid signal transmission and synchronized contractions, FHOD1 seems to be dispensable in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Al Haj et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dwyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sanematsu et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, FHOD3 is implicated in sarcomere assembly and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fujimoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Iskratsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kan-o et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Ushijima et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>There are four isoforms of FHOD3 reported in Uniprot. The major differences are due to alternative splicing in the N-terminal half. An eight residue insert in the C-terminal half (an acidic sequence T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE) is present only in Uniprot isoform 4, which is commonly referred to as FHOD3L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Iskratsch et al., 2010</xref>). In this paper, we adopt the commonly accepted nomenclature in which FHOD3S (short) indicates Uniprot isoform 1 and FHOD3L (long) indicates Uniprot isoform 4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). FHOD3L is predominantly expressed in striated muscle, whereas FHOD3S is more widely expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>). In cardiomyocytes, FHOD3L localizes to sarcomeres in a striated pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Iskratsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kan-o et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, FHOD3L does not localize at the barbed end of actin filaments within sarcomeres. Instead, a direct interaction between FHOD3L and cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C) drives localization of FHOD3L to the so-called C zone of sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Matsuyama et al., 2018a</xref>). In the absence of cMyBP-C, FHOD3L is diffuse and cardiac function is compromised, suggesting that a balance between these two proteins is critical for proper heart function in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Matsuyama et al., 2018a</xref>).</p>

<p>Mutations in the <italic>FHOD3</italic> gene have been deemed causative in at least 1-2% of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), in addition to cases of left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and progressive high-frequency hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arimura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boussaty et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Myasnikov et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ochoa et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, recent clinical studies have shown that HCM-causative FHOD3 mutations increase the risk of cardiovascular death and all-cause death, with the onset of the disease occurring as early as age 4 and as late as age 63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Vodnjov et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite its known physiological significance, we lack a mechanistic understanding of FHOD3L’s role in cardiac development and function. Early biochemical analysis suggested that FHOD family formins were an exceptional class of formins. Both purified mammalian isoforms (FHOD1 and FHOD3) were found to decelerate, rather than hasten, actin assembly <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Schonichen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, actin bundling was observed for FHOD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Schonichen et al., 2013</xref>). Consistently, FHOD1 mediates nuclear movement by bundling and anchoring actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Antoku et al., 2023</xref>). However, it fails to complete this function when a highly conserved isoleucine in the FH2 domain is mutated (hereafter, referred to as the IA mutation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kutscheidt et al., 2014</xref>). The IA mutation is known to disrupt both nucleation and elongation in most, if not all, formins, indicating that FHOD1 may enhance actin assembly in addition to bundling <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Patel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Xu et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, FHOD proteins are required to form new sarcomeres in rat cardiomyocytes, human induced cardiomyocytes, worms and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fenix et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Iskratsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kan-O et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sundaramurthy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>). FHODs with the IA mutation do not form new sarcomeres, suggesting that actin assembly is required for sarcomere assembly, in conflict with the biochemical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kan-O et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shwartz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Xu et al., 2004</xref>). Most recently, in the worm, FHOD protein was shown to cooperate with profilin to build muscle, providing strong evidence that it functions by elongating actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kimmich et al., 2024</xref>). Previously, we found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Fhod is a potent actin nucleator that can accelerate actin elongation under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Patel et al., 2018</xref>). We also showed that human FHOD1 can nucleate actin but its activity is sensitive to the actin isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Patel et al., 2018</xref>). We confirmed that both of these Fhod-family formins lose activity when the IA mutation is introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Patel et al., 2018</xref>). Based on these biochemical results and the data regarding Fhod-family formins in muscle of multiple species, we asked whether human FHOD3L can also nucleate.</p>
<p>Here, we show that purified FHOD3L can accelerate actin assembly by both nucleation and elongation. We also confirm that FHOD3L potently caps filaments, in the absence of profilin, and bundles. Using function-separating mutations, we correlate FHOD3L’s biochemistry to the integrity of the sarcomere within cardiomyocytes. We found that reduced nucleation, capping, and bundling by FHOD3L are well tolerated in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), whereas elongation activity is necessary for proper sarcomere formation and function.</p>

<title>Biochemical characterization of human FHOD3</title>
<p>We purified the C-terminal half of human FHOD3L (FHOD3L-CT), encompassing the FH1 domain, FH2 domain, and C-terminal tail, which is typically sufficient for actin assembly <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Courtemanche, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Patel et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to an earlier report, we found that FHOD3L-CT enhances rabbit skeletal muscle actin (RSA) assembly in bulk pyrene assays (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>). (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes all biochemical measurements.) Consistent with nucleation activity, when we visualized the products of similar reactions, we observed many more filaments in the presence of FHOD3L-CT compared to actin alone (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also asked if the shorter, alternatively spliced FHOD3 isoform, FHOD3S-CT, nucleates actin. FHOD3S-CT, which is 8 residues shorter than FHOD3L-CT, accelerates actin assembly ∼30% more potently than FHOD3L-CT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the C-terminal half of both FHOD3 isoforms (moving forward, we will use S/L when indicating both the short and long isoforms of FHOD3) are able to nucleate actin filaments.</p>

<p>To further compare FHOD3L-CT to previously characterized formins, we introduced mutations at conserved residues of the FH2 domain, I1163A and K1309A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Xu et al., 2004</xref>). Like other formins, the I1163A mutant lacked nucleation activity and the K1309A mutant reduced nucleation by ∼90% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We observed a reduction in the plateau of pyrene traces with wild-type FHOD3S/L-CT and the mutants. The decrease was more apparent at higher concentrations of the nucleator and seemed to be dose-dependent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Control experiments demonstrated that the fluorescence change does not reflect quenching due to side binding or bundling (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We, therefore, tested barbed-end binding. We asked whether FHOD3L-CT inhibits filament elongation by performing bulk seeded-elongation assays. Indeed, we found that FHOD3L-CT potently slows barbed-end elongation (K<sub>app</sub> = 0.023 ± 0.005 nM; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Barbed-end binding by FHOD3S-CT is over 30 times weaker (K<sub>app</sub> = 0.750 ± 0.090 nM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The IA mutation is generally thought to disrupt binding to both actin monomers and filament barbed ends. However, FHOD3L-CT I1163A has an affinity of 4.9 ± 1.4 nM for barbed ends of actin filaments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). While the affinity is &gt;200-fold weaker than FHOD3L-CT, it still binds barbed ends tightly. Therefore, we interpret the plateau decrease observed in bulk assembly assays as evidence of barbed-end capping.</p>
<p>To directly observe the impact of FHOD3L-CT on growing actin filaments, we used Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy in the presence of profilin. Most of the filaments elongated at rates indistinguishable from actin alone. Initially, we could not confirm that FHOD3L-CT was bound to these filaments. We, therefore, repeated bulk seeded-elongation assays in the presence of profilin. Under these conditions, we observed increased rates of actin assembly at low doses of FHOD3L-CT, confirming that the formin accelerates elongation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, at higher formin concentrations, we found that elongation was actually slower than actin alone. We attribute the complicated shapes and dose response of these data to the contributions of both elongation and capping activities. We also note that the concentrations required for FHOD3L-CT to elicit measurable changes in actin assembly indicate a marked apparent decrease (500-1000 fold) in affinity for the barbed-end when profilin is present (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>Upon closer observation of individual filaments in the TIRF assay, we detected brief pauses followed by short “bursts” of fast elongation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F,G</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). A pause lasted ∼12 s on average (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). During the following bursts, the filaments were dimmer and elongated ∼3-fold faster (39 ± 13 subunits/s), consistent with formin-mediated elongation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F,G</xref>, Video 1). The average length of filament produced during these bursts was 1.10 ± 0.49 <italic>μ</italic>m (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), which is similar to the characteristic run length of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Fhod-A (∼2 <italic>μ</italic>m), but very different from other formins, which often range from 20 – 200 <italic>μ</italic>m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bremer et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Moseley and Goode, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Patel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Vizcarra et al., 2014</xref>). FHOD3S-CT mediated similar behavior with indistinguishable pauses, though with slightly, albeit statistically significantly, shorter bursts (characteristic run length of 0.90 ± 0.33 <italic>μ</italic> m) (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C-E</xref>). Thus, for brief intervals, FHOD3S/L-CT caps barbed-ends followed by accelerated elongation, when profilin is present.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated bundling by FHOD3L-CT. To do so, we visually examined the organization of phalloidin-stabilized actin filaments after incubating with FHOD3L-CT. Bundles were readily apparent (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). To better characterize bundling activity, we performed low-speed bundling assays with a fixed concentration of actin filaments and several concentrations of FHOD3L-CT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H,I</xref>). We also compared this activity to bundling by FHOD3S-CT. We found that FHOD3L-CT bundles somewhat more potently than FHOD3S-CT, which is most apparent at concentrations above 15 nM (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F,G</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, FHOD3S/L-CT nucleates and elongates actin. FHOD3S-CT is a more potent nucleator, a weaker barbed-end capper, and a slightly weaker bundler compared to FHOD3L-CT (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These data suggest that the acidic T(D/E)<sub>5</sub>XE insertion of FHOD3L interacts with different surfaces of actin depending on the biochemical activity. Perhaps the marked increase in capping by FHOD3L-CT is mediated by binding to an exposed basic region on the filament. Decreased activity levels of FHOD3L-CT, such as nucleation and bundling, may be due to the fact that most of the actin monomer surface is acidic.</p>

<title>Biochemical validation of function-separating mutants</title>
<p>We next designed FHOD3L-CT mutants to separate nucleation and elongation. We also assessed the impact of these mutations on capping and bundling. Previously, Baker et al. identified mutations in the FH2 domain of Bni1 that diminish nucleation while maintaining elongation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baker et al., 2015</xref>). Based on sequence and structural alignments, FHOD3L K1193 approximates one of these, Bni1 K1467. FHOD3L-CT K1193L nucleated with less than 30% of the strength seen for wild-type (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The barbed-end affinity of FHOD3L-CT K1193L was 0.470 ± 0.090 nM, ∼12-fold weaker than wild-type (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, K1193L-mediated elongation of actin filaments was indistinguishable from wild-type (no significant difference in elongation rate, run length, or capping duration) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Low-speed bundling assays showed that K1193L bundling is &gt;2-fold weaker than wild-type (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). In summary, elongation activity is maintained while nucleation and bundling are strongly reduced by the K1193L mutation.</p>

<p>To remove FH1-mediated acceleration of elongation, we substituted glycine-serine linkers for the polyproline tracts in FHOD3L-CT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zweifel and Courtemanche, 2020</xref>). (The FH2 domain alone was unstable <italic>in vitro</italic>.) Pyrene-based actin assembly assays were confounded by bundling/aggregation induced by this construct. Although low-speed cosedimentation assays indicated that the bundling strength of FHOD3L-CT GS-FH1 is slightly weaker than that of wild-type, images show irregular shapes that may scatter light more, thereby disrupting the pyrene signal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, to compare the nucleation strength of FHOD3L-CT GS-FH1 with wildtype, we counted filaments using TIRF microscopy. We observed similar numbers of filaments generated in the presence of low concentrations (used to minimize bundling) of FHOD3L-CT wild-type or GS-FH1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Barbed-end elongation assays in the absence of profilin demonstrated a weakened affinity of FHOD3L-CT GS-FH1 (K<sub>app</sub> = 0.218 ± 0.016 nM) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This finding suggests that increasing the stiffness of the FH1 domain impacts barbed end binding but we cannot say whether the effect is direct or indirect. Interestingly, profilin did not decrease barbed-end binding of FHOD3L-CT GS-FH1 (K<sub>app</sub> = 0.21 ± 0.13 nM; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Finally, and most importantly deceleration was observed at all concentrations tested in assays with profilin, confirming that elongation is not enhanced by FHOD3L-CT GS-FH1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, nucleation is maintained while acceleration of elongation is no longer detected.</p>
<p>Together, these mutations resulted in a range of nucleation, elongation, capping, and bundling activities (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We, therefore, used them to assess the correlation of biochemical activities with sarcomere formation and function in cardiomyocytes.</p>

<title>FHOD3L rescues sarcomere organization and contractility in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes</title>
<p>In order to perform structure-function analysis in a cellular context, we established methods to knock down and rescue FHOD3L in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) (similar to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, freshly isolated NRVMs were treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting FHOD3 using reverse transfection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>; see Methods for details). Adenoviral infection, driving expression of rescue constructs, was initiated two days after siRNA treatment and cells were examined (fixed or live) two days after infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The rescue constructs contained human FHOD3L, which is not targeted by the siRNA used to remove endogenous rat FHOD3. In all cases, cells were treated with siRNA and adenovirus. For negative controls, AllStars Negative Control siRNA and/or empty virus were substituted for the FHOD3-specific reagents. Thus, we refer to the negative control experiment as a mock knockdown and the knockdown alone as a mock rescue. During assay development, we found that knockdown reduced FHOD3 mRNA to ∼35% of original levels after four days, with either of two commercially available oligos (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At this timepoint, we detected an ∼80% reduction in endogenous FHOD3 protein via Western blot (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B,C</xref>).</p>

<p>We analyzed sarcomere structure in fixed samples. To detect sarcomeres, we stained cells with anti-α-actinin antibodies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). To analyze on a per cell basis, we stained plasma membranes with WGA (wheat germ agglutinin) and segmented the NRVMs with CellPose (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Stringer et al., 2021</xref>). The DsRed reporter was not an accurate readout of exogenous 3xHA-FHOD3L (hereafter, FHOD3L) expression levels (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, we used anti-HA antibodies to visualize and quantify the expression of exogenous FHOD3 on a per cell basis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, Figure 4—figure supplement 4G). We found that exogenous FHOD3L expression was ∼90% above endogenous levels at the end of the rescue timeline (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B,C</xref>). We, therefore, examined the impact of FHOD3L expression level on sarcomere structure. We detected essentially no correlation (R-squared ranges from 0.01 to 0.16) of sarcomere number, length, or width over a three-fold change in FHOD3L expression levels (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-F</xref>). The average HA intensity was within this range for all experiments. Despite the evidence that sarcomere structure was not a function of FHOD3 expression levels, we decided to exclude NRVMs that express very highly above endogenous FHOD3 levels. We set an upper cutoff for the normalized exogenous FHOD3L expression per cell area of 5% and applied that same intensity level as a cutoff for all other experiments (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). We also set a lower cutoff slightly above background HA levels to exclude NRVMs not expressing exogenous FHOD3L.</p>
<p>We confirmed that sarcomeres remained organized upon mock knockdown, counting 12 ± 13 sarcomeres per cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D,E</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

Expression of wild-type FHOD3L was sufficient to rescue the loss of sarcomeres and anti-HA staining demonstrated that exogenous FHOD3L localized to sarcomeres, as expected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). In fact, FHOD3L-rescued NRVMs formed significantly more sarcomeres than the mock knockdown NRVMs (19 ± 14 vs. 12 ± 13; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). We note that the sarcomere number measurement has a high standard deviation because even within the expression level cutoffs, some cells lacked sarcomeres. Such right-tailed distributions are consistent with other reports of sarcomere numbers per cardiomyocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Neininger-Castro et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<p>To analyze sarcomere integrity more closely, we measured sarcomere lengths (Z-line to Z-line) and widths (Z-line lengths). In the mock rescue cells, the sarcomeres that remained were both shorter and narrower than those in the mock knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F, G</xref>). When rescued with FHOD3L, sarcomere lengths (1.72 ± 0.18 µm) and sarcomere widths (1.70 ± 0.46 µm) recovered to lengths comparable to the mock knockdown control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F, G</xref>). To measure thin filament length, we stained NRVMs with phalloidin and anti-HA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 H</xref>). We observed shorter thin filament lengths in FHOD3L-rescued NRVMs (739 ± 81 nm) compared to mock knockdown NRVMs (925 ± 94 nm) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). The difference in thin filament length could reflect the increased number of sarcomeres in the rescued cells and/or indicate that the sarcomeres have not reached their final steady state after two days of FHOD3L expression. Therefore, FHOD3L-rescued NRVMs form sarcomeres <italic>de novo</italic> that well approximate the sarcomeres in the negative control. We compared further experimental results to FHOD3L rescue cells, due to the slight differences.</p>
<p>We next measured contractile function in FHOD3L-rescued NRVMs. To do so, we used the motionGUI MatLab program that makes use of Digital Image Correlation (DIC) to measure contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huebsch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nakano et al., 2017</xref>). Contraction and relaxation velocities inform us about systolic and diastolic function of the cardiomyocytes, respectively, and thus their ability to promote proper blood flow in organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ferreira-Martins and Leite-Moreira, 2010</xref>). As expected, maximal contraction and relaxation velocities were both significantly decreased upon FHOD3 knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,B,D</xref>, <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Both velocities recovered to mock knockdown levels by subsequent expression of FHOD3L (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,C,D</xref>, <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, Video 2). We also examined expression of FHOD3L in an otherwise untreated background (overexpression). Intensity of exogenous FHOD3L per NRVM was notably lower compared to the wild-type rescue despite infecting with the same titer, suggesting that excel FHOD3L is deleterious and NRVMs attempt to maintain FHOD3L levels below some maximum (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Consistent with this idea, contraction and relaxation velocities were reduced upon overexpression of FHOD3L (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). These data further confirm that the expression levels in our rescue experiments, while somewhat higher than endogenous levels, are within an acceptable range.</p>

<p>To assess the impact of FHOD3L depletion on cardiac rhythm, we measured the percentage of beating area in each video that exhibited consistent, rhythmic contractions (defined as no more than 1 beat out of sync in a 10 second period). We observed rhythmic contractions for both the mock knockdown NRVMs and FHOD3L-rescued NRVMs for ∼75% of the analyzed videos (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,C,E</xref>, Video 2). In contrast, primarily arrhythmic contractions were detected in FHOD3-depleted NRVMs, with only ∼15% of the videos showing rhythmic beating (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B,E</xref>, Video 2). To assess whether some NRVMs in these conditions were not contracting at all, we estimated the proportion of NRVMs that were contracting per video and found contractions throughout ∼95% of the field of view on average for both mock knockdown NRVMs and wild-type FHOD3L-rescued NRVMs (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). For FHOD3-depleted NRVMs, we observed a reduction in contractile area to ∼80% (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This value was higher than expected based on other metrics (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D,E</xref>). We attribute much of the movement to neighboring cells pulling each other. We also quantified contractility when we overexpressed FHOD3L. FHOD3L overexpression did not clearly impact the average amount of rhythmic contractions or the area of contraction though variance was increased (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D,E</xref>), consistent with the idea that, at high enough levels, FHOD3L activity can be detrimental in NRVMs.</p>

<title>Loss of nucleation but not elongation is tolerated for sarcomere formation and cardiac function</title>
<p>Once we established baseline levels of sarcomere structure and contractility in NRVMs with the wild type FHOD3L rescue, we asked which of FHOD3L’s actin organizing activities are important for its cellular function. To this end, we performed rescue experiments with the nucleation-hindering mutant (K1193L) and the elongation-hindering mutant (GS-FH1). Expression of the K1193L mutant resulted in expression levels similar to wild type (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Overall, cells expressing FHOD3L K1193L were almost indistinguishable from those expressing FHOD3L. FHOD3L K1193L localization was striated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) and the number of sarcomeres per NRVM was rescued to wild-type levels (15 ± 16) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Sarcomere lengths and widths were indistinguishable from wild-type (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C,D</xref>). The only difference was thin filament lengths, which were significantly longer in the K1193L-rescued NRVMs (792 ± 79 nm) compared to those in FHOD3L-rescued NRVMs (739 ± 81) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In agreement with the well-organized, near wild-type appearance of sarcomeres, contraction and relaxation velocities, as well as the proportion of rhythmically contracting NRVMs, were indistinguishable from the FHOD3L rescue (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F,G</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>, Video 3). Thus, ∼70% lower nucleation activity, ∼20-fold weaker barbed-end capping, and loss of over 50% of bundling activity had no deleterious impact on FHOD3L’s ability to function in NRVMs.</p>

<p>In contrast, the elongation deficient mutant (GS-FH1) did not rescue FHOD3L loss in NRVMs. Based on total fluorescence per cell, we determined that GS-FH1 levels were lower than observed for wild-type or K1193L, despite infecting a similar proportion of NRVMs (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In a few cells that possibly escaped from RNAi knockdown, we observed a striated pattern of GS-FH1, demonstrating that the protein can fold and localize correctly if sarcomeres are intact (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The turnover rate of GS-FH1 may be higher than wild-type intrinsically or because there are few binding sites available. The sarcomere number per cell was only 2 ± 4, similar to the mock rescue (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Within the sarcomeres detected, sarcomere lengths and widths were both reduced (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C and D</xref>). We were not able to measure thin filament lengths with confidence, due to the lack of sarcomere organization. Not surprisingly, contractility was nearly abolished after rescuing with GS-FH1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F,G</xref>,<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>, Video 3). Contraction and relaxation velocities were decreased, and contractions were largely arrhythmic (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F,G</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). We note that barbed-end capping and bundling activities were weaker than wild-type in the GS-FH1 mutant but they were equivalent or greater than the activities found for the K1193L mutant which rescued well (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B,D</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that elongation activity of FHOD3L is the primary activity required for sarcomere formation, whereas reduced nucleation, barbed-end binding, and bundling activities are well tolerated.</p>

<title>FHOD3L elongation is necessary for sarcomeres in NRVMs</title>
<p>Published rates of nucleation and elongation by formins both range over at least an order of magnitude. It is generally thought that the specific actin assembly properties of a given formin are set for its function, i.e., the structure this formin will build. To directly test this idea, Homa et al. replaced Cdc12p, the formin critical to <italic>S. pombe</italic> cytokinesis, with several chimeras of differing nucleation strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Homa et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, they found a strong positive correlation between formins with nucleation strength similar to Cdc12p and their ability to drive cytokinesis. In a computational model that recapitulates yeast cable structure, it was found that nucleation and/or elongation could be tuned to build the cables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">McInally et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, how formins are used is likely to differ from case to case.</p>
<p>Here we determined that FHOD3L can nucleate <italic>in vitro</italic>, albeit weakly compared to many formins. Unlike in cytokinesis, we found that this activity is not necessary for its function in NRVMs. The necessity of actin assembly, nucleation and/or elongation, by Fhod-family formins has been assumed based on failure of the IA mutation to rescue in multiple species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kan-O et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kimmich et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kutscheidt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shwartz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Taniguchi et al., 2009</xref>). To assess nucleation more specifically, we tested a mutant variant that substantially reduces the nucleation activity without altering elongation (FHOD3L K1193L). This mutant had almost no impact on sarcomere formation or function in NRVMs. The only statistically significant difference we detected was in thin filament length (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). A host of proteins are critical to establishing and maintaining thin filaments at a precise length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Szikora et al., 2022</xref>). No other studies have implicated FHOD3L in this process to date. Thus, we believe that the length difference is more likely to reflect the state of maturity of the cells (time post infection) and/or the number of sarcomeres per cell. While we only have three data points at this time, sarcomere number and thin filament length were highly correlated (inversely) in our experiments, with an R-squared of 0.90.</p>
<p>By rescuing NRVMs with FHOD3L K1193L, we also tested a formin that caps barbed ends with a K<sub>d</sub> that is ∼15 times higher than wild type (i.e., ∼15x weaker) and bundles filaments ∼50% less potently than wild type. The fact that the cardiomyocytes were indistinguishable from wild-type when expressing this mutant suggests that neither of these activities are required and, certainly, they are not needed at wild-type levels. Assuming that FHOD3L activities are tuned to meet its <italic>in vivo</italic> functions, these magnitudes of change in activity would be expected to result in measurable phenotypes in function and/or morphology of the cell.</p>
<p>The fact that K1193L had no impact on the elongation properties of FHOD3L <italic>in vitro</italic> and still rescues sarcomeres leads to an indirect conclusion that elongation is the actin assembly activity that is important in NRVMs. Of course, the failure to rescue by FHOD3L GS-FH1, an elongation incompetent mutant, strongly supports this conclusion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The elongation properties of FHOD3L are unusual. Its elongation rate is among the highest known, including mDia1 and Cappuccino (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kovar et al., 2006</xref>). However, processivity is very brief, resulting in filaments of only ∼1 μm. We previously found that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> splice variant FhodA has a similarly short characteristic run length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Patel et al., 2018</xref>). In principle, this characteristic run length is sufficient to build sarcomeric thin filaments, which are about 1 μm long in NRVMs. Notably, a splice variant of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Fhod that only differs by having a shorter tail, FhodB, typically elongates for ∼20 μm and the tails of mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> formins are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bremer et al., 2024</xref>). These observations lead us to question whether processivity of Fhod-family formins is somehow regulated <italic>in vivo</italic> such that it can build short filaments when needed and longer filaments in other contexts. Interestingly, a computational model describing Bni1-built actin cables demonstrates that tuning the length of individual filaments to cell size is sufficient to account for cable differences in cells of different sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">McInally et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>The FH1 domain strongly influences elongation rate <italic>in vitro</italic>. In NRVMs, we found that replacement of the FH1 domain with a flexible linker (FHOD3L GS-FH1) resulted in a severe phenotype. These cells had very few sarcomeres. FHOD3L GS-FH1 was indistinguishable from mock rescue in sarcomere number, structure (shorter and narrower), and function (contraction and relaxation velocities did not differ). The result could be questioned because the expression levels were lower than those for the other constructs. We argue against this based on two observations: First, despite similar metrics in sarcomere structure and function, the rhythmicity of contraction was markedly diminished, even compared to the mock rescue (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Second, we do not believe that the low protein levels reflect protein instability. We detect FHOD3L GS-FH1 bound to residual sarcomeres, suggesting that it folds and is stable when binding sites within sarcomeres are available (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Therefore, we suspect that low FHOD3L GS-FH1 levels reflect the absence of sarcomeres.</p>
<p>Recent work in C. elegans is consistent with our finding. Kimmich et al. removed the endogenous coding region of the FH1 domain in worm Fhod-1 (the only worm Fhod gene) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kimmich et al., 2024</xref>). Body wall muscle is severely impacted by this deletion. In addition, they found that profilin is required for Fhod-1 function. Together these data strongly argue that elongation is important. Interestingly, the muscle phenotype is more severe in a strain that lacks the FH2 domain and all of the upstream sequence but not the FH1 domain. Thus, nucleation activity seems to be necessary in this animal. Ultimately, complete removal of a domain, such as the GS-FH1 mutant is an important starting point but a blunt tool. Future experiments with modified elongation (e.g. slower, more processive) will provide further insight into the biochemical role of FHOD3.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Why does FHOD3L elongate in NRVMs?</title>
<p>Given these new data, what could FHOD3L be doing in the cell? In multiple species, premyofibrils are built but they fail to mature into wild-type myofibrils in the absence of FHOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fenix et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kan-O et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kimmich et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shwartz et al., 2016</xref>). It follows that FHOD3 is not required to build the earliest thin filaments in the sarcomere. Instead, FHOD3 could contribute new thin filaments to expanding, maturing sarcomeres. If this were the case, we might expect nucleation to be more important than our data indicate. Instead, FHOD3L could be responsible for elongating filaments that are nucleated by a different protein. For example, FHOD3L and DAAM could collaborate, or they could contribute to the apparent redundancy and robustness built in to sarcomerogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Szikora et al., 2022</xref>). DAAM knockout mice have overlapping cardiac phenotypes with those of the FHOD3 knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kan-O et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, a lack of sarcomere thickening and loss of sarcomere organization are common phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> knockdowns of Daam1 and Fhod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Molnár et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shwartz et al., 2016</xref>). While FHOD3L and DAAM cannot compensate for the loss of one or the other, they might work together and be able to help each other when one is compromised.</p>
<p>Alternatively, FHOD3L could be reinforcing the Z-line structure to facilitate sarcomere thickening. This idea is consistent with the narrow myofibrils and Z-body disorder observed in worms lacking functional Fhod-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kimmich et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mi-Mi et al., 2012</xref>). However, if capping and bundling were important to the Z-line integrity, one would expect to find FHOD3L localized in the Z-line. In mouse heart tissue, FHOD3L appears to bind directly to MyBP-C which localizes between the Z- and M-lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Matsuyama et al., 2018b</xref>), suggesting that it is not actively stabilizing the Z-line. FHOD localization varies between species and with development, suggesting that this role is not conserved, if it exists. If, instead, transient actin assembly were sufficient for Z-line stabilization, this role would be consistent with our findings that capping and bundling are not essential in NRVMs.</p>

<p>FHOD3L-CT (residues 963-1622) was cloned into pGEX-6P-2 with an N-terminal glutathione-S-transferase (GST) tag. The original template, EGFP-Fhod3L, was generously provided by T. Iskratsch (Queen Mary University of London) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Iskratsch et al., 2010</xref>). Point mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Truncations were constructed using FastCloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Liu and Naismith, 2008</xref>). pGEX-FHOD3L-CT GS-FH1, in which the polyproline tracts were replaced with GS linkers was cloned via Gibson Assembly introducing a gBlock into pGEX-FHOD3L-CT (not including the FH1 region).</p>
<p>The FHOD3L-CT wild-type and mutant constructs were transformed in Rosetta 2 (<italic>E. coli</italic> DE3) cells (Novagen), which were grown in 1 liter of Terrific Broth supplemented with 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 32 mg/liter chloramphenicol. Expression was induced at an OD of 0.6-0.8 by adding 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalacto-pyranoside (IPTG) and shaking overnight at 18°C, 210 rpm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in PBS, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p>Cell pellets expressing GST-FHOD3L-CT wild-type and mutants were resuspended in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT, 2 μg/mL DNaseI. All subsequent steps were performed on ice or at 4°C. The cells were lysed with a microfluidizer, cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 20 minutes, and then purified using a HitrapSP-FF cation exchange column (GE Life Sciences) with a gradient of 0.2 –0.6 M NaCl over 1 column volume after a 1 column volume wash with 0.2 M NaCl. Peak fractions were dialyzed overnight into 20 mM HEPES pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and Prescission Protease was added to cleave off the GST-tag. This sample was centrifuged at 4°C for 48,000 rpm for 20 minutes, and further purified on a MonoS cation exchange column (GE Life Sciences) with a gradient of 0.2–0.95 M NaCl over 40 column volumes after a 1 column volume wash with 0.2 M NaCl. Peak fractions were exchanged into storage buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mM DTT), then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.</p>
<p>Cell pellets expressing GST-FHOD3S-CT were purified and stored similarly to GST-FHOD3L-CT wild-type, except 150 mM NaCl was used throughout the purification with a gradient of 0.15–0.95 M NaCl over 40 column volumes after a 1 column volume wash with 0.15 M NaCl on the MonoS cation exchange column (GE Life Sciences).</p>
<p>Concentrations of C-terminal FHOD3 constructs were determined by running a series of serial dilutions on a Sypro Red-stained quantitative gel using densitometry (ImageJ) with rabbit skeletal actin as the standard. All FHOD3L-CT concentrations are reported as dimer concentrations.</p>

<p>We used rabbit skeletal muscle actin (RSA) throughout the paper, based on FHOD3L’s role in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Skeletal muscle actin was isolated from rabbit back muscle acetone powder (Pel-Freez) according to the method described by Spudich and Watt followed by gel purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Spudich and Watt, 1971</xref>).

<title>Pyrene Assays</title>
<p>Pyrene assays were performed essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bor et al., 2012</xref>) on an Infinite 200 Pro plate reader (Tecan). FHOD3L-CT was diluted in buffer Z (2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM TCEP, 0.04% sodium azide) before addition to polymerization buffer (KMEH: 10mM HEPES, pH 7, 1mM EGTA, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). This mix was added to Mg<sup>2+</sup>-actin at a final concentration of 4 μM with 5% pyrene-labeled actin. For bulk assembly assays, nucleation strengths were calculated from the slope at t<sub>1/8</sub> through the origin. The concentration of barbed ends was calculated from the slope (obtained by linear regression over 90 s) as described in (Pollard, 1986 and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Patel et al., 2018</xref>). For seeded elongation assays, actin filaments were sheared by passing three times through a 24-gauge needle and then aliquoted into each well of a microplate. Proteins were added to the seeds and incubated for 2– 4 min at room temperature. Seeds and additional proteins in KMEH were added to Mg<sup>2+</sup>-actin, at a final concentration of 0.5 μM actin with 10% pyrene-labeled actin, to initiate elongation. Elongation rates were determined by linear regression over the first 90 s and normalized against the rate of actin alone in each experiment. The affinity of FHOD3-CT for barbed ends was determined by fitting the data to the quadratic binding equation:

The text files of the outlines were saved and overlaid on the respective channels of the images individually using the provided python file from Cellpose as a macro through FIJI (imagej_roi_converter.py). Cellpose segments with no nuclei or 3 or more nuclei, as well as cell segments on the edge of the image were excluded from analysis.</p>
<p>Sarcomere analysis was performed manually in a single-blind manner (for mock knockdown, mock rescue, wild-type rescue, and the K1193L rescue) using blindrename.pl (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/davalencia0914/sarcApp_Cellpose_Merge">https://github.com/davalencia0914/sarcApp_Cellpose_Merge</ext-link>) to generate the filenames and a key filename csv file for decoding after analysis. We attempted to blind all other rescue conditions, but they were too easily identified based on expression level and localization differences. Linescans were generated along myofibrils, perpendicular to the Z-lines to make sarcomere length measurements from Z-line peak to Z-line peak. Z-line lengths were measured by visual inspection of the alpha-actinin channel and measured on FIJI with the line tool. Three or more consecutive Z-lines at least 0.70 µm long in a row were analyzed as sarcomeres.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>To compare two or more groups for the rescue experiments in NRVMs, pair-wise comparisons were performed. In order to reduce Type 1 error rate stemming from multiple comparisons, Bonferroni correction was applied to obtain a corrected alpha. Whether groups were normally distributed or not was determined by the Shapiro-Wilk test. To compare two normally distributed groups, Student’s two-sample, unpaired t-test was used. If either group was not normally distributed, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used. The same analysis was applied to analyze run lengths and capping duration from the TIRF seeded elongation assays.</p>
<p>For the nucleation assay, barbed-end binding assays, and TIRF elongation rate analysis, one-way ANOVA’s were performed for 3 treatment comparisons with post-hoc Tukey tests as the variances between all treatments tested were fairly equal.</p>
<p>In all cases when the sample size exceeded 20, we removed outliers from the bottom and upper 2.5% of data to perform all statistical tests, regardless of normality, to avoid introducing bias. However, all plots shown include these outliers.</p>

<p>Valencia et al. combine elegant in vitro biochemical experiments with functional assays in cardiomyocytes to determine which properties of the FHOD3 formin are essential for sarcomere assembly. Using separation-of-function mutants, they show that FHOD3's elongation activity, rather than its nucleation, capping, or bundling activities, is key to its sarcomeric function. This is an <bold>important</bold> finding; most of the data presented in the manuscript are <bold>convincing</bold>, with the exception of two experiments (presence of FHOD3 at the barbed end of actin filaments in the TIRF elongation assays and characterization of the GS-FH1 mutant phenotype) that would merit few additional controls.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Formins are complex proteins with multiple effects on actin filament assembly, including nucleation, capping with processive elongation, and bundling. Determining which of these activities is important for a given biological process and normal cellular function is a major challenge.</p>
<p>Here, the authors study the formin FHOD3L, which is essential for normal sarcomere assembly in muscle cells. They identify point mutants of FHOD3L in which formin nucleation and elongation/bundling activities are functionally separated. Expression of these mutants in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes shows that the control of actin filament elongation by formin is the major activity required for the normal assembly of functional sarcomeres.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this work is to combine sensitive biochemical assays with excellent work in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. This combination of approaches is highly effective for analyzing the function of proteins with multiple activities in vitro.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>FHOD3L does not seem to be the easiest formin to study because of its relatively weak nucleation activity and the short duration of capping events. This difficulty imposes rigorous biochemical analysis and careful interpretation of the data, which should be improved in this work.</p>

<p>This article elucidates the biochemical and cellular mechanisms by which the FHOD-family of formins, particularly FHOD3, contributes to sarcomere formation and contractility in cardiomyocytes. Formins are mainly known to nucleate and elongate actin filaments, with certain family members also exhibiting capping, severing, and bundling activities. Although FHOD3 has been well-established as essential for sarcomere assembly in cardiomyocytes, its precise biochemical functions and contributions to actin dynamics remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>In this study, the authors combine in vitro biochemical assays with cellular experiments to dissect FHOD3's roles in actin assembly and sarcomere formation. They demonstrate that FHOD3 nucleates actin filaments and acts as a transient elongator, pausing elongation after an initial burst of filament growth. Using separation-of-function mutants, they show that FHOD3's elongation activity - rather than its nucleation, capping, or bundling capabilities - is key for its sarcomeric function.</p>
<p>The experiments have been conducted rigorously and well-analyzed, and the paper is clearly written. The data presented support the authors' conclusions. I appreciate the detailed description and rationale behind the FHOD3 constructs used in this study.</p>
<p>However, I was somewhat surprised and a bit disappointed that while the authors conducted single-color TIRF experiments to observe the effects of FHOD3 on single filaments, they did not use fluorescently labeled FHOD3 to directly visualize its behavior. Incorporating such experiments would significantly strengthen their conclusions regarding FHOD3's bursts of elongation interspersed with capping activity. While I understand this might require a few additional weeks of experiments, these data would add considerable value by directly testing the proposed mechanism.</p>
<p>There is a typo in the word &quot;required&quot; in line number 30. The authors also use fit data to extract parameters in several panels (e.g., Figures 2b, 2d, 3a, and 3b). While these fit functions may be intuitive to actin experts, explicitly describing the fit functions in the figure legends or methods would greatly benefit the broader readership.</p>

<p>Valencia et al. aim to elucidate the biochemical and cellular mechanisms through which the human formin FHOD3 drives sarcomere assembly in cardiomyocytes. To do so, they combined rigorous in vitro biochemical assays with comprehensive in vivo characterizations, evaluating two wild-type FHOD3 isoforms and two function-separating mutants. Surprisingly, they found that both wild-type FHOD3 isoforms can nucleate new actin filaments, as well as elongate existing actin filaments in conjunction with profilin following barbed-end capping. This is in addition to FHOD3's proposed role as an actin bundler. Next, the authors asked whether FHOD3L promotes sarcomere assembly in cardiomyocytes through its activity in actin nucleation or rather elongation. With two function-separating mutants, the authors evaluated the numbers and morphology of sarcomeres, as well as their ability to beat and generate cardiac rhythm. The authors found that while the wild-type FHOD3L and the K1193L mutant can rescue sarcomere morphology and physiology, the GS-FH1 mutant fails to do so. Given that in GS-FH1 mainly elongation activity is compromised, the authors concluded that the elongation activity of FHOD3 is essential for its role in sarcomere assembly in cardiomyocytes, while its nucleator activity is dispensable. Overall, this important study provided a broadened view on the biochemical activities of FHOD3, and a pioneering view on a possible cellular mechanism of how FHOD3L drives sarcomere assembly. If further validated, this can lead to new mechanistic models of sarcomere assembly and potentially new therapeutic targets of cardiomyopathy.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by the comprehensive biochemical analyses performed by the authors. However, the sarcomere assembly defect phenotype in the GS-FH1 rescue condition requires further investigation, as the extremely low level of GS-FH1 signal in transfected cells in Figure 6A may reflect a failure of actin-binding by this construct in vivo, rather than its inability to drive elongation. Though the authors do show in Figure 6 that GS-FH1 can bind to normal-looking sarcomeres when they are present, this may be due to a lack of siRNA activity in these cells, such that endogenous FHOD3L is still present. In this possible scenario, GS-FH1 may dimerize with endogenous FHOD3L. The authors should demonstrate that GS-FH1 alone can indeed interact with existing actin filaments in vivo. While this has been clearly demonstrated in vitro, given the more complex biochemical environment in vivo where additional unknown binding partners may present, cautions should be made when extrapolating findings from the former to the latter.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their careful readings of our paper and their very positive assessment. Here we address the two major concerns they raised, referring to the revised version of the manuscript that will be submitted:</p>
<p>(1) Important points were raised regarding the brief elongation events we reported. The time resolution and noise in our system reduce the accuracy of the burst velocity measurements. To address this, we have reached out to a colleague who is set up to repeat these measurements with microfluidics-assisted TIRF. The noise should be greatly reduced and the system is also optimal for directly visualizing labeled FHOD3, as suggested. We hope this experimental approach will provide new insights.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we analyzed our data more closely. We were asked about the pauses we observe before bursts of elongation and how we know they are functionally relevant. The short answer is that we do not know. We reported them because they were so common:  in three independent experiments with wild type FHOD3L-CT we analyzed a total of 20 filaments. We detected 112 dim regions and 97 of these were pause/burst events (~87%). Among the cases lacking a pause we include instances of apparent &quot;double bursts&quot; with no time for capping in between (which may be a time resolution issue) and some cases where the burst was in progress when data collection started. In the latter case, we cannot determine whether or not a pause was missed. We cannot rule out that this pause reflects an interaction with the surface but might expect the frequency to be lower if it were. In fact, we did detect pauses in the profilin-actin negative control but only 4 pauses were detected across 21 filaments analyzed compared to 97 pauses observed in the presence of wild type FHOD3L across 20 filaments analyzed. We will revise the text to make our conclusions about pauses more circumspect.</p>
<p>For comparison to our current data, we further analyzed the filaments in TIRF assays with no formin present. As the reviewers point out, inhomogeneities in filament intensity are normal. Thus, we examined any dim spots for pauses and/or bursts. We will report (future Figure 2G) that the velocity of growth of these dim spots was the same as the velocity of the rest of the filament. While our numbers may not be perfectly accurate due to the noise in our system, the difference of 3-4 fold increase versus no detectable change in rate is substantial and statistically different. In addition, we determined the number of dim spots per length of filament. We found a higher frequency of dim spots when FHOD3L-CT or FHOD3S-CT was present vs no formin, as will be shown in Figure 2 – figure supplement 1G and 2D.</p>
<p>We are convinced that the brief dim events we observed in the presence of FHOD3L-CT do, in fact, reflect formin-mediated elongation and hope that the reviewers concur. This does not preclude our interest in the microfluidics and two-color assays, which we will pursue in the future.</p>
<p>(2) The reviewers were concerned about the low protein levels in the GS-FH1 rescue experiments as reflected in the HA fluorescence intensity distributions shown in Fig. 5 – figure supplement 2A. While the scenario proposed could explain our observations with the GSFH1 rescues, it is quite complex and does not preclude the conclusion that the FH1 domain is critical. One limit of this scenario would be that the protein levels in the GS-FH1 cells reflect completely inactive protein, as opposed to FHOD3L that cannot elongate (by design). Given that the C-terminal half of the protein folds and functions and that the changes are made within an intrinsically disordered region, we do not favor this model. The reviewers suggest that the mutant protein detected in the few cells with (probably residual) sarcomeres could be stabilized, in part or entirely, by heterodimerization with residual endogenous wild type protein. We agree that heterodimerization is possible. The question becomes, how active is a heterodimer? If heterodimers have any activity, it seems far from sufficient to rescue sarcomere formation, suggesting that two functional FH1 domains are critical. To confirm this possibility, we would have to be able to determine whether the few sarcomeres present in these cases are residual and/or the new sarcomeres the low level of heterodimers could make. That said, we do not see evidence of correlation between protein levels and rescue at the level present in these cells (addressed below). Unfortunately, the proposed IP to test whether FHOD3L binds actin <italic>in vivo</italic> would only potentially report on filament side binding (both direct and indirect). It would not address whether the GS-FH1 mutant functions as a nucleator, elongator, bundler and/or capping protein <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>If we assume that the protein present is active, the critical question that we can address is whether the phenotype is due to low protein levels or if the phenotype is due to loss of elongation activity by FHOD3L. To address this question, we revisited our data.</p>
<p>First, we plotted the distributions of the intensities of the cells we analyzed further, in addition to the automated readout of all the cells in the dish we originally presented (e.g. Fig. 4 – figure supplement 2A,B). These cells were selected randomly and, as should be the case, the distributions of their intensities agree well with the original distributions for the three different rescue constructs: FHOD3L, K1193L, and GS-FH1 (Fig. 6 – figure supplement 1A,B). We then asked whether there was any correlation between HA intensities with the sarcomere metrics. Consistent with in our pilot data, no correlation is evident in any of the three cases across the range of intensities we collected (400 – 2700 a.u.) (Fig. 6 – figure supplement 1C,D,E). We were originally satisfied with the GS-FH1 data, despite the low average intensity levels, because the intensities were well within the range that we established in pilot studies. These data reconfirm that the intensity levels are reasonable in a larger study.</p>
<p>To more specifically address the question of whether low HA fluorescence intensity is likely to reflect sufficient protein levels to build sarcomeres, we re-examined two data sets from the FHOD3L WT rescue data. We found that, by chance, the first replicate of data from the wild type rescue has a comparable intensity distribution to that of the GSFH1 rescues (580 +/- 261 / cell vs. 548 +/- 105 / cell). In addition, we collected all of the data from cells with intensity levels &lt;720, selected to mimic the distribution of the GS-FH1 cells (Fig. 6 – figure supplement 3A). We then compared the sarcomere metrics (sarcomere number, sarcomere length, sarcomere width) between the full data set and the two low intensity subsets using statistical tests as reported for the rest of the cell biology data set:</p>
<p>· Sarcomere number is the only non-normal metric. We therefore used the Mann Whitney U test for each pairwise comparison, which shows no difference between all 3 WT distributions.</p>
<p>· We compared Z-line lengths by Student’s two-sample, unpaired t-test for each pairwise comparison, again finding no significant difference for all distributions.</p>
<p>· Sarcomere length shows a weakly significant difference (p=0.017 (compared to 0.033 for 3 treatment groups based on Bonferroni correction)) between the whole WT data set and bio rep 1, but no difference between the whole WT data set and the HA&lt;720 group via Student’s two-sample, unpaired t-test.</p>
<p>An alternate statistical analysis approach, one-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests, gave similar results. Thus, cells expressing wild type FHOD3L at levels comparable to levels detected in GS-FH1 mutant rescues, are fully rescued. Based on these findings we conclude that the expression levels in the GS-FH1 are high enough to rescue the FHOD3 knock down, supporting our conclusion that the defect is due to loss of elongation activity. We will add this analysis and discussion to the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>In future studies we will design less severe mutations to the FH1 domain. We hope to identify one with a strong effect on elongation and another with an intermediate effect. Once the best candidates are characterized in vitro, we will test them in our rescue experiments. If the strong mutant mimics the GS-FH1 rescue and the intermediate mutant is less severe, we will have strengthened our conclusion that elongation is a critical FHOD3L activity in sarcomere formation.</p>
<p>Additional improvements will be made to the manuscript based on recommendations we received from the reviewers.</p>
