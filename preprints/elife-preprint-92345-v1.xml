<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Bacteriophages are ubiquitous in nature and play key roles in various ecosystems. They impact microbial community composition and reprogram the metabolism of diverse host cells using auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs). Whether bacteriophages can reprogram host polysaccharide metabolism through AMGs remains unclear, however. Here, we found for the first time that polysaccharides induce the production of different types of bacteriophages in two deep-sea <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strains (WC36 and zth2). Through physiological assays, genomic analysis and transcriptomics assays, we found that these bacteriophages might assist their hosts in metabolizing polysaccharides through AMGs. Moreover, the isolated bacteriophages could effectively assist a marine bacterium (<italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> 273) in metabolizing and utilizing polysaccharide to promote its growth. These findings shed light on the importance of atypical and poorly understood virus-host interactions and bring us closer to understanding the potential role of deep-sea viruses in marine ecosystems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Viruses are the most abundant and genetically diverse biological entities on this planet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Suttle, 2007</xref>), and potentially play a role in shaping microbial abundances, community structure, and the evolutionary trajectory of core metabolisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Samson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zimmerman et al., 2020</xref>). The effect of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) on their specific hosts and within the microbial community is largely determined by their lifestyle. Traditionally, most bacteriophage life cycles are classified as being either lytic or lysogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Du Toit, 2017</xref>). During the lytic cycle, phages hijack the host’s metabolic machinery for replication of their own genome and the production of progeny particles that are released through lysis. By contrast, during lysogeny, phages integrate their genomes into the host chromosome (or exist in the extrachromosomal form) and enter a dormant state, with the potential to re-enter a lytic cycle and release progeny by environmental changes at a later stage. Currently, more and more attention has been paid to chronic life cycles where bacterial growth continues despite phage reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hoffmann Berling and Maze, 1964</xref>). During a chronic cycle, progeny phage particles are released from host cells via extrusion or budding without killing the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Putzrath and Maniloff, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Russel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Marvin et al., 2014</xref>), instead of lysis of the host cell. Chronic infections are common among eukaryotic viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Godkin and Smith, 2017</xref>), however, only a handful of chronic viruses have been described for prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Roux et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Alarcón-Schumacher et al., 2022</xref>). The best-studied examples of chronic infection are those from filamentous ssDNA (single-stranded DNA) phages that to date have primarily been identified in the order <italic>Tubulavirales</italic>, which currently involves three families (<italic>Inoviridae, Paulinoviridae</italic> and <italic>Plectroviridae</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ackermann, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Knezevic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chevallereau et al., 2022</xref>). One of the most distinctive features of inoviruses is their ability to establish a chronic infection whereby their genomes may either integrate into the host chromosome or reside within the cell in a non-active form, and inoviruses particles are continuously released without killing the host. In addition, tailless phages enclosed in lipid membrane are also released from hosts during chronic life cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Recent studies indicate that chronic cycles are more widespread in nature than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mäntynen et al., 2021</xref>), and the abundance of inoviruses in ecosystem may have been far underestimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Roux et al., 2019</xref>). These findings have suggested that plenty of novel phages in the biosphere may be produced through chronic life cycles, but whether chronic cycles are associated with specific environments or ecological conditions remains to be thoroughly explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chevallereau et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Marine ecosystems always influence the operating conditions for life on earth via microbial interaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Falkowski et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Faust and Raes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wigington et al., 2016</xref>), which are modulated by viruses through impacting their lifespan, gene flow and metabolic outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Suttle, 2005</xref>). A majority of these viruses are bacteriophages, which exist widely in oceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Breitbart, 2012</xref>). In addition to core viral genes encoding viral structural proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brum et al., 2016</xref>), bacteriophages also encode various auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brum and Sullivan, 2015</xref>) that provide supplemental support to key steps of host metabolism. For instance, AMGs of marine bacteriophages have been predicted to be involved in photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mann et al., 2003</xref>), nitrogen- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ahlgren et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gazitúa et al., 2021</xref>), sulfur- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Anantharaman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Roux et al., 2016</xref>), and phosphorus cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zeng and Chisholm, 2012</xref>), nucleotide metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sullivan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dwivedi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Enav et al., 2014</xref>) and almost all central carbon metabolisms in host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hurwitz et al., 2013</xref>). However, AMGs of chronic phages have not been reported. Thus, it is worth exploring whether chronic phages could carry AMGs and assist host metabolism during chronic infection.</p>
<p>The deep sea harbors abundant and undiscovered viruses, which potentially control the metabolism of microbial hosts and influence biogeochemical cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Li et al., 2021</xref>). However, the vast majority of deep-sea bacteria cannot be cultivated, which greatly limits the host range of deep-sea bacteriophages, resulting in most unknown bacteriophages could not be isolated in the laboratory. Thus, it is of great significance to further identify unknown phages in the deep sea and explore their relationship with microbial hosts and even marine ecosystems. Here, we report that polysaccharides can induce deep-sea <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> bacteria (difficult-to-cultivate microorganisms) to release some bacteriophages. These bacteriophages might assist host metabolism to degrade polysaccharide and thereby promote host growth via AMGs.</p>

<title>Polysaccharides promote the growth of deep-sea <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strain WC36 and stimulate the expression of phage-associated genes</title>
<p>As a primary carbon source, polysaccharides are a ubiquitous energy source for microorganisms in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zheng et al., 2021a</xref>). In our previous work, we successfully isolated a novel <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> species through a polysaccharide degradation-driven strategy from the deep-sea cold seep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zheng et al., 2021a</xref>). Of note, using the same approach and deep-sea sample replicates, we also cultured a bacterial strain WC36 that was identified as a member of the phylum <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> by 16S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogenetic analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). As expected, growth assays showed that two kinds of polysaccharides including laminarin and starch could promote strain WC36 growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In particular, supplementation of 10 g/L laminarin and 10 g/L starch in rich medium resulted in ∼7-fold and ∼4-fold growth promotion respectively compared to cultivation in rich medium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To explore the reasons behind this significant growth promotion by polysaccharide supplementation, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of strain WC36 cultured in rich medium supplemented either with or without 10 g/L laminarin for 5 days and 10 days. In addition to the up-regulation of genes related to glycan transport and degradation, when 10 g/L laminarin was added in the rich medium, the most upregulated genes were phage-associated (e. g. phage integrase, phage portal protein) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). Consistently, RT-qPCR results (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) confirmed upregulation of some genes encoding phage-associated proteins, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>. Therefore, we speculate that the metabolism of polysaccharides in strain WC36 might be closely connected with the phage production.</p>

<title>Polysaccharides induce the production of bacteriophages in <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strain WC36</title>
<p>To test our hypothesis that polysaccharides might induce strain WC36 to release bacteriophages, we grew strain WC36 in rich medium supplemented with or without laminarin or starch and isolated bacteriophages from the cell suspension supernatant according to established standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). Based on the growth curve of strain WC36, we found that the strictly anaerobic WC36 grew much slower than normal aerobic bacteria. Therefore, different to the typical sampling time (24 h) for bacteriophage isolation from other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jiang and Paul, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Weinbauer et al., 1999</xref>), we selected a longer sampling time (10 days) to extract bacteriophages. TEM observation showed that many different shapes of phage-like structures indeed existed in the supernatant of WC36 cells cultured in rich medium supplemented with laminarin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, panels II-IV) or starch (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, panels V-VIII). In contrast, we did not observe any phage-like structures in the supernatant of WC36 cells cultured in rich medium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, panel I) or in different media without culturing bacterial cells (Supplementary Fig. 1A, B). These results suggest that polysaccharides indeed stimulate the production of various bacteriophages from strain WC36. Correspondingly, in the presence of laminarin, different forms of bacteriophages were observed by TEM, with filamentous ones dominant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The length of these filamentous phages was about ∼0.4 μm to ∼8.0 μm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, panel II), and the size of the hexagonal phages was less than 100 nm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, panel IV). In the presence of starch, in addition to filamentous and hexagonal phages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, panels V, VI, and VIII), we also observed a kind of icosahedral <italic>Microviridae</italic>-like phage with a diameter of 25-30 nm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, panel VII).</p>

</fig>
<p>Given that we found bacteriophages in cultures of strain WC36, we next sought to explore whether bacteriophages adhering to bacterial cells could be observed. To this end, we checked the morphology of strain WC36 in the absence or presence of polysaccharides. As expected, with TEM we observed many filamentous phage-like structures around strain WC36 cells cultivated in rich medium supplemented with laminarin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, panel II) and starch (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, panels III-IV). In contrast, we could not find any phage-like structures around strain WC36 cells cultivated either in rich medium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, panel I), in rich medium supplemented with 10 g/L laminarin (Supplementary Fig. 2A) or in 10 g/L starch without culturing bacterial cells (Supplementary Fig. 2B). Moreover, based on TEM observation of ultrathin sections of strain WC36 cultured in medium supplemented with polysaccharide, we even observed filamentous phages that were being released from or entering into host cells via a kind of extrusion or budding structure around bacterial cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, panels II-IV), suggesting that filamentous bacteriophages might be released chronically as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chevallereau et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Liu et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>To further verify the release style of bacteriophages from strain WC36 in the presence of polysaccharide, we prolonged the incubation time of this strain up to 30 days in medium supplemented with 5 g/L or 10 g/L laminarin. Strain WC36 showed stable growth after it entered the stationary phase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The bacterial cells maintained their cell shape intact regardless of the presence of laminarin, indicating their healthy state after for a long time (Supplementary Fig. 3A, panels I-III). Apparently, the replication and release of bacteriophages in strain WC36 did not kill the host cell, consistent with the key feature of chronic bacteriophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Howard-Varona et al., 2017</xref>). With an increase of culture time (5, 10, or 30 days) and laminarin concentration (5 or 10 g/L), the number of released bacteriophages increased (Supplementary Fig. 3A, panels IV-VI; Supplementary Fig. 4, panels IV-IX). Specifically, the average number per microliter of filamentous phages and hexagonal phages extracted from the supernatant of strain WC36 cultured in rich medium supplemented with 10 g/L laminarin for 5, 10, 30 days (around 9.7, 29, 65.3 and 9, 30, 46.7) was higher than those cultured in rich medium supplemented with 5 g/L laminarin for 5, 10, 30 days (around 4.3, 13.7, 35.3 and 4, 11.3, 17.7), respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, C</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition, in the presence of laminarin we observed many extrusions or buddings around bacterial cells (Supplementary Fig. 3B, panels II-III), which are typical cellular structures in host cells used for chronic bacteriophage release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Marvin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Krupovic and Consortium, 2018</xref>). In contrast, phage-like structures with extrusions or buddings were not found in cells of strain WC36 cultivated in rich medium (Supplementary Fig. 3B, panel I). Hence, these results collectively suggest that filamentous phages induced from deep-sea strain WC36 replicate in a chronic manner. However, the morphology and process of hexagonal phages that entry and exit into the WC36 cells were not observed.</p>

<title>Polysaccharides promote the growth of deep-sea <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strain zth2 and induce bacteriophage production</title>
<p>To explore whether the production of bacteriophages induced by polysaccharide is an individual case, we further checked growth promotion and bacteriophage induction by polysaccharide in another cultured deep-sea <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> - strain zth2 - which was isolated by the same polysaccharide degradation-driven strategy as that used for strain WC36. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity calculation using the NCBI server indicated that the closest relative of strain zth2 was strain WC36 (90.4%), which was lower than the threshold sequence identity (94.5%) for distinct genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yarza et al., 2014</xref>). Based on a maximum likelihood tree and similarity of 16S rRNA gene sequences, we propose that strain zth2 and WC36 are the type strains of two different novel genera, both belonging to the <italic>Lentisphaeraceae</italic> family, <italic>Lentisphaerales</italic> order, <italic>Lentisphaeria</italic> class. Consistently, laminarin indeed promoted the growth of strain zth2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Analysis of the differential transcriptome and RTq-PCR of strain zth2 cultured in either unsupplemented medium or with laminarin showed that many genes encoding critical factors associated with the phage life cycle were up-regulated (ranging from 4 to 200 fold) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B, C</xref> and Supplementary Table 2), suggesting that phages might also be involved in the utilization of laminarin by strain zth2, the same as in strain WC36.</p>
<p>To further confirm the existence of bacteriophages in the supernatant of strain zth2 cell suspension cultured in medium supplemented with polysaccharide, we performed bacteriophage isolation from the supernatant of strain zth2 cultures followed by TEM. Indeed, many filamentous-, hexagonal- and icosahedral phages were clearly observed in the culture of strain zth2 grown in the presence of laminarin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, panels I-III) and starch (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, panels IV-V), but not in rich medium short of polysaccharide (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, panel VI). This suggests that bacteriophages were induced by supplementation of polysaccharide to strain zth2.</p>
<p>In addition, transcriptome and RT-qPCR results showed that genes encoding bacterial secretion system-related proteins were up-regulated in strains WC36 (Supplementary Fig. 5A, B) and zth2 (Supplementary Fig. 5C, D) cultured in medium supplemented with laminarin. It has been reported that filamentous phages utilise host cell secretion systems for their own egress from bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Davis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bille et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, the filamentous phages induced from strains WC36 and zth2 might also get in and out of host cells using bacterial secretion systems. Taken together, we conclude that laminarin effectively promotes the growth of deep-sea <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strains WC36 and zth2, and induces the production of bacteriophages. Distinct from previous reports that bacteriophages are induced under traditional conditions such as low temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wang et al., 2007</xref>), mitomycin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mazaheri Nezhad Fard et al., 2010</xref>), and ultraviolet irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">McKay and Baldwin, 1973</xref>), here, we report that polysaccharides induce the production of bacteriophages.</p>

<title>Bacteriophages reprogram the polysaccharide metabolism of <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strains WC36 and zth2</title>
<p>In natural ecosystems, viral infections indirectly influence microbial metabolic fluxes, metabolic reprogramming, and energy homeostasis of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Howard-Varona et al., 2020</xref>). For example, cyanoviruses possess AMGs encoding core photosynthetic reaction centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>) which are highly expressed during infection, thus stimulating photosynthesis and enhancing viral abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lindell et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, we clearly show that polysaccharide effectively promotes bacterial growth and simultaneously induces the production of bacteriophages, suggesting a close relationship between bacteriophages and host polysaccharide metabolism. Therefore, we sought to ask whether bacteriophages could reprogram polysaccharide metabolism in deep-sea bacteria. For this purpose, we sequenced the genomes of the bacteriophages induced by polysaccharides in <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strains WC36 and zth2. Eventually, two assembled genomes (Phage-WC36-1, 8.0 kb; Phage-WC36-2, 28.3 kb) were obtained from the bacteriophages of strain WC36 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, B</xref> and Supplementary Tables 3, 4). Meanwhile, two assembled genomes (Phage-zth2-1, 8.0 kb; Phage-zth2-2, 40.4 kb) were obtained from the phages of strain zth2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, C</xref> 327 and Supplementary Tables 3, 5). Subsequently, we carefully compared the bacteriophage genomes with those of the corresponding hosts (strains WC36 and zth2) using Galaxy Version 2.6.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://galaxy.pasteur.fr/">https://galaxy.pasteur.fr/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Afgan et al., 2018</xref>) with the NCBI BLASTN method and used BWA-mem software for read mapping from host whole genome sequencing (WGS) to these bacteriophages. These analyses both showed that the bacteriophage genomes are completely outside of the host chromosomes, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chevallereau et al., 2022</xref>). Through comparison of genome sequence (Supplementary Fig. 6), IMG database analysis, and phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7), we confirmed that Phage-WC36-1 was the same as Phage-zth2-1 (inoviruses, belonging to the family <italic>Inoviridae</italic>, order <italic>Tubulavirales</italic>, class <italic>Faserviricetes</italic>), indicating that inoviruses might be common in the <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> phylum. Inovirus members were the dominant population in the active group of viruses from deep-sea sediments, and encode some proteins contributing to host phenotypes and ultimately alter the fitness and other behaviors of their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Engelhardt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mai-Prochnow et al., 2015</xref>). A maximum likelihood tree showed that both Phage-WC36-2 and Phage-zth2-2 belonged to the class <italic>Caudoviricetes</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 8). In addition to genes encoding phage-associated proteins within the assembled bacteriophage genomes, there are also many genes encoding proteins associated with polysaccharide transport and degradation. These polysaccharide metabolizing proteins include glycoside hydrolase family 18 protein (GH18, HMM e-value 1.5e-14) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), TonB-system energizer ExbB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Koebnik, 2005</xref>), O-polysaccharide acetyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lunin et al., 2020</xref>), glucosaminidase, glycoside hydrolase family 127 protein (best BLASTP hit e-value 3e-25) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>) and transglycosylase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). These CAZymes (GH18 and GH127) are specifically responsible for degrading polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cantarel et al., 2009</xref>). Energizer ExbB is an important part of the TonB-system, which is often present in <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and responsible for transport of oligosaccharides from the outer membrane into the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Foley et al., 2016</xref>). It is absent in the strain WC36 and zth2 genomes, however. Therefore, these AMGs encoding TonB-system energizer ExbB and glycoside hydrolases might reprogram the polysaccharide metabolism of host cells (strains WC36 and zth2) by providing supplemental support to key metabolic processes. Overall, bacteriophages induced by polysaccharides contain specific AMGs associated with polysaccharide degradation, which may play a key role in the degradation and utilization of polysaccharide by host cells.</p>

<title>Bacteriophages released from <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strain WC36 promote the growth and polysaccharide metabolism of a marine bacterium, <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> 273</title>
<p>Given that the bacteriophages released from <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strain WC36 (named Phages-WC36 in this study) could reprogram bacterial polysaccharide metabolism and thereby promote host growth, we next sought to determine the capability of these bacteriophages to reprogram polysaccharide metabolism and promote growth in other marine bacteria. To this end, we chose a marine bacterium - <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> 273 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wu et al., 2016</xref>) - and tested the potential growth promotion driven by Phages-WC36. Growth assays showed that Phages-WC36 could promote strain 273 growth by assisting its metabolism and utilization of starch (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). In particular, supplementation with Phages-WC36 and 5 g/L starch in basal medium resulted in 6∼10-fold growth promotion compared to basal medium without Phages-WC36 or starch (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). In addition, we observed many filamentous phage and hexagonal phage structures in the supernatant of strain 273 cultivated in basal medium supplemented with 5 g/L starch and Phages-WC36 for 24 h. In contrast, we could not find any phage-like structures in three other types of media. Specifically, the average number of filamentous phages and hexagonal phages extracted from the supernatant of strain 273 cultured in basal medium supplemented with 5 g/L starch and Phages-WC36 (∼44.7 and ∼29, respectively) was higher than that in three other media types (where it was close to zero) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). To test whether Phages-WC36 could infect strain 273, the strain 273 cultivated in basal medium supplemented with 5 g/L starch and Phages-WC36 was inoculated in basal medium and basal medium supplemented with 5 g/L starch for three consecutive times (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). After 3 passages of serial cultivation in basal medium supplemented with 5 g/L starch, we found that filamentous phages (∼45.3, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>) and hexagonal phages (∼21.7, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>) were also present in basal medium supplemented with starch, but not in the basal medium, which may mean that Phages-WC36 could infect strain 273 and starch is an important inducer. Consistently, genes encoding bacterial type II/IV/VI secretion system-related proteins were up-regulated in strain 273 cultured in basal medium supplemented with 5 g/L starch and 20 μl/mL Phages-WC36 in comparison to basal medium with 5 g/L starch (Supplementary Fig. 9). Upregulation of these genes may help filamentous phages get in and out of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Davis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bille et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, the expression of genes encoding the TonB-dependent receptor and CAZymes was upregulated in strain 273 cultured in basal medium supplemented with starch and Phages-WC36 in comparison to basal medium with starch (Supplementary Fig. 10A and Supplementary Table 6) or Phages-WC36 (Supplementary Fig. 10B and Supplementary Table 7). These results suggest that Phages-WC36 proliferate in strain 273 and promote growth by assisting in starch metabolism and utilization. Consequently, we propose that Phages-WC36 might infect other hosts and assist them in degradation and utilization of polysaccharides. This provides stronger evidence that the relationship between Phages-WC36 and their hosts is not a fight to the death between enemies, but in contrast a mutualistic relationship between partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Shkoporov et al., 2022</xref>). Most deep-sea microbes are anaerobic, which limits investigation of bacteriophages in their original host. <italic>P. stutzeri</italic> 273 is a typical aerobic bacterium, and thus our study provides an effective way to replicate deep-sea bacteriophages and perform functional analysis in aerobic heterologous hosts.</p>
<p>In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that polysaccharides induce the production of bacteriophages in <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic> strains WC36 and zth2, and these bacteriophages contain AMGs encoding TonB-system energizer ExbB and CAZymes that assist host metabolism and utilization of polysaccharide, thereby promoting host growth. We also demonstrate that Phages-WC36 could infect and assist a marine strain 273 to utilize polysaccharides, further expanding our understanding of the significant role of deep-sea bacteriophages. Moreover, the study of deep-sea bacteriophages has the potential to provide insight into the molecular evolution of virus-host interactions in prokaryotes.</p>

Bacterial growth was monitored by measuring the OD<sub>600</sub> value via a microplate reader (Infinite M1000 Pro; Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland) every 4 hours until cell growth reached the stationary phase. In addition, phages were extracted from the supernatants of the above four media and their morphology was observed by TEM. In parallel, filamentous phage and hexagonal phage numbers in each condition was respectively calculated by randomly selecting TEM photos.</p>
<p>For transcriptomic analysis, we used cell suspensions of <italic>P. stutzeri</italic> 273 cultured in basal medium supplemented with 20 μl/L Phages-WC36, basal medium supplemented with 5 g/L starch, basal medium supplemented with 5 g/L starch and 20 μl/L Phages-WC36 for 24 hours at 28 °C. These cultures were harvested and sent to Novogene (Tianjin, China) for transcriptome sequencing analysis. The detailed procedures are described in the supplementary information.</p>

<p>This manuscript presents <bold>useful</bold> findings on several phage from deep sea isolates of Lentisphaerae strains WC36 and zth2 that further our understanding of deep sea microbial life. The manuscript's primary claim is that phage isolates augment polysaccharide use in Pseudomonas bacteria via auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs). However, the strength of the evidence is <bold>incomplete</bold> and does not support the primary claims. Namely, there are not data presented to rule out phage contamination in the polysaccharide stock solution, AMGs are potentially misidentified, and there is missing evidence of successful infection.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes the identification and isolation of several phage from deep sea isolates of Lentisphaerae strains WC36 and zth2. The authors observe induction of several putative chronic phages with the introduction of additional polysaccharides to the media. The authors suggest that two of the recovered phage genomes encode AMGs associated with polysaccharide use. The authors also suggest that adding the purified phage to cultures of Pseudomonas stutzeri 273 increased the growth of this bacteria due to augmented polysaccharide use genes from the phage.</p>
<p>While the findings were of interest and relevance to the field, it is my opinion that several of the analysis fall short of supporting the key assertions presented.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Interesting isolate pf deep sea Lentisphaerae strains which will undoubtedly further our understanding of deep sea microbial life.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Many of the findings are consistent with a phage contamination in the polysaccharide stock solution.</p>
<p>The genes presented as AMGs are largely well known and studied phage genes which play a role in infection cycles.</p>
<p>The evidence that the isolated phage can infect Pseudomonas stutzeri 273 is lacking, putting into question the dependent results.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper investigates virus-host interactions in deep-sea bacteriophage systems which employ a seemingly mutualistic approach to viral replication in which the virus aids host cell polysaccharide import and utilization via metabolic reprogramming. The hypothesis being tested is supported with solid and convincing evidence and the findings are potentially generalizable with implications for our understanding of polysaccharide-mediated virus-host interactions and carbon cycles in marine ecosystems more broadly.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper synthesizes sequencing and phylogenic analyses of two Lentisphaerae bacteria and three phage genomes; electron microscopy imaging of bacterial/phage particles; differential gene expression analyses; differential growth curve analyses, and differential phage proliferation assays to extract insights into whether laminarin and starch can induce both host growth and phage proliferation. The data presented convincingly demonstrate that both host culture density and phage proliferation increase as a result having host, phage, and polysaccharide carbon source together in culture.</p>
<p>Weaknesses (suggestions for improvement):</p>
<p>The article would be strengthened by the following additional experiment: providing the phage proteins hypothesized to be aiding host cell growth (red genes from Figure 5...TonB system energizer ExbB, glycosidases, etc) individually or in combination on plasmids rather than within the context of the actual phage itself to see if such additional genes are necessary and sufficient to realize the boosts in host cell growth/saturation levels observed in the presence of the phages tested.</p>
<p>The paper would also benefit from additional experiments focused on determining how the polysaccharide processing, transport, and metabolism genes are being used by the phages to either directly increase viral infection/replication or else to indirectly do so by supporting the growth of the host in a more mutualistic manner (i.e. by improving their ability to import, degrade, and metabolize polysaccharides).</p>
<p>The introduction would benefit from a discussion of what is known regarding phage and/or viral entry pathways that utilize carbohydrate anchors during host entry. The discussion could also be improved by linking the work presented to the concept of &quot;selfishness&quot; in bacterial systems (see for instance Giljan, G., Brown, S., Lloyd, C.C. et al. Selfish bacteria are active throughout the water column of the ocean. ISME COMMUN. 3, 11 (2023) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00219-7">https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-023-00219-7</ext-link>). The bacteria under study are gram negative and it was recently demonstrated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201726">https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201726</ext-link>) that &quot;selfish&quot; bacteria sequester metabolizable polysaccharides in their periplasm to advantage. It is plausible that the phages may be hijacking this &quot;selfishness&quot; mechanism to improve infectivity and ENTRY rather than helping their hosts to grow and profilerate so they can reap the benefits of simply having more hosts to infect. The current work does not clearly distinguish between these two distinct mechanistic possibilities. The paper would be strengthened by at least a more detailed discussion of this possibility as well as the author's rationale for interpreting their data as they do to favor the &quot;mutualistic&quot; interpretation. In the same light, the paper would benefit from a more careful choice of words which can also help to make such a distinction more clear/evident/intentional. As currently written the authors seem to be actively avoiding giving insights wrt this question.</p>
<p>Finally, I would be interested to know if the author's sequencing datasets might be used to inform the question raised above by using bacterial immunity systems such as CRISPR/Cas9. For example, if the phage systems studied are truly beneficial/mutualistic for the bacteria then it's less likely that there would be evidence of targeted immunity against that particular phage that has the beneficial genes that support polysaccharide metabolism.</p>
