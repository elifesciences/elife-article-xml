<title>Abstract</title><p>Nervous systems coordinate effectors across the body during movements. We know little about the cellular-level structure of synaptic circuits for such body-wide control. Here we describe the whole-body synaptic connectome of a segmented larva of the marine annelid <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic>. We reconstructed and annotated over 9,000 neuronal and non-neuronal cells in a whole-body serial electron microscopy dataset. Differentiated cells were classified into 202 neuronal and 92 non-neuronal cell types. We analyse modularity, multisensory integration, left-right and intersegmental connectivity and motor circuits for ciliated cells, glands, pigment cells and muscles. We identify several segment-specific cell types, demonstrating the heteromery of the annelid larval trunk. At the same time, segmentally repeated cell types across the head, the trunk segments and the pygidium suggest the serial homology of all segmental body regions. We also report descending and ascending pathways, peptidergic circuits and a multi-modal mechanosensory girdle. Our work provides the basis for understanding whole-body coordination in an entire segmented animal.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nervous systems coordinate behaviour, physiology and development through synaptic and neuroendocrine signalling. Signalling occurs specifically between groups of cells, organised into multilayered networks with precise synaptic and neuromodulatory connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bentley et al., 2016</xref>). Mapping such synaptic and chemical networks in blocks of neural tissue is the central aim of cellular-level connectomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Helmstaedter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Morgan and Lichtman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Williams et al., 2017</xref>). For synaptic networks, connectomics requires volume imaging by serial electron microscopy (serial EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Schlegel et al., 2017</xref>). The comprehensive analysis of whole-body coordination of actions by synaptic circuits would benefit from the cellular-level mapping of entire nervous and effector systems. Whole-animal synaptic connectomes have so far only been described for the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cook et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">White et al., 1986</xref>) and the tadpole larva of the ascidian <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ryan et al., 2016</xref>). Circuits spanning the entire central nervous system (CNS) have also been reconstructed in the larval CNS of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Carreira-Rosario et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Miroschnikow et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>) and in the three-day-old larva of the annelid <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bezares-Calderón et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Randel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Verasztó et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, whole-brain connectomics has become possible in the larval and adult fly brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Franconville et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Winding et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we report the complete synaptic connectome and the cell-type complement of a three-day-old larva (nectochaete stage) of the marine annelid <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic>. This larval stage has three trunk segments, adult and larval eyes, segmental ciliary bands and a well-developed somatic musculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jasek et al., 2022</xref>). The larvae show several behaviours, including visual phototaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Randel et al., 2014</xref>), UV avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Verasztó et al., 2018</xref>), a startle response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bezares-Calderón et al., 2018</xref>) and coordinated ciliary activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Verasztó et al., 2017</xref>). Three-day-old larvae do not yet have sensory palps and other sensory appendages (cirri), they do not feed and lack visceral muscles and an enteric nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brunet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Williams et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>Platynereis</italic> larvae, it has been possible to integrate behaviour with synapse-level maps, transgenic labelling of individual neurons, activity imaging and gene knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bezares-Calderón et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jokura et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Verasztó et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">2017</xref>). Cellular-resolution gene expression atlases have also been developed for different larval stages. These can increasingly be integrated with single-cell transcriptomic atlases and synaptic circuit maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Achim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Vergara et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Vergara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Williams et al., 2017</xref>). The registration of a gene expression atlas to a whole-body low-resolution EM volume in the six-day-old <italic>Platynereis</italic> larva has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Vergara et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>We previously reported synaptic connectomes for several whole-body circuits from a transmission EM volume of a three-day-old larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Randel et al., 2015</xref>). These include the visual, startle, ciliomotor, nuchal organ, and neurosecretory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bezares-Calderón et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Randel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shahidi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Verasztó et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Williams et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we report the complete synaptic connectome and the cell-type complement from the same volume of a three-day-old <italic>Platynereis</italic> larva. Recently we also reported the desmosomal connectome and motoneuron innervation of the somatic musculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jasek et al., 2022</xref>) and a preprint of a preliminary analysis of the synaptic connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Verasztó et al., 2020</xref>) that this work supersedes. The full connectome reconstruction has now allowed us to uncover several new circuits and to consider all circuits in a whole-body context. We also found several neurons that span the entire length of the larva, highlighting the strength of a whole-body dataset. These cells and their circuits allow us to generate hypotheses on how whole-body coordination may be achieved by the larval nervous system. The connectome also allows us to address long-standing hypotheses about the origin of the segmented annelid body-plan and explore patterns of circuit evolution.</p>

<p>We skeletonised cells containing projections or having an elongated morphology including muscle cells, glia and neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, D</xref>). During skeletonisation, interconnected nodes are placed in the neurite cross-section profiles of the same neuron across layers. The skeletons are grown until all branches of a neuron have been traced. The individual nodes can be tagged and the skeletons named and multiply annotated. For all neuronal skeletons, we also identified and marked synaptic sites as connectors. Connectors link a node of a presynaptic skeleton to a node of a postsynaptic skeleton partner. Synapses were recognised as presynaptic vesicle clusters at the membrane with no postsynaptic specialisations, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Randel et al., 2014</xref>). Synapses are monoadic, connecting one presynaptic neuron to one postsynaptic cell. Querying all skeletons and synaptic connectors allowed us to derive the synaptic connectome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). We did not identify any gap junctions.</p>

<p>The skeletons across the volume comprised 5,661,050 nodes and had 28,717 presynaptic and 27,538 postsynaptic sites. We could not attach 15,020 fragments (896,428 nodes) to a skeleton with a soma. These fragments contained 4,122 presynaptic and 5,304 postsynaptic sites. Most of the fragments represent short skeletons of twigs (median length 1.04 µm)(<xref rid="figs1f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) that could not be traced across gaps or low-quality layers. Overall, 15.8% of all nodes, 14.4% of presynaptic, and 19.3% of postsynaptic sites are on fragments and not assigned to a cell with a soma.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Neuroanatomy and neuropils</title>
<p>The <italic>Platynereis</italic> larval nervous system is subdivided into an anterior brain and a rope-ladder-like paired ventral nerve cord (VNC). The brain and VNC are connected by circumesophageal connectives (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, F-H</xref>). The trunk has five segments, an anterior cryptic segment (segment 0)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Steinmetz et al., 2011</xref>), three main segments (segments 1-3) with parapodia, and a posterior pygidium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>).</p>
<p>Morphological rendering of all synapses in the volume highlights the overall organisation of neuropils and motor nerves. In the brain, sensory, inter- and motoneurons synapse in partly overlapping regions, with sensory neuron synapses occurring more anteriorly. In the head as well as the VNC, motor synapses mark the periphery (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-H</xref>).</p>
<p>The VNC also has an organised neuropil architecture. Sensory neurons in the trunk only have ipsilateral projections that concentrate in two ventro-lateral bundles in the VNC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I-K</xref>). Interneurons have either ipsi- or contralateral projections that remain in the VNC neuropil and also concentrate ventrally in the VNC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>). Motoneurons can have ipsilateral and contralateral projections and are the only neuron class with peripheral afferent projections (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). Motor nerves concentrate dorsally in the VNC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>), close to the basal lamina and mesodermal muscles.</p>
<p>Neurons have a median cable length of 97.1 µm (sensory neurons: 101.6 µm; interneurons: 87.77 µm, motoneurons: 139.8 µm)(<xref rid="figs1f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and the largest neurons (Ser-tr1 and Loop) a cable length of 1.2-1.7 mm.</p>
<p>Neurons have a median of 8 outgoing (presynpatic) and 6 incoming (postsynaptic) synaptic sites with the largest neurons (MC, Ser-tr1, Loop) with over 300 outgoing synapses (<xref rid="figs1f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The relative ratio of incoming and outgoing sites distinguishes sensory, inter- and motoneurons, with sensory neurons having relatively more outgoing synapses (<xref rid="figs1f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>The number of outgoing and incoming synaptic sites and skeleton segments scales with the total cable length of skeletons with Pearson’s correlation coefficients &gt;0.7 (<xref rid="figs1f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F-H</xref>).</p>
<p>Most neuronal trees are unipolar and not highly branched (&lt;100 segments; <xref rid="figs1f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>). Neurons in general do not have primary cilia. Sensory neurons are bipolar with an axon and a sensory dendrite bearing zero to five sensory cilia at its proximal tip, showing different sensory specialisations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bezares-Calderón et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Williams et al., 2017</xref>). Interneurons are unipolar or pseudo-unipolar. Ciliomotor neurons have two motor axons emanating from the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Verasztó et al., 2017</xref>), other motoneurons are unipolar.</p>

<title>Derivation and network analysis of the whole-body synaptic connectome</title>
<p>To define a whole-body synaptic connectome for the larva, we comprehensively identified synapses by traversing the volume and each skeleton multiple times (32,381 synapses). Synapses were connected to the pre- and postsynaptic skeletons (one to one, as synapses are monoadic). We then retrieved all synapses and their pre- and postsynaptic skeletons and derived a graph (6,725 graph nodes or vertices). From this graph, nodes with less than three connections were removed. The final synaptic connectome contains 2,675 nodes (including 467 fragments) connected by 14,066 directed edges formed by 26,881 in-graph synapses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The connectome is a sparsely-connected network with a graph density of 0.00197.</p>
<p>In the graph, the majority of source nodes (nodes with only outgoing edges) are sensory neurons, sink nodes (nodes with only incoming edges) are mostly effector cells (<xref rid="figs2f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The nodes with the highest degree included ciliomotor neurons (e.g. Loop, Ser-tr1)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bezares-Calderón et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Verasztó et al., 2017</xref>), the sensory-motoneuron pygPBunp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Verasztó et al., 2017</xref>), and the motoneurons of exocrine glands (MNspinning, see below). Some of the strongest edges (highest number of synapses) were between the pigment-cell motoneuron cioMNcover and prototroch pigment cells, MNspinning and exocrine glands, and the previously described MC cell and ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Verasztó et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify more strongly connected subgraphs within the connectome, we used community detection with the Leiden algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Traag et al., 2019</xref>). This analysis combined with force-field-based clustering highlighted several modules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>). Nodes in a module are more strongly interconnected than to nodes in other modules (<xref rid="figs2f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We named the modules based on their primary effector organs or other dominant anatomical characters. We would like to note that this analysis can recover varying numbers of modules depending on the resolution parameter (<xref rid="figs2f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The selected resolution parameter subdivides the network into communities that we think best represent functional units.</p>
<p>The modules include the anterior neurosecretory centre, the mushroom bodies, the visual circuit, a network of ciliomotor neurons, a module innervating head pigment cells, a left and right mechanosensory module providing input to muscles and segmental exocrine glands, a module for trunk postural control, and five muscle-motor modules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The modules contain neurons that project to distinct neuropil domains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>—figure supplement 5) and likely correspond to functional units. The visual module contains neurons of the eyes and primary visual neuropil (PRC, IN1, INint, INton) previously shown to mediate visual phototaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Randel et al., 2014</xref>). The ciliomotor module contains ciliary band cells and functionally related neurons that show coordinated activity and drive ciliary closures and beating (Ser-tr1, Loop, MNant) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Verasztó et al., 2017</xref>). The anterior neurosecretory centre includes anterior and dorsal sensory neurons, the ciliary photoreceptors and their postsynaptic circuit including the INRGWa and INNOS interneurons as well as the Ser-h1 and MC ciliomotors with their prototroch targets. Neurons in this module mediate barotaxis and UV avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Calderón et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jokura et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Verasztó et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The modules are also interconnected among themselves suggesting crosstalk. Most sensory neurons occur in the visual, the two mechanosensory, the mushroom body and the anterior neurosecretory modules (<xref rid="figs2f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J</xref>). In a Sankey network diagram representing information flow, these modules are upstream of the motor-dominated pigmentmotor, ciliomotor, and musclemotor modules (<xref rid="figs2f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>Cell-type classification and neuronal diversity</title>
<p>In the volume, each skeleton was multiply annotated. Neurons and non-neuronal cells were categorised into classes (sensory, inter- and motoneurons, muscle, gland etc.) and further subdivided into cell types.</p>
<p>For classifying neurons into cell types, we used a combination of five morphological and connectivity criteria: i) position of cell somata, ii) the morphology of neurite projections (e.g. branching pattern, decussating, ascending or descending), iii) the ultrastructure of sensory specialisations (e.g. number and type of cilia, microvilli — for sensory neurons only), iv) neuropeptide content as determined by the siGOLD immunolabelling method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shahidi et al., 2015</xref>), and v) synaptic connectivity. Most cell types show left-right symmetry except for a few asymmetric or midline neurons (e.g. SN_YF5cil, pygPBunp).</p>
<p>Based on these criteria, we classified 966 neurons into 202 cell types (Supplementary Table 1, Video 1, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Most neuronal cell types are represented by only two cells in the entire body (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

<p>We also categorised the remaining 8,196 cells in the larva. Of these, 3128 were classified into 92 non-neuronal cell types (Supplementary Table 1, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> —figure supplement 1).</p>
<p>These included epidermal cells (1334 cells), various pigment cells (158 cells of 7 types), muscle cells (853 cells of 53 types, described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jasek et al., 2022</xref>)), locomotor ciliated cells (80 cells of 6 types, described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Verasztó et al., 2017</xref>)), glial cells (78 cells of 3 types), gland cells (54 cells of 6 types), various support and sheet cells, nephridia, putative migratory cells, parapodial cells producing chitin chaetae (106 cells) or aciculae (12 cells), and the follicle cells (566 cells of 5 types) ensheathing them (Supplementary Table 1; Video 1; <xref rid="figs3f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, we defined 18 broader neuronal cell groups, containing neurons of similar morphology (e.g. head decussating neurons) but in either differentiated or immature state (e.g. immature palp sensory neurons).</p>
<p>The annotations are hierarchical and cell groups can contain one or more differentiated cell types (Supplementary Table 1). The remaining 5,068 cells are either dividing cells (68 cells), undifferentiated cells that putatively belong to the neuronal lineage (1597 cells) and various developing neurons with projections but no or only very few synapses (2457). These cells were not classified into cell types.</p>
<p>The developing antennae contain 115 cells of which the majority have only few or no synapses and immature sensory dendrites. In the developing palps, we found 82 developing sensory neurons. The developing mouth or stomodeum (675 cells) is lined with 52 immature sensory neurons.</p>
<p>All cells were annotated in CATMAID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Saalfeld et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016</xref>) with information representing the above categories. We also annotated all cells based on their soma position in the body (e.g. left or right side, segment 0-3, germ layer etc.)(<xref rid="figs3f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These annotations were used to query the data and visualise subsets of cells.</p>
<p>Supplementary Table 1 lists all neuronal and non-neuronal cell types, their main annotations, including morphological, cell-class, segment, ganglion or sensory organ, neurotransmitter and neuropeptide phenotype, and main synaptic partners. We also listed all literature references for previously published neuronal and non-neuronal cells and indicated which cells are reported here for the first time (105 cell types out of 294).</p>
<p>Querying by two or more annotations allows tallying the number of cells in different category (e.g. number of sensory cells with a single penetrating cilium or the number of gland cells in a particular segment)(<xref rid="figs3f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Left-right cell-type pairs have similar arbor morphologies (<xref rid="figs3f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The similar branching patterns for left and right cells of the same type is also indicated by their similar average Sholl diagrams (<xref rid="figs3f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Left-right pairs also have projections at symmetrical positions in the VNC indicating neuropil stereotypy (<xref rid="figs3f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Outgoing and incoming synapses in a neuron can be intermingled or spatially segregated. Interneurons can have mixed or spatially segregated input-output compartments. Most motoneurons have spatially segregated input-output compartments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L-Q</xref> and <xref rid="figs3f7" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>, 8).</p>

<p>This cell-type connectome included 84 sensory, 82 interneurons, 34 motoneuron types and 58 effector cell types (including ciliary band, muscle, gland and pigmented cell types)(<xref rid="figs4f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The cell-type graph had 2,410 edges formed by 14,640 synapses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>The correlation of the left and right synapse matrices was 0.91, indicating a high level of stereotypy of connectivity (<xref rid="figs4f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref rid="figs4f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p>
<p>The cell-type graph is characterised by network parameters similar to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> connectome graphs (<xref rid="figs4f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting a similar overall circuit organisation at the level of cell types, but with an order of magnitude more cells in <italic>Platynereis</italic>.</p>
<p>To explore sensory-motor pathways in the grouped graph, we searched for the shortest directed paths from all sensory neurons to all effector cells. We identified four sensory neurons with direct motor output (sensory-motor neurons: eyespot-PRCR3, pygPBunp, pygCirrusPUSM, hPU2l-asymPDF) and 25 premotor sensory neurons. The maximum number of hops from sensory neurons to an effector is five. 33 sensory neurons have no synaptic paths to effectors. 19 of these are neurosecretory cells with few or no synaptic partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Williams et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="figs4f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). For a graph-based visualisation of information flow, we arranged the nodes according to their relative ratio of incoming and outgoing synapses (<xref rid="figs4f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). This layout indicates that sensory-evoked activity propagates from sensory neurons through interneurons and motoneurons to effectors.</p>

<p>We annotated 11 cholinergic, 3 serotonergic, 1 dopaminergic, 1 adrenergic, and 4 glutamatergic neuronal cell types. In addition, we assigned one of 12 neuropeptides to 38 cell types (pigment dispersing factor — 12, allatotropin/orexin — 5, leucokinin — 1, proenkephalin — 1, FVamide — 5, FMRFamide — 3, myoinhibitory peptide — 3, achatin — 1, RGWamide — 1, MLD/pedal peptide — 1, IRP2 — 1, WLD — 1). Neuropeptides occur in sensory, motor and interneurons.</p>
<p>In agreement with the large number of neuropeptides expressed in the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Conzelmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shahidi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Williams et al., 2017</xref>), 516 connectome neurons contained dense core vesicles, indicative of peptidergic transmission (<xref rid="figs5f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>We highlight cellular and sensory-effector circuit examples for PDF, leucokinin and allatotropin/orexin neuropeptides (<xref rid="figs5f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

<title>Brain ganglia, neuropils, cell types and circuits</title>
<p>The annelid nervous system has a ganglionic architecture. In the head of the <italic>Platynereis</italic> larva, the different head sensory neurons form several ganglionic clusters, including a median-dorsal sensory cluster, an apical organ, a dorso-lateral sensory cluster, the adult eyes and nuchal organs, the antennae, the palps, and the ventro-lateral mushroom bodies (Video 2; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). These distinct sensory cell clusters project to distinct neuropils in the centre of the brain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-C</xref>). A few sensory cell types are more scattered in the ventro-median head (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). The interneuron somata form clusters in the mushroom bodies, in the eye and dorso-lateral clusters, the apical organ, and in the ventro-median domain of the brain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).

<p>The cell-type annotation and connectivity information for all differentiated neurons allowed us to investigate the cellular composition and circuitry of the different head ganglia and cell types.</p>
<p>Information flows from various sensory neuron clusters to head interneurons that converge on ciliomotor, head ventral motoneuron (vMNs), and head descending interneuron groups (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>).

<p>Another motor output from the head is two types of exocrine glands in the first segment (ciliatedGland, MVgland). These are innervated by two MNgland-head gland-motor neurons. The MNgland-head cells receive input from the rhythmically active serotonergic Ser-h1 ciliomotor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Verasztó et al., 2017</xref>) suggesting a link between ciliary activity and glandular secretion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, several head ciliomotor neurons directly innervate locomotor ciliary bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Verasztó et al., 2017</xref>) (MC, Ser-h1, MNant, vMN). Of these, the MNant cells receive direct input from several head sensory neurons (SNhook, SNtorii, SNantler, SNhorn)(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). The vMN and MNant motoneurons thus seem to integrate multiple direct sensory and other inputs.</p>
<p>Sensory integration also characterises the visual system. Here, the visual eye photoreceptors (PRC) share a postsynaptic interneuron (INR) with the PRCR1 photoreceptors of the eyespots (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G-H</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify neurons with possible integrative function, we ranked cells by the number of presynaptic and postsynaptic cell-type-level partners. We also ranked cells by various node-centrality measures including node weighted degree, pagerank, betweenness and authority (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J, K</xref>; <xref rid="figs7f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The MNant and vMN motoneurons have among the highest number of presynaptic partners. Among the interneurons, INRGW, INarc1 and INW integrate the largest number of inputs.</p>
<p>Regarding the multiplicity of outputs, the head collar receptor neurons (hCR) that mediate a startle response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bezares-Calderón et al., 2018</xref>) stand out with the largest number of postsynaptic cell types.</p>
<p>Some sensory neurons directly connect to muscle-motor, ciliomotor or pigment-motor neurons (e.g. eyespotPRC_R3, MS cells, SNhook, SNblunt) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></p>
<p>—figure supplement1, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>) or to effector cells (e.g. eyespotPRC_R3, hPU2l_asymPDF)(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, <xref rid="figs4f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Analysis of connectivity (&gt;2 synapses) only between head sensory and interneurons revealed a skewed distribution with many sensory neurons only synapsing on one interneuron type and many interneurons only receiving input from one sensory neuron type (<xref rid="figs7f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>).</p>
<p>At the other end of the distribution, the head CR neurons have eight and SNlasso have five types of postsynaptic interneuron partners, suggesting that these cells recruit extended downstream circuits (<xref rid="figs7f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A, E</xref>).</p>
<p>Some interneurons and motoneurons are directly postsynaptic to several distinct sensory neuron types (up to 9, &gt;2 synapses)(<xref rid="figs7f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Among the interneurons, INRGWa, INarc1 and INcrossbow have &gt;4 presynaptic sensory neuron partners.

<p>The interneurons with the highest number of presynaptic interneuron partners are the INW cells (<xref rid="figs7f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 3D</xref>).

<p>The mushroom bodies (MBs) are formed by a pair of ventrolateral brain ganglia. They comprise both sensory and interneurons (SNMB and INMB)(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A-D</xref>). Most SNMB cells project to two lateral MB neuropils and a few to the anterior neurosecretory plexus (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>), in agreement with the projection reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Vergara et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>We classified INMBs into intrinsic (MBintrIN) and output projection (MBON) types (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C-D</xref>). MBintrINs project to the MB neuropils, MBONs project ventrally to the VNC or to the developing mouth (stomodeum)(<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C-G</xref>; Video 3).</p>
<p>Besides MB-intrinsic sensory neurons, MBs receive sensory input from the antennae, the palps and two further sensory neuron types (SNbronto, SNstiff) (Figure9A-D). These sensory inputs are mostly to the MBONs. SNMBs connect to MBINs, central brain interneurons and the MNant ciliomotor neurons (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). There is cell-type-specific connectivity between sensory neuron types and interneurons, with groups organised into specific micro-circuits (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B, E-G</xref>, <xref rid="figs9f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). MBINs connect to distinct central brain interneuron or projection-neuron types that in turn provide distinct inputs to trunk circuits (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9H-Q</xref>, <xref rid="figs9f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 9—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>), including motor innervation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9O</xref>).</p>

<p>The morphology and connectivity of distinct mushroom body cell types shows left-right symmetry. The Sholl diagrams are similar for left-right pairs and the correlation coefficient of the left and right connectivity matrices is 0.76 (<xref rid="figs9f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The outputs of the mushroom body circuits also include projection neurons of the central brain, including the INW, INlasso, INproT2 and INdecussHook neurons (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9H-Q</xref>). Among these the INproT2 neurons are premotor neurons synapsing on trunk MNring motoneurons, indicating a shallow sensory-motor organisation of mushroom-body outputs.</p>
<p>The overall architecture of the <italic>Platynereis</italic> MB is multilayer, parallel and feed-forward, with only very weak recurrent connections or lateral connections between the feed-forward networks (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>; <xref rid="figs9f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). The circuit also shows a fan-out fan-in architecture, with the sensory neurons diverging to several IN targets (e.g. SNtorii to INtorii, INbigloop and INhorn) and post-MB interneurons receiving converging input (e.g. INW from INhook, INlasso, INMBtype5-6, and SNlasso). This multilayer perceptron architecture may support the formation of associative memories, as proposed for memory circuits in cephalopods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shomrat et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>There are 138 brain neurons that descend to the VNC and 75 VNC neurons that ascend to the brain (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10C, D</xref>). There are 549 trunk connectome cells that receive synapses from head neurons and 288 head connectome cells that receive synapses from trunk neurons (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10E, G</xref>).</p>
<p>The trunk-projecting brain neurons have either a decussating or ipsilaterally descending morphology. The two types project to different domains of the VNC and have different target neurons (<xref rid="figs10f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 10—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). Decussating and descending neurons receive most of their incoming synapses in the central head neuropil and form most of their outgoing synapses in the VNC (<xref rid="figs10f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 10—figure supplement 1C, D, H-M</xref>).</p>
<p>Ranking head neurons by the number of synapses on trunk targets highlights the strong motor connections of the INrope MB projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bezares-Calderón et al., 2018</xref>) and the ventral head motoneurons (vMNs)(<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10F</xref>). The MNant and MNgland-head neurons also innervate trunk effectors (ciliary band and gland cells, respectively). The other head projection neurons predominantly connect to trunk interneurons (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10F</xref>).</p>
<p>Trunk targets of head neurons can be distributed across segments 1-3 (INrope, MN1, MN2) and also reach the most posterior pygidium (MN3) or occur mostly in segment 1 (most head SN and INs with trunk connections)(<xref rid="figs10f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The strongest inputs from trunk neurons to the head are provided by the cioMNcover, pygPBunp and MC3cover pigment-motor neurons and the Loop and Ser-tr1 ciliomotor neurons. Other contacts are formed mostly between trunk and head interneurons (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10H</xref>).</p>
<p>Plotting head-to-trunk connectivity by cell class (sensory, inter, motor neurons and effectors) (<xref rid="figs10f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 10—figure supplement 3</xref>) shows the relative strengths of the connections.</p>
<p>A similar analysis for left-to-right cell groups highlights the strong connectivity between the two body sides across all cell classes (<xref rid="figs10f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 10—figure supplement 4</xref>). For example, left-side eyespot-PRCR3, SNantlerPDF, and SNMIP-vc sensory neurons synapse on right-side MN1 and MN3 motoneurons, INrope interneurons synapse on both left and right MNspinning mononeurons, and mononeurons form similar number of synapses on left- and right-side partners (<xref rid="figs10f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 10—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Intersegmental connectivity</title>
<p>Next, we analysed the neuronal complement and interconnectivity of the body segments.</p>
<p>The three-day-old larva has three main trunk segments with chaeta-bearing parapodia (chaetigerous segments) and a more anterior cryptic segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Steinmetz et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, the pygidium forms the posterior-most part of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Starunov et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A</xref>).

</fig>
<p>Breaking down connections to segments (head, sg0-3, pygidium) or to cell classes (SN, IN, MN, effector) and segments shows that the strongest connections are formed within segments but there are also connections between any pair of segments with the exception of segment 0 (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B-D, F, G</xref>; <xref rid="figs11f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). Segment 1 interneurons, for example, connect to cells in four other body regions (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11G</xref>). In agreement with this, morphological rendering of cells per segment reveals long-range projections beyond the boundary of each segment (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11H-K</xref>). The head, segment 1 and the pygidium all contain neurons that project along the entire length of the body (neurons with ‘global reach’)(<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11L-N</xref>).</p>
<p>The innervation of different effector classes shows segment-selectivity. Ciliary band cells receive most of their innervation from the head and first segment (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11E</xref>). Gland cells receive most of their synapses from the second segment. Muscles are innervated by motoneurons with somas in the head and segments 1-3. In contrast, pigment cells receive their inputs predominantly from pygidial neurons (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11E</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, intersegmental connectivity is a hallmark of the <italic>Platynereis</italic> larval nervous system and suggests that motor control and behaviour cannot be understood by focusing on a single segment or the brain alone.</p>

<title>Segment-specific cell types and circuits in the trunk</title>

<p>These distinct sets of neurons suggest a functional specialisation of the different trunk segments and are in agreement with segmental differences in the expression of developmental transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Vergara et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The segment-specific cell types form unique motor circuits. The first segment contains ciliomotor neurons involved in body-wide ciliary closures and beating (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Verasztó et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, segment-1-specific inter- and motoneurons have extensive connections with other trunk and head cell types (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12D</xref>), including sensory inputs and motor outputs.</p>
<p>Segment 2 contains a unique pair of giant motoneurons (MNspinning) that extensively innervate the contralateral spinning glands (spinGland) in the second and third segments (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12E, F</xref>). The four spinGland cells have a large microvillar secretory pore at the tip of the ventral parapodia (neuropodia). MNspinning cells form reciprocal connections with pseudounipolar INsplit mechanosensory interneurons (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12I</xref>). Segment 2 also contains the large contra- and ipsilaterally projecting MNbow motoneurons and four types of unique interneurons (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12G, H</xref>).</p>
<p>The pygidium (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12J</xref>) contains several unique cell types with global reach (<xref rid="figs12f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 12—figure supplement 3</xref>). The cioMNcover and pygPBunp motoneurons innervate the head cover cells (with large pigment vacuoles) that occur in two rings anterior and posterior to the head protoroch ciliary band (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12J, K</xref>). The pygPBunp neuron also synapses on another head pigmented cell type (vacuolar-cell). Pygidial cells also form connections with segment 1-3 sensory, inter- and motoneurons.</p>
<p>Ranking trunk and pygidial cell types by various network centrality measures often identified segment-specific cells as strongly connected (e.g. pygPBunp, Ser-tr1, Loop)(<xref rid="figs12f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 12—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The global projections of two mechanosensory interneuron types — INsplitPBant and INsplitPB-RF/Ya — outline the axon tracts of the mechanosensory girdle (Video 4; <xref rid="figs14f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 14—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The projections of several other neurons follow this axonal tract and form a bundle at the ventral side of the VNC (<xref rid="figs14f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 14—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The analysis of axon tracts and connectivity allowed us to identify further sensory cell types that are part of the mechanosensory girdle.

<p>The interneurons in the girdle include various INsplit cells (see below) as well as the pygidial ascending INasc-pyg and the head descending INrope neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bezares-Calderón et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="figs14f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 14—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Chaetal mechanoreceptors</title>
<p>The trunk neurons with the largest number of postsynaptic partners and the highest weighted degree in the grouped connectome are the chaeMech chaetal mechanoreceptor neurons (<xref rid="figs12f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 12—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The chaeMechs are part of the mechanosensory girdle and are dendritic sensory cells in segments 1-3 in both the dorsal (notopodium) and the ventral (neuropodium) lobes of the parapodia (Video 5). The sensory dendrites of chaeMech cells branch between the chaetal sacs (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Figure 15A-D</xref>) and may sense the displacement of the chaetae during crawling (proprioception) or due to external mechanical stimuli. The annelids <italic>Harmothoë</italic> (a polynoid) and <italic>Nereis</italic> (a nereid) have cells with a similar morphology called bristle receptors. These cells show rapidly adapting spikes upon the displacement of the chaetae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dorsett, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Horridge, 1963</xref>). The chaeMech cells are also reminiscent of dendritic proprioceptors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae that sense body-wall deformations and provide feedback about body position through premotor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vaadia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zarin et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>Harmothoë</italic> and <italic>Nereis</italic>, the bristle receptors connect to the giant axon system. In <italic>Platynereis</italic>, chaeMech neurons are highly interconnected. They project into the VNC where inputs and output are mixed on the chaeMech axons (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Figure 15B</xref>).</p>
<p>The direct postsynaptic partners of chaeMech cells include the premotor interneurons INsplitCR, INsplitBronto, INchaeMech and the MNring and MNspinning motoneurons (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Figure 15E, F</xref>). The innervation of MNspinning by chaeMech (and also indirectly by PB mechanosensory neurons; <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12I</xref>) suggests that parapodial mechanosensation may regulate glandular secretion of the spinGlands.</p>
<p>Among the direct targets of chaeMech neurons, the INsplitCR interneurons receive the largest number of chaeMech synapses (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Figure 15E</xref>). These neurons are also postsynaptic to the collar receptors (CR) that mediate a hydrodynamic startle response characterised by parapodial elevation and the extension of the chaetae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bezares-Calderón et al., 2018</xref>). At the same time chaeMech do not or only weakly synapse on INrope and INCM neurons, which are one of the main targets of CRs and INchaeMech neurons lack synaptic inputs from CRs. This shows that the postsynaptic circuits of CRs and chaeMechs are only partially overlapping. The shared innervation of INsplitCR by CRs and chaeMechs suggests that there may be proprioceptive inhibitory feedback during the startle response provided by chaeMechs through the INsplitCR cells.</p>

<p>The strongest postsynaptic partners of the diverse girdle mechanosensory neurons are ipsilateral interneurons with a bifurcating projection (presudounipolar morphology). This family of interneurons — collectively referred to as INsplit — could be subdivided into several distinct cell types (INsplitCR, INsplitPB, INsplitPBant, INsplitPB-RF/Ya, INsplitPUh, INsplitBronto, INCM)(<xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Figure 16A-H</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bezares-Calderón et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<p>INsplit neurons occur in all four trunk segments and in the head (INsplitPUh) and the distinct types have unique synaptic connectivity. PB and interparaPM neurons specifically target INsplitPB and represent their main input (<xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Figure 16B, E</xref>). SNbronto and chaeMech neurons both synapse on the INsplitBronto interneurons (<xref rid="fig15" ref-type="fig">Figure 15E, F</xref>, <xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Figure 16C</xref>), which have no other major presynaptic partners. CR and chaeMech neurons synapse on INsplitCR (<xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Figure 16A</xref>) while CR neurons also target INCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bezares-Calderón et al., 2018</xref>). Some head PU neurons synapse on INsplitPUh (<xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Figure 16D</xref>).</p>
<p>Among trunk neuron types, INsplitCR and INsplitPB cells are highly ranked based on the number of pre- and postsynaptic partners, suggesting an integrating function (<xref rid="figs12f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 12—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>
<p>INsplit neurons are premotor neurons, with connections to several trunk motoneuron types that in turn innervate glands, ciliated cells, muscles and pigment cells (<xref rid="fig16" ref-type="fig">Figure 16I</xref>, <xref rid="figs16f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 16—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mechanosensory neurons thus provide input to all effector systems in the body.</p>

<sec id="s3a">
<title>A whole-body resource for <italic>Platynereis</italic></title>
<p>Here we described a whole-body connectome for the segmented three-day-old larva of the marine annelid <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic>. <italic>Platynereis</italic> is the third species for which such a whole-body resource is available, after <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cook et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ryan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">White et al., 1986</xref>). The power of such whole-body approaches lies in their comprehensive nature encompassing not only the nervous system but also all effectors and other cells. Overall, we identified, annotated and spatially mapped 294 cell types and a total of 9,162 cells.</p>
<p><italic>Platynereis</italic> is distinguished from the nematode and tunicate larval connectomes by the complexity of its nervous and effector systems. The nervous system contains an order of magnitude more neurons. The effector system is multi-modal, and includes muscles, locomotor multiciliated cells, glands and pigment cells. The musculature is composed of 53 distinct muscle cell-types, is segmental, and extends to the parapodia that are supported by a chitin-based endoskeleton (aciculae) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jasek et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Organisation of the connectome</title>
<p>The overall organisation of the nervous system is feed-forward, with information flow from a large diversity of sensors through interneurons to effectors. Most sensory-motor connections are relatively shallow, including direct sensory-motor neurons. However, we identified many areas of recurrent connectivity suggesting internal processing beyond sensory-motor arcs. One example is the ciliomotor system that is driven by a rhythmic pacemaker circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Verasztó et al., 2017</xref>). The endogenous activity generated by this circuit is modified by sensory inputs such as hydrostatic pressure or UV light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Calderón et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jokura et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>We also identified several potential sites of multisensory integration suggesting extensive cross-talk between distinct channels of sensory processing. One experimentally characterised example is a cross-talk between phototaxis and UV avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Verasztó et al., 2018</xref>). We have now found that the eyespot R1 and adult eye photoreceptors converge on the INR interneurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G, H</xref>). This suggests a further layer of integration of light-sensory pathways. The connectome now enables the systematic identification of similar circuit motifs for sensory cross-talk with predictive value.</p>
<p>The connectome also shows a modular organisation and can be subdivided into functionally distinct sub-networks. These sub-networks are strongly connected within themselves, but there are also extensive connections between the modules. Such inter-module connections may establish a hierarchy of behaviours e.g. by cross-inhibition.</p>
<p>The mushroom bodies also show a parallel feed-forward organisation with minimal feedback. This could be due to the developmental snapshot we acquired for the three-day-old stage. Mushroom bodies grow in size and form a morphologically clearly recognisable region only in later-stage larvae and juveniles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tomer et al., 2010</xref>). This growth is likely accompanied by circuit maturation. However, we think that the mushroom body cell types and circuits we reconstructed already show a functional circuit architecture. The MB cell types and their connections show left-right stereotypy and specificity of connectivity. It may be that annelid mushroom bodies can support associative learning by this multilayer perceptron-like organisation. In the cephalopods <italic>Sepia officinalis</italic> and <italic>Octopus vulgaris</italic>, similar feedforward information flow characterises the vertical lobe, a learning centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shomrat et al., 2011</xref>). The circuitry here has a simple fan-out fan-in architecture that in <italic>Octopus vulgaris</italic> shows further interconnections between the parallel feedforward networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bidel et al., 2023</xref>). In <italic>Platynereis</italic>, we only identified very weak connections between the parallel networks, at the level of the MB projection neurons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Functional predictions</title>
<p>The connectome also enables the generation of specific circuit-level hypotheses about neuronal control and integration in the <italic>Platynereis</italic> larva.</p>
<p>The analysis of the mechanosensory systems, for example, led to several new functional predictions. The convergence of mechanosensory pathways to the MNspinning motoneurons of the exocrine spinGlands indicates that glandular secretion is regulated by mechanosensory inputs to the parapodia. These circuits could regulate tube secretion by the benthic juvenile worms.</p>
<p>We also identified a potential site of mechanosensory feedback that may regulate the startle response. During a vibration-induced startle, the parapodia and their chaetae are extended, potentially activating the chaeMech chaetal mechanoreceptors. The chaeMech neurons synapse on the INsplitCR cells that are also a main target of the vibration-sensing CR neurons. An inhibitory signal from chaeMech to INsplitCR could lead to the controlled cessation of a startle.</p>
<p>By comprehensive tracing and cell annotation, we also identified a unique class of pigment-motor neurons (MC3cover, cioMNcover, pygPBunp). The direct synaptic innervation of pigment cells suggests that pigmentation may be under neuronal control in <italic>Platynereis</italic> larvae. We do not know how neuronal inputs may influence pigment cells. One possibility is that synaptic signals induce the movement or bleaching of the pigment vacuoles. In the cover cells, we occasionally observed the rapid disappearance of the pigment granules. The fact that at least one of the pigment-motor cells (pygPBunp) is also directly mechanosensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bezares-Calderón et al., 2018</xref>) suggests that mechanical cues may alter pigmentation.</p>
<p>Network analysis also identified various hub neurons of potential functional importance. For example, in the brain, INRGWa and INW interneurons integrate a large number of inputs. Likewise, in the trunk mechanosensory system, INsplitCR and INsplitPB neurons receive many distinct inputs. Multi-pathway convergence can occur both at the level of interneurons and on motoneurons (e.g. MNant, vMN, MNspinning).</p>

<sec id="s3d">
<title>Circuits for whole-body coordination</title>
<p>The <italic>Platynereis</italic> whole-body connectome resource highlights the value of having access to comprehensive circuit and cell-type information. In the <italic>Platynereis</italic> larva, almost every functional module spans several body regions and often the entire body.</p>
<p>The coordinated closure and beating of cilia along the body segments is ensured by giant ciliomotor neurons that innervate target cells in multiple segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Verasztó et al., 2017</xref>). The secretion of spinGlands across segments is likely also coordinated since the two MNspinning neurons innervate the four spinning glands in segments 2 and 3. Among the muscle motoneurons, the vMNs MN1 and MN2 innervate ventral and dorsal longitudinal muscles (MUSlong) in each segment. MNspider cells synapse on contralateral muscles in two consecutive segments and the muscle targets of MNcrab and MNbow neurons span three segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bezares-Calderón et al., 2018</xref>). In the pigment-motor system, the cioMNcover cells each innervate half the ring of the cover cells and pygPBunp innervates the entire ring, also suggesting coordinated regulation.</p>
<p>Intersegmental coordination is also apparent at the level of sensory and interneurons. For example, individual chaeMech cells can synapse on interneurons in three segments. INrope and INchaeMech interneurons target motoneurons across three segments, INsplitCRATO, INsplitBronto and INsplitVent in two segments. The globally reaching INsplitPBant cells have postsynaptic partners in all four segments and the pygidium.</p>
<p>These examples demonstrate the importance of a whole-body approach in connectomics to understanding circuit function and behaviour. Partial connectomes could not deliver satisfactory circuit explanations for any of these systems We do not expect this to be different for other animals.</p>

<title>Circuit evolution by duplication and divergence</title>
<p>An exciting perspective in connectomics is to learn about circuit evolution by the analysis of comprehensive datasets that integrate anatomy and connectivity. Our reconstructions identified a potential case for circuit evolution by duplication and divergence of synaptically connected cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tosches, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The mechanosensory girdle contains several morphologically similar mechanosensory neurons bearing penetrating cilia at the tip of their sensory dendrites (PB, CR, interparaPM, PU and pygPBunp). These cells likely represent evolutionarily related sister cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arendt, 2008</xref>). Some of these neurons also show overlapping gene regulatory signatures — supporting their classification as sister cell types — as they all can be labelled by the same <italic>PKD2-1</italic> transgene (PB, CR and pygPBunp)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bezares-Calderón et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>These mechanosensory neurons synapse on distinct subsets of INsplit types. Based on their morphological similarity, INsplit cells are also likely related among themselves.</p>
<p>This pattern suggests that these parallel systems may have evolved through the process of circuit duplication and divergence. According to this model, the diversification of mechanoreceptors may have been paralleled by the diversification of their postsynaptic INsplit neurons. This enabled sensory refinement in parallel with the evolution of matched downstream circuits and behaviours.</p>
<p>The duplication and divergence of cell-type sets also characterised the evolution of the vertebrate cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kebschull et al., 2020</xref>). Further support for this model in <italic>Platynereis</italic> could come from comprehensive gene expression analyses for the distinct mechanosensory and INsplit neurons.</p>

<title>Connectomics informs the evolution of the annelid segmental body plan</title>
<p>Our dataset represents, to our knowledge, the first whole-body connectome of a segmented animal. These data also inform our understanding of the evolution of the annelid body segments and nervous system, both long-standing questions in evolution and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Balfour, 1881</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nielsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nielsen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sedgwick, 1884</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Starunov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Steinmetz et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>By mapping cell-type distributions across segments we found evidence for segmental homology overlain by a heteromeric pattern with segment-specific cell types. The serial homology of the cryptic segment (sg0) with the other three trunk segments (sg1-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Steinmetz et al., 2011</xref>) is confirmed by neuron and muscle types shared between these four segments. In addition, the pygidium and the head may have metameric origin. The pygidium has a coelomic cavity and muscle cell types (MUSlong, MUStrans) shared with the other trunk segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jasek et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Starunov et al., 2015</xref>). The segmental origin of the annelid head is suggested by a Cambrian annelid fossil where the head is formed by a segment with parapodia and chaetae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Parry et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The metameric origin of all six body regions receives additional support from our connectome reconstructions. We identified muscle cell types (MUSlongV, MUStrans), sensory neuron types (CR, PB, PU) and one family of interneurons (INsplit) shared by five or six of the body regions. One interpretation of this pattern is that the annelid body evolved from an organisation with six homomeric regions that subsequently diversified but retained a core set of homologous cells. Further tests of this model could come from future whole-body connectomes of other annelid species.</p>
<p>The identification of a mechanosensory girdle in <italic>Platynereis</italic> reminded us of another classic hypothesis about bilaterian body-plan evolution.</p>
<p>In 1881, Francis Balfour put forward the hypothesis that the ancestral nervous system from which the nervous system of arthropods, molluscs and other invertebrates derived was “a circumoral ring, like that of Medusae, with which radially-arranged sense-organs may have been connected”. He posits a transition scenario in which a “circumoral nerve-ring, if longitudinally extended, might give rise to a pair of nerve-cords united in front and behind” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Balfour, 1881</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1884, Sedgwick further developed this model and derived the bilaterian mouth and anus through the fusion of the lateral lips of the gastric slit of a radially symmetric animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sedgwick, 1884</xref>). Metameric segmentation in this model evolved from the mesenteries and somites from gut pouches of a radial ancestor. For a thorough modern treatment of this Balfour-Sedgwick model — also referred to as the amphistomy theory — see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nielsen et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Our connectome reconstructions in the <italic>Platynereis</italic> larva are compatible with the Balfour-Sedgwick theory. The mechanosensory girdle looping around all six homologous body segments can be interpreted as a derivative of a circumoral nerve ring looping around homomeric body regions. The girdle could correspond to radially-arranged mechanosensory organs around the cnidarian oral opening (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Singla, 1975</xref>)) (<xref rid="fig17" ref-type="fig">Figure 17</xref>). Alternative transition scenarios, such as the evolution of a new opening at the aboral pole of a radial ancestor and de-novo evolution of a mechanosensory, circumoral nerve ring seem less plausible.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="585258v2_fig17.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Testing this model would require detailed reconstructions of cnidarian circumoral nervous systems. We predict that there may be bifurcating interneurons in cnidarians that are postsynaptic to circumoral mechanosensors and project in two directions along the oral opening (similar to INsplit neurons).</p>

<title>Specimen preparation, transmission electron microscopy and image processing</title>
<p>Fixation and embedding were carried out on an 72 hpf <italic>Platynereis</italic> larva (HT9-4) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Conzelmann et al., 2013</xref>). Serial sectioning and transmission electron microscopy were done as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shahidi et al., 2015</xref>). The section statistics for the HT9-4 (NAOMI) specimen were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Randel et al., 2015</xref>). The serial sections were imaged on a FEI TECNAI Spirit transmission electron microscope with an UltraScan 4000 4X4k digital camera using Digital Micrograph acquisition software (Gatan Software Team Inc., Pleasanton) and SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schorb et al., 2019</xref>). The images for the HT9-4 projects were scanned at various pixel resolutions: 5.7 nm/pixel, 3.7 nm/pixel, and 2.2 nm/pixel. Images were stitched and alignment with TrakEM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cardona et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>We used the collaborative annotation toolkit CATMAID for tracing, annotation and reviewing of skeleton annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Saalfeld et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to contrast and focus problems in the main dataset we had to re-image certain layers at higher resolutions, to allow tracing of neurons. These re-imaged series were made into independent CATMAID projects. This included five extra projects, taken at various points throughout the main dataset. All layers including the information on lost layers, immunogold labelling and re-imaging are listed in Supplementary Table 2. The largest of these, Plexus_HT-4_Naomi_project 372-4013, consisted of 1407 layers at resolution of 2.2 nm. This stack mostly focused on the brain plexus and the ventral nerve cord where most neurites and synapses occur. Other projects consisted of three jump/gap regions that required not only high resolution but also better realignment. One set contained all the immunogold labelled layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shahidi et al., 2015</xref>) that were not included in the main aligned dataset. These layers had very low contrast due to the immunolabelling procedure and therefore required higher resolution imaging. All projects were first created and processed in TrakEM2 and then exported as flat jpeg images into CATMAID.</p>

<title>Image-stack realignment and transformation of spatial data in CATMAID</title>
<p>To improve the traceability of the vEM stack in all areas, we realigned the raw TEM images to improve the previously reported alignment of the volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Randel et al., 2015</xref>). First, we opened the original project with the TrakEM2 plugin for FIJI (ImageJ) (version 2.0.0-rc-15/1.49k / Java 1.6.0_24 (64-bit) – 2014). We set the region of interest (ROI) to width: 25792, height: 28800, x-shift: 20885, y-shift: 11928. All 4846 layers were then exported as flat TIFF images with a scale of 100%, 8-bit grayscale, no background color (0). A new blank TrakEM2 project was then created in FIJI and the exported TIFF images were imported using the project import function “import sequence as grid”. The project was then aligned according to Albert Cardona’s 2016 alignment protocol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/khlab/TrakEM2+elastic+alignment?preview=/139168916/194807990/TEM">https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/khlab/TrakEM2+elastic+alignment?preview=/139168916/194807990/TEM</ext-link> Alignment in TrakEM2 (Cardona 2016).pdf) with some modifications. The image filters were previously applied to the images, and therefore were not required. First, an ‘Affine’ alignment was applied using the following parameters: least squares (linear feature correspondences) mode, choosing entire layer range with first layer as reference, using visible images only and no propagation, initial Gaussian blur of 1.6 pixels, 3 steps per scale octave, minimum image size of 64 pixels and maximum of 2048 pixels, feature descriptor size of 8, feature descriptor orientation bins of 8, closest ratio of 0.92, with clear cache selected, feature extraction threads of 30, maximal alignment error of 100 pixels, minimal inlier ratio of 0.20, minimal number of inliers of 12, expected transformation as Affine, testing multiple hypotheses with tolerance of 5.00 pixels, testing maximal layer neighbour range of 5 layers, giving up after 5 failures, desired transformation as Affine, regularizing model, maximal iteration of 1000, maximal plateauwidth of 200, regularizer as Rigid, and lambda of 0.10. Next, two iterations of Elastic alignment were applied using the following parameters: block matching layer scale of 0.05, search radius of 200 pixels, block radius of 2000 pixels (increased to 2400 pixels during second iteration), resolution of 60, correlation filters with minimal PMCC r of 0.10, maximal curvature ratio of 1000, maximal second best r/best r of 0.90, using local smoothness filter, with approximate local transformation as Affine, local region sigma of 1000 pixels, absolute maximal local displacement of 10 pixels, relative maximal local displacement of 3.00, as pre-aligned layers, testing maximal of 4 layers, approximate transformation as Rigid, maximal iterations of 1000, maximal plateau width of 200, spring mesh stiffness of 0.01, maximal stretch of 2000 pixels, maximal iterations of 3000, maximal plateauwidth of 200, using legacy optimizer. After each alignment procedure the project was saved as an XML file with a different name. Finally, images were exported for CATMAID using TrakEM2 in FIJI (version 2.0.0-rc-69/1.52p / Java 1.8.0_172 (64-bit) – 2019). After the realignment, the transformation of all traced neuron skeletons in CATMAID was necessary to match the newly applied image alignment transforms. To achieve this, we used a logic script (Tom Kazimiers, Kazmos GmbH) that applied a realignment transformation process from the TrakEM2 xml project file to the CATMAID data. This script was added as a management command in CATMAID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/catmaid/CATMAID/blob/master/django/applications/catmaid/management/commands/catmaid_update_tracing_data_using_trakem2_xml.py">https://github.com/catmaid/CATMAID/blob/master/django/applications/catmaid/management/commands/catmaid_update_tracing_data_using_trakem2_xml.py</ext-link>). When applied, these transformation offsets were within ±1 pixel accuracy for all parented nodes. The code is available in the CATMAID GitHub repository, commit e25debb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/catmaid/CATMAID/commit/e25debb">https://github.com/catmaid/CATMAID/commit/e25debb</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Neuron tracing, synapse annotation and reviewing</title>
<p>To digitally reconstruct every neuron in the serial TEM dataset of the three-day-old larva, we used the collaborative web application CATMAID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Saalfeld et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016</xref>) installed on a local server.</p>
<p>The total construction time of all skeletons was over 2,970 hours with an additional 782 hours of review time.</p>
<p>To mark the position of cell somas, we tagged the centre of each nucleus in the volume. At the approximate centre of each nucleus, we changed the radius of a single node according to the soma size in that layer. All skeletons were rooted on the soma and the node was tagged with ‘soma’.</p>
<p>Ultrastructural features (number and orientation of microtubules, electron density of the cytoplasm and vesicles, ER structure) and a high resolution dataset of the neuropil and the ventral nerve cord aided tracing through low-quality layers and gaps.</p>
<p>We identified synapses based on a vesicle cloud close to the plasma membrane. Most synapses were visible in consecutive layers (for example images see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Randel et al., 2014</xref>) and browse the data). We also checked for the proximity of mitochondria in the same arbour in case of ambiguous synapses — a requirement supported by quantitative connectomic data in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016</xref>). The systematic review of all neurons belonging to a cell type was done by one or multiple reviewers until close to 100% was reached for every cell. Cells were further checked in the 3D widget to split implausible skeletons. Synapses were reviewed multiple times, from both the pre- and postsynaptic arbour.</p>

We named neurons based on their type (e.g. sensory or motor; SN, MN) cell body position (left or right, head or trunk segment), axonal morphology, neuropeptide expression, and other specialisations (e.g. sensory morphology). Cells of the same type have similar names, distinguished by body position indicators and numbers. These indicators follow the general cell-type name separated by the first _ symbol in the name string. We endeavoured to give names that were easy to remember. The name of many sensory neurons start with SN followed by a specific term (e.g. blunt, bronto, stiff). Interneurons often start with IN and motoneurons with MN. There are exceptions, including neurons with known function (e.g. PRC for photoreceptor cells) and neurons with prominent morphology (e.g. Loop). Segmental position (sg0-3) and body side (l or r) is indicated in the name of most neurons. Non-neuronal cells were named based on anatomical terms (e.g. prototroch) or by abbreviations (e.g. EC for epithelial cell).</p>
<p>All cells have multiple annotations, which can be used to query the database in CATMAID or through the CATMAID API (e.g. in R b the catmaid package). Neurons belonging to a cell-type category were annotated with the generalist annotation ‘celltype’ and a cell-type-specific annotation (e.g. celltype23 for the INpreMN neurons). Non-neuronal cells belonging to a cell-type category were annotated with the generalist annotation ‘celltype_non_neuronal’ and a cell-type-specific annotation (e.g. celltype_non_neuronal23 for the acicula cells). Neurons were also annotated with descriptors of their projection morphologies (e.g. commissural, ipsilateral, pseudounipolar etc.), neuron class (Sensory neuron, sensory-motor neuron, sensory-neurosecretory neuron, interneuron, inter-motorneuron and motorneuron [note the ‘r’, which we kept for backward compatibility]). In CATMAID, we recommend the use of regular expressions for searching annotations e.g. ^motorneuron$ to retrieve exact matches. Differentiating neurons with immature sensory dendrites or axonal projections with axonal growth cones and with no or few synapses were annotated ‘immature neuron’ (402 cells). Ascending trunk neurons and descending head neurons traversing the circumesophageal connectives were annotated ‘head-trunk’. Neurons with a soma in the head and a descending decussating axon were annotated with ‘decussating’. Cells were also annotated according to the location of their soma in a certain body region (head — as ‘episphere’, trunk — as ‘torso’, ‘pygidium’), body side (‘left_side’, ‘right_side’), segment (‘segment_0’ etc.), and germ layer (ecto-, meso-, endoderm).</p>

<sec id="s4f">
<title>Criteria for including cells in the connectome</title>
<p>When defining the connectome, we aimed at including differentiated cells and skeletons connected with at least three synapses to the main graph. We used the script ‘connectome_from_CATMAID.R’ to derive the final full connectome graph. First, we fetched all synaptic connectors and their pre- and postsynaptoc partners. Each single synapse was assigned a weight of one and edges connecting the same nodes in the same direction were summed. We then removed all vertices from the graph with &lt;3 synapses. We checked for connected components and selected the largest subgraph.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g">
<title>Network layout</title>
<p>The layout of the full connectome was generated by force-field-based clustering. We used the Force Atlas tool in Gephi 0.10.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bastian et al., 2009</xref>). The inertia was set to 0.1, repulsion strength was 35, attraction strength was 10, maximum displacement was 5, gravity was 20, speed was 5 and the attraction distribution option was on. The ‘auto stabilise function’ was off. Towards the end of the clustering the ‘adjust by sizes’ option was also selected. To prevent node overlap, we then run the ‘Noverlap’ function. Node positions from this Gephi layout were imported and further graph manipulations (including node colouring) were carried out in R.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h">
<title>Network analysis</title>
<p>We used CATMAID (several releases), Gephi 0.10.1 and R for network analysis. For graph analysis and visualisation, we used R and the iGraph, tidygraph, visNetwork and networkD3 packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Allaire et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Almende et al., 2019</xref>; Csardi et al., 2006).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i">
<title>Data analysis and plotting</title>
<p>For data analysis, we used R and Rstudio (various releases)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Posit team, 2023</xref>). For data handling and plotting we endeavoured to adhere to the practices and packages of the Tidyverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wickham et al., 2019</xref>). Data plotting was done with the ggplot2 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wickham et al., 2016</xref>).

<p>This study is an <bold>important</bold> advancement towards the understanding of animal nervous system organization and evolution by providing a <bold>compelling</bold> description of the entire connectome of the 3-day larva of the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii. It provides a wealth of data on cell type diversity and the modules that interconnect them. Its strength in the massive amount of high-quality data is also partly a weakness as it can make it difficult to read and scientifically digest. This work lays the foundations for studies on cell type diversity, segmental vs. intersegmental connectivity, and mushroom bodies, but will certainly also be of use to scientists interested in other nervous systems parts, their functions, and evolution.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper provides a resource for researchers studying the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii. It is only the third whole-body connectome to be assembled and thus provides a comparison with those less complex animals: the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the tunicate Ciona intestinialis. The paper catalogs all cells in the body, not just neurons, and details how sensory neurons, interneurons, motor neurons, and effector organs are connected. From this, the authors are able to extract information about the organization of different aspects of the nervous system. These include the extent of recurrent connectivity, unimodal and multimodal sensory processing, and long-range and short-range connectivity.</p>
<p>Several interesting conclusions are drawn, including the concept that circuit evolution might have proceeded by duplication and diversion of cell types, much as it has been posited that gene evolution has occurred. It also informs the understanding of the evolution of segmental body plans in annelids by mapping and comparing cells in each segment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper contains a wealth of data. The raw dataset is available. The codes and scripts are provided to allow interested readers to utilize this dataset.</p>
<p>The analysis is painstakingly meticulous. The diagrams are organized to orient the reader to the complexities of this overwhelming analysis</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The strength of the paper is also its weakness. It contains so much data and analysis that it is burdensome to read and understand. There are 16 multi-panel data figures in the main text, and \another 38 supplemental figures, and 5 videos.</p>
<p>The impact of the paper is diminished by its size and depth. The paper could be broken up into smaller thematic papers that would be more accessible to researchers interested in particular topics. For example, there could be a single paper on the mushroom body and another paper on the segmental organization.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The stated ambition of the authors in this manuscript is to thoroughly analyze the complete neural connectome of the three-day larva of the marine annelid Platynereis. This manuscript follows several previous publications by the same group on the same volume of serial EM data, addressing several specialized functional circuits, and supersedes a previous preprint published in 2020. To this end, the authors have annotated the whole cell complement of the larva, including non-neural cells, with the collaborative tool CATMAID, traced the whole neurite extensions of neural cells, and annotated all synapses. The connectome has been algorithmically analyzed to extract the principal modules, adding several new, so far unexplored neural circuits to the list.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This remarkable study adds a third species to the list of animals in which the full connectome and functional modules have been analyzed, alongside C. elegans and Ciona intestinalis. It represents a leap in phylogeny, with Platynereis being a representative of the lophotrochozoans. Also, Platynereis has considerably more neurons than the latter species. The study provides a complete picture of the set of neural modules that are necessary for the survival of an autonomous marine larva with an active lifestyle.</p>
<p>The analysis is particularly impressive for revealing the complete innervation of the entire set of effector cells in the Platynereis larva, including muscle fibers, glands, pigment cells, ciliated cells, and helping understand the overall control of the organism's behavior through multiple sensory pathway integrations. It also reveals layers of neuronal intercalation in sensory-effector pathways that allow further integration even in a larva with limited behavioral complexity. The structure of the developing mushroom bodies, proposed ancestral bilaterian brain sensory integrative units, is detailed, as well as a complex mechanosensory module specific to a swimming larva.</p>
<p>A key new aspect of this connectome study is the thorough analysis of segmental cell types and intersegmental connectivity. Metameric organization is widespread in bilaterians and is nowhere clearer than in annelids. This metameric organization is even proposed by some authors to be an ancestral trait of bilaterians. Here, the authors show that homologous cell types and connectivity are shared not only by all segments of the animal but also by its non-segmental terminal parts (anterior prostomium and posterior pygidium). They suggest, in turn, that the entire body of the annelid may be formed of ancestral metameric units, an idea proposed before but here strongly supported by a list of homologous cell types. This is the most thorough evidence obtained so far for this provocative and stimulating evolutionary hypothesis.</p>
