<title>Abstract</title>
<p>As a master regulator of seed development, Leafy Cotyledon 1 (LEC1) promotes chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, but the mechanism underlying this remains poorly understood. Here, we found that loss of function of <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic>, a <italic>LEC1</italic> homolog of rice, leads to chlorophyllous embryo, indicating that <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> plays an opposite role in Chl biosynthesis in rice compared with that in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. OsNF-YB7 regulates the expression of a group of genes responsible for Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis by directly binding to their promoters. In addition, OsNF-YB7 interacts with Golden 2-Like 1 (OsGLK1) to inhibit the transactivation activity of OsGLK1, a key regulator of Chl biosynthesis. Moreover, OsNF-YB7 can directly repress <italic>OsGLK1</italic> expression by recognizing its promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>, indicating the involvement of OsNF-YB7 in multiple regulatory layers of Chl biosynthesis in rice embryo. We propose that OsNF-YB7 functions as a transcriptional repressor to regulate Chl biosynthesis in rice embryo.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Angiosperms can be divided into chloroembryophytes and leucoembryophytes, depending on the presence or absence of chlorophyll (Chl) in the embryo, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Puthur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Smolikova and Medvedev, 2016</xref>). Some plant species such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<italic>A. thaliana</italic>) produce chloroembryos, which have photochemically active chloroplasts capable of producing assimilates that are further converted into reserve biopolymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Simkin et al., 2020</xref>). Grass species, such as rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>), are unable to produce Chl during embryo development. To the best of our knowledge, it remains completely unclear what determines the ability to biosynthesize Chl in plant embryo. However, studies have identified several genes that contribute to Chl degradation for chloroembryos, the mutation of which can lead to a stay-green phenotype in mature seeds such as Mendel’s green pea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sato et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Delmas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Thomas and Ougham, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Golden 2-Like</italic> (<italic>GLK</italic>) genes encode GARP-type transcription factors (TFs), which are key components regulating chloroplast development and Chl biosynthesis in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rossini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fitter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nakamura et al., 2009</xref>). GLK can recognize the CCAATC <italic>cis</italic>-element of the Chl biosynthesis- and photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes to trigger their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Waters et al., 2009</xref>). The G-box (CACGTG) is also enriched in the GLK-targeted genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, possibly due to GLK being able to interact with certain G-box binding factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tamai et al., 2002</xref>). A genetic study showed that GLK activates Chl biosynthesis in roots, in a manner dependent on the G-box binding TF Elongated Hypocotyl 5 (HY5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kobayashi et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>There are two copies of <italic>GLK</italic> in the rice genome, designated as <italic>OsGLK1</italic> and <italic>OsGLK2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fitter et al., 2002</xref>). They redundantly regulate a set of genes, such as rice <italic>Chlorophyllide A Oxygenase</italic> (<italic>OsCAO</italic>) and <italic>Protochlorophyllide Oxidoreductase A</italic> (<italic>OsPORA</italic>) responsible for Chl biosynthesis, and <italic>Light Harvesting Complex B1</italic> (<italic>OsLHCB1</italic>) and <italic>OsLHCB4</italic> responsible for photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nakamura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sakuraba et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>OsGLK1</italic> overexpression in rice leads to green calli and chloroplast development in the vascular bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nakamura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Organelle development in rice vascular sheath cells is induced by ectopically expressed maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) <italic>GLK</italic> genes, mimicking a key step in the evolutionary transition from C3 to C4 plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In accordance with this, the ectopic expression of maize <italic>GLK</italic>s in rice can boost biomass and grain yield by facilitating chloroplast development and photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yeh et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, the overexpression of maize <italic>GLK</italic>s in calli was shown to improve the ability of rice and maize to regenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Luo et al., 2022</xref>). A recent study found that <italic>OsGLK1</italic> also participates in tapetum plastid development and programmed cell death, consequently affecting pollen fertility in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>). The findings indicate that GLK plays multiple roles in relation of plant development.</p>
<p>Leafy Cotyledon 1 (LEC1), a member of the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) TF family, is a central regulator controlling many aspects of seed development, such as Chl accumulation in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Meinke et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pelletier et al., 2017</xref>). LEC1 can also act as a pioneer TF to regulate flowering by reprogramming the embryonic chromatin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tao et al., 2017</xref>). Previous studies have reported that <italic>lec1</italic> mutants have paler green embryos than wild-type (WT) at maturation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Meinke et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">West et al., 1994</xref>). LEC1 transcriptionally regulates the expression of genes that encode light-reaction components of photosystems I and II, as well as the expression of genes involved in chloroplast biogenesis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and soybean embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pelletier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jo et al., 2020</xref>). These findings suggest that LEC1 is important for photosynthesis and chloroplast development during seed development. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unclear.</p>
<p>It is still a mystery why plant species such as rice cannot synthesize chlorophyll in embryos, while species such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> can. There are two LEC1 homologs, <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> and <italic>OsNF-YB9</italic>, encoded by the rice genome (E et al., 2018). <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> is restricted to the embryo, and defective <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> may result in seed lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Niu et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhang and Xue, 2013</xref>). Here, we found that OsNF-YB7 acts as a key inhibitor of Chl biosynthesis in rice embryo. It inactivates the transactivation activity of OsGLK1, at multiple regulatory layers, to inhibit Chl accumulation in the embryo of rice, explaining the achlorophyllous embryo produced in rice.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Loss of function of <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> leads to chloroembryos</title>
<p>By observing seeds produced by the loss-of-function mutant of <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic>, we surprisingly found that the <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> embryo was greenish (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A and B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> plays a negative role in chloroplast biogenesis or Chl biosynthesis, or both, during embryogenesis. We therefore examined the phenotype of green embryos at various seed development stages. The results showed that WT had an achlorophyllous embryo throughout embryonic development, whereas <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> embryo turned green at 5 days after fertilization (DAF) and the chloroembryo remained green until maturity (<bold>Fig. S1A—C</bold>). In support of this, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed well-developed chloroplast in the scutellum tip of the mutant, but this was not seen in the WT sections (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). By measuring Chl contents in the developing and mature embryos, we found that total Chl content in <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> was consistently higher than that in the WT, both at 10 DAF and at maturation (30 DAF) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). As revealed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), Chl autofluorescence was detectable as early as 5 DAF in <italic>osnf-yb7</italic>, indicating the initiation of Chl accumulation at this stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). This is consistent with our previous finding that <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> was highly activated at 5 DAF in rice embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Niu et al., 2021b</xref>).</p>

<p>Light is a critical signal triggering Chl biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wietrzynski and Engel, 2021</xref>). To determine whether the Chl biosynthesis in <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> is induced by light, we investigated the embryo phenotype of WT and <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> in the dark, using aluminum foil to cover rice panicles prior to flowering. The result showed that, similar to WT, <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> embryo was achlorophyllous in the dark, although the embryogenesis defects, such as degenerated epiblast and coleorhiza, and maldeveloped coleoptile, were still observable (<bold>Fig. S2A—H</bold>). This indicated that Chl biosynthesis in the mutant is light dependent. Only a small amount of light can be perceived by rice embryos because the external hulls block light penetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Simkin et al., 2020</xref>). We removed the hulls to directly expose the embryo to light; however, Chl accumulation still failed to occur in the WT embryo (<bold>Fig. S2I—L</bold>), suggesting that there are internal signals that repress Chl biosynthesis in rice embryo. We suspected that the <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> mutation may attenuate the activity of such inhibitors; alternatively, OsNF-YB7 itself could be an inhibitor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>OsNF-YB7 negatively regulates photosynthesis- and Chl biosynthesis-related genes</title>
<p>Using 5- and 10-DAF-old WT and <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> embryos, we previously performed deep sequencing of the transcriptome (RNA-seq) to identify possible downstream genes of OsNF-YB7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Niu et al., 2021a</xref>). As revealed by Mapman analysis, photosynthesis-related pathways, such as photosystem I, photosystem II, and the light reaction, were significantly enriched for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the mutant embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref><bold>, Fig. S3A and B</bold>). Moreover, 96.9% (95/98) and 96.4% (106/110) of the photosynthesis-related DEGs that identified from 5- and 10–DAF-old embryos, respectively, were upregulated in the mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). To confirm this finding, we next examined the expression of <italic>OsLHCA</italic>s and <italic>OsLHCB</italic>s, which are primarily associated with photosystems I and II, respectively, via quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). It showed higher expression of all of the studied <italic>OsLHCA</italic>s and <italic>OsLHCB</italic>s in the <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> embryo at 10 DAF (<bold>Fig. S4A</bold>). Likewise, many of the genes participating in Chl biosynthesis, including rice <italic>Genomes Uncoupled 4</italic> (<italic>OsGUN4</italic>), <italic>Mg-Chelatase H Subunit</italic> (<italic>OsCHLH</italic>), <italic>OsCHLI</italic>, <italic>OsCHLD</italic>, <italic>Copper Response Defect 1</italic> (<italic>OsCRD1</italic>), <italic>OsPORA</italic>, <italic>OsPORB</italic>, and <italic>Divinyl Reductase</italic> (<italic>OsDVR</italic>), were significantly activated in the mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref><bold> and Fig. S4B</bold>). The findings indicated that OsNF-YB7 might act as a repressor of Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis, which is opposite to the role of its homologue LEC1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>
<p>Since OsNF-YB7 is a TF, we assumed that it may directly regulate the expression of genes related to Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis, such as <italic>OsPORA</italic>, and <italic>OsLHCB4</italic>, which were significantly activated in the <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> embryo (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). We first generated transgenic lines that overexpressed <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic>, tagged with either green fluorescent protein (<italic>NF-YB7-GFP</italic>) or 3× Flag (<italic>NF-YB7-Flag</italic>) in the Zhonghua11 (ZH11, <italic>O. sativa</italic> ssp. <italic>geng</italic>/<italic>japonica</italic>) or Kitaake (<italic>O. sativa</italic> ssp. <italic>geng</italic>/<italic>japonica</italic>) background, respectively. As expected, <italic>OsPORA</italic> and <italic>OsLHCB4</italic> were significantly downregulated in leaves of the <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> overexpressors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C and D</xref><bold>, and Fig. S4C</bold>). Similar to previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhang and Xue, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ito et al., 2011</xref>), the OsNF-YB7 overexpression lines displayed severe reproductive development defects, which prevented us from obtaining sufficient embryo tissues for subsequent experiments. Instead, using the <italic>NF-YB7-Flag</italic> seedling, we conducted a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay coupled with quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR). The results showed that OsNF-YB7 was highly enriched in the promoter regions of <italic>OsPORA</italic> and <italic>OsLHCB4</italic> harboring the G-box motif (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E and F</xref>), a putative binding site of OsNF-YB7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Guo et al., 2022</xref>). To confirm the ability of OsNF-YB7 to bind to the <italic>OsPORA</italic> and <italic>OsLHCB4</italic> promoters, we next performed electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSAs), using recombinant OsNF-YB7-His protein, and biotin-labeled subfragments of the <italic>OsPORA</italic> or <italic>OsLHCB4</italic> promoters containing G-boxes. The results showed that OsNF-YB7-His was able to bind to the labeled probes, and the shifted band signals were substantially weakened upon application of the unlabeled cold probes or hot probes with a mutated G-box (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G and H</xref>).</p>

<p>To confirm that the binding of OsNF-YB7 represses target gene expression, dual luciferase (LUC) reporter (DLR) assays were performed. We first generated LUC reporters driven by the <italic>OsPORA</italic> or <italic>OsLHCB4</italic> promoters (designated as <italic>proOsPORA:LUC</italic> and <italic>proOsLHCB4:LUC</italic> hereafter) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>). When the reporters were coexpressed with OsNF-YB7, which acted as an effector, in rice protoplasts, we found that OsNF-YB7 significantly repressed the activity of both <italic>proOsPORA:LUC</italic> and <italic>proOsLHCB4:LUC</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>). Taken together, these results suggested that OsNF-YB7 directly binds to the promoters of photosynthesis- and Chl biosynthesis-related genes and represses their transcription.</p>

<p><italic>OsGLK1</italic> was the most strikingly activated TF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and B</xref>), while it was significantly repressed <italic>in NF-YB7-GFP</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). To test the idea that <italic>OsGLK1</italic> is a direct downstream target of OsNF-YB7, a ChIP-qPCR assay was first carried out using <italic>NF-YB7-Flag</italic> transgenic seedlings. The results showed that the promoter segments P3 and P4 were significantly enriched in the immunoprecipitated chromatin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), suggesting that OsNF-YB7 was able to bind to the <italic>OsGLK1</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, we failed to validate the binding ability <italic>in vitro</italic> using the EMSA assay (<bold>Fig. S5</bold>), suggesting that OsNF-YB7 requires other NF-Ys or TFs to form a TF complex to recognize the promoter, as many NF-Y members do for function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Laloum et al., 2013</xref>). A DLR assay was next performed to investigate the negative regulation of OsNF-YB7 on <italic>OsGLK1</italic> transcription using rice protoplasts. The <italic>OsGLK1</italic> promoter was inserted upstream of the 5× upstream activating sequence (UAS) as a reporter; OsNF-YB7 was fused C-terminally to the DNA binding domain (BD) of the yeast GAL4 and the herpes virus VP16 transactivation domain (VP16:OsNF-YB7), as an effector (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>).

<p>Recently, the putative binding sites of OsNF-YB7 and OsGLK1 were investigated at the whole genome scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Guo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tu et al., 2022</xref>). This allows us to test our hypothesis that OsNF-YB7 and OsGLK1 can target a common set of genes involved in Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis. By reanalyzing the ChIP-seq data, we found that 91.4% (235/257) and 90.7% (167/184) of the OsGLK1-binding genes overlapped with the OsNF-YB7-binding genes in two replicates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref><bold> and Table S3</bold>), although the peak number of OsNF-YB7 was much greater than that of OsGLK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Guo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tu et al., 2022</xref>). A large number of the common targets were activated in the embryos of <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> and <italic>OsGLK1-OX</italic> at 10 DAF (<bold>Fig. S11A</bold>). GO analysis suggested that most of the common targets were genes involved in Chl biosynthesis or photosynthesis (<bold>Fig. S11B</bold>). By retrieving the sequences of the OsNF-YB7 and OsGLK1 binding peaks in the common targets for MEME analysis, we found that the TFs probably recognize similar DNA motifs. A short sequence containing the G-box motif was the most significantly enriched (<bold>Fig. S12A and B</bold>). There was also enrichment of another sequence containing a CCAAT motif recognized by the NF-Y TF complexes and a CCAATC motif recognized by GLKs, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Waters et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pelletier et al., 2017</xref>) (<bold>Fig. S12A and B</bold>). The results suggested that OsNF-YB7 and OsGLK1 can bind to the same region of their common target. In agreement with this, approximately 75.0% and 76.5% of the peak summits of OsGLK1 were located proximally to the summit of OsNF-YB7 in two replicates, within an adjacent region no more than 100 bp away (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref><bold> and Table S3</bold>). Consistent with our biochemical evidence, the ChIP-seq results showed that OsNF-YB7 does bind to the same regions of the <italic>OsPORA</italic> and <italic>OsLHCB4</italic> promoters as OsGLK1 binds to (<bold>Fig. S12C</bold>).</p>

<title>OsNF-YB7 physically interacts with OsGLK1 to inhibit its transcriptional activity</title>
<p>To resolve how OsNF-YB7 and OsGLK1 bind to the same regions to regulate their common targets, we speculated that the TFs probably form a dimer in rice in order to exert their functions. We therefore carried out a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay by transforming yeast cells with a bait construct expressing OsNF-YB7 fused with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD), together with a prey construct expressing OsGLK1 fused with the yeast GAL4 activation domain (AD). The results showed that OsNF-YB7 interacts with OsGLK1 in yeast (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A and B</xref>). Furthermore, to determine the functional domains required for the interaction, we generated two truncated versions of OsNF-YB7, which contained the N- or C-terminal, and three truncated versions of OsGLK1, which contained the N-terminal, DNA-BD, or GCT box domain, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fitter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhang et al., 2021b</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). We found that the C-terminus of OsNF-YB7 was sufficient for the interaction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). In addition, the GCT box domain of OsGLK1 strongly interacted with the full length or C-terminus of OsNF-YB7, while the DNA-BD of OsGLK1 showed a weak interaction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>A split complementary LUC assay further confirmed the interaction between OsNF-YB7 and OsGLK1 in the epidermal cells of <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). As suggested by the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis, the interaction occurred exclusively in the nuclei of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> epidermal cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Moreover, we transiently coexpressed OsNF-YB7 tagged with GFP (OsNF-YB7-GFP) and OsGLK1 tagged with 3× Flag (OsGLK1-Flag) in rice protoplasts, and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis showed that OsGLK1-Flag could be immunoprecipitated by the anti-GFP antibody (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), indicating that the interactions do occur <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, both Y2H and split complementary LUC assays showed that OsGLK2 could interact with OsNF-YB7 (<bold>Fig. S13A and B</bold>). These findings indicated that OsNF-YB7 interacts with OsGLKs, explaining why OsNF-YB7 and OsGLKs share a common set of targets in rice.</p>
<p>To explore the biological meaning of the interaction, we next performed DLR assays using rice protoplasts. Transient expression of OsGLK1 in rice protoplasts substantially activated the reporters, driven by either the <italic>OsPORA</italic> or the Os<italic>LHCB4</italic> promoter; however, when we coexpressed OsNF-YB7 with OsGLK1, the transactivation ability of OsGLK1 was significantly repressed in rice protoplasts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). These findings suggested that OsNF-YB7/OsGLK1 dimerization reduces the transactivation ability of OsGLK1 for fine-tuning the Chl biosynthetic and photosynthetic genes, such as <italic>OsPORA</italic> and Os<italic>LHCB4</italic>. The EMSA assay showed that OsGLK1-MBP recombinant proteins could bind to the promoter of <italic>OsPORA</italic>; however, when we incubated the probe with OsGLK1-MBP and OsNF-YB7-His together, the binding ability of OsGLK1 substantially decreased (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). As a control, when the probe was incubated with OsGLK1-MBP and GST-His, the binding ability of OsGLK1 remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). These findings implied that the reduced transactivity of OsGLK1 is likely due to the formation of OsNF-YB7/OsGLK1 heterodimers inhibiting the binding of OsGLK1 to its downstream genes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In crops such as soybean and canola, the presence of green embryos is considered as a valuable trait due to its association with increased photosynthetic capacity, which consequently promotes fatty acid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ruuska et al., 2004</xref>). This highlights the potential value of the green embryo. Nevertheless, the degradation of chlorophyll in mature seeds is necessary to prevent adverse effects on seed viability and meal quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chung et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>By surveying 1,094 species from 666 genera and 182 families, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yakovlev and Zhukova (1980)</xref> found that 428 angiosperms produce embryos with the presence of chlorophyll. Seeds with chlorophyllous embryo are scattered throughout the angiosperms and have evolved in many unrelated groups, but they are more prevalent in non-endospermous seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dahlgren, 1980</xref>). Currently, the evolutionary force driving the divergence of chloroembryophytes and leucoembryophytes remains largely unknown. Embryo photosynthesis contributes a large amount of oxygen to fuel energy-generating pathways in seed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Simkin et al., 2020</xref>). The presence of chlorophyll in the embryo facilitates photosynthesis at early developmental stages, potentially leading to improved seedling growth and vigor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Smolikova and Medvedev, 2016</xref>). In many chloroembryophytes, such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the embryo occupies a large proportion of the seed. From an evolutionary perspective, the presence of chlorophyll in the embryo may promote adaptation in such chloroembryophytes, as more reserves can be accumulated in the seed through active photosynthesis, better supporting the embryo development and subsequent seedling growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sela et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, some leucoembryophytes, such as rice, have a persistent endosperm rich in storage reserves to nourish embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). The acquisition of the ability to accumulate chlorophyll in the embryo is not necessary in such species. Although chlorophyllous embryos are rare among the ‘primitive’ angiosperm superorders, they are observed in some (but not all) Nymphaeales species that are surrounded by some amount of endosperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yakovlev and Zhukova, 1980</xref>). As there is a paucity of knowledge regarding the evolution of chlorophyllous embryos, further comprehensive studies are necessary.</p>
<p>Some algae and gymnosperm species have evolved an ability to synthesize Chl in the dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Myers, 1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ranade et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bogorad, 1950</xref>). However, it has remained largely unclear whether access to light accounts for the induction of chloroembryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dahlgren, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Periasamy and Vivekanandan, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we found that removing the tissues covering an embryo failed to produce chlorophyllous embryos in the WT; however, light avoidance inhibited Chl accumulation in <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> embryos (<bold>Fig. S2A—H</bold>). These results suggest that light is necessary but insufficient to trigger chloroplast biogenesis in rice. Because light itself does not induce Chl accumulation in rice embryo (<bold>Fig. S2I—L</bold>), we inferred that there are intrinsic cues to repress chloroplast development in rice embryo. However, to the best of our knowledge, the underlying mechanism that determines an embryo’s ability to synthesize Chl is completely unknown. Here, we showed that OsNF-YB7, a LEC1 homolog of rice, acts as an inhibitor to repress Chl accumulation in the embryo. In line with this, a recent independent study also showed that the <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> null mutant accumulates Chl in the embryo, although the cause of this remains unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Guo et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Several TFs involved in chloroplast development and photomorphogenesis in rice have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nakamura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hudson et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, we found that many of them were upregulated in the <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> embryos. For example, <italic>OsGLK1</italic> was shown to be the most activated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and B</xref>). Our genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that <italic>OsGLK1</italic> is involved in the OsNF-YB7-mediated repression of Chl biosynthesis in rice embryo. <italic>OsGLK1</italic> overexpression mimicked the chloroembryo phenotype in WT, while knockout of <italic>OsGLK1</italic> and <italic>OsGLK2</italic>, simultaneously, suppressed Chl accumulation in <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> embryo (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A—G</xref>). The biochemical experiments suggested that OsNF-YB7 associates with the promoter of <italic>OsGLK1</italic>, <italic>in vivo</italic>, to transcriptionally inactivate <italic>OsGLK1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D–F</xref>), indicating that <italic>OsGLK1</italic> is a downstream target of OsNF-YB7. However, OsNF-YB7 alone failed to bind to the promoter of <italic>OsGLK1 in vitro</italic> (<bold>Fig. S5</bold>), presumably due to some as-yet-unidentified TFs being recruited by OsNF-YB7, assisting in recognizing <italic>OsGLK1</italic> for transcriptional regulation. An NF-Y TF complex usually consists of three subunits (NF-YA/B/C) in order to exert its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Laloum et al., 2013</xref>). NF-YA is responsible for DNA binding, while NF-YB and NF-YC are primarily responsible for transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chaves-Sanjuan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gnesutta et al., 2017</xref>). OsNF-YB7 possibly forms a heterotrimer with NF-YA and NF-YC in the embryo to recognize <italic>OsGLK1</italic>. In addition, previous studies showed that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> LEC1 can interact with different TFs for developmental regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Huang et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yamamoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fatihi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boulard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Huang et al., 2015a</xref>). Identifying such TFs may reveal how OsNF-YB7 recognizes <italic>OsGLK1</italic> in order to exert its function.</p>
<p>OsNF-YB7 could recognize a common set of genes involved in Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis that are recognized by OsGLK1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E—H</xref><bold> and Table S3</bold>). The biochemical results suggested that OsNF-YB7 can directly repress <italic>OsPORA</italic> and Os<italic>LHCB4</italic>, which are activated by OsGLK1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref><bold>, and Fig. S10</bold>). OsNF-YB7 probably hinders OsGLK1 to access the target genes by forming an OsGLK1/OsNF-YB7 heterodimer (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A—E</xref>), or by occupying the motif OsGLK1 recognized in the promoter, given the binding sites of OsGLK1 and OsNF-YB7 are likely overlapped (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref><bold>, Fig. S12 and Table S3</bold>). The first of these hypotheses is more plausible because, upon co-incubation of OsGLK1 and OsNF-YB7 with the <italic>OsPORA</italic> promoter <italic>in vitro</italic>, the shifted band signal of OsGLK1 was substantially decreased (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>), indicating that the protein-protein interactions overwhelm the protein-DNA interactions. Thus, when OsNF-YB7 is expressed, it interacts with OsGLK1, then OsGLK1 is less available to activate downstream targets. The findings suggested that OsNF-YB7 plays a dual role in regulating Chl biosynthesis in rice embryo: first, it represses the downstream genes, achieved via its function as a transcriptional inactivator; second, OsNF-YB7 can interact with OsGLKs to disturb their abilities to transactivate genes related to Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis (<bold>Fig. S14</bold>). In addition to OsNF-YB7, a recent study showed that Deep Green Panicle 1, a plant-specific protein with a conserved TIGR01589 domain, can interact with OsGLKs to suppress OsGLK-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhang et al., 2021a</xref>). The findings suggested that, as the central regulator responsible for chloroplast development, GLK is tightly regulated at the post-translational level to fine-tune Chl biosynthesis in plants.</p>
<p>Previous studies suggested that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> LEC1 is a positive regulator of Chl biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pelletier et al., 2017</xref>), given that the mature embryos of <italic>lec1</italic> were paler than the WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Meinke, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">West et al., 1994</xref>). However, the null mutation of <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> activated Chl biosynthesis, implying that the LEC1-type gene acts as a negative regulator in rice. By surveying the literature, we noted that Meinke reported that the cotyledons of the <italic>lec1</italic> mutant remained green unusually late in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Meinke, 1992</xref>). Although there was no significant difference in Chl content upon using whole seeds for quantification, Parcy <italic>et al</italic>. did observe that the tip of <italic>lec1</italic> cotyledons accumulated more Chl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Parcy et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>lec1</italic>;<italic>abi3</italic> double mutant embryos produced much more Chl than the <italic>abi3</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Parcy et al., 1997</xref>). Pelletier <italic>et al</italic>. recently reported that a cluster of LEC1 targets is enriched in genes related to photosynthesis and chloroplast development, and many of which are down-regulated in the embryo of <italic>lec1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pelletier et al., 2017</xref>); however, we noticed that in their dataset, the photosynthesis and Chl biosynthesis related genes were more strikingly enriched in the up-regulated genes of <italic>lec1</italic>, at either the mature green or postmature green stage. These observations challenge the concept that LEC1 positively regulates Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Most studies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have emphasized the importance of <italic>LEC1</italic> in embryo development at the maturation stage. However, <italic>LEC1</italic> is activated within 24 h after fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lotan et al., 1998</xref>), but its role in the early embryo developmental stages for Chl biosynthesis is still unknown. Previously, we have expressed <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> in the <italic>lec1-1</italic> background, driven by the native promoter of <italic>Arabidopsis LEC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Niu et al., 2021b</xref>). Given that <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> could rescue embryo morphogenesis defects in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Niu et al., 2021b</xref>), we postulated that <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> in rice plays a similar role to that of <italic>LEC1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In order to ascertain whether <italic>LEC1</italic> can fully restore <italic>osnf-yb7</italic>, it is necessary to ectopically express <italic>LEC1</italic> driven by the native <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> promoter in the <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> background in the future, due to the possibility of functional divergence between the genes with regard to the regulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis in the embryo. It would also be worthwhile to carry out similar tests in other grass organisms to better understand the regulatory mechanism in rice.</p>
<p>In addition to producing chlorophyllous embryo, the <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> mutants display an array of developmental defects, including abnormal embryogenesis, reduced dormancy, and desiccation intolerance, similar to those found in <italic>Arabidopsis lec1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Niu et al., 2021a</xref>). Mutation of <italic>osglk1</italic> and <italic>osglk2</italic> in <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> could recover the chloroembyo phenotype, but did not alleviate the other embryo defects (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D—G</xref>). The findings suggest that OsGLKs specifically function in Chl biosynthesis, but that OsNF-YB7 is responsible for many aspects of embryo development. In agreement with this, the number of OsNF-YB7-targeted genes is far greater than that of OsGLK-targeted genes, and the DEGs in <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> embryo is far greater than that in <italic>OsGLK1-OX</italic> embryo (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). The mechanisms underlying the OsNF-YB7-regulated multiple embryo developmental processes require further investigation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript investigates the regulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice embryos, focusing on the role of OsNF-YB7. The rigorous experimental approach, combining genetic, biochemical, and molecular analyses, provides a robust foundation for these findings. The research achieves its objectives, offering new insights into chlorophyll biosynthesis regulation, with the results convincingly supporting the authors' conclusions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strengths include the detailed experimental design and the findings regarding OsNF-YB7's inhibitory role.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, the manuscript's discussion on the practical implications for agriculture and the evolutionary analysis of regulatory mechanisms could be expanded.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors set out to establish the role of the rice LEC1 homolog OsNF-YB7 in embryo development, especially as it pertains to the development of photosynthetic capacity, with chlorophyll production as a primary focus.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The results are well-supported and each approach used complements each other. There are no major questions left unanswered and the central hypothesis is addressed in every figure.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are a handful of sections which could use clarifying for readers, but overall this is a solidly composed manuscript.</p>
<p>The authors clearly achieved their aims; the results compellingly establish a disparity between how this system operates in rice and Arabidopsis. Conclusions are thoroughly supported by the provided data and interpretations. This work will force a reconsideration of the value of Arabidopsis as a model organism for embryo chlorophyll biosynthesis and possibly photosynthesis during embryo maturation more broadly, as rice is a major crop organism and it very clearly does not follow the Arabidopsis model. It will thus be useful to carry out similar tests in other organisms rather than relying on Arabidopsis and attempt to more fully establish the regulatory mechanism in rice.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors set out to understand the mechanisms behind chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice, focusing in particular on the role of OsNF-YB7, an ortholog of Arabidopsis LEC1, which is a positive regulator of chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. They showed that OsNF-YB7 loss-of-function mutants in rice have chlorophyll-rich embryos, in contrast to Arabidopsis LEC1 loss-of-function mutants. This contrasting phenotype led the authors to carry out extensive molecular studies on OsNF-YB7, including in vitro and in vivo protein interaction studies, gene expression profiling and protein-DNA interaction assays. The evidence provided well supported the core arguments of the authors, emphasising that OsNF-YB7 is a negative regulator of Chl biosynthesis in rice embryos by mediating the expression of OsGLK1, a transcription factor that regulates downstream Chl biosynthesis genes. In addition, they showed that OsNF-YB7 interacts with OsGLK1 to negatively regulate the expression of OsGLK1, demonstrating the broad involvement of OsNF-YB7 in rice Chl biosynthetic pathways.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study clearly demonstrated how OsNF-YB7 regulates its downstream pathways using several in vitro and in vivo approaches. For example, gene expression analysis of OsNF-YB7 loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants revealed the expression of selected downstream chl biosynthetic genes. This was further validated by EMSA on the gel. The authors also confirmed this using luciferase assays in rice protoplasts. These approaches were used again to show how the interaction of OsNF-YB7 and OsGLK1 regulates downstream genes. The main idea of this study is very well supported by the results and data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see how two similar genes have come to play opposite roles in Arabidopsis and rice. Interspecies complementation might help to understand this point.</p>

<p>This is an important study on the regulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice embryos. It provides insights into the genetic and molecular interactions that underlie chlorophyll accumulation, highlighting the inhibition of OsGLK1 by OsNF-YB7 and the broader implications for understanding chloroplast development and seed maturation in angiosperms. The results presented, including mutation analysis, gene expression profiles, and protein interaction studies, provide convincing evidence for the function of OsNF-YB7 as a repressor in the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript investigates the regulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice embryos, focusing on the role of OsNF-YB7. The rigorous experimental approach, combining genetic, biochemical, and molecular analyses, provides a robust foundation for these findings. The research achieves its objectives, offering new insights into chlorophyll biosynthesis regulation, with the results convincingly supporting the authors' conclusions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strengths include the detailed experimental design and the findings regarding OsNF-YB7's inhibitory role.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, the manuscript's discussion on the practical implications for agriculture and the evolutionary analysis of regulatory mechanisms could be expanded.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comments and suggestions. In the revised manuscript, we discussed the potential application of the chlorophyllous embryo (please see line 270-274). The presence of chlorophyll in the embryo facilitates photosynthesis at early developmental stages, potentially leading to improved seedling growth and vigor (Smolikova and Medvedev, 2016). In crops such as soybean and canola, green embryo is considered as a valuable trait due to its association with enhanced photosynthetic capacity, which consequently promotes fatty acid biosynthesis (Ruuska et al., 2004). However, chlorophyll degradation must be carefully managed during seed maturation to avoid negative effects on seed viability and meal quality (Chung et al., 2006). Interestingly, the green embryo of lotus (<italic>Nelumbo nucifera</italic>) is widely used as a food ingredient in Asian, Australia, and North America. It is employed in herbal medicine to treat nervous disorders, insomnia, and other conditions (Zhu et al., 2017; Ha et al., 2022), highlighting the significant potential value of the green embryo.</p>
<p>In many chloroembryophytes, such as Arabidopsis, the embryo occupies a large proportion of the seed. From an evolutionary perspective, the presence of chlorophyll in the embryo may promote adaptation in such chloroembryophytes because more reserves can be accumulated in the seed through active photosynthesis, better supporting the embryo development and subsequent seedling growth (Sela et al., 2020). On the other hand, some leucoembryophytes, such as rice, have persistent endosperm rich in storage reserves to nourish embryo development (Liu et al., 2022). Gaining the ability to accumulate chlorophyll in the embryo is unnecessary for such species. In agreement with this hypothesis, cholorophyllous embryos are more prevalent in non-endospermous seeds (Dahlgren, 1980). However, we would like to emphasize that the evolutionary force driving the divergence of chloroembryophytes and leucoembryophytes is currently almost completely unknown and deserves in-depth investigation in the future. We discussed the possible evolution of the ability to accumulate chlorophyll in the embryo, please find the details in Line 276-295.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors set out to establish the role of the rice LEC1 homolog OsNF-YB7 in embryo development, especially as it pertains to the development of photosynthetic capacity, with chlorophyll production as a primary focus.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The results are well-supported and each approach used complements each other. There are no major questions left unanswered and the central hypothesis is addressed in every figure.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are a handful of sections that could use clarifying for readers, but overall this is a solidly composed manuscript.</p>
<p>The authors clearly achieved their aims; the results compellingly establish a disparity between how this system operates in rice and Arabidopsis. Conclusions are thoroughly supported by the provided data and interpretations. This work will force a reconsideration of the value of Arabidopsis as a model organism for embryo chlorophyll biosynthesis and possibly photosynthesis during embryo maturation more broadly, as rice is a major crop organism and it very clearly does not follow the Arabidopsis model. It will thus be useful to carry out similar tests in other organisms rather than relying on Arabidopsis and attempting to more fully establish the regulatory mechanism in rice.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your positive comments. We have carefully revised the manuscript according to your and the other reviewers’ comments and suggestions. Particularly, we emphasized the necessary to carry out similar tests in other organisms rather than relying on Arabidopsis to better understand the regulatory mechanism in rice.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors set out to understand the mechanisms behind chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice, focusing in particular on the role of OsNF-YB7, an ortholog of Arabidopsis LEC1, which is a positive regulator of chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. They showed that OsNF-YB7 loss-of-function mutants in rice have chlorophyll-rich embryos, in contrast to Arabidopsis LEC1 loss-of-function mutants. This contrasting phenotype led the authors to carry out extensive molecular studies on OsNF-YB7, including in vitro and in vivo protein interaction studies, gene expression profiling, and protein-DNA interaction assays. The evidence provided well supported the core arguments of the authors, emphasising that OsNF-YB7 is a negative regulator of Chl biosynthesis in rice embryos by mediating the expression of OsGLK1, a transcription factor that regulates downstream Chl biosynthesis genes. In addition, they showed that OsNF-YB7 interacts with OsGLK1 to negatively regulate the expression of OsGLK1, demonstrating the broad involvement of OsNF-YB7 in rice Chl biosynthetic pathways.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study clearly demonstrated how OsNF-YB7 regulates its downstream pathways using several in vitro and in vivo approaches. For example, gene expression analysis of OsNF-YB7 loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants revealed the expression of selected downstream chl biosynthetic genes. This was further validated by EMSA on the gel. The authors also confirmed this using luciferase assays in rice protoplasts. These approaches were used again to show how the interaction of OsNF-YB7 and OsGLK1 regulates downstream genes. The main idea of this study is very well supported by the results and data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, it is interesting to see how two similar genes have come to play opposite roles in Arabidopsis and rice. It would have been more interesting if the authors had carried out a cross-species analysis of AtLEC1 and OsNF-YB7. For example, overexpressing AtLEC1 in an osnf-yb7 mutant to see if the phenotype is restored or enhanced. Such an approach would help us understand how two similar proteins can play opposite roles in the same mechanism within their respective plant species.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your insightful comments and suggestions. It is a very interesting question whether <italic>AtLEC1</italic> can fully restore <italic>osnf-yb7</italic>, given the possible functional divergence between the genes in terms of regulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis in the embryo. We have previously expressed <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> in the <italic>lec1-1</italic> background in Arabidopsis, driven by the native promoter of <italic>LEC1</italic> (Niu et al., 2021). We found that <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> could almost completely rescue the embryo defects in Arabidopsis, indicating that <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> plays a resemble role in rice as the <italic>LEC1</italic> does in Arabidopsis (Niu et al., 2021). We sought to determine whether <italic>AtLEC1</italic> can complement the chlorophyll defect in <italic>osnf-yb7</italic>. However, given the fact that <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> shows severe callus induction defect, which is not surprising, because many studies have shown that <italic>LEC1</italic> is indispensable for somatic embryo development in various plant species, we are struggling to obtain the genetic materials for analysis. We have to transform <italic>OsNF-YB7pro::AtLEC1</italic> into the WT background first, and then cross the transformant with the <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> mutant. This is a time-consuming process in rice, but hopefully we will able to isolate a line expressing <italic>OsNF-YB7pro::AtLEC1</italic> in the <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> background from the resulting segregating population.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>A minor comment regarding the chlorophyll contents quantification in the study. Line 87: &quot;The results showed that WT had an achlorophyllous embryo throughout embryonic development,....&quot; In the TEM result, chloroplast was not observed in the WT embryo sections, indicating a lack of chlorophyll-containing structures, contrary to what was found in the osnf-yb7 embryos where chloroplasts were observed.</p>
<p>The authors stated that the embryo morphologies and Chl autofluorescence data showed that WT had an achlorophyllous embryo throughout embryonic development. However, the quantification of Chl levels in Figure 1D and Figure 4C showed that WT does produce some chlorophylls, albeit at lower levels than osnf-yb7 or OSGLK-OX embryos (WT values in the two figures are slightly different). This discrepancy warrants clarification to ensure consistency and accuracy in the manuscript's findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We re-evaluated the Chl content in the embryos of WT and <italic>OsGLK1-OX</italic> mature seeds. The result confirmed our previous finding that WT embryos produce a small amount of chlorophyll (please see the updated Fig. 4C). Notably, we observed that the dark-grown etiolated plants still have measurable chlorophyll content as reported in many studies (for example, Wang et al., 2017; Yoo et al., 2019), suggesting that there is potential bias in measuring chlorophyll content using an absorbance-based approach. We assume this possibly explains the concern you have raised.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Mild editing for grammar is needed throughout, e.g. line 73, &quot;It is still a mysterious why plant species&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have carefully edited the grammar.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>As a minor point, the placement of figure panels, such as in Figure 1, is not always intuitive.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. This figure has been revised as suggested. Please see the updated Fig. 1.</p>

<p>What is the significance of the two GFP mutants in Figures 2C and 2D? Is one of those the mislabeled Flag mutant?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The lines showed in Fig. 2C and D were not mislabeled. They were two independent transgenic events, both of which showed that OsNF-YB7 inhibited the expression of <italic>OsPORA</italic> and <italic>OsLHCB4</italic> in rice. The transgenic lines overexpressing <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> tagging with the 3× Flag (<italic>NF-YB7-Flag</italic>) were also used for this experiment. In agreement, <italic>OsPORA</italic> and <italic>OsLHCB4</italic> were significantly downregulated in the three independent <italic>NF-YB7-Flag</italic> lines (Fig. S4C), confirming the results showed in Fig. 2C and D.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figures 2G and 2H, what is that enormous band at the bottom of the gel?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The bands at the bottom of the gel were free probes. We indicated this in the revised figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Not until the Materials and Methods section did I realize that any of this study was being done in tobacco; the Introduction implies it's rice vs. Arabidopsis and it might be a good idea to mention the organism of study somewhere before Figure 6.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for any confusion caused by our previous writing. While the majority of this study was performed with rice plants or protoplasts, the split complementary LUC assays and BiFC assays were performed with tobacco. We have specified these in the revised manuscript as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>It would be nice if the author could show what the phenotype is in AtLEC1 OX in osnf-yb7 and also OsNF-YB7 OX in atlec1 mutants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have previously expressed <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> in the <italic>lec1-1</italic> background of Arabidopsis, driven by the native promoter of Arabidopsis <italic>LEC1</italic> (Niu et al., 2021). Since <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> could rescue the embryo morphogenesis defects in Arabidopsis (Niu et al., 2021), we assumed that <italic>OsNF-YB7</italic> plays a similar role in rice as the <italic>LEC1</italic> does in Arabidopsis. However, it remains unknown whether expression of <italic>LEC1</italic> in <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> may restore the chlorophyllous embryo phenotype in rice. As the generation of genetic material is time-consuming, and especially given the fact that <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> has a severe callus induction defect, we are struggling to obtain the complementary line for analysis. We have to transform <italic>OsNF-YB7pro::AtLEC1</italic> in a WT background first, and then cross the transformant with the <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> mutant. Hopefully, we will be able to isolate a line expressing <italic>OsNF-YB7pro::AtLEC1</italic> in <italic>osnf-yb7</italic> background, from the derived segregating population. We discussed the reviewer’s concern in the revised manuscript, please see Line 369-376.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 46, I think it is vague to mention that 'Like most plant species'. Some species might have different copy numbers, for example, a single GLK in liverwort M. polymorpha.</p>

<p>The statement has been revised. Please see Line 46.</p>

<p>Figures 2F and 5B, why was only one promoter region used for OsLHCB4? It would be better to have more regions like OsPORA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. Here, we have examined more promoter regions (P1, P2 and P3) in the revised manuscript as suggested, among which, the previously selected promoter region (P3) contains both the G-box and CCAATC motifs that can be potentially recognized by GLK1. Consistent to our previous report, the results showed that OsNF-YB7 (left) and OsGLK1 (right) were associated with the P3 region, but showed no significant differences in the other probes. Please see the results in Fig. 2F and Fig. 5B of the revised manuscript.</p>
