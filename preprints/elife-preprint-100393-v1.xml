<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Saprolegnia parasitica</italic> (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic>) is one of the most virulent oomycete species in freshwater aquatic environments, causing severe saprolegniasis and leading to significant economic losses in the aquaculture industry. Thus far, the prevention and control of saprolegniasis face a shortage of medications. Linalool, a natural antibiotic alternative found in various essential oils, exhibits promising antimicrobial activity against a wide range of pathogens. In this study, the specific role of linalool in protecting <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection at both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> levels was investigated. Linalool showed multifaceted anti-oomycetes potential by both of antimicrobial efficacy and immunomodulatory efficacy. For <italic>in vitro</italic> test, linalool exhibited strong anti-oomycetes activity and mode of action included: (1) Linalool disrupted the cell membrane of the mycelium, causing the intracellular components leak out; (2) Linalool prohibited ribosome function, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis and ultimately affecting mycelium growth. Surprisingly, meanwhile we found the potential immune protective mechanism of linalool in the <italic>in vivo</italic> test: (1) Linalool enhanced the complement and coagulation system which in turn activated host immune defense and lysate <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> cells; (2) Linalool promoted wound healing, tissue repair, and phagocytosis to cope with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection; (3) Linalool positively modulated the immune response by increasing the abundance of beneficial Actinobacteriota; (4) Linalool stimulated the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to lyse <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> cells. In all, our findings showed that linalool possessed multifaceted anti-oomycetes potential which would be a promising natural antibiotic alternative to cope with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection in the aquaculture industry.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Saprolegniasis is one of the most serious oomycete diseases in the aquaculture industry all over the world, infecting a wide host range (fish, crustaceans, amphibians, and their eggs et al.) with a conspicuous symptom (grayish-white cotton wool-like covering on the surface of host)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Oomycete infections lead to significant economic losses and serious damage to natural ecosystems[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. As the infection intensifies, saprolegniasis can cause muscle ulceration, compromised immune system, respiratory problems, secondary infection, and finally result in host death[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. <italic>Saprolegnia</italic>, <italic>Achlya</italic>, and <italic>Leptolegnia</italic> are key pathogens responsible for Saprolegniasis outbreaks[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], among them, <italic>Saprolegnia</italic> is proven to be the most virulent[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>ferax</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>delica</italic>, and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>diclina</italic> are the main pathogens causing saprolegniasis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], as a highly virulent group belonging to the phylum Oomycota, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> serves as the primary species in fish infections[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>In the past, malachite green was highly effective in controlling <italic>saprolegnia</italic> infections, however, it has been banned worldwide for its carcinogenic and toxicological effects, which led to a sharp re-emergence of <italic>Saprolegnia</italic> infections in aquaculture industry[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Recently, various methods have been established to deal with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infections, mainly including physical (water quality management, temperature control, and so on), chemical (hydrogen peroxide, natural antimicrobial compounds, and so on), and biological (probiotics, antagonistic microbe, and so on) methods[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Among these, antibiotics have served as the primary therapeutic and prophylactic tools for Saprolegniasis management in aquaculture. However, their overuse and abuse have resulted in antibiotic resistance among various aquatic pathogens[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Therefore, the increasing need for sustainable and eco-friendly strategies to combat <italic>saprolegnia</italic> infections has driven research into natural antimicrobial agents, due to their advantages in terms of avoiding antibiotic resistance issues, health safety, and ecological sustainability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>In our earlier studies, the anti-oomycetes activities of 12 plant essential oils (EOs) and 5 of their major compounds (linalool, pinene, limonene, myrcene, and terpinene) were evaluated, and we found that linalool was one of the strongest anti-oomycetes compounds and selected for further study. Linalool, a monoterpene alcohol found in various EOs, has shown promising antimicrobial activity against a wide range of pathogens[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Our groups and other research teams have reported that linalool exhibits antimicrobial activity against bacteria such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], <italic>Elizabethkingia miricola</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], <italic>Pseudomonas fragi</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], <italic>staphylococcus aureus</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], <italic>Brochothrix thermosphacta</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] and <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], as well as against oomycetes like <italic>Colletotrichum lagenarium</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] and <italic>Phytophthora capsici</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], and fungi including <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], <italic>Penicillium citrinum</italic>, <italic>Chaetomium globosum</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], <italic>Colletotrichum gloesporioides</italic>, <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] and <italic>Candida albicans</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>In our previous study, we found that linalool exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>ferax</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], while whether it is also a promising agent against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic>, another key virulent pathogen for <italic>Saprolegniasis</italic>is is still unknown, and the detailed mechanism, especially the <italic>in vivo</italic> immune mechanism induced by linalool remains poorly understood. Thus, in this study we focused on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> and aimed to investigate the specific role of linalool in protecting <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection at both of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> level by using different technologies, including <italic>in situ</italic> fluorescence observation, microstructure observation, Molecular Docking, AlphaFold2, transcriptome profiling, histological examinations, gut microbiota analysis, and deep bioinformatics analysis. We believe this study will shed light on the antimicrobial activity and mode of action of linalool against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic>, and contribute to the development of novel antibiotic alternative strategies to cope with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection in aquaculture industry.</p>

<p>Linalool exhibited the MIC and MFC of 0.025% and 0.025% (v/v, 0.216 mg/mL) against spores, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Besides, both the MIC and MFC against mycelium growth were 0.05% (v/v, 0.432 mg/mL) and 0.1% (v/v, 0.864 mg/mL), respectively. Various linalool doses were examined against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> CQT2 on linalool-containing plates to evaluate their impact on inhibiting mycelium growth. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-D</xref>, the findings indicated the anti-oomycetes activity of linalool against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> CQT2 was dose-dependent. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> displayed mycelium growth on PDA plates under varying linalool concentrations. The viability of mycelium following linalool treatment was assessed using a PI staining assay, where non-viable (dead) mycelium appeared red after PI uptake. Untreated mycelium showed no detectable red fluorescent, indicating 100% viability. In contrast, distinct red fluorescent mycelium was observed after linalool treatment at both MIC and 2×MIC levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>

<p>The <italic>in situ</italic> fluorescence observations were displayed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, with linalool treatment for 0 minutes, the mycelium structure remained undamaged, and the red and green fluorescence showed an even distribution. After 2 min, red fluorescence started appearing within the mycelium, accompanied by the entry of the styryl dye FM4-64, indicating damage to the cell membrane. As the duration of linalool treatment increased, the intensity of red fluorescence within the mycelium also increased, indicating a rise in the number of mycelial cell deaths along with severe damage to the cell membrane. When examined by SEM, the mycelium exhibited a smooth and intact surface in the control group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), while in the treated groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), it appeared wrinkled, deformed, and shrunken (Red dashed quadrilateral). When examined by TEM, the untreated mycelium cell exhibited clear and intact ultrastructure in the cell membrane, cell wall, mitochondria, and rough endoplasmic reticulum (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). However, after treatment with linalool, the cell membrane was wrinkled and seriously damaged, and mitochondria began to dissolve (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F-G</xref>, the cell membrane structure disappeared, the cell wall became thinner, and some exhibited severe deformation and bending. Vacuoles appeared in the cytoplasm, and mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum ruptured and dissolved (red circles). No intact organelles were present within the cytoplasm.</p>

<p>As shown in the GO classification analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), the cellular components were distributed across 8 groups, with “cell part” and “membrane part” being the most prevalent. The DEPs related to intrinsic component of membrane were screened out, categorizing them into 4 classes: related to ribosome function, related to DNA/RNA function, related to signal transduction and regulation, and related to cell metabolism (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). Therefore, the cell membrane may be a potential target for linalool.</p>

<label>2.3</label><title>The <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-oomycete mechanisms revealed by transcriptome analysis</title>
<p>As shown in Figure S1A-B, a total of 4142 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were discovered between the control and treatment groups, with 2016 showing upregulation and 2108 downregulation. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref> presented the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the functional aspects of genes and their products. These DEGs were categorized into 20 GO categories, with 6 associated with biological activities, where cellular and metabolic functions had the most DEGs. There were also 6 molecular function categories, with catalytic activity and binding containing the majority of DEGs. Additionally, Figure S1C demonstrated the results of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation, revealing 10 metabolic (M) pathways, 2 environmental information processing (EIP) pathways, 2 cellular processes (CP), and 5 genetic information processing (GIP).</p>

<label>2.3.1</label><title>The ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> were prohibited by linalool</title>
<p><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref> displayed the results of GO enrichment analysis, revealing the top 20 biological processes that differed significantly between the control and treated groups. Notably, in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, the downregulated biological processes are highlighted, and remarkably, 19 of them were associated with “ribosome”, such as ribosome biogenesis, ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, pre ribosome, and small-subunit process some. In addition, KEGG enrichment analysis in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> revealed that “Ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes” was the most enriched pathway, aligning with the GO enrichment analysis results mentioned earlier. The pathway of ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) showed that linalool influenced DNA transcription, tRNA transport, rRNA processing and maturation (5.8S, 18S, and 25S), and the biogenesis and assembly of ribosome subunits (40S and 60S) in the cell, which might lead to the reduction of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> growth. We found that many DEGs related to ribosome biogenesis and RNA polymerase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) are down expressed. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> highlighted the upregulated biological processes, and notably, 11 of them were linked to “amino acids”, such as the sulfur amino acid, L-phenylalanine, alpha-amino acid, tyrosine, and homocysteine. Amino acids serve essential roles within the cell, acting as both the foundational components for synthesizing new proteins and as precursors for various metabolic processes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>].</p>

<p>Molecular docking was carried out to explore the specific binding protein of linalool with ribosome. The binding energy of linalool was -6.2 kcal/mol with NOP, -4.8 kcal/mol with SNU13, and -5.0 kcal/mol with DKC1 (Table S1). Consequently, NOP1 was selected as the receptor protein for subsequent molecular docking. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> illustrated the tertiary structure of ribosomal protein NOP1. Linalool formed hydrogen bonds with glutamic acid (Glu155) and phenylalanine (Phe156) of NOP1 while exhibiting hydrophobic interactions with alanine (Ala181), arginine (Arg182), valine (Val201), and isoleucine (Ile209) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). In summary, this interference may hinder the ribosome’s ability to execute normal biological processes, such as protein synthesis, thereby impacting the growth and reproduction of oomycetes.</p>

<label>2.3.2</label><title>The global metabolisms of <italic>S. parasitica</italic> were regulated by linalool</title>
<p>In KEGG enrichment analysis, we found that 6 processes were associated with metabolic pathways, such as cysteine and methionine metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, and sulfur metabolism. Moreover, metabolic pathways were the most annotated pathway which was in line with the results of KEGG annotation analysis.

In PC group, severe kidney damage was evident, characterized by enlarged glomeruli, glomerular cysts, interstitial bleeding, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. In addition, extensive vacuolation and expansion of intercellular space was observed in hepatocytes, with nuclei displaced toward one side. Cytoplasmic pyknosis and structural disintegration were observed in the pancreatic acinar cells. Meanwhile, the red and white pulp of the spleen was poorly demarcated, the splenic corpuscle was irregularly shaped and arranged, and the white pulp was structurally disrupted.

<label>2.5</label><title>The <italic>in vivo</italic> Saprolegniasis protective mechanism of linalool revealed by comparative transcriptome analysis</title>
<p>To analyze the contrasting gene-level responses in grass carp spleens, a vital immune organ, following <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection and linalool treatment, spleen samples were collected for transcriptome analysis. Compared to PC group, 2029 genes in LT group exhibited significant difference, with 809 DEGs up regulated and 1220 down regulated. Meanwhile, 671 genes were identified as significantly different, with 609 DEGs up-regulated and 618 downregulated in LP group relative to PC group (Figure S2A-B).</p>
<p>Based on the GO annotation analysis, a total of 2219 unigenes in the LT group and 520 unigenes in the LP group were classified into 3 primary functional categories (Figure S2C). Within the biological process category, “cellular process,” “metabolic process,” and “biological regulation” were the most prominent subcategories. In terms of cellular components, “membrane part” and “cell part” were highly represented. “Binding” and “catalytic activity” were the most prevalent subcategories within molecular functions. Regarding KEGG annotations, the largest cluster within organismal systems was the immune system, encompassing 209 genes (42.47%) in the LT group (Figure S2D) and 38 genes (50.00%) in the LP group (Figure S2E). In the environmental information processing category, most unigenes were associated with signal transduction, with 227 (65.60%) in the LT group and 38 genes (52.00%) in the LP group. These results suggested that the immune response and signal transduction pathways were crucial for grass carp in dealing with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infections.</p>
<p>The GO enrichment analysis of the spleens illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref> to reveal distinct biological process. Those down regulated biological process were shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, compared to PC group, the “positive regulation of immune system process” term (GO:0002684) and “regulation of body fluid levels” term (GO:0050878) were enriched with the greatest number of DEGs in LT group. It is worth noting that there are 9 terms related to “body fluids (especially blood)”, such as regulation of coagulation (GO:0050818), blood coagulation (GO:0007596), and regulation of hemostasis (GO:1900046). In addition, those up regulated biological process, the “ion binding” term (GO:0043167) was enriched with the greatest number of DEGs in LT group. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> illustrated the GO terms with the largest number of down regulated DEGs in LP group was “small molecule binding” (GO:0036094).</p>
<p>KEGG enrichment analysis was used to explore the functional pathways involving DEGs. The 20 significantly enriched up regulated and down regulated pathways of each group are shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-D</xref>. Multiple pathways associated with immune response were enriched in down regulated genes after linalool treatment in LT group, including complement and coagulation cascades, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway, T cell receptor signaling pathway, B cell receptor signaling pathway, and so on (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, Complement and coagulation cascades, and Chemokine signaling pathway were enriched with mostly up-regulated genes. Furthermore, metabolic pathways were enriched with mostly down-regulated genes in LP group. Some pathways associated with immune response were significantly enriched, such as Antigen processing and presentation, Fc epsilon RI signaling pathway, Intestinal immune network for IgA production, and so on (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed the presence of numerous immune-related genes within corresponding functional processes and pathways. The expression of <italic>fb</italic>, <italic>c1q</italic>, <italic>c2</italic>, <italic>c3</italic>, <italic>c4</italic>, <italic>c6</italic>, <italic>c7</italic>, <italic>c8A</italic>, <italic>c8b</italic>, and <italic>c9</italic> genes were up expressed. Additionally, there was a significant up expressed in the gene expression levels of coagulation factors II (thrombin), VII, VIIi, VIII, X, coagulation factor IXb and IXa, serpin peptidase inhibitor clade C/D/G/F, <italic>fga</italic>, <italic>fgb</italic>, <italic>fgg</italic>, protein C, plasminogen, and plasminogen activator (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). The differential expression of immune-related DEGs implied their role in host defense against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection.</p>
<p>To ensure the regulation of immune-related DEGs by linalool, the expression of several vital immune related genes (<italic>cfh</italic>, <italic>masp2</italic>, <italic>c1r</italic>, <italic>c3</italic>, <italic>cfb</italic>, <italic>ap-1</italic>, <italic>il-1β</italic>, and <italic>il-6</italic>) in different groups were tested by RT-qPCR assay. The results showed that the expression of these genes in the LP and LT groups significantly exceeded those in the PC group (P &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). Further exploration of immune-related genes indicated that linalool treatment promoted the expression of genes linked to the complement system and inflammatory factors. Additionally, analysis of 8 genes revealed that the real-time fluorescence quantitative analysis results were consistent with the expression trend of transcriptome analysis genes.</p>

The mycelium forms a dense structure to protect <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> spores from external factors. CLSM, SEM, and TEM observations suggested that the cell membrane of the mycelium treated with linalool was damaged, causing the intracellular components to leak out, and could not develop completely (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-G</xref>). Meanwhile, 678 genes related to the “intrinsic component of membrane” showed significant expressed in GO enrichment analysis, suggesting that linalool may enhance the expression of intracellular membrane components, reflecting its impact on cell membrane structure or function. Gao et al. illustrated that linalool caused significant damage to the cell wall/membrane of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, resulting in the lysis and death of bacterial cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].

<p>ABC transporters utilize ATP hydrolysis energy to facilitate the export of harmful compounds or essential lipids across bacterial and eukaryotic membranes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].

PDR5-related proteins in fungi played a role in excreting xenobiotics, including antifungal agents[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) transporters were typically associated with multidrug resistance, cellular detoxification, and drug metabolism[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>].

Linalool influenced DNA transcription, tRNA transport, rRNA processing and maturation (5.8S, 18S, and 25S), and the biogenesis and assembly of ribosome subunits (40S and 60S) in the cell, which might lead to the reduction of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> growth. Ribosomes are assembled logistically by more than 200 ribosomal proteins (such as NOP, RIOK, and UTP) and RNA factors in a highly coordinated manner[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Depletion of Nop-7-associated 2 (NSA2) led to decreased nascent rRNA synthesis, reduced protein synthesis, and impacted cell proliferation due to its critical role in ribosome biogenesis regulation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>].

<p>Recent studies demonstrated that the spleen serves antibacterial functions in various fish species, with a high quantity of melano-macrophages that assist in phagocytosis during the immune response[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. The rise of macrophages and the change in the pathological and physiological circumstances in fish are correlated[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>].

Here we used comparative transcriptome analysis to investigate potential genes and signaling pathways regulated by linalool in the spleen of grass carp. Several genes associated with both innate and adaptive immunity, such as complement molecules, pattern recognition receptors, inflammatory cytokines, immunoglobulins, and chemokines, were differentially expressed as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E-G</xref>.</p>
<sec id="s3b1">
<label>3.2.1</label><title>Enhancement of complement and coagulation system</title>
<p>It is widely acknowledged that the complement and coagulation system in fish is an important immune defense mechanism for fighting pathogens and maintaining immune homeostasis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. The complement system is made up of over 30 different proteins (complement receptors, internal components, and regulatory proteins) and 3 activation pathways (the classic pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. In our study, the expression of <italic>fb</italic>, <italic>c1q</italic>, <italic>c2</italic>, <italic>c3</italic>, <italic>c4</italic>, <italic>c6</italic>, <italic>c7</italic>, <italic>c8a</italic>, <italic>c8b</italic>, and <italic>c9</italic> genes were all up regulated after linalool therapeutic. Meanwhile, the c3a anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor (<italic>c3aar1</italic>) and mannan-binding lectin serine protease 2 (<italic>masp2</italic>) genes were up expressed. During complement activation, <italic>c3</italic> and <italic>c5</italic> split into molecules such as <italic>c3a</italic>, <italic>c3b</italic>, <italic>c5a</italic>, and <italic>c5b</italic>, of which <italic>c3a</italic> and <italic>c5a</italic> are considered strong inflammatory mediators because of their ability to attract leukocytes and promote inflammation and pathogen clearance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. <italic>masp2</italic> activates complement components such as <italic>c4</italic> and <italic>c2</italic>, triggering a complement cascade reaction that ultimately leads to pathogen rupture[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. <italic>c8b</italic> is a subunit of the complement component 8 (<italic>c8</italic>) protein, which helps form the membrane attack complex (MAC) for cell lysis and immune defense against microbes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. In addition, high expression of complement factor H like 3 (<italic>chfl3</italic>) prevents overactivation of the complement system to avoid damage to their own tissues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. The effective antimicrobial role of the <italic>c5a</italic>-<italic>c5ar1</italic> signaling pathway in the complement system has been identified. It functions by enhancing neutrophil phagocytosis of fungi and macrophage-mediated fungicidal activity to combat fungal infections[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. In all, our findings suggested that linalool may enhance the complement system which in turn activated host immune defense and lysate <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> cells.</p>
<p>The coagulation cascades are connected with the complement system.

<p>Gut microbiota controls host growth and health status through various pathways[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. Firstly, in our study, the function of gut microbiota is mainly enriched in metabolic-related pathways linalool increased the abundance of the beneficial phylum Actinobacteriota and decreased the abundance of the harmful phylum Verrucomicrobiota. Actinobacteriota plays a crucial role because Actinobacteria can produce enzymes, antibiotics, Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), signaling molecules, and immunomodulators[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. Meanwhile, Actinobacteriota correlated positive with the complement and coagulation system according to the correlation analysis. Secondly, intestinal IgA production was correlated significantly with Proteobacteria which are the primary inducers of IgA production by B cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>].

<label>3.2.3</label><title>Regulation of Inflammatory Factors</title>
<p>Pattern Recognition Receptors (PPRs) detect and initiate multiple signaling pathways upon recognizing Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) on the surface of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.), inducing subsequent host immune responses[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>].

<label>4.</label><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In summary, our study proved that linalool is an effective natural antimicrobial agent against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic>. Linalool disrupted the cell membrane, resulting in the leakage of cellular components and restricting ribosomal function, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. Comprehensive analyses revealed the specific role of linalool in protecting <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection skin inflammation in grass carp. Meanwhile, the complement and coagulation systems, inflammatory factors, along with Actinobacteriota, significantly involved in this protective effect (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Further investigation would be carried out to explore and refine how linalool affects the inflammatory effects of <italic>S. parasitica</italic> on fish through signaling pathways and mechanisms. We believe that this study will contribute to developing an innovative alternative strategy, distinct from antibiotics, to cope with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> infection in the aquaculture industry.</p>

<p><italic>S</italic>. <italic>parasitica</italic> used in this study was from our lab, which was isolated from grass carp (<italic>Ctenopharyngodon idella</italic>). Linalool (0.862g/mL), pinene (0.874g/mL), limonene (0.842g/mL), myrcene (≥95%), terpinene (≥95%), resazurin dye, and Prodium iodide (PI) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). SYTO 9 and FM4-64 were purchased from ThermoFisher (USA). Potato dextrose agar (PDA) and glucose yeast extract (GY) were purchased from Guangdong Huankai Microbial Sci. and Tech. Co., Ltd, China.</p>

<label>5.2</label><title>Agar diffusion assay</title>
<p>The anti-oomycetes effects of EOs and 5 components (linalool, terpinene, limonene, myrcene, and pinene) were assessed by using the agar diffusion method. Initially, a 6 mm mycelium plug was inoculated at the center of the plates. Subsequently, 6 mm sterile filter paper discs were soaked in EOs and components for more than 12 h and placed symmetrically at a distance of 2.5 cm from the target mycelium plug. Sterile distilled water was used as negative control. Finally, the width of the colonies was measured once the mycelium in the control group was completely covered the plate.</p>

<label>5.3</label><title>Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) assays</title>
<p>To determine the MIC and MFC of linalool on mycelium, 6 mm mycelium plugs were inoculated into a 24 well cell culture plate. The wells contained linalool at concentrations of 0.8%, 0.4%, 0.2%, 0.1%, 0.05%, 0.025%, 0.0125%, and 0.00625%, dissolved in 1% Tween 20 and potato dextrose broth (PDB). Wells without mycelium plugs were served as negative controls. After incubating at 25°C for 48 h, the lowest concentration of linalool with no visible mycelium growth was recorded as MIC. Mycelium plugs showing no growth at this MIC concentration were then inoculated onto PDA plates and incubated for 7 days at 25°C to determine MFC.</p>
<p>The method for spores induction is similar as previously described by our previous research[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. In a 96-well cell culture plate, 100 μL of linalool at concentrations of 0.4%, 0.2%, 0.1%, 0.05%, 0.025%, 0.0125%, 0.00625%, and 0.003125% were dissolved in 1% Tween 20 and GY were added initially to each well, followed by the addition of 100 μL of spore suspension at a concentration of 1×10<sup>6</sup> spores/mL to each well. Malachite green and Tween 20 served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Following a 24-hour incubation at 20°C, 5 μL of resazurin dye was added. When the color of the wells turned to pink, the linalool concentration in the first non-pink well corresponded to the MIC. The culture liquid from wells with no visible mycelium growth was streaked onto new plates. After incubating at 25°C for 7 days, the well with the lowest linalool concentration with no visible mycelium growth was determined as MFC.</p>

<p>Different concentrations of linalool were added to molten PDA plates at 50°C for quantitative assessment. A similarly sized mycelium plug was placed at the center of each plate. Once the mycelium in the control group without linalool reached the edge of the plate (approximately 60 h), the radial diameter of the mycelium was measured. The calculation of growth inhibition was determined by assessing the percentage inhibition of radial growth, as below: PIRG % = [(R1− R2)/R1] × 100%, where, R1 = radial growth of control plate (mm), R2 = radial growth of treatment plate (mm)</p>

<p>Total RNA was isolated from linalool treated (exposed to 0.5×MIC linalool for 10 minutes) and untreated control groups using the TRIzol method. The messenger RNA (mRNA) was enriched and fragmented into 200 bp fragments. These mRNA fragments were reverse-transcribed into cDNA using random primers and reverse transcriptase. The cDNA ends were modified and ligated to an adaptor. After PCR amplification and purification, Illumina sequencing was performed. Quality control removed low-quality reads. The mapped reads were assembled using StringTie. Gene expression was quantified with the transcripts-per-million-reads method to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using a threshold of |log twofold change| ≥ 2 and FDR &lt; 0.05. Afterward, functional enrichment analysis was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. KEGG pathway analysis was conducted using Goatools.

<p>This study presents <bold>useful</bold> findings on the efficacy and mechanism of linalool protection against Saprolegnia parasitica oomycetes in the grass carp model. The evidence is <bold>incomplete</bold> since the claims are partially justified, thus there is a need for more experimental data and more rigorous statistical data analysis . Revisions according to the recommendations will improve the work, making it of interest to scientists within the fields of aquaculture, ichthyology, microbiology, and drug discovery.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The work seeks to investigate the efficacy of linalool as a natural alternative for combating Saprolegnia parasitica infections, which would provide great benefit to aquaculture. This paper shows the effect of linalool in vitro using a variety of techniques including changes in S. parasitica membrane integrity following linalool exposure and alterations in cell metabolism and ribosome function. Additionally, this work goes on to show that prophylactic and concurrent treatment of linalool at the time of S. parasitica infection can improve survival and tissue damage in vivo in their grass carp infection model. The conclusions of the paper are partially supported by the data, cleaning up, clarifying, and elaborating on some aspects of this work is necessary.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors aimed to delineate the antimicrobial activity of linalool and tried to investigate the mode of action of linalool against S. parasitica infection. One of the main focuses of this work was to identify the in vitro and in vivo mechanisms associated with the protective role of linalool against S. parasitica infection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors have used a variety of techniques to prove their hypothesis.</p>
<p>(2) An adequate number of replicates were used in their studies.</p>
<p>(3) Their findings showed a protective role of linalool against oomycetes and makes it an attractive future antibiotic in the aquaculture industry.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are several weaknesses in this manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) The authors have taken for granted that the readers already know the experiments/assays used in the manuscript. There was not enough explanation for the figures as well as figure legends.</p>
<p>(2) The authors missed adding the serial numbers to the references.</p>
<p>(3) The introduction section does not provide adequate rationale for their work, rather it is focused more on the assays done.</p>
<p>(4) Full forms are missing in many places (both in the text and figure legends), also the resolution of the figures is not good. In some figures, the font size is too small.</p>
<p>(5) There is much mislabeling of the figure panels in the main text. A detailed explanation of why and how they did the experiments and how the results were interpreted is missing.</p>
<p>(6) There is not enough experimental data to support their hypothesis on the mechanism of action of linalool. Most of the data comes from pathway analysis, and experimental validation is missing.</p>
<p>Overall, the conclusions drawn by the authors are partially justified by the data. Importantly, this paper has discovered the novelty of the compound linalool as a potent antimicrobial agent and might open up future possibilities to use this compound in the aquaculture industry.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments on our manuscript. We will carefully revise this part. Actually, we used a time-lapse method to capture images at 0 minute before any drugs were added. We will change '0 min' to 'untreated,' which will further strengthen our findings.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments on our manuscript. To further strengthen Figure 4, we will use quantification of immune infiltration and histological scoring of the kidney, liver, and spleen in different groups. Additionally, we will use ImageJ software for molecular immunohistochemistry and determine the ratio of normal to abnormal cells, providing more comprehensive insights into the effects of the treatments.</p>

<p>Thank you for your comments on our manuscript. Previous researches have shown that antibiotics and other drugs can cause alterations in gut microbiota. Therefore, we plan to study the effects of linalool on gut microbiota. The results of this part were mostly built on gut microbiota sequencing and correlation analysis, we have tried several times to isolate vital microbes from the gut, but this is a very challenging work and the results were not good. Thus, in this study, we just predicted the effects of linalool on gut microbiota. In the future, we will continue to delve into interesting aspects of how linalool affects gut microbiota.</p>

<p>(6) There is not enough experimental data to support their hypothesis on the mechanism of action of linalool. Most of the data comes from pathway analysis, and experimental validation is missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments on our manuscript. We have tried our best to link transcriptomic data, pathway analysis, experimental validation. We carried out many experiments to substantiate the changes inferred from the transcriptomic data as SEM, TEM, CLSM, molecular docking, RT-qPCR, histopathological examinations. The detailed information is listed as follows. (1) As shown in Figure 2, we combined the transcriptomic data related to membrane and organelle with SEM, TEM, and CLSM images. After deep analysis of these data and observation together, we illustrated that cell membrane may be a potential target for linalool. (2) As shown in Figure 3, we carried out molecular docking to explore the specific binding protein of linalool with ribosome which were screen out as potential target of linalool by transcriptomic data. (3) As shown in Figure 5, transcriptomic data illustrated that linalool enhanced the host complement and coagulation system. To substantiate these changes, we carried out RT-qPCR to detect those important immune-related gene expressions, and found that RT-qPCR analysis results were consistent with the expression trend of transcriptome analysis genes. (4) As shown in Figure 4 and 5, transcriptomics data revealed that linalool promoted wound healing tissue repair, and phagocytosis (Figure. 5E). To ensure these, we carried out histopathological examinations, and found that linalool alleviated tissue damage caused by <italic>S. parasitica</italic> infection on the dorsal surface of grass carp and enhancing the healing capacity (Figure. 4G). But we know the antimicrobial mechanism of linalool need further investigation, we will conduct more experiments to explore the antimicrobial mechanism of action of linalool in the future.</p>
