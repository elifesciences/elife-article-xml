<title>Summary</title>
<p>Suppressive function of regulatory T (Treg) cells is dependent on signaling of their antigen receptors triggered by cognate self, dietary or microbial antigens in the form of peptide-MHC class II complexes. However, it remains largely unknown whether distinct or shared repertoires of Treg TCR are mobilized in response to different challenges in the same tissue or the same challenge in different tissues. Here we used a fixed TCRβ chain FoxP3-GFP mouse model to analyze conventional (eCD4) and regulatory (eT<sub>reg</sub>) effector TCRα repertoires in response to six distinct antigenic challenges to the lung and skin. For both subsets, we observed challenge-specific clonal expansion yielding homologous TCRα clusters within and across animals and exposure sites, which were reflected in the draining lymph nodes but not systemically. Some clusters were shared across cancer challenges, suggesting response to common tumor-associated antigens. For most challenges, eCD4 and eT<sub>reg</sub> clonal response did not overlap, indicating the distinct origin of the two cell subsets. At the same time, we observed such overlap at the sites of certain tumor challenges. The overlaps included dominant responding TCRα motif and characteristic iNKT TCRα, suggesting the tumor-induced eCD4-eT<sub>reg</sub> plasticity. Our TCRα repertoire analysis also demonstrated that distinct antigenic specificities are characteristic for eT<sub>reg</sub> cells residing in particular lymphatic tissues, regardless of the challenge, revealing the homing-specific, antigen-specific resident Treg populations. Altogether, our study highlights both challenge-specific and tissue-specific responses of Treg cells associated with distinct clonal expansions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg</sub>), which constitute 5-10% of peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are indispensable for the maintenance of immunological self-tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and regulation of ongoing immune responses to microbiotal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and foreign<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> antigens, contributing to tissue and metabolic homeostasis and regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. T<sub>reg</sub>s suppress immune responses through various mechanisms, but primarily do so via antigen-specific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> interaction with professional and non-professional antigen-presenting cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. There is considerable data suggesting that T<sub>reg</sub>s employ higher-affinity T cell receptor (TCRs) and CTLA4 to compete with conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in an antigen-specific manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Most T<sub>reg</sub> cells are produced by the thymus as a functionally distinct FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T cell subset. Thymic T<sub>reg</sub>s are generated based on positive selection against self-peptide/MHCII (pMHCII) complexes in the thymic medulla, and multiple other immune cell types may further contribute to this process, including medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), resident and immigrating dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here we investigated the TCR landscape of conventional (eCD4) and regulatory (eT<sub>reg</sub>) effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in lungs, spleen, skin, and three lymph node locations after response to six distinct antigenic challenges to the lungs or skin. We used FoxP3-GFP mice with a fixed TCRβ context and analyzed the TCRα repertoire composition for eCD4 and eTreg cells.</p>
<p>Our analysis of the TCRα repertoire on the fixed TCRβ background revealed a highly focused response, which was distinct for each of the antigenic challenges. The response was clonotypically shared between individual mice and between different tissues and formed clear convergent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> TCRα CDR3 sequence motifs responding to the challenges.</p>
<p>In conditions with such a highly convergent TCR response involving multiple independently-primed T cell clones with similar TCRα CDR3 sequences, one could expect a similar repertoire of clonotypes to dominate within the eCD4 and eT<sub>reg</sub> subpopulations, given the assumption that both subsets may start from the same pool of antigen-inexperienced naïve T cells. However, we demonstrate that the TCR landscape of eCD4 and eT<sub>reg</sub> responses was distinct, suggesting that these effector cell types originate from distinct T cell subsets.</p>
<p>The exceptions were the antigenic challenges with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and MMTV-PyMT-derived tumor cells (PYMT), where we observed increased overlap between the eCD4 and eT<sub>reg</sub> repertoires at the site of challenge, but not systemically. A dominant eCD4 TCRα motif was also present in corresponding eT<sub>reg</sub> subsets in the LLC and PYMT challenge. Similarly, the characteristic innate natural killer T cell (iNKT) TCRα variants that were abundant within eCD4 subsets upon challenge with LLC, bleomycin, and the helminth <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic> were represented in the corresponding eT<sub>reg</sub> subset in the LLC challenge experiments but not with the bleomycin and helminth antigens. We attribute these observations to the transient plasticity of effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the context of an immunosuppressive tumor burden.</p>
<p>Altogether, our results show the highly antigen-specific and distinct eCD4 and eT<sub>reg</sub> responses to different challenges, supporting the initial thymic programming of T<sub>reg</sub> cells responding to newly-incoming challenges, and suggest that the fixed TCRβ chain, FoxP3-GFP mouse offers a valuable “digital” model of TCR response that benefits from highly convergent, easy-to-track TCRα CDR3 motifs.</p>

<title>TCRα repertoire sequencing</title>
<p>Six distinct challenges including influenza virus, <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic>, bleomycin-induced injury, LLC, PYMT, and B16 melanoma were applied to the lung and skin of <italic>Foxp3</italic><sup><italic>gfp</italic></sup> <italic>Tcra</italic><sup><italic>−/+</italic></sup> mice bearing the DO11.10 TCRβ transgene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> (3–7 mice per group, see <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold> for details on each tissue and challenge experiment). After incubation, mice were sacrificed and tissue from the lungs, spleen, skin, and three types of lymph nodes (lung-draining mediastinal, MLN, axillary, AXLN, and intraglandular, IGLN) were isolated and digested to generate single-cell suspensions. T<sub>eff</sub> and T<sub>reg</sub> CD4<sup>+</sup> cells were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) based on FoxP3-GFP signal. RNA-based unique molecular identifier (UMI)-labeled TCRα cDNA libraries were obtained using a previously-reported technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> with minor modifications, and then analyzed using MIGEC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and MiXCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> software. See <bold>Graphical abstract</bold> for the experimental scheme. Altogether, we sequenced 524 TCRα cDNA libraries, yielding 13,353 ± 1,254 UMI-labeled TCRα cDNA molecules and 38,310 ± 310 TCRα CDR3 clonotypes per sample (see <bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold> for details on each cloneset).</p>
<p>Lungs are exposed to a myriad of different insults during their lifetime and are constantly in need of a T cell response to resolve inflammatory insults. Furthermore, T<sub>reg</sub>s with an effector phenotype accumulate in the inflamed lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> but it remains poorly understood whether there is a common antigenic denominator driving TCR specificities in the tissue or whether there are selective TCR subsets expanded upon a particular inflammatory insult. Therefore, in the following analyses, we mainly focused on TCR repertoires obtained from T cells infiltrating the lung tissue, for which we have also obtained the largest collection of samples, with several more specific cross-tissue analyses showing the similarity of systemic T cell responses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Clonality of eCD4 and eT<sub>reg</sub> repertoires in the lung</title>
<p>First, we explored how clonal the eCD4 and eT<sub>reg</sub> response is in lungs following distinct antigenic challenges. TCRα repertoire diversity was assessed using several widely used metrics, including observed diversity (number of distinct clonotypes), normalized Shannon Wiener index (repertoire evenness and the extent of clonal expansion) and Chao 1 (estimated lower bound of total diversity based on relative representation of small clonotypes). For normalization, all of these metrics were obtained from datasets that had been down-sampled to 1,000 randomly-chosen, UMI-labeled TCRα cDNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. We observed a prominent clonal response to each of the challenges compared to the control group (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a–c</xref></bold>). The decrease in diversity metrics was comparable for the lung-infiltrating eCD4 and eT<sub>reg</sub> cells. This indicates that the amplitude and focused nature of the effector and regulatory T cell response in lungs is generally comparable.</p>

<title>Responding eCD4 and eTreg repertoires are distinct</title>
<p>Next, we analyzed all-versus-all pairwise overlap of the amino acid TCRα CDR3 repertoires of lung-infiltrating eTreg and eCD4 cells. We used F2 similarity metrics in the VDJtools software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, which employs a clonotype-wise sum of geometric mean frequencies that takes into account the relative size of shared clonotypes. As such, F2 metrics generally enable comparison of pairs of TCR repertoires with regard to the relative share occupied by common clonotypes. This analysis showed that the eT<sub>reg</sub> and eCD4 repertoires are highly distinct across distinct challenges (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,e</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>eTreg response is convergent and differs for distinct challenges</title>
<p>We next zoomed in on the eT<sub>reg</sub> repertoire in order to investigate how focused their antigen-specific response is in the lungs. Repertoire overlap analysis showed that eT<sub>reg</sub> repertoires were highly similar across mice for each of the challenges, and differed between challenges (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref></bold>). Cluster sequence analysis further revealed common dominant TCRα CDR3 motifs in response to each of the challenges (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref></bold>). It should be noted that the eT<sub>reg</sub> repertoires in the three different cancer challenges (B16, LLC, and PYMT) clustered together and shared some CDR3 motifs, suggesting response to shared tumor-associated antigens. In LLC and PYMT, but not in other challenges, some of the characteristic CDR3 motifs were shared with the eCD4 subset.</p>

<title>eTreg repertoire upon lung challenge is reflected in the draining lymph node</title>
<p>It has previously been shown in a mouse model that the antigen-specific T<sub>reg</sub> response to influenza in the lungs is also reflected in the lung-draining mediastinal lymph node (MLN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Our data revealed this at the repertoire level, showing that the same TCR clonotypes and CDR3 motifs distinguish antigen-specific eT<sub>reg</sub> response to each of the different lung challenges in the lung and MLN (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref></bold>). It should be noted that each challenge produces its own specific response, wherein eT<sub>reg</sub> TCRα CDR3 repertoires from the lung and MLN are located side by side. At the same time, the lung and MLN eT<sub>reg</sub> repertoires of control mice obtained in the absence of any antigenic challenges were distinct, confirming that repertoire similarity is dictated by corresponding antigenic challenges (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref></bold>). In contrast, the eT<sub>reg</sub> repertoires in distant AXLN and IGLN lymph nodes and the spleen were less similar to that observed in the lungs, and clustered separately (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c–e</xref></bold>). Altogether, these results demonstrate the selective tissue localization of the antigen-focused T<sub>reg</sub> response.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Repertoire focus is the same for the lung and skin tumor localization</title>
<p>The eT<sub>reg</sub> TCR repertoire in lungs (upon lung tumor challenge) and in skin (upon corresponding tumor challenge in skin) was also highly similar (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>), demonstrating that the antigen-specific character of the T<sub>reg</sub> response dominates over the tissue location of the challenge. TCR repertoires from eCD4 T cells in the lungs and MLN in response to distinct lung challenges, as well as repertoires of skin eCD4 T cells in response to various skin challenges also clustered together (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>), with a magnitude of repertoire convergence that was at the same level as for eTreg cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>eCD4 to eT<sub>reg</sub> conversion is only observed in two cancer challenges</title>
<p>As can be seen in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref></bold>, CDR3<sub>α</sub> eT<sub>reg</sub> and eCD4 amino acid repertoires in the lungs were more similar in the context of the LLC tumor challenge compared to other challenges, and this could reflect induced plasticity of the eCD4 subset. In order to assess possible eCD4-to-eT<sub>reg</sub> clonal conversion due to natural helper T cell plasticity, we analyzed eT<sub>reg</sub> versus eCD4 repertoire overlap at the level of CDR3a nucleotide clonotypes for paired eCD4-eT<sub>reg</sub> samples obtained from the same mice. Estimated eCD4-to-eT<sub>reg</sub> conversion was strongest in skin and in lung following LLC and PYMT challenge, but was low or absent in the aftermath of other antigenic challenges, including B16 tumor (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,c</xref></bold>). The effect was probably local and transient, and was not observed at systemic level in the spleen (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b,d</xref></bold>). CDR3a cluster #408 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref></bold>) was the major contributor to the observed conversion (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Global CDR3α cluster analysis revealed that characteristic eT<sub>reg</sub> TCR motifs were present in distinct lymphatic tissues, including spleen and thymus, irrespective of the applied challenge (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We observed a prominent local clonal response to different antigenic challenges within the lung. Remarkably, this effect was comparable for both lung-infiltrating eCD4 and eT<sub>reg</sub> cells, suggesting similar amplitude for the effector and regulatory response (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a–c</xref></bold>). The TCR repertoires of the eT<sub>reg</sub> and eCD4 subsets were highly distinct across antigenic challenges (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, e</xref></bold>). At the same time, eT<sub>reg</sub> repertoires were highly similar across mice for each challenge (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref></bold>), and common TCRα CDR3 motifs dominated each response (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref></bold>). That being said, the eT<sub>reg</sub> repertoires were similar for the three different cancer challenges, suggesting a response to shared tumor-associated antigens. Antigen-specific T<sub>reg</sub> response in lungs was reflected in the lung-draining MLN, but not in distant tissues including the AXLN, IGLN, and spleen (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref></bold>), showing the local character of the antigen-specific regulatory response.</p>
<p>For the LLC and PYMT tumors—but not other antigenic challenges—the overall repertoires and dominant CDR3 motifs were shared between the two subsets, suggesting induction of eCD4-eT<sub>reg</sub> plasticity. Further analysis showed that eCD4 to eT<sub>reg</sub> conversion was strongest in the skin and lung following LLC and PYMT tumor challenge, and was observed in the site of challenge but not systemically (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a–e</xref></bold>). The presence of an increased proportion of T<sub>reg</sub>-iNKT cells among the total pool of eT<sub>reg</sub> cells in the lung upon LLC challenge provided further support for the notion of tumor-induced plasticity (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f–h</xref></bold>). This observation is of particular interest in the context of recent reports on innate-like T cell anti-tumor response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The local eT<sub>reg</sub> response to a given tumor type was clonally very similar upon lung and skin challenge, showing that the antigen-specific character of the eT<sub>reg</sub> response dominates over the tissue location of the initial challenge (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Strikingly, we observed commonality between eT<sub>reg</sub> repertoires obtained from the same lymphoid tissue in different mice irrespectively of the antigenic challenge (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,b</xref></bold>). This observation indicates that distinct antigenic specificities are characteristic for T<sub>reg</sub> cells with distinct tissue residence.</p>
<p>The eCD4 subset generally exhibited similar patterns to the eT<sub>reg</sub>s, although the extent of convergence among eT<sub>reg</sub> repertoires was higher in most scenarios compared to the eCD4 subset, indicating the highly antigen-specific nature of the T<sub>reg</sub> response.</p>
<p>Altogether, our data demonstrate highly antigen-specific and distinct T<sub>eff</sub> and T<sub>reg</sub> responses to different challenges and support the use of the fixed TCRβ chain FoxP3-GFP mouse as a “digital” model of TCR response that benefits from access to highly convergent and easy-to-track TCRα CDR3 clusters.</p>

Tumor lines were trypsinized and washed with serum-free DMEM. A dose of 1× 10<sup>5</sup> cells in 200 uL DMEM was injected to each mouse intravenously (i.v) via the tail vein or subcutaneously (s.c) in right flank to induce lung or skin tumors, respectively. Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus was grown in the cavity of 10-day embryonated chicken eggs, and a dose 100 pfu in 35 uL PBS was used to challenge mice intranasally (i.n)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic> L3 stage larvae were passaged and isolated from the feces of Wistar rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. 500-700 infective L3 larvae were injected s.c to mice in 500 uL PBS. Bleomycin for injection was obtained from the pharmacy and each mouse was challenged i.n with a dose of 0.1 U in 35 uL PBS. Control mice were mock challenged with PBS. Antibodies for magnetic cell isolation and fluorescence activated cell sorting were purchased from Biolegend, Thermofisher and TONBO BIO.

<p>Lungs from all challenge groups were flushed from excess blood via intracardiac injection with 10 mL of PBS, and each lobe was cut into small pieces and digested with Collagenase A (Roche, 1mg/mL), DNAse (30 ug/mL) in DMEM 2% FBS for 30 min at 37°C in an orbital shaker. Skin tumors were dissected, minced into small pieces and digested with Collagenase A as described above for lung samples. Single cell suspensions were spun and resuspended in sterile EDTA containing FACs buffer (PBS 2% FBS, 1mM EDTA). Spleens and individual lymph nodes were dissociated with frosted glass slides into single-cell suspensions in FACS buffer. All cell suspensions were filtered with 70 uM strainers (BD Biosciences) and kept on ice until further use.</p>

In-frame TCRα and TCRβ repertoires were extracted using MiXCR software (version 3.0.13). The number of obtained UMI-labeled cDNA molecules per repertoire per sample ranged from 114 to 204,990, and the number of CDR3 clonotype variants at the nucleotide level per repertoire per sample ranged from 2 to 38,310.

As a baseline, we used random mouse TCRα VDJ rearrangements. Each cluster was assigned a frequency based on the total frequency of T cells encoding corresponding CDR3s within a sample. The CDR3 cluster frequency matrix was then subjected to hierarchical clustering using the ‘aheatmap’ R package with default parameters.</p>

<p>This manuscript presents a <bold>valuable</bold> approach to exploring CD4+ T-cell response in mice across stimuli and tissues through the analysis of their T-cell receptor repertoires. The authors use a transgenic mouse model, in which the possible diversity of the T-cell receptor repertoire is reduced, such that each of a diverse set of immune exposures elicits more detectably consistent T-cell responses across different individuals. However, whereas the proposed experimental system could be utilized to study convergent T-cell responses, the analyses done in this manuscript are <bold>incomplete</bold> and do not support the claims due to limitations in the statistical analyses and lack of data/code access.</p>

<p>The authors investigate the alpha chain TCR landscape in conventional vs regulatory CD4 T cells. Overall I think it is a very well thought out and executed study with interesting conclusions. The authors have investigated CDR3 alpha repertoires coupled with a transgenic fixed CDR3beta in a mouse system.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
- One of a kind evidence and dataset.</p>
<p>- State-of-the-art analyses using tools that are well-accepted in the literature.</p>
<p>- Interesting conclusions on the breadth of immune response to challenges across different types of challenges (tumor, viral and parasitic).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
- Some conclusions regarding the eCD4-&gt;eTreg transition are not so strong using only the data.</p>
<p>- Some formatting issues.</p>

<p>This study investigates T-cell repertoire responses in a mouse model with a transgenic beta chain, such that all T-cells in all mice share a fixed beta chain, and repertoire diversity is determined solely by alpha chain rearrangements. Each mouse is exposed to one of a few distinct immune challenges, sacrificed, and T-cells are sampled from multiple tissues. FACS is used to sort CD4 and Treg cell populations from each sample, and TCR repertoire sequencing from UMI-tagged cDNA is done.</p>
<p>Various analyses using repertoire diversity, overlap, and clustering are presented to support several principal findings: 1) TCR repertoires in this fixed beta system have highly distinct clonal compositions for each immune challenge and each cell type, 2) these are highly consistent across mice, so that mice with shared challenges have shared clones, and 3) induction of CD4-to-Treg cell type transitions is challenge-specific.</p>
<p>The beta chain used for this mouse model was previously isolated based on specificity for Ovalbumin. Because the beta chain is essential for determining TCR antigen specificity, and is highly diverse in wildtype mice, I found it surprising that these mice are reported to have robust and consistently focused clonal responses to very diverse immune challenges, for which a fixed OVA-specific beta chain is unlikely to be useful. The authors don't comment on this aspect of their findings, but I would think it is not expected *a priori* that this would work. If this does work as reported, it is a valuable model system: due to massively reduced diversity, the TCR repertoire response is much more stereotyped across individual samples, and it is much easier to detect challenge-specific TCRs via the statistics of convergent responses.</p>
<p>While the data and analyses present interesting signals, they are flawed in several ways that undermine the reported findings. I summarize below what I think are the most substantive data and analysis issues.</p>
<p>1. There may be systematic inconsistencies in repertoire sampling depth that are not described in the manuscript. Looking at the supplementary tables (and making some plots), I found that the control samples (mice with mock challenge) have consistently much shallower sampling-in terms of both read count and UMI count-compared with the other challenge samples. There is also a strong pattern of lower counts for Treg vs CD4 cell samples within each challenge.</p>
<p>2. FACS data are not reported. Although the graphical abstract shows a schematic FACS plot, there are no such plots in the manuscript. Related to the issue above, it would be important to know the FACS cell counts for each sample.</p>
<p>3. For diversity estimation, UMI-wise downsampling was performed to normalize samples to 1000 random UMIs, but this procedure is not validated (the optimal normalization would require downsampling cells). What is the influence of possible sampling depth discrepancies mentioned above on diversity estimation? All of the Treg control samples have fewer than 1000 total UMIs-doesn't that pose a problem for sampling 1000 random UMIs? Indeed, I simulated this procedure and found systematic effects on diversity estimates when taking samples of different numbers of cells (each with a simulated UMI count) from the same underlying repertoire, even after normalizing to 1000 random UMIs. I don't think UMI downsampling corrects for cell sampling depth differences in diversity estimation, so it's not clear that the trends in Fig 1A are not artifactual-they would seem to show higher diversity for control samples, but these are the very same samples with an apparent systematic sampling depth bias.</p>
<p>4. The Figures may be inconsistent with the data. I downloaded the Supplementary Table corresponding to Fig 1 and made my own version of panels A-C. This looked quite different from the diversity estimations depicted in the manuscript. The data does not match the scale or trends shown in the manuscript figure.</p>
<p>5. For the overlap analysis, a different kind of normalization was performed, but also not validated. Instead of sampling 1000 UMIs, the repertoires were reduced to their top 1000 most frequent clones. It is not made clear why a different normalization would be needed here. There are several samples (including all Treg control samples) with only a couple hundred clones. It's also likely that the noted systematic sampling depth differences may drive the separation seen in MDS1 between Treg and CD4 cell types. I also simulated this alternative downsampling procedure and found strong effects on MDS clustering due to sampling effects alone.</p>
<p>It is not made clear how the overlap scores were converted to distances for MDS. It's hard to interpret this without seeing the overlap matrix.</p>
<p>6. The cluster analysis is superficial, and appears to have been cherry-picked. The clusters reported in the main text have illegibly small logo plots, and no information about V/J gene enrichments. More importantly, as the caption states they were chosen from the columns of a large (and messier-looking) cluster matrix in the supplementary figure based on association with each specific challenge. There's no detail about how this association was calculated, or how it controlled for multiple tests. I don't think it is legitimate to simply display a set of clusters that visually correlate; in a sufficiently wide random matrix you will find columns that seem to correlate with any given pattern across rows.</p>
<p>7. The findings on differential plasticity and CD4 to Treg conversion are not supported. If CD4 cells are converting to Tregs, we expect more nucleotide-level overlap of clones. This intuition makes sense. But it seems that this section affirms the consequent: variation in nucleotide-level clone overlap is a readout of variation in CD4 to Treg conversion. It is claimed, based on elevated nucleotide-level overlap, that the LLC and PYMT challenges induce conversion more readily than the other challenges. It is not noted in the textual interpretations, but Fig 4 also shows that the control samples had a substantially elevated nucleotide-level overlap. There is no mention of a null hypothesis for what we'd expect if there was no induced conversion going on at all. This is a reduced-diversity mouse model, so convergent recombination is more likely than usual, and the challenges could be expected to differ in the parts of TCR sequence space they induce focus on. They use the top 100 clones for normalization in this case, but don't say why (this is the 3rd distinct normalization procedure).</p>
<p>Although interpretations of the reported findings are limited due to the issues above, this is an interesting model system in which to explore convergent responses. Follow-up experimental work could validate some of the reported signals, and the data set may also be useful for other specific questions.</p>

<p>Nakonechnaya et al present a valuable and comprehensive exploration of CD4+ T cell response in mice across stimuli and tissues through the analysis of their TCR-alpha repertoires.</p>
<p>The authors compare repertoires by looking at the relative overlap of shared clonotypes and observe that they sometimes cluster by tissue and sometimes by stimulus. They also compare different CD4+ subsets (conventional and Tregs) and find distinct yet convergent responses with occasional plasticity across subsets for some stimuli.</p>
<p>The observed lack of a general behaviour highlights the need for careful comparison of immune repertoires across cell subsets and tissues in order to better understand their role in the adaptive immune response.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this is an important paper to the community as it suggests several future directions of exploration.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the lack of code and data availability does not allow the reproducibility of the results.</p>
