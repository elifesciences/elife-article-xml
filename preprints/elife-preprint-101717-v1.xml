<title>Abstract</title><p>DNA replication requires Cdc45 and GINS recruitment into the MCM duplex hexamer by initiation factors to form an active helicase, the Cdc45–MCM–GINS (CMG) complex, at the replication origins. The initiation factor Sld3 is a central regulator of Cdc45 and GINS recruitment worked with Sld7 together. However, the mechanism through which Sld3 regulates CMG complex formation remains unclear. Here, we present the structure of the Sld3 Cdc45-binding-domain in complex with Cdc45 (Sld3CBD–Cdc45), showing detailed interactions and conformational changes required for binding to each other. The mutant analysis indicated that the binding between Sld3CBD and Cdc45 could be broken easily. We also revealed that Sld3CBD, GINS, and MCM bind to different sites on Cdc45 in the Sld3CDB–CMG model, indicating that after recruitment of Cdc45, Sld7–Sld3 could remain in Cdc45–MCM until CMG formation. The consistency between the particle size of Sld7–Sld3–Cdc45 and the distance between Sld3CBDs in the Cdc45–MCM dimer indicated the binding manner of the Cdc45–Sld3–[Sld7]<sub>2</sub>–Sld3–Cdc45 off/on MCM duplex hexamer. A DNA-binding assay of Sld3 and its complexes with single-stranded ARS1 fragments revealed a relationship between the dissociation of Sld7–Sld3 from CMG and the unwound single-stranded DNA. These findings help to further our understanding of the molecular basis of regulation of CMG complex formation by Sld3.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Eukaryotic chromosomal DNA replication in the cell cycle, a tightly regulated process that ensures precise gene copying, begins with the unwinding of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into signal-stranded DNA (ssDNA), including the formation of an active helicase Cdc45–MCM–GINS (CMG) complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. In the G1 phase of the yeast cell cycle, two inactive helicase Mcm2–7 hexamer rings (Mcm2–6–4–7–3–5) are loaded onto autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs) of dsDNA to form a double hexamer (MCM DH) at the replication origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. To facilitate this loading, Cdt1 binds to the Mcm2–7 hexamer ring and stabilizes a gap formation between the Mcm2 and Mcm5, which serves as a dsDNA entry gate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Next, the MCM DH on dsDNA is phosphorylated by Dbf4-dependent protein kinase (Cdc7 kinase or DDK <sup>[6F0L]</sup>) (Supplementary Figure 1A), allowing the key factor Sld3 and its partner Sld7 to recruit Cdc45 (Sld7–Sld3–Cdc45) to each MCM (Supplementary Figure 1B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Subsequently, the phosphorylation of Sld3 by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) regulates the assembly of GINS onto MCM DH with Dpb11, CDK-phosphorylated Sld2, and DNA polymerase ε to form CMG (Supplementary Figure 1C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Finally, the factors Sld2, Sld3, Sld7, and Dpb11 are released by elusive mechanisms from an active CMG and facilitate bidirectional replication by translocating along the 3′ to 5′ direction of the DNA strand (Supplementary Figure 1D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].</p>
<p>As a central regulator of CMG formation in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Sld3 functions as a bridge protein in the Sld7–Sld3–Cdc45 complex to recruit Cdc45 to DDK-phosphorylated MCM DH. This Sld3 contains three domains each of which binds mainly to one of Sld7, Cdc45, and MCM. The N-terminal domain of Sld3 (Sld3NTD: M1–L116) binds to the N-terminal domain (M1– D130) of Sld7 (Sld7NTD) (Sld7 C-terminal domain [Sld7CTD: K168–S257] is a self-dimerization domain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Following the NTD of Sld3, the middle part is a central portion known as the Cdc45-binding domain (Sld3CBD: S148–K430) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. A previous study also demonstrated that a region (L510–R530) in the Sld3 C-terminal domain (Sld3CTD: T445–T679) binds to Mcm4 and 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. CDK-dependent phosphorylation of two residues (T600 and S622) downstream of Sld3CTD initiates the binding of GINS-carrying Dpb11 to Cdc45–MCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. In addition to its role as a bridge in the recruitment of Cdc45 and GINS, Sld3 binds to two ARS1 ssDNA fragments (ssARS1-2 and ssARS1-5) but not to the corresponding dsDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. The specific association between Sld3 and ssDNA is not affected by CDK phosphorylation. Furthermore, the structures of the Sld7CTD dimer, Sld7NTD–Sld3NTD, Sld3CBD, MCM DH, and CMG were determined through crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Recent single-molecule biochemical assays have reported the stepwise recruitment of multiple Cdc45s to the MCM DH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. However, how Sld3–Sld7 brings Cdc45 into the MCM for the formation of CMG to regulate the initiation of DNA replication remains unclear.</p>
<p>In the present study, we aimed to understand how Sld3 recruits Cdc45 to the MCM DH with Sld7 for CMG formation through structure and particle analyses. The structure of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sld3CBD–Cdc45 at 2.6 Å resolution presented the detailed interactions between Sld3 and Cdc45, which were confirmed through <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> mutant analyses. Compared to the monomer structures, the conformation of Sld3CBD and Cdc45 in the Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex changed significantly to bind each other. Based on the structural similarity of Cdc45s in Sld3CBD–Cdc45 and CMG, we modelled Sld3CBD–Cdc45–MCM–dsDNA and SCMG–dsDNA (Sld3CBD–CMG– dsDNA) as a snapshot of how helicase CMG forms. The models demonstrated that Sld3CBD, MCM, and GINS bind to different sites on Cdc45, indicating that Sld7–Sld3 could remain at Cdc45–MCM until CMG formation after GINS loading. Consistency between the particle size of Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45, as per spectroscopic analysis, and the distance of Sld3CBDs in the Cdc45–MCM dimer suggested that the ternary complex of Sld7–Sld3–Cdc45 forms a dimer off/on the MCM DH for recruiting Cdc45. Furthermore, ssDNA-binding analysis of ARS1 fragments implied that the release of Sld3–Sld7 could be associated with ssARS1 unwound by CMG. Our findings illustrate the recruit–release function of Sld3 in CMG formation and expand our knowledge of the initiation process of DNA replication.</p>

<title>Overall structure of Sld3CBD and Cdc45 complex</title>
<p>We obtained a recombinant Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and determined its crystal structure at 2.6 Å resolution using molecular replacement (Supplementary Figure 2 A, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Only one complex exists within an asymmetric unit. Similar to monomer Sld3CBD (PDBID: 3WI3 with RMSD of 0.50 Å for 181 Cα atoms) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], Sld3CBD (Y154–P420) in the Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex is an α-helical structure with two disordered regions of R317–S336 and P364–A369, but with a significant difference in that a disordered part in monomer Sld3CBD was visualized as a C-terminal part of bent long helix α8 (F294–R316; referred to as α8CTP) (Supplementary Figures 3A and 4). Cdc45 (M1–L650) is an α/β structure composed of three β-sheets (parallel: β1-β6-β5-β4-β2-β3, anti-parallel: β7-β8, mixed: β10-β11-β12-β14-β13) surrounded by 21 α-helixes. Owing to the poor electron density map, the regions D106–K110, D166–K227, S306–V310, and T438–D460 on the molecular surface could not be built. In contrast to the monomer huCdc45 and the CMG form (Cdc45 in the CMG complex), more than the N-terminal half of the protruding long helix α7 was disordered in the Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex (Supplementary Figures 3B and 5).</p>

<title>Conformation changes in Sld3CBD and Cdc45 for binding each other</title>
<p>Sld3CBD binds to Cdc45 in a similar way to a toothed gear (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> right panel), with a contact surface of 1808 Å<sup>2</sup> accounting for approximately 13.3% and 7.0% of the total surface of Sld3CBD and Cdc45, respectively. Two helixes (α8 and α9) of Sld3CBD formed a plier structure and gripped the C-terminal domain DHHA1 (R523–L650) of Cdc45 through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. The C-terminal loop (L646–L650) and the C-terminal part of α7 (E232–S242) of Cdc45 sandwiched the helix α8CDP of Sld3CBD. Compared to the isolated form (PDBIDs: 5DGO for huCdc45 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] and 6CC2 for EhCdc45 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]) and the CMG form (PDBID: 3JC6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]), the Cdc45 in the Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex changed the conformation of DHHA1 to form pockets on its two sides for binding Sld3CBD α8CTP and α9. The remaining part of Cdc45 (∼K517) retained a structure with RMSD values of 1.29 Å (isolated huCdc45), 1.81 Å (isolated EhCdc45), and 1.295 Å (in CMG) for 243, 251, and 361 Cα atoms, respectively.</p>
<p>The helix α8CTP (F294–R316) of Sld3CBD was surrounded by the C-terminal domain DHHA1 and a C-terminal part of the protruded long helix α7 (E232–S242) of Cdc45 but completely disordered in Sld3CBD alone (PDBID: 3WI3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> right panel and 1B and Supplementary Figure 3A). Therefore, the helix α8CTP seems to be an intrinsically disordered segment that lacks an ordered conformation alone but folds into a helix coupled to the binding partner in the Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex. This α8CTP is essential for binding to Cdc45, as its deletion inhibited cell growth in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. For binding to Sld3CBD α8CTP, loop I595– N604 in Cdc45 DHHA1 changed conformation to interact with Sld3CBD α8CTP. Subsequent the following helix α20 (F605–E615) rotated the C-terminus by 25 degrees, which altered the conformation of the next two β-strands (β13 and β14) in the mixed β-sheet (β10-β11-β12-β14-β13) (Supplementary Figure 3C), allowing Sld3CBD α8CTP to enter the binding pocket. Furthermore, proline substitution for Cdc45 Ser242 (Cdc45-35), which interacts with L307 and T310 in Sld3CBD α8CTP, conferred temperature-sensitive growth to yeast cells (Supplementary Figure 6). Although an increase in the number of copies of Sld3–Sld7 could weakly suppress cell growth defects, it did not recover the disrupted interaction.</p>
<p>The α9 (L337–E360) of Sld3CBD is the secondary Cdc45-binding region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C and D</xref> and Supplementary Figure 7), which is located in a shallow dent formed by the C-terminal helix and a loop with the following β-strand (K520–Q531) of Cdc45 DHHA1. Three hydrophobic residues (I352, I355, and L356) in Sld3CBD α9 interact with the C-terminal helix (L522, L527, V529, L641, and L647) of Cdc45 DHHA1, while the side chains of two negatively charged residues (D344 and D348) form hydrogen bonds through a water molecule to the main and side chains of R523 on a loop of Cdc45 DHHA1. A disordered region, L527–V529, of Cdc45 DHHA1 in the isolated form forms a β-sheet in the Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex and binds to the I352 and I355 of Sld3CBD α9. We substituted single, double, or ternary positively charged or hydrophilic residues at D344, D348, I352, I355, and L356 of Sld3CBD α9 (D344R/D348R: Sld3-2R, I352Y: Sld3-Y, I352S/I355S/L356S: Sld3-3S, I352E/I355E/L356E: Sld3-3E). Based on the CD spectra, we confirmed that those mutants keep the structural elements of Sld3CBD (Supplementary Figure 8). Double and ternary mutants Sld3-2R, Sld3-3S, and Sld3-3E eliminated Cdc45-binding affinity, whereas the single mutant Sld3-Y seemed to retain a faint interaction with Cdc45 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We also substituted the single, double, or ternary residues R523, L522, L527, V529, L637, and L641 of Cdc45 on Sld3CBD α9 binding sites (L637S/L641S: Cdc45-IIS, L637E/L641E: Cdc45-IIE, L522S/L527S/V529S: Cdc45-IIIS, L522E/L527E/V529E: Cdc45-IIIE, and Cdc45-A: R523A). All Cdc45 mutants disrupted the binding between Sld3CDB and Cdc45, except for Cdc45-A, as surmised from the Sld3CBD–Cdc45 structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Although mutant Cdc45-A had reduced hydrogen bonds with D344, the remaining hydrogen-bond network maintained contact between Sld3CBD and Cdc45. Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic studies confirmed the importance of these Sld3 residues. By expressing Sld3-3S, Sld3-3E, and Sld3-2R in Sld3, the variant strains caused complete cell death, whereas the Sld3-Y strain maintained cell growth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that these residues are required to work together to bind Cdc45, and the loss of the Cdc45-binding capacity of Sld3 inhibits the recruitment of Cdc45 and the subsequent formation of the active replicative helicase CMG for DNA replication.</p>

<title>Cdc45 recruitment to MCM DH by Sld3 with partner Sld7</title>
<p>Except for the Sld3 binding region DHHA1, the N-terminal domain of Cdc45 (Cdc45NTD) maintained a structure similar to that of the monomer, Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex, and CMG complex. Therefore, we modelled Sld3CBD–Cdc45–MCM–dsDNA and SCMG–dsDNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) by superposing Cdc45NTD structures between Sld3CBD–Cdc45 and CMG dimers, which were modelled by superposing Mcm2–7 structures between CMG (PDBID: 3JC6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] and MCM– dsDNA (PDBID: 5BK4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. In the models, two Sld3CBDs are located in each monomer of the Cdc45–MCM dimer over 230 Å apart (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate how Sld7–Sld3 brings Cdc45 to MCM DH, we attempted particle analysis for the Sld7–Sld3-Cdc45 complex using the purified recombinant Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45. The approximate molecular weight of Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 was estimated to be &gt;400 kDa according to size-exclusion chromatography (Supplementary Figure 2B). Given that the molecular weight calculated from their amino acid sequences was 158 kDa, the purified complex should be a dimer. Next, using dynamic light scattering, the particle size (hydrodynamic diameter) of the tripartite complex was estimated to be around 235 Å (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, Supplementary Figure 9), which is consistent with the distance of Sld3CBDs in the model of Sld3CBD–Cdc45–MCM dimer. Furthermore, considering that the domains of Sld7 (NTD: Sld3NTD-binding, CTD: self-dimerization) and Sld3 (NTD: Sld7NTD-binding, CBD: Cdc45-binding, CTD: MCM-binding) function independently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], we estimated a dimer model of Sld7–Sld3–Cdc45, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>.</p>
<p>Although a previous study showed that Sld3 inhibits the interaction between GINS and MCM by binding experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], our SCMG–dsDNA model demonstrated that Sld3CBD neighbors Mcm2 and binds to Cdc45 on the opposite side of GINS binding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that Sld7– Sld3 bound to the Cdc45–MCM dimer did not inhibit GINS binding to Cdc45–MCM and could be remained for CMG formation. Interestingly, in the Sld3CBD–Cdc45–MCM–dsDNA and SCMG– dsDNA model, we found that a part (S358-D383) of Sld3CBD containing the C-terminal of α9, a disordered fragment, and α10 was in contact distance with Mcm2CTD. In addition, the Sld3CBD-bound Cdc45 DHHA1 appeared to become close to Mcm2CTD. In contrast, the Cdc45 DHHA1 was not in contact with Mcm2–7 or GINS in the CMG structure (Supplementary Figure 10). The conformational change in Cdc45 DHHA1 not only facilitates binding with Sld3CBD but could also cause contact with Mcm2 without affecting the interaction between Cdc45 and GINS.</p>

<title>ssDNA binding affinity of Sld3 depended on complex formation with Cdc45 and Sld7</title>
<p>Sld3 binds to the ssDNA fragment ARS1, the replication origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. The DNA-binding regions of MCM DH were identified as ssARS1-2 and ssARS1-5 when dsDNA ARS1 was divided into three 80-bp segments (dsARS1-12, dsARS1-34, and dsARS1-56) and unwound to six fragments of ssDNA: ssARS1-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Supplementary Figure 11A). Considering that Sld3 binds to Sld7 and Cdc45 in the MCM–DNA complex, we investigated whether Sld7 and Cdc45 affect the ssDNA-binding capacity of Sld3 to gain more information on the significance of the ssDNA binding of Sld3 during CMG formation. Therefore, we performed an ssDNA binding assay using the Sld3CBD, Sld3CBD–Cdc45, Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 and Sld7–Sld3ΔC (Sld3ΔC: binding part M1–N433 to Sld7 and Cdc45) complexes against different regions of ssARS1 for comparison. Cdc45 binds ssDNA with a nonspecific sequence at lengths &gt;60 bases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Therefore, we fragmented each ssARS1 into fragments of 40 bases to prevent this nonspecific interaction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and Supplementary Figures 11B).</p>

The molecular ratio of ssDNA to protein in lanes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 was 1:0, 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 0:1, respectively. The controls for ssDNA and protein are lanes 1 and 5, respectively. The disappearance of the ssDNA band in lanes 2–5 indicates that the protein (Sld3CBD, Sld7–Sld3ΔC and Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45) binds with high affinity.</p></caption>

<p>For the Sld3CBD and ssDNA mixtures at a molar ratio of 1:1, the band corresponding to ssDNA disappeared, indicating a strong binding affinity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and Supplementary Figures 12). The ssDNA band remained and new bands corresponding to the ssDNA–protein complex appeared when the Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex was mixed with ssDNA at the same ratio, indicating that the binding affinity of Sld3CBD–Cdc45 for ssDNA was lower than that of Sld3CBD alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and Supplementary Figures 12). Additionally, the disappearance of ssDNA bands and the appearance of new bands corresponding to the ssDNA–protein complex correlated with an increase in the concentration of Sld3CBD–Cdc45 in the mixture.</p>
<p>In the presence of the Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 complex, the band corresponding to ssDNA disappeared in the equimolar ratio of protein and ssDNA, similar to that observed for Sld3CBD (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and Supplementary Figures 12). This result demonstrates that the presence of Sld7 could restore the ssDNA-binding capacity of Sld3 to a level comparable to that of Sld3CBD. Also, Sld7–Sld3ΔC showed a ssDNA-binding capacity similar to that of Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45, implying that ssDNA-binding of Sld7–Sld3ΔC is independent of Cdc45. Furthermore, the results revealed no significant difference in binding affinity between the 40-base fragments of ssARS1-2-1, 2, 3 and ssARS1-5-1, 2, 3 for Sld3CBD, Sld3CBD–Cdc45, and Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45, indicating that there is no stronger binding-region specific to ssARS1-2 or ssARS1-5 fragments. For sequence specificity, we also analyzed other fragments of ssARS1-1, 3, 4, and 6 and dsARS1, and all of them showed no binding (Supplementary Figure 13). Considering that ssDNA is unwound from dsDNA by the helicase CMG complex, Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 and Sld7–Sld3ΔC having a stronger ssDNA-binding capacity than Sld3CBD–Cdc45 imply a relationship between the dissociation of Sld7–Sld3 from the CMG complex and binding to ssDNA unwound by CMG.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As a central regulator of helicase CMG formation, Sld3 has attracted interest in studies aiming to understand the initiation of DNA replication. Owing to the lack of structural information on Sld3 complexed with Cdc45 or MCM, how Sld3 regulates helicase activation with other factors remains unknown. Here, we present the structure of the Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex and particle size of the Sld7–Sld3–Cdc45 complex to examine the detailed mechanisms underlying CMG formation.</p>
<p>Sld3 is highly conserved in eukaryotes, whereas its functional homolog/counterpart in metazoans Treslin (also known as Ticrr) has a distinct size and sequence, except for Sld3CBD. Sequence alignment of Sld3CBD among Sld3 and Treslin revealed that all Cdc45-binding residues in α8 and α9 identified in our study were almost conserved or exhibited conserved changes (Supplementary Figures 4 and 5), indicating that these regions provide a similar mode of interaction between Sld3CBD and Cdc45 in the regulation of metazoan Treslin DNA replication. Therefore, we hypothesize that they load Cdc45, as observed in yeast Sld3 and Sld7.</p>
<p>Sld3CBD and Cdc45 significantly change their conformation to bind to each other in the Sld3CBD–Cdc45 complex compared with their conformation as monomers. Interestingly, the conformational changes in Cdc45 DHHA1 upon binding to Sld3CBD also caused contact with Mcm2NTD in the Sld3CBD–Cdc45–MCM–dsDNA and SCMG–dsDNA models, whereas DHHA1 interacted with neither MCM nor GINS in the CMG structure. Taken together, Sld3CBD contact with Mcm2NTD in the Sld3CBD–Cdc45–MCM–dsDNA and SCMG–dsDNA models and then seems to play a guiding role in helping Cdc45 bind to MCM at the right position. Sld3CBDs in each monomer of the Sld3CBD–Cdc45–MCM dimer were located at a distance of more than 230 Å, which is consistent with the results of a particle size analysis of the Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 complex off MCM DH in solution. Therefore, we indicated the binding manner of Sld7–Sld3– Cdc45 in a dimer Cdc45–Sld3–(Sld7)<sub>2</sub>–Sld3–Cdc45 off/on MCM DH for efficiently recruiting two Cdc45 molecules to an MCM DH, consequently leading to the formation of a pair of CMG helicases.</p>
<p>In the SCMG–dsDNA complex model, Cdc45 bound to Sld3CBD, MCM, and GINS on different sides (with contact surfaces of 6.7, 4.8, and 5.1% of the total Cdc45 surface, respectively), indicating that these bindings occurred independently and did not interfere with each other. In particular, Sld3 and GINS bind to Cdc45 and MCM rings at opposite positions (Mcm2–4–6 and Mcm5–3–7 vs. Sld3 and GINS, respectively), suggesting that the GINS-recruitment protein should cross a long-distance in an MCM monomer or MCM DH to recognize the phosphorylation site (T600 and S622) of Sld3. Furthermore, our SCMG–dsDNA model revealed that Sld3CBD on CMG appears to contact an N-terminal helix of Mcm2CTD and Sld3CTD could extend to bind to Mcm4NTD through interaction with the NTDs of Mcm2, and 6, rather than the CTD tier (Supplementary Figure 14), indicating that the binding of Sld3–Sld7 to MCM does not appear to affect the ability of AAA+ motors to open and close the MCM ring with a gap between Mcm2CTD and Mcm5CTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Taking our findings and those of previous studies together, we propose a detailed process for helicase CMG formation from inactive MCM, as depicted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> A–C, in which Sld7–Sld3 brings Cdc45 into the MCM as a Sld7–Sld3–Cdc45 dimer (Cdc45– Sld3–[Sld7]<sub>2</sub>–Sld3–Cdc45), which remains until GINS loading.</p>

<p>The following inquiry concerns the dissociation of Sld3 and other factors. Interestingly, the mutant analysis showed that disrupting just one binding site between Sld3CBD and Cdc45 could cause the dissociation of Sld3CBD and Cdc45, indicating that the binding between Sld3CBD and Cdc45 could be broken easily. Our binding analysis of ssARS1 fragments to Sld3CBD, Sld3CBD– Cdc45, and Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 demonstrated the sequence specificity to ssARS1-2 and ssARS1-5 fragments, not others including dsARS1. Considering that ssARS1-2 and ssARS1-5 are on both sides of MCM DH-bound dsDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], and ssARS1-2 disrupts the interaction between Sld3 and Mcm2–7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], ssARS1-binding could take advantage of dissociating from CMG for Sld3. As a bridge protein, Sld3 recruits Cdc45 to Sld7, and phosphorylated Sld3 regulates the recruitment of GINS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Finally, the release of Sld3 and Sld7 from CMG could be associated with the binding of ssARS1 unwound by CMG and may also be related to the dissociation of Dpb11–Sld2 from CMG (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> D, E) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Further structural investigation of Sld3–Sld7– Cdc45–MCM in the GINS-recruiting stage is required to validate the complete CMG formation process.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our structural and biochemical studies of Sld3CBD–Cdc45 revealed a detailed process of CMG formation and the subsequent release of the central regulator Sld3 and other factors associated with single-stranded DNA, leading to a deeper understanding of the initialization mechanism of DNA replication.</p>

The primer sequences for Sld3CBD–Cdc45 are listed in Supplementary Table 1.</p>
<p>To confirm the interactions obtained from the Sld3CBD–Cdc45 structure, we constructed four types of single or multi-mutants for Sld3CBD (Sld3-3S: I352S/I355S/L356S, Sld3-3E: 352E/I355E/L356E, Sld3-2R: D344R/D348R, and Sld3-Y: I352Y), and three types of single or multi-mutants for Cdc45 (Cdc45-IIIS: L522S/L527S/V529S, Cdc45-IIIE: L522E/L527E/V529E, Cdc45-IIS: L637S/L641S, Cdc45-IIE: L637E/L641E, and Cdc45-A: R523A) using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis method and the inverse PCR method with pETDuet-1– Sld3CBD–Cdc45 as template DNA. The primer sequences for the mutant strains are listed in Supplementary Table 1.</p>
<p>As <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sld7–Sld3–Cdc45 could not be co-overexpressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we attempted to clone it from several other fungal sources. The complex of Sld7 (M1-T268), Sld3ΔC (M1-N433), and Cdc45 (M1-I666) from the budding yeast <italic>Kluyveromyces marxianus</italic>, which belongs to the same family as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45), was cloned into pETDuet-1. We also added a His<sub>6</sub>-tag (LEHHHHHH) to the C-terminus of Sld3ΔC. The primer sequences for Sld7–Sld3ΔC and Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 are listed in Supplementary Table 1. As Cdc45 mutants can lose the ability to bind to Sld3, we overexpress Sld7–Sld3ΔC by multi-mutants of Cdc45 (Cdc45-IIS) in Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45. The residues (L654S/L658S) of Cdc45-IIS from <italic>K. marxianus</italic> were selected based on sequence conservation. We constructed mutant Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45IIS using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis method and the inverse PCR method with pETDuet-1–Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 as template DNA. The primer sequences for the mutant strains are listed in Supplementary Table 1.</p>
<p>To overexpress Sld3CBD, Sld3CBD–Cdc45, Sld3CBD–Cdc45 mutants, Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 and Sld7–Sld3ΔC, the vector of pET26Sld3CBD, pETDuet-1-Sld3CBD–Cdc45, pETDuet-1-Sld3CBD–Cdc45 mutants, pETDuet-1-Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 or pETDuet-1-Sld7–Sld3ΔC was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21 (DE3) through electroporation, followed by preculturing in 5 ml of Luria–Bertani medium containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin at 310 K overnight. The culture was then transferred to 3 L Luria–Bertani medium and grown until the OD<sub>600</sub> reached 0.6. After cooling the culture for 30 min on ice, overexpression of each sample was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and then cells were grown for an additional 12 h at 293 K.

The His-tagged target protein was eluted with imidazole at 20% (100 mM), 30% (150 mM), and 50% (250 mM), followed by a linear gradient of 250–500 mM imidazole in buffer B [20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 500 mM imidazole]. We analyzed the fractions using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Except for mutants of Sld3CBD–Cdc45, the pooled fractions were then purified through size-exclusion chromatography using a buffer A-equilibrated Superdex 200 16/60 column (GE HealthCare, Chicago, IL, USA). Protein purity was confirmed through SDS-PAGE. The purified samples were concentrated to 10 mg/ml and stored at 193 K.</p>

The transformants were streaked on SD plates lacking Trp and Leu (SD-Trp, Leu) and SD-Trp, Leu containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA-Trp, Leu), and then incubated at 298 K for 3 days. To analyze the Cdc45 mutant, strain Cdc45-35 containing the <italic>CDC45</italic> mutant gene was re-transformed with the YEplac195 plasmid containing <italic>SLD3</italic> and the YEplac122 plasmid containing <italic>SLD7</italic>. The transformants were streaked on yeast extract–peptone–dextrose plates and incubated at 298 or 305 K for 3 days.</p>

<title>Modelling of complexes</title>
<p>We constructed the models of Sld3CBD–Cdc45–MCM–dsDNA (Sld3CBD–Cdc45–MCM dimer complexed with dsDNA) and SCMG–dsDNA (SCMG dimer complexed with dsDNA) using a two-step process. First, the structure of the MCM–NTDs in the CMG monomer (PDBID: 3JC6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] was superimposed on that of MCM DH complexed with dsDNA (5BK4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] to obtain a dimer of Cdc45–MCM–GINS complexed with dsDNA (Cdc45–MCM–GINS–dsDNA). Next, the models of Sld3CBD–Cdc45–MCM–dsDNA and SCMG–dsDNA were obtained by superimposing Cdc45NTD from Sld3CBD–Cdc45 onto Cdc45–MCM–GINS–dsDNA.</p>

<title>Dynamic light scattering</title>
<p>We estimated the particle size of the Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 complex using dynamic light scattering in the term of peak size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. To avoid the effect of concentration, we measured four samples of the Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 complex. Each sample was overexpressed independently and purified through size-exclusion chromatography. All samples were concentrated to 10 mg/ml, and stored at 193 K. Before measurement, protein samples were dialyzed in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 300 mM NaCl and then filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. Dynamic light scattering data were collected and analyzed using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano-ZS instrument (Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, UK) for 0.2–0.5 mg/ml protein samples 500 μl in a microquartz cuvette (Malvern-ZEN0112). An automatic duration model was used to collect data. The Zetasizer 6.20 was utilized for data analysis form three measurements to estimate the particle size of each sample.</p>

<title>Electrophoretic mobility shift assay for ssDNA binding</title>
<p>Sld3 binds to single strands of DNA (<italic>ssARS1-2</italic> and <italic>ssARS1-5</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. To determine the specificity of the ssDNA binding affinity of Sld3, we conducted an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using non-denaturing PAGE (native-PAGE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Given that Cdc45 binds ssDNA with a nonspecific sequence at lengths greater than 60 bases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], we designed three fragments of ssDNA 40 bases in length (first half 1–40 bp, second half 41–80 bp, and middle half 21–60 bp) for each ssDNA 80-bp segment. All ssDNA fragments of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> were synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich. The 40-bp dsDNA fragments (dsARS1-34_1:ssARS1-3_1/ssARS1-4_2) were converted by annealing them using the PCR protocol and then checked through SDS-PAGE. The loaded samples were incubated overnight at 277 K in TMK buffer containing synthesized ssDNA and varying amounts of proteins at ssDNA: protein molecular ratios of 1:0, 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 0:1. After incubation, the mixtures were loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel (5% (w/v) acrylamide (39:1), 10% 10 × running buffer (0.25 M Tris, 1.92 M Glycine), 0.1% Ammonium peroxodisulphate, 0.06% (v/v) TEMED) without denaturing (native-PAGE). EMSA was performed at 10 mA/200 V per gel for 40 min at 277 K in 1 × running buffer. After electrophoresis, the reaction products were visualized using SYBR safe (SYBR safe:1 × running buffer = 0.0001:1) to stain the ssDNA and Coomassie brilliant blue (G-250) to stain the proteins. We repeated the EMSA experiments three or more times to confirm the readability. Considering the functional similarity of ARS1-core, the EMSA of Sld7–Sld3ΔC and Sld7–Sld3ΔC–Cdc45 of <italic>K. marxianus</italic> used ssDNA fragments of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The crystal structure of the Sld3CBD-Cdc45 complex presented by Li et al. is a novel contribution that significantly advances our understanding of CMG formation during the rate-limiting step of DNA replication initiation. This structure provides insights into the intermediate steps of CMG formation. The study builds upon previously known structures of Sld3 and Cdc45 and offers new perspectives into how Cdc45 is loaded onto MCM DH through Sld3-Sld7. The most notable finding is the structural difference in Sld3CBD when bound to Cdc45, particularly the arrangement of the α8-helix, which is essential for Cdc45 binding and may also pertain to its metazoan counterpart, Treslin. Additionally, the conformational shift in the DHHA1 domain of Cdc45 suggests a possible mechanism for its binding to MCM2NTD.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is generally well-written, with a precise structural analysis and a solid methodological section that will significantly advance future studies in the field. The predictions based on structural alignments are intriguing and provide a new direction for exploring CMG formation, potentially shaping the future of DNA replication research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness of the manuscript lies in the lack of experimental validation for the proposed Sld3-Sld7-Cdc45 model. Specifically, the claim that Sld3 binding to Cdc45-MCM does not inhibit GINS binding, a finding that contradicts previous research, is not sufficiently substantiated with experimental evidence. To strengthen their model, the authors must provide additional experimental data to support this mechanism. Also, the authors have not compared the recently published Cryo-EM structures of the metazoan CMG helicases with their predicted models to see if Sld3/Treslin does not cause any clash with the GINS when bound to the CMG. Still, the work holds great potential in its current form but requires further experiments to confirm the authors' conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>The manuscript presents valuable findings, particularly in the crystal structure of the Sld3CBD-Cdc45 interaction and the identification of additional sequences involved in their binding. The modeling of the Sld7-Sld3CBD-CDC45 subcomplex is novel, and the results provide insights into potential conformational changes that occur upon interaction. However, the work remains incomplete as several main claims are only partially supported by experimental data, particularly the proposed model for Sld3 interaction with GINS on the CMG. Additionally, the single-stranded DNA binding data from different species do not convincingly advance the manuscript's central arguments.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>(1) The Sld3CBD-Cdc45 structure is a novel contribution, revealing critical residues involved in the interaction.</p>
<p>(2) The model structures generated from the crystal data are well presented and provide valuable insights into the interaction sequences between Sld3 and Cdc45.</p>
<p>(3) The experiments testing the requirements for interaction sequences are thorough and conducted well, with clear figures supporting the conclusions.</p>
<p>(4) The conformational changes observed in Sld3 and Cdc45 upon binding are interesting and enhance our understanding of the interaction.</p>
<p>(5) The modeling of the Sld7-Sld3CBD-CDC45 subcomplex is a new and valuable addition to the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(1) The proposed model for Sld3 interacting with GINS on the CMG needs more experimental validation and conflicts with published findings. These discrepancies need more detailed discussion and exploration.</p>
<p>(2) The section on the binding of Sld3 complexes to origin single-stranded DNA needs significant improvement. The comparisons between Sld3-CBD, Sld3CBD-Cdc45, and Sld7-Sld3CBD-Cdc45 involve complexes from different species, limiting the comparisons' value.</p>
<p>(3) The authors' model proposing the release of Sld3 from CMG based on its binding to single-stranded DNA is unclear and needs more elaboration.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper by Li et al. describes the crystal structure of a complex of Sld3-Cdc45-binding domain (CBD) with Cdc45 and a model of the dimer of an Sld3-binding protein, Sld7, with two Sld3-CBD-Cdc45 for the tethering. In addition, the authors showed the genetic analysis of the amino acid substitution of residues of Sld3 in the interface with Cdc45 and biochemical analysis of the protein interaction between Sld3 and Cdc45 as well as DNA binding activity of Sld3 to the single-strand DNAs of the ARS sequence.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provided a nice model of an intermediate step in the assembly of an active Cdc45-MCM-GINS (CMG) double hexamers at the replication origin, which is mediated by the Sld3-Sld7 complex. The dimer of the Sld3-Sld7 complexes tethers two MCM hexamers together for the recruitment of GINS-Pol epsilon on the replication origin.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The biochemical analysis should be carefully evaluated with more quantitative ways to strengthen the authors' conclusion.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewers’ careful reading and the comments.</p>
<p>The structure of Sld3CBD-Cdc45 showed that the binding site of Cdc45 to Sld3CBD was distinct from the binding ranges of Cdc45 to GINS and MCM, indicating that the Sld3CBD, MCM, and GINS bind to separate sites of Cdc45 on the CMG complex. The SCMG-DNA model confirmed such a binding situation but did not show whether the binding of Sld3 to Cdc45 affects the recruitment of GINS (by GINS-Dbp11-Sld2) for CMG formation. We will modify our manuscript and discuss this point. Also, we will check the recently published Cryo-EM structures of the metazoan CMG helicases with their predicted models to confirm our conclusions. We will try to conduct the experiments as suggested.</p>

<p>We appreciate your positive comments. As suggested, we will try to improve the experiments and manuscript and discuss in more detail, including the interaction between Sld3 and GINS on the CMG, ssDNA-binding section, and the explanations of why we use different species for comparison and more elaboration on the Sld3-release proposal.</p>
