<title>Abstract</title><p>Sotorasib (AMG510) and adagrasib (MRTX849) have shown significant efficacy in <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> mutant NSCLC, but acquired resistance occurs within 6–12 months. While some resistance arises from new mutations, over half of the resistant cases lack identifiable genomic alterations. We hypothesize that resistance is driven by signaling network rewiring, creating new therapeutic vulnerabilities. To investigate acquired resistance (AR) mechanisms, multiple AR models, including cell lines (H23AR &amp; H358AR), PDXs (TC303AR &amp; TC314AR), CDXs (H358AR CDX), and PDXOs (PDXO303AR &amp; PDXO314AR) were developed. H23AR and H358AR cells displayed &gt;600-fold and 200-fold and PDXO303AR and PDXO314AR, exhibited &gt;300-fold and &gt;100-fold resistance to sotorasib, respectively compared to their parental counterparts, however, no additional mutations in KRAS or other potential genetic alterations were identified. The AR cells and PDXOs also showed comparable resistance to adagrasib. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses in TC303AR &amp; TC314AR PDXs identified distinct protein signatures associated with KRAS reactivation, mTORC1 signaling upregulation, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation. PI3K protein levels were significantly elevated in AR PDXs, H23AR, and H358AR cells. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K with copanlisib or genetic knockout via CRISPR-Cas9 restored sotorasib sensitivity, suppressed colony formation, and inhibited downstream effectors, including p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-S6, p70S6K, p-GSK3β, and p-PRAS40 in AR cells. copanlisib also sensitized both acquired and primary resistant PDXOs and synergized with sotorasib in restoring drug sensitivity. We found that p4E-BP1 was significantly upregulated in H23AR and H358AR cells, and copanlisib suppressed its expression. The level of p4E-BP1 expression was correlated with Sotorasib sensitivity in PI3K knockout clones, where the most sensitive clone displayed reduced or no p4E-BP1 expression. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of 4E-BP1, either alone or in combination with PI3K knockout, dramatically restored sotorasib sensitivity to levels comparable to parental cells. Suppression of 4E-BP1 hyperphosphorylation required dual inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2, and treatment with AZD8055 or sapanisertib (mTORC1/2 dual inhibitors) significantly dephosphorylated 4E-BP1 and restored sotorasib sensitivity in resistant cells and PDXOs. In contrast, everolimus (a mTORC1-selective inhibitor) did not restore sotorasib sensitivity. In PDX, CDX, and xenograft models in vivo, the combination of sotorasib with either copanlisib or sapanisertib resulted in robust, synergistic, and durable tumor regression at well-tolerated doses. These findings showed the critical role of PI3K/mTOR signaling as a bypass mechanism of resistance to KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitors. We conclude that mTORC1/2 mediated inhibition of p4E-BP1 and combination strategies targeting this pathway effectively overcomes acquired resistance to KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitors in NSCLC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>KRAS</italic> mutations represent the most common gain-of-function alterations in cancer, accounting for approximately 30% of lung adenocarcinomas— a significantly higher prevalence than other oncogenic drivers, such as <italic>EGFR</italic> (15%), <italic>ALK</italic> rearrangements (5%), and <italic>MET</italic> alterations (3%), for which targeted therapies are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Among <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations, the <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> variant is one of the most frequent activating alterations, occurring in approximately 14% of lung adenocarcinomas and 0.5% to 4% of squamous cell carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). This mutation is also found in 3% to 4% of colorectal cancers (CRC) and 1% to 2% of biliary and pancreatic cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Unlike protein kinases that utilize ATP as substrate, the KRAS protein is a GTPase that hydrolyzes guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and normally functions as a molecular switch that cycles between an active, GTP–bound state and an inactive, GDP–bound form. Oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations impair GTP hydrolysis, resulting in an accumulation of the active GTP-bound form, which drives pro-tumorigenic signaling predominantly through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways, promoting tumor growth and proliferation. Although inhibitors targeting several components of the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways have been clinically approved, no direct <italic>KRAS</italic> inhibitors were available until recently. The attempts to use these drugs targeting downstream effectors in <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant cancers have largely been unsuccessful in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). The recent discovery and development of new targeted therapeutic agents against <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> renewed the clinical interest in <italic>KRAS</italic> biology, which was long considered undruggable for decades because of its high affinity for nucleotide and the lack of tractable binding pockets for small-molecule inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>Two FDA-approved small-molecule <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> inhibitors, adagrasib (MRTX849) and sotorasib (AMG510), have showed potent, selective, and irreversible inhibition of <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> activity, showing promising efficacy in non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and more modest activity in colorectal cancer in early-phase clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). In advanced NSCLC patients harboring <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> mutations, both agents exhibited encouraging clinical outcomes, with objective response rates ranging between 37% and 45% and disease control rates of 81% to 96%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). These inhibitors covalently bind to the switch II pocket of KRAS, which becomes accessible in the GDP-bound inactive state, irreversibly locking the protein in its inactive conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). This mechanism inhibits downstream MAPK signaling, as evidenced by reduced ERK phosphorylation (p-ERK), and suppresses the viability of <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic>-mutant cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Despite these promising results, approximately half of the patients treated with sotorasib or adagrasib in clinical trials did not achieve significant tumor shrinkage, highlighting the limited overall therapeutic benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Moreover, like other targeted therapies, virtually all patients who initially experience objective responses or stable disease eventually develop disease progression within 6–12 months of therapy initiation due to the emergence of resistance mechanisms. Therefore, the identification of these acquired resistance mechanisms, along with the development of alternative therapeutic strategies, including combination therapies with <italic>KRAS</italic> inhibitors, represents an urgent unmet clinical need.</p>
<p>Various possible mechanisms of acquired resistance to <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> inhibitors have been identified in recent studies and can be broadly categorized into the following events: genetic alterations, reactivation of KRAS signaling, and non-genetic alternative bypass pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Genetic alterations, particularly the emergence of secondary <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations or new mutations in other oncogenic drivers, have been frequently observed as a primary cause of acquired resistance. However, these genetic events alone cannot fully explain treatment failure, as no identifiable mutations were detected in nearly half of patients treated with sotorasib or adagrasib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). In addition, the new secondary mutations developed in KRAS inhibitors treated patients usually appeared with low allelic frequency, raising the possibility that they may not be solely responsible for the observed tumor resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Reactivation of KRAS signaling has emerged as a predominant mechanism of acquired resistance, predominantly through the reactivation of two major canonical downstream pathways: the BRAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) and PI3K-AKT-mTOR cascades. Beyond these canonical pathways, several alternative bypass mechanisms have also been identified, which either converge on RAS pathway reactivation or activate parallel signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/mTOR axis, to sustain tumor growth and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Notably, inhibition of both MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathways is often required to achieve significant antitumor effects, underscoring the necessity of combination therapies to overcome resistance. Combination therapy represents a crucial approach to prevent or delay the onset of resistance, as well as to enhance the efficacy of <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> inhibitors. Rational combination strategies that either overcome resistance mechanisms or synergize with <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> inhibitors to suppress tumor growth and promote cancer cell death are urgently needed in clinical practice. A recent preclinical study showed that the combination of a <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> inhibitor with a selective mTORC1 kinase inhibitor causes synergistic antitumor effect through the inhibition of cap-dependent translation, a critical process in cancer cell survival and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Consistent with this, our recent study identified a non-genetic bypass resistance mechanism to osimertinib in <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutant NSCLC, in which PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) amplification drives resistance through upregulation of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we take advantage of a series of paired sotorasib-resistant patient-derived xenografts (PDX), cell-derived xenografts (CDX), acquired resistant PDX-derived organoids (PDXO) and sotorasib-resistant isogeneic cell lines to identify acquired resistance mechanisms and explore potential therapeutic approaches. Reactivation of KRAS signaling was identified in acquired resistant tumors, which was evidenced by the impaired inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling. The upregulation of PI3K signaling in resistant cells was found as a major bypass mechanism for the acquired resistance. Genetic ablation of PI3K through CRISPR-mediated knockout or pharmacological inhibition with copanlisib restored sensitivity to both sotorasib and adagrasib in vitro and in vivo. The combination of PI3K inhibition with <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> inhibitors exerted a synergistic antitumor effect by suppressing 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, thereby limiting cap-dependent protein translation, which was dependent on the simultaneous inhibition of both mTORC1 and mTORC2.</p>

<p>To investigate the sotorasib sensitivity in vivo, these PDXs were engrafted in NSG mice and treated with sotorasib when tumors reached ~200 mm³. Despite co-mutations in <italic>STK11, TP53, or KEAP1</italic>, all four models exhibited high sensitivity to sotorasib, leading to significant tumor growth suppression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, TC247, TC303, and TC314 showed substantial tumor regression, whereas TC453 displayed only moderate sensitivity without significant regression.</p>
<p>To generate sotorasib-resistant models, the two most sensitive PDXs (TC303 and TC314) underwent prolonged in vivo treatment. Third generation (G3) resistant PDXs—TC303AR and TC314AR—were established by re-passaging the PDXs into new mice followed by sotorasib treatment for at least 3 cycles. These resistant models no longer responded to sotorasib (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>WES of TC303AR and TC314AR confirmed that both retained the <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> mutation, with no additional mutations detected in <italic>KRAS</italic>.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Development and Characterization of Acquired Resistance to Sotorasib in NSCLC PDX-Derived Organoids</title>
<p>Ten PDX-derived organoids (PDXOs) listed in the table in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> were established and characterized from their corresponding PDX models. All organoids were characterized by sequencing and flow cytometry. WES confirmed that all established organoids retained the <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> mutation, while flow cytometry analysis detected no mouse cell contamination, as indicated by the absence of H2kb staining (mouse MHC class I) and the presence of human EpCAM, an epithelial marker.</p>
<p>Sotorasib sensitivity was assessed for all PDXOs, with IC50 values (µM) listed in the table shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>. The sensitivity testing revealed that PDXO303 and PDXO314 were the most responsive, with IC50 values of 0.03 µM and 0.11 µM, respectively. These two organoids were also challenged for Adagrasib sensitivity. Both models also exhibited high sensitivity to adagrasib, the second FDA-approved <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> inhibitor.</p>
<p>Of the remaining PDXOs, six out of seven displayed primary resistance to sotorasib (IC50 ≥10 µM), with only one of the seven showing sensitivity to adagrasib. Specifically, PDXO303, PDXO314, and PDXO723 were highly sensitive to adagrasib (IC50 0.03 µM, 0.09 µM, and 0.1 µM, respectively, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E &amp; F</xref>).</p>
<p>PDXO303 and PDXO314, the two most sensitive PDXOs to both sotorasib and adagrasib, underwent prolonged exposure to increasing doses of sotorasib in culture. This resulted in the development of sotorasib-resistant PDXO303AR and PDXO314AR, exhibiting &gt;300-fold and &gt;100-fold resistance, respectively.

Notably, both parental and resistant PDXO303 and PDXO314 organoids exhibited comparable sensitivity to copanlisib, indicating its strong therapeutic potential.</p>
<p>Further, copanlisib sensitivity was evaluated in additional KRASG12C-mutant PDXOs that were intrinsically resistant to sotorasib. PDXO780 and PDXO864 organoids were highly sensitive to copanlisib, with IC50 values of 0.059 µM and 0.145 µM, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, PDXO481, PDXO551, and PDXO723 organoids, which did not respond to sotorasib treatment, exhibited remarkable sensitivity to copanlisib (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Expression of PI3K was upregulated in both H23AR and H358AR cells compared to their sensitive counterparts. Treatment with copanlisib effectively inhibited PI3K signaling, as evidenced by a significant reduction in AKT phosphorylation at S473 (p-AKT S473) and T308 (p-AKT T308) in both H23AR and H358AR cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Similarly, copanlisib treatment led to a marked decrease in AKT phosphorylation in parental H23 and H358 cells.</p>
<p>To evaluate the functional impact of PI3K inhibition, a colony formation assay was performed. H23 and H358 isogenic cells were treated with increasing concentrations of copanlisib (25 nM, 50 nM, 100 nM, 250 nM, and 500 nM). Even at 50 nM, copanlisib reduced colony formation in both resistant cell lines, with a significant inhibitory effect observed at 100 nM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>To further investigate the role of AKT signaling, resistant cells were treated with MK2206, an AKT inhibitor, alone and in combination with copanlisib.

<p>Previous analyses showed significant enrichment of mTORC1 signaling in sotorasib-resistant PDXs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).

Notably, the combination of everolimus with a low dose of copanlisib (50 nM) resulted in a profound reduction in colony formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).

<title>PI3K knockout via CRISPR-Cas9 restores sotorasib sensitivity in acquired resistant cells by dephosphorylating 4E-BP1</title>
<p>PI3K expression is upregulated in resistant cells, and its inhibition by copanlisib sensitizes these cells to treatment. To further validate the role of PI3K in resistance, we generated PI3K alpha-subunit knockout clones in both H23AR and H358AR cells using CRISPR-Cas9 technology and evaluated their sensitivity to sotorasib.</p>
<p>In H23AR cells, four PI3K-knockout clones (H23AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-2-15</sup></italic>, H23AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-2-17</sup></italic>, H23AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-3-3</sup></italic>, and H23AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-3-12</sup></italic>) were verified via PI3K sequencing and western blot analysis, confirming the complete loss of PI3K/p110α expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Cell viability assays showed that all PI3K-knockout clones exhibited significantly increased sensitivity to sotorasib compared to the parental H23AR cells (p=0.035, p=0.0002, p=0.09, &amp; p= 0.012 respectively), although the degree of sensitivity varied among clones (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Similarly, in H358AR cells, three PI3K-knockout clones (H358AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-1-4</sup></italic>, H358AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-2-4</sup></italic>, and H358AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-2-7</sup></italic>) were generated and confirmed by western blot analysis, showing no detectable PI3K/p110α expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). These PI3K-knockout clones also exhibited significantly increased sensitivity to sotorasib compared to the resistant H358AR cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating that PI3K inhibition plays a direct role in restoring sotorasib sensitivity in resistant cells.</p>
<p>Among the H23AR knockout clones, H23AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-2-17</sup></italic> showed the highest sensitivity to sotorasib, with a response comparable to the original resistant H23AR cells (p=0.0002). In contrast, H23AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-3-3</sup></italic> exhibited the lowest sensitivity to sotorasib, though still significantly more sensitive than the original H23AR-resistant cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). To further investigate the molecular basis of this differential sensitivity, we analyzed downstream signaling pathways in the most and least sensitive clones.</p>
<p>Like the effects of copanlisib on molecular signaling in H23AR cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B &amp; H</xref>), robust downregulation of p-AKT (S473 &amp; T308), pS6 (S235/236), pPRAS40 (T246), and p4E-BP1 (S65) was observed in the highly sensitive H23AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-2-17</sup></italic> clone. Notably, copanlisib treatment did not further reduce the levels of these signaling molecules in this clone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). In contrast, in the least sensitive PI3K-knockout clone (H23AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-3-3</sup></italic>), similar levels of p-AKT (S473 &amp; T308), pS6 (S235/236), and pPRAS40 (T246) downregulation were observed; however, p4E-BP1 (S65) remained elevated, resembling the levels found in H23AR cells suggesting a critical role of 4E-BP1 in sotorasib sensitivity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>The expression of p4E-BP1 (S65) was significantly upregulated in H23AR compared to H23, the expression was completely depleted in the highly sensitive PI3K-knockout clone (H23AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-2-17</sup></italic>). Conversely, in the least sensitive PI3K-knockout clone (H23AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-3-3</sup></italic>), p4E-BP1 (S65) levels remained high, maintaining partial resistance. However, treatment of this least sensitive clone with copanlisib effectively reduced p4E-BP1 (S65) levels, along with significant inhibition of p-AKT (S473 &amp; T308), pS6 (S235/236), and pPRAS40 (T246) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Importantly, copanlisib treatment completely abolished p4E-BP1 (S65) expression in H23AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-3-3</sup></italic>, reducing it to levels comparable to those in the highly sensitive clone H23AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-2-17</sup></italic>. Taken together, these findings suggest that <italic>PI3K</italic> knockout or inhibition by copanlisib restores sotorasib sensitivity in resistant cells, primarily through the suppression of p4E-BP1.</p>

<title>Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, which is dependent of both mTOCC1 and mTORC2 kinases, is associated with acquired resistance and 4E-BP1 knockout via CRISPR-Cas9 restores sotorasib sensitivity</title>
<p>4E-BP1 is a negative regulator of protein translation that, in its non-phosphorylated state, binds to the translation initiation factor eIF4E, thereby inhibiting 5’-cap-dependent translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). We have shown that in sotorasib-resistant H23AR and H358AR cells, the 4E-BP1 and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (p4E-BP1 at S65) were significantly upregulated compared to their parental counterparts.

<title>mTORC1 and mTORC2 Mediate 4E-BP1 Hyperphosphorylation in Resistant Cells</title>
<p>Since p4E-BP1 (S65) was associated with sotorasib resistance and knocking down PI3K or 4E-BP1, or copanlisib treatment restores sotorasib sensitivity in acquired resistant cells, we further investigated the role of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in resistant cells. Everolimus, a mTORC1 inhibitor, and AZD8055, a dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor, were used to treat H23 parental, H23AR, H23AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-2-17</sup></italic> (most sensitive clone), and H23AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-3-3</sup></italic> (least sensitive clone) cells.</p>
<p>Everolimus treatment significantly downregulated pS6 (S235/236) in H23AR and H23AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-2-17</sup></italic>, but did not reduce p4E-BP1 (S65) levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>).

When comparing AZD8055 with everolimus in resistant H23AR and H358AR cells, the dual inhibitor induced significantly greater cytotoxicity than the mTORC1-specific inhibitor (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>).</p>
<p>Further analysis of the combination index (CI) between sotorasib and AZD8055 revealed strong synergy in resistant cells. In H23AR cells, sotorasib (0.031 µM) combined with AZD8055 (0.03 µM) yielded a CI of 0.283, indicating strong synergism. In H358AR cells, sotorasib (0.031 µM) combined with AZD8055 (0.01 µM) exhibited an even stronger synergy, with a CI of 0.053 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>).</p>
<p>This data suggests that dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 through PI3K knockout, 4E-BP1 knockout, or copanlisib treatment restores sotorasib sensitivity. Notably, mTORC1 inhibition alone is insufficient to suppress p4E-BP1, while dual inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2 effectively abolishes p4E-BP1 expression, leading to robust cytotoxicity and enhanced sotorasib sensitivity indicating the suppression of p4E-BP1 is dependent on both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes.</p>

<p>Combination index (CI) analysis revealed a strong to very strong synergism when sotorasib (0.031–0.31 µM) was combined with copanlisib (0.05 µM) in both H23AR and H358AR cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Notably, the least responsive PI3K-knockout clone (H23AR<italic><sup>PI3K-KO-3-3</sup></italic>) also exhibited significant sensitivity to the combination treatment, with a CI of 0.093 at sotorasib (0.031 µM) + copanlisib (0.05 µM) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>).</p>
<p>To evaluate the in vivo efficacy of this combination, we established sotorasib-resistant H358AR-CDX tumors in NSG mice. Once tumor volumes reached approximately 200 mm³, mice were treated with copanlisib, sotorasib, or their combination, following the strategy outlined in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>.</p>
<p>Copanlisib monotherapy showed significant antitumor activity compared to the control group. However, the combination of sotorasib and copanlisib exhibited a synergistic antitumor effect, with statistically significant tumor suppression observed at D40, D44, and D47 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). The combination treatment was superior to either monotherapy in controlling tumor growth.</p>
<p>Individual tumor growth curves (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>) revealed that in the combination group, tumor volumes remained stable, with no significant growth observed between pre-treatment (D26) and post-treatment (D44) measurements. In contrast, tumors in the sotorasib monotherapy group continued to grow significantly between D26 and D44, further highlighting the superior efficacy of the combination strategy.</p>
<p>To investigate the underlying mechanism, tumors were harvested after three weeks of treatment and analyzed using RPPA. The expression levels of total 4E-BP1, phosphorylated 4E-BP1 at T37/46 and S65 were significantly suppressed by both copanlisib monotherapy and the combination treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Additionally, other key downstream effectors of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, including phosphorylated S6 (S235/236), phosphorylated mTOR (S2448), GSK-3β, phosphorylated Src (Y527), and p70-S6K1, were also downregulated (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). In contrast, sotorasib monotherapy failed to reduce the phosphorylation of key signaling proteins such as p-mTOR (S2448), p-S6 (S235/236), p4E-BP1 (S65), and p-Src (Y527). This indicates that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway remained functionally active in resistant tumors, thereby sustaining resistance to sotorasib treatment.</p>
<p>The combination of sotorasib and copanlisib was evaluated to determine its in vivo efficacy in overcoming sotorasib-acquired resistance in H23AR xenograft tumors. H23AR cells were continuously cultured under sotorasib pressure during cell expansion to develop resistance, and these resistant cells were subsequently implanted into NSG mice. Treatment was initiated once the tumor volumes reached approximately 200 mm³, following the experimental strategy illustrated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>. When administered as a monotherapy, sotorasib did not demonstrate a statistically significant antitumor effect against H23AR xenografts compared to the control group (p = 0.40). However, treatment with copanlisib alone resulted in a strong antitumor response, which was statistically significant when compared to both sotorasib monotherapy and the control group (p &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). Although the combination of copanlisib and sotorasib did not exhibit a synergistic effect due to the strong copanlisib single agent effect (p = 0.82; comb vs copanlisib), the combination therapy successfully overcame sotorasib resistance by significantly inhibiting tumor growth compared to both sotorasib monotherapy (p = 0.001) and the control group (p &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). Individual mouse responses showed that tumor growth was inhibited in every mouse treated with the combination treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>).</p>
<p>Like the H23AR xenograft model, the therapeutic efficacy of sotorasib in combination with copanlisib was also investigated in the TC314AR patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, which has acquired resistance to sotorasib. TC314AR-resistant PDXs were implanted into NSG mice, and the experimental design followed an individualized PDX trial approach. In this strategy, each mouse was blindly assigned to one of the four treatment groups—control, sotorasib, copanlisib, or combination once the PDX tumor volume reached approximately 200 mm³. The treatment regimen was continued for three weeks to assess the antitumor effects of each therapy. As anticipated, sotorasib monotherapy failed to exert a significant inhibitory effect on tumor growth when compared to the control/vehicle-treated group (p = ns vs control). In contrast, copanlisib monotherapy showed a potent antitumor response, which was statistically significant when compared to both the control and sotorasib monotherapy groups (p &lt;0.005). The combination of sotorasib and copanlisib produced an even stronger tumor-suppressive effect than either monotherapy (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>). Individual mouse responses are shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>. The efficacy of this combination was analyzed using the CombPDX tool, a unified statistical platform designed to evaluate drug synergy in PDX models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). The treatment effect shown in <xref rid="fig7-S1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1A</xref> was measured based on tumor growth inhibition (TGI) with a 95% confidence interval in comparison with the control group, and the combination treatment showed superior efficacy. The Combination Index (CI), calculated based on the Highest Single Agent (HSA) method, yielded a positive value, indicating a synergistic interaction between sotorasib and copanlisib (<xref rid="fig7-S1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>We showed above that the dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor AZD8055 was synergistic in vitro against sotorasib-resistant cells and PDX organoids (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). We therefore investigated the antitumor efficacy of combining sotorasib with sapanisertib, another dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor, in the TC314AR PDX model. In vitro cell viability assays showed that sapanisertib exhibited a significant cytotoxic effect, significantly inhibiting the proliferation of acquired-resistant cell lines, including H23AR, H358AR, and PDXO models (<xref rid="fig7-S2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 7-figure supplement 2A</xref>-<xref rid="fig7-S2b" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). TC314AR PDX tumors were established in NSG mice, and once tumor volumes reached approximately 200 mm³, treatment with either sotorasib monotherapy, sapanisertib monotherapy, or the combination of both agents was administered for three weeks. As observed in prior resistance models, sotorasib alone did not elicit a significant antitumor response, with no notable tumor growth inhibition observed. In contrast, the combination of sotorasib with sapanisertib led to a dramatic and highly significant antitumor effect (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7K</xref>). This combination therapy was further evaluated using the CombPDX analysis tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), a comprehensive statistical tool to analyze the drug synergy on PDXs, which confirmed that the antitumor response observed with the combination was markedly superior to that of either monotherapy. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was assessed with a 95% confidence interval, revealing that the combination treatment resulted in a TGI value exceeding 0.75 (on a scale of 0 to 1.0), whereas sotorasib and sapanisertib monotherapies showed TGI values of less than 0.2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7L</xref>). The Combination Index (CI) was calculated as previously reported and indicated synergy for the combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7L</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings underscore the critical role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in sotorasib resistance and show that targeting this pathway with copanlisib or dual mTORC1/2 inhibition can effectively restore sensitivity to sotorasib. The combination of sotorasib with copanlisib exhibited robust synergy both in vitro and in vivo, providing a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome acquired resistance in PDX and CDX tumor models.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Due to the intrinsic characteristics of KRAS proteins, KRAS has been considered an undruggable target. The recent advent of compounds allowing direct inhibition of the <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> oncogene such as adagrasib and sotorasib has initiated a new era in the clinical management of <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> mutant NSCLC. Both AMG510 (Sotorasib) and MRTX849 (Adagrasib), bind covalently to the GDP-bound form of the KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> protein (KRAS OFF), preventing oncogenic signaling and cause tumor regression in preclinical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Current <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> (OFF) inhibitors cause responses in less than half of patients and these responses are not durable. Other than sotorasib and adagrasib, other new inhibitors are developing, targeting either the KRAS active state (KRAS ON) where RAS coupled with GTP, or inactive state (KRAS OFF) where RAS binds with GDP, and evaluating the clinical efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). In early-phase clinical trials, adagrasib and sotorasib have shown promising results against non–small cell lung cancer and more modest efficacy against colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Despite high initial efficacy, there is a relatively short progression-free survival due to resistance that develops in virtually all patients to single-agent therapy. Moreover, the responsiveness of NSCLC to <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> inhibitors is not sufficient compared with that of TKIs such as EGFR-TKI and ALK-TKI, which show response rates of 70% and 80%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>).</p>
<p>An improved understanding of the biological basis of acquired resistance is necessary, which will provide more opportunities to optimize <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> inhibitor regimens and new combinations. Multiple mechanisms of resistance have been described in the clinic upon treatment with direct <italic>KRAS</italic> inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Acquired resistance to KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitors is mainly driven by genomic mutations and monogenetic alteration events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Development of secondary mutations in <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> oncoprotein that interfere with the binding of covalent inhibitors to cysteine 12 residues, or mutations in the normal <italic>KRAS</italic> alleles that could not be targeted by the KRAS inhibitors or other mutations in BRAF, MAP2K1, RTKs that are related to the reactivation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway are the major genetic events associated with sotorasib resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Other tumors displayed mutations in <italic>PI3K</italic>, <italic>PTEN, SMAARCA4, KEAP1,</italic> and <italic>PTCH1</italic> effectors in additional oncogenic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). In this study, sotorasib acquired resistant isogenic patient-derived xenografts (PDXs: TC314AR and TC303AR), CDX, PDX-derived organoids (PDXOs: (PDXO314AR &amp; PDXO303AR), and H23AR and H358AR cell lines were developed and investigated to explore the underlying mechanism of resistance. Whole exome sequence was performed in all acquired resistant models, no additional mutations were found in <italic>KRAS,</italic> and no new mutations were found in major proteins associated with bypass pathways. Although each resistant model has its distinct molecular profiling pattern, all resistant models retained <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> mutation regardless.</p>
<p>Yet about half of the resistant tumors examined did not display additional mutations, thus indicating the existence of additional mechanisms that might cause resistance to KRAS inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Identification of these resistance mechanisms is an urgent prerequisite to developing improved therapeutic strategies. Reactivation of KRAS and/or upregulation of additional bypass signaling pathways are found to be one of the potential central mechanisms of KRASi-related acquired resistance. Reactivation of the MAPK pathway without developing new mutations in <italic>KRAS</italic> or its downstream mediators has been reported in <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> lung adenocarcinomas resistant to the KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitor AMG 510 and adagrasib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Consistent with that, we also found upregulation of ERK signaling determined by the level of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in sotorasib-resistant H23AR and H358AR cells which was inhibited by the treatment of KRASi. On the other hand, the complete inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by sotorasib treatment was noticed in parental H23 and H358 cells. This hyper-phosphorylation of EKR1/2 in acquired resistant cells could be explained by the hyper-formation of new KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> proteins and reactivating downstream signaling in resistant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). High throughput Mass-Spectrometry (MS) was performed in acquired resistant TC314AR and TC303AR PDXs to understand the bypass resistance mechanisms. Enrichment analysis showed that PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling was significantly upregulated in resistant PDXs as compared with their parental counterpart. Over-expression of PI3K was also found in acquired resistant cell lines that was found in consistent with other studies where activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR canonical pathway was found as an additional bypass mechanism in acquired resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Other alternative pathways such as epidermal growth factor receptor or Aurora kinase A (AURKA) signaling, FAK, and Hippo pathways are also reported to be associated with resistance to KRAS inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). These alternative pathways were not found significantly upregulated in our study indicating heterogeneous mechanisms involved in KRASG12C inhibitor resistance notably being tissue specific.</p>
<p>The PI3K–AKT–mTOR signaling pathway is frequently activated in cancer, deregulates control of metabolism, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Pharmaceutical inhibition of PI3K by copanlisib or genetic knock-out of PI3K by CRISPR-Cas9 restores the sensitivity of sotorasib in sotorasib-resistant cells or organoids. Copanlisib is a potent pan-PI3K inhibitor, an FDA-approved compound that has been shown to inhibit cellular proliferation of relapsed or refractory, indolent, or aggressive lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). However, there are no studies investigating the use of copanlisib in NSCLC preclinical models. PI3K expression was upregulated in sotorasib-resistant H23AR and H358AR cells and inhibition of PI3K by copanlisib induced cytotoxicity in the cells. Similarly, sotorasib-acquired resistant PDXOs such as PDXO314AR and PDXO303AR were also found to be very sensitive to copanlisib.</p>
<p>We have developed around PDXOs from their respective PDXs. Over 50% of those PDXOs were primarily resistant to sotorasib or adagrasib. No additional KRAS mutation was found in any of those PDXs, and no significant correlation was found with any co-mutation with either PI3K, STK11, KEAP1, SMARCA4 etc. However, no co-mutation was associated with sotorasib resistance. As a majority of PDXOs showed primary resistance to sotorasib this suggests that other bypass signaling mechanisms are involved in sotorasib resistance. Primarily resistant PDXOs were found to be very sensitive to copanlisib in the PDXO viability assay suggesting the role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in the inactivation of sotorasib sensitivity. Copanlisib overcame sotorasib resistance in the sotorasib-resistant H23AR and H358AR cells and PDXOs (PDXO303AR and PDXO314AR) and worked synergistically with sotorasib in-vitro and in-vivo. The drug combination index (CI) analysis showed that a very low dose of copanlisib (50nM) worked synergistically in sensitizing resistant cells to sotorasib which could mitigate copanlisib-associated drug toxicity.</p>
<p>To understand the underlying resistance mechanism of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, blocking the upstream PI3K by pan-PI3K inhibitor copanlisib which inhibits the catalytic activity of the class I PI3Kα, β, γ, and δ isoforms, inhibited AKT phosphorylation at both T308 and S347 and its direct substrates PRAS40 (T246) and GSK3β (S9) which was consistent with breast tumor models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Inhibition of AKT by MK2206, an AKT inhibitor, moderately inhibited the colony formation and worked significantly better when combined with copanlisib suggesting overcoming resistance by copanlisib is not solely dependent on AKT inhibition. The moderate activity in resistant cells by AKT inhibitor, MK2206 can be explained by its moderate inhibition of downstream mTORC1 targets. Will et al reported that targets of mTOR such as pS6 and p4EBP1 were also inhibited by both MK2206 and copanlisib, although PI3K inhibition blocked 4E-BP1 phosphorylation more potently and longer than AKT inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). In our study, copanlisib was found to be very effective in downregulating the mTORC1 signaling through inhibiting the phosphorylation of the target molecules such as S6 and 4E-BP1.</p>
<p>Like AKT inhibition by MK2206, inhibition of mTORC1 by everolimus which targets S6 and inhibited the phosphorylation of S6, inhibited colony formation moderately in sotorasib resistant H23AR and H358AR cells but the inhibition of colony formation increased significantly when combined with copanlisib. In cell viability assays in acquired resistant isogeneic cells or PDXOs, copanlisib was found to be very effective and the effect was much stronger for copanlisib compared to everolimus. This data suggested that the downstream mechanism of PI3K inhibition by copanlisib involves more than S6 mediated mTORC1 activity. To verify the precise involvement of mTORC1, we investigated two downstream effector molecules S6 and 4E-BP1 which are involved in protein translation. Both S6 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by copanlisib treatment in resistant cells, although basal expression of 4E-BP1 was significantly higher only in resistant cells. Everolimus, an mTORC1 inhibitor, downregulated S6 phosphorylation in resistant cells where 4E-BP1 expression remained unaffected indicating dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is essential for overcoming sotorasib resistance.</p>
<p>4E-BP1 is a member of the 4E-BP family that represses translation by competing with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E, thereby preventing the formation of the eIF4F complex. In cancer cells, however, 4E-BP1 is frequently phosphorylated by its upstream oncogenic signals such as PI3K/AKT and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways, which causes 4E-BP1 disassociation from eIF4E and increases cap-dependent protein translation. The mTOR kinase complex 1 (mTORC1) is the master regulator of eIF4E-initiated cap-dependent translation by phosphorylating 4E-BP1 on Thr37 and Thr46 that act as priming sites for its subsequent phosphorylation on Ser65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was found in sotorasib-resistant cells as compared with sensitive cells which was consistent with other studies that found an association with malignant progression and poor prognosis with 4E-BP1 hyperphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). PI3K inhibition by copanlisib sensitizes the cells by downregulating 4E-BP1 which emphasizes the role of 4E-BP1 in overcoming sotorasib resistance. We also found a clear inverse association between the level of sotorasib cytotoxicity and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 among PI3K-knockout clones. The clone H23AR-PI3K-KO-2-17, the most sensitive clone, showed complete inhibition of phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (S65) which resembles the status found in the parental H23 cells. On the other hand, the clone H23AR-PI3K-KO-3-3, the least sensitive clone, showed partial dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and correlated with the expression found in sotorasib-resistant H23AR cells. To verify the precise role of 4E-BP1, CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out of 4E-BP1 clones was created in resistant cells. After knocking out 4E-BP1, both resistant cells H23AR and H358AR became sensitive to sotorasib. When 4E-BP1 was knocked out from sotorasib’s least sensitive PI3K knock-clone (H23AR-PI3K-KO-3-3), the double knock-out clone (PI3K and 4E-BP1) restored sotorasib sensitivity to the level of sensitive cells suggesting the pivotal role of 4E-BP1 in overcoming sotorasib resistance.</p>
<p>4E-BP1 is the downstream target of mTORC1. To verify the dependency on mTORC1 kinase on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and subsequent protein translation, everolimus (mTORC1 specific inhibitor) and AZD8055, a dual inhibitor that inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2, were used to treat the resistant cells. Everolimus can stop S6 phosphorylation without having any effect on 4E-BP1 in resistant cells whereas AZD8055 reduced p4E-BP1 and pS6 in resistant cells suggesting the hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in resistant cells was independent of mTORC1. ADZ8055 dual mTOR inhibitor also synergized with sotorasib in restoring the sensitivity in sotorasib-resistant cells and PDXOs. In our study, mTORC1 inhibition by everolimus did not restore sotorasib (KRAS OFF inhibitor) sensitivity, but a recent study found a synergistic effect of KRASi (KRAS ON inhibitor) with mTORC1 kinase inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Another recent study showed that RAS-ON inhibition can overcome resistance developed from RAS-OFF blockade which is sotorasib or adagrasib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). In conclusion, our study found a strong synergistic antitumor effect of sotorasib with upstream PI3K inhibitor or downstream mTORC1 and mTORC2 dual inhibitor in sotorasib-acquired resistant PDXs, CDX, and xenograft tumors suggesting a possible combination to overcome the acquired resistance that merits translation into clinical trials.</p>

Female 6-to-8-week-old mice were used in these studies. Mice were housed in micro isolator cages under specific pathogen-free conditions in a dedicated mice room in the animal facility at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Mice were given autoclaved acidified water and fed a special diet (Uniprim diet). All animal experiments were carried out under approved IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocols following approval by the MDACC institutional review board and were performed by the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>H23 and H23AR xenograft tumors were generated by subcutaneously injecting 5–8 million cells per mouse into NSG mice. To ensure the maintenance of acquired resistance, H23AR cells were expanded in cell culture with sotorasib (2.5 µM) prior to implantation. Tumors were allowed to develop over a period of 4–6 weeks, after which all tumor-bearing mice were randomized blindly into different treatment groups, as specified in each in vivo experiment.</p>
<p>Once tumor volumes reached approximately 200 mm³, treatment was initiated and continued for at least three weeks. In studies evaluating the combination of sotorasib and copanlisib, single-agent treatment groups were included, with each group consisting of at least 5–7 mice. Control group mice received vehicle treatment, while the experimental groups were treated with sotorasib (50 mg/kg) and copanlisib (6 mg/kg) administered once daily (QD) for five days per week over a three-week period. Mice were monitored daily for potential side effects, and tumor growth was assessed by measuring two perpendicular tumor diameters two to three times per week. Tumor surface area was calculated using the formula: 1/2 × (Length × Width²).</p>

<title>Development of sotorasib-acquired resistant cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) model</title>
<p>The <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic>-mutant H358 cell line, recognized as one of the most sensitive models to sotorasib treatment, was implanted into NSG mice via subcutaneous injection, with each mouse receiving approximately 5–8 million cells. Once the tumors reached a volume of 200 mm³, the mice were administered sotorasib (AMG510) at a dosage of 100 mg/kg once daily (QD) for five days per week over a period of two months.</p>
<p>Tumors that grew beyond 500 mm³ were harvested, reimplanted into new NSG mice, and allowed to establish at 200 mm³ before initiating a second round of sotorasib treatment for an additional two months. Following this treatment period, the first-generation (G1) resistant tumors were collected and reimplanted into a new cohort of mice, where they were subjected to another four months of sotorasib treatment to generate the second-generation resistant CDX (G2). These G2-resistant CDXs were subsequently reimplanted into new mice and underwent another two-month cycle of sotorasib treatment to develop the third generation (G3) H358AR CDX model.</p>
<p>To evaluate the resistance potential of the G3 CDX model, G3 H358AR CDXs were implanted into a fresh batch of NSG mice, while a separate group of NSG mice received subcutaneous injections of parental H358 cells. Once tumors from both the G3 H358AR CDX and H358 xenografts reached 200 mm³, sotorasib treatment was initiated and maintained for three weeks. Tumor growth inhibition was assessed at Day 21 of treatment, revealing that the G3 H358AR CDX exhibited no detectable antitumor response. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on these CDXs to confirm the presence of the <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> mutation.</p>

<title>Development and therapeutic studies on NSCLC PDX models</title>
<p>12 <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> mutant PDXs were selected from our core with over 200 NSCLC PDXs in UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (Dr. Jack Roth, PI) developed under the NCI–funded PDX Development and Trial Centers Research Network (PDXNet) program. All the PDXs were well characterized and well annotated based on RNASeq, whole exome sequencing (WES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). PDXs were established from frozen stocks through implantation into NSG mice according to the protocol published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). The PDX studies were conducted according to the approved institutional animal care and use committee protocol in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p>
<p><bold><italic>For the sotorasib sensitive study</italic></bold>, PDXs TC247, TC314, TC303, and TC453 were established in NSG mice simultaneously or 1-2 models at a time. Tumor-bearing mice were randomized to treatment and control groups (n=5-7 mice/group) when tumor volume reached approximately 200 mm<sup>3</sup>. Treatments were started simultaneously for the models within an acceptable size window (such as 200 mm<sup>3</sup>) or independently for each mouse when a certain tumor size was reached (e.g., at a predetermined size such as 200 mm<sup>3</sup>) if mice were enrolled in all groups in a parallel fashion. PDX-bearing mice treated with sotorasib at the dose of 100 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg unless otherwise mentioned. The treatment was continued for 5 days/week for 3 weeks.</p>
<p><bold><italic>For the sotorasib combination studies</italic></bold> with either copanlisib (6 mg/kg) or sapanisertib (1mg/kg) in the TC314AR PDX model, treatment arms included single-agent administration of each agent to assess the contributions of each agent. Control mice were treated with solvent. Sotorasib, copanlisib or sapanisertib or solvent were administered orally QD for 21 days. Tumor growth was monitored 2-3 times/week.</p>
<p>The following formula approximates the volume of the ellipsoid corresponding to the tumor: tumor volume (mm<sup>3</sup>) = [tumor length X (tumor width)<sup>2</sup>]/2. Tumor growth curves show median or average tumor volumes, and the standard error (SE) or standard deviation was added to demonstrate variability. Changes in tumor volume were assessed by comparing the volume at a defined time point with the baseline volume, thus adjusting for baseline tumor volume. For an individual mouse, the tumor response according to the percent change in tumor volume was calculated from baseline to the time of assessment as follows: % tumor volume change <italic>ΔVt</italic> = (<italic>Vt</italic> - <italic>V0 / V0)</italic> X <italic>100</italic>, where <italic>Vt</italic> is the tumor volume at time <italic>t</italic> and <italic>V0</italic> is the tumor volume at baseline. We used the following criteria to determine treatment responses: 1) Tumor Regression (or partial response): tumor regression ≥ −30% based on tumor volume changes calculated by AUC<sub>0-21day</sub> or at day 21 after treatment start when compared with baseline (beginning of treatment at day 0); 2) Tumor Growth Inhibition (or stable disease): Tumor growth was significantly suppressed when compared with control (p &lt; 0.05), but no tumor regression was observed, or tumor regression was less than −30% based on tumor volume changes calculated by AUC<sub>0-21day</sub> or at day 21 after treatment start when compared with baseline; 3) Resistance: Tumor volume changes calculated by AUC<sub>0-21day</sub> was not significantly different from control group (p&gt;0.05).</p>

<title>Development of sotorasib-acquired resistant PDX models</title>
<p>To develop NSCLC PDXs with acquired resistance to sotorasib (AMG510), <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> mutation harboring TC303 and TC314 PDXs, the two most sotorasib sensitive PDXs, were implanted into NSG mice. when the tumor volume of these PDXs reached approximately 200 mm3, mice were treated with AMG510 (100mg/Kg) daily for at least 3 weeks, paused if tumor size shrank below 200 mm<sup>3</sup>. We monitored mice with regressed tumors for tumor re-growth. When those tumors regrew to 200 mm<sup>3</sup> in size, we retreated again, until mice were euthanized at tumor size at around 500-100 mm3. The tumors were passaged to new NSG mice for another round of AMG510 treatment. Third generation (G3) PDXs TC303AR and TC314AR were generated in which each generation was treated with three or more cycles. Susceptibility to AMG510 (sotorasib) was reduced in each passage. We performed whole exome sequencing for at least 2-3 tumors from each PDX obtained in passage 3 (G3) that were under constant AMG510 treatment and did not regress during treatment. All resistant tumors from third generations from both PDXs had the same <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> mutation as the parental PDXs (TC303 and TC314), with no other <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations.</p>

<title>PDX-derived organoid (PDXO) culture, maintenance, and development of sotorasib-acquired resistant PDXO models</title>
<p>PDX tissues were harvested and processed into 2-3-mm-diameter pieces and washed with ice-cold PBS. Tumor pieces were dissociated into single cells in Advanced DMEMF12 (GIBCO) with Liberase TM (Sigma) for 1 hour followed by 10-minute incubation with TrypLE Express (Invitrogen) in 37<sup>0</sup>C with gentle shaking. The establishment of organoids in culture was done according to the protocol described in Shi R et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) with little modification. Briefly, single cells from freshly harvested PDX tissues were counted and resuspended in 100% growth factor–reduced Matrigel (VWR), plated in 24-well tissue culture plates as Matrigel domes, and maintained in 37<sup>0</sup>C 5% CO2 with media overlaying the Matrigel dome. Growth factors and supplements used in the media for the organoid culture are followed according to the reference article. Organoid growth was monitored weekly for the detection of initiated organoids, and organoids were kept in the same passage for no longer than four weeks. To make the sotorasib resistant PDXOs, PDX TC303 and PDX TC314 tissues were harvested, and single-cell suspension and establishment of organoids (PDXO303 &amp; PDXO314) were prepared according to the protocol mentioned above. These organoids were cultured in a complete medium with all supplements and growth factors and incremental doses of sotorasib for 1-4 weeks before passaging. Repeated these passaging steps with sotorasib for several cycles until the organoids grew smoothly without cell death with 1 µM sotorasib containing medium and developed the sotorasib resistant PDXO303AR and PDXO314AR isogeneic organoids. The resistant organoids were then subjected to whole exome sequencing to verify <italic>KRAS<sup>G12C</sup></italic> mutation status.</p>
<p>To check the purity of organoids, we prepared the single cells from fresh organoids and stained them with mouse cells detecting antibody (H-2Kb/H-2Db; BioLegend, CA, USA) and human epithelial marker (EpCAM; BioLegend, CA, USA) and ran flow cytometry using Attune NxT cytometer (Invitrogen, CA, USA).

<p>CRISPR-Cas9 technology was used to knock out PI3K and 4E-BP1 genes so that the corresponding functional proteins are no longer produced. These experiments involved transfecting H23AR and H358AR cells with a target-specific guide RNA (gRNA) and a Cas9 nuclease. All the reagents which included Gene Knockout Kit v2, sgRNA, and SpCas9 Nuclease were purchased from Synthego (Synthego, CA, USA). The experiment was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, for one knockout test, 3 ul sgRNA (30 uM), 0.5 ul Cas9 (20 uM), and 3.5 ul Buffer R were mixed and kept at Room Temperature for 10 min, and then added 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells in 3 ul Buffer R to the above mixture, followed by electroporation (Invitrogen Neon electroporation system: 10-ul tip type) (Pulse voltage, 1100 v; Pulse width, 30 ms; Pulse number, 1). After electroporation, the knockout cells were cultured in a 24-well plate at 37 <sup>0</sup>C for 3 days. Total genomic DNA was extracted, PCR for specific genes was conducted, a certain DNA fragment was sequenced with the Sanger technique, and sequencing results were analyzed using Inference of CRISPR Edits (ICE) (a free online tool on Synthego website) that provides an easy quantitative assessment of indels generated by CRISPR in pools and clones. The ICE report outputs both the total indel percentage and the Knockout Score (the percentage of outcomes that lead to a putative knockout). Finally, the knockout efficiency was carried out using western blot for the specific knockout gene protein products.</p>

Two-way ANOVA with the interaction of treatment group and time point was performed to compare the difference of tumor volume changes from baseline between each pair of the treatment groups at each time point. Means ± standard errors of the mean are shown in all graphs. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was applied to compare cell numbers in different treatment groups.

SuperCurve, a software developed in-house, was used to estimate relative protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). After SuperCurve fitting, protein measurements were normalized for loading using median centering across antibodies. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess the differences in protein expressions between control and treatment groups on a protein-by-protein basis. First, for one feature(protein) at a time, we carried out an over-all F test to detect any significant difference among the means of all the groups. Next, for the featured (proteins) identified in this process, we then compared between desired groups to identify the sources of difference. The R library “multcomp” was used for this purpose. Note that the FC (fold change) values were calculated as the estimated ratio between the 2 groups in comparison, with the following conventional modification: For the rations &gt; 1 (up-regulation), FCs were noted as the same as the ratio. For the rations ≤ 1 (down-regulation), FC were noted as the negative inverse of the ratio. Furthermore, to account for multiple testing, we estimated the false discovery rates (FDR) of the overall test of the model using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. An FDR adjusted p-value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant unless otherwise mentioned. The criteria of significant protein selection were: 1.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors investigate mechanisms of acquired resistance (AR) to KRAS-G12C inhibitors (sotorasib) in NSCLC, proposing that resistance arises from signaling rewiring rather than additional mutations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Using a panel of AR models - including cell lines, PDXs, CDXs, and PDXOs - they report activation of KRAS and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, with elevated PI3K levels. Pharmacologic inhibition or CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of PI3K partially restores sotorasib sensitivity, and p-4EBP1 upregulation is implicated as an additional contributor, with dual mTORC1/2 inhibition more effective than mTORC1 inhibition alone.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the study addresses an important clinical question, it is limited by several weaknesses in experimental rigor, data interpretation, and presentation. The mechanistic findings are not entirely novel, since the role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in therapeutic resistance is already well-established in the literature. Rather than uncovering new resistance mechanisms, the study largely confirms known pathways. Several key conclusions are not supported by the data, and critical alternative explanations - such as additional mutations or increased KRAS expression - are not thoroughly investigated or ruled out. Furthermore, while the authors use CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out PI3K and 4E-BP1 in H23-AR and H358-AR cells to restore sotorasib sensitivity, they do not perform reconstitution experiments to confirm that re-expressing PI3K or 4E-BP1 reverses the sensitization. This prevents full characterization of PI3K and p-4EBP1 upregulation as contributors to resistance. The manuscript also has several errors, poor figure quality, and a lack of proper quantification. Additional experimental validation, data improvement, and text revisions are required.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors focus on the identification of the mechanisms involved in the acquired resistance to Sotorasib in non-small lung KRASG12C mutant cells. To perform this study, the authors generate different clones of cell lines, cell-derived xenografts, patient-derived xenograft organoids, and patient-derived xenografts. In all these models, the authors generate resistant forms (i.e., resistant cell lines PDXs and organoids) and the genetic and molecular changes were characterised using whole-exome sequencing, proteomics, and phospho-proteomics. This analysis led to the identification of an important role of the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1/2 signalling network in the acquisition of resistance in several of the models tested. Molecular characterisation identified changes in the expression of some of the proteins in this network as key changes for the acquisition of resistance, and in particular, the authors show that changes in 4E-BP1 are common to some of the cells downstream of PI3K. Using pharmacological testing, they show that different drugs targeting PI3K, AKT, and MTORC1/2 sensitise some of the resistant models to Sotorasib. The analyses showed that the PI3K inhibitor copanlisib has an effect in NSCLC cells that, in some cases, seems to be synergistic with Sotorasib. Based on the work performed, the authors conclude that the PI3K/mTORC1/2 mediated 4E-BP1 phosphorylation is one of the mechanisms associated with the acquisition of resistance to Sotorasib and that targeting this signalling module could result in effective treatments for NSCLC patients.</p>
<p>The work as presented in the current manuscript is very interesting, provides cell models that benefit the community, and can be used to expand our knowledge of the mechanism of resistance to KRAS targeting therapies. Overall, the techniques and methodology seem to be performed in agreement with standard practice, and the results support most of the conclusions made by the authors. However, there are some points that, if addressed, would increase the value and relevance of the findings and further extend the impact of this work. Some of the recommendations for changes relate to the way things are explained and presented, which need some work. Other changes might require the performance of additional experiments or reanalysis of the existing data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) One of the stronger contributions of this article is the different models used to study the acquisition of resistance to Sotorasib. The resistant cell lines, PDXs and PDXOs, and the fact that the authors have different clones for each, made this collection especially relevant, as they seem to show different mechanisms that the cells used to become resistant to Sotorasib. Although logically, the authors focus on one of these mechanisms, the differential responses of the different clones and models to the treatments used in this work show that some of the clones used additional mechanisms of resistance that can be explored in other studies. Importantly, as they use in vitro and in vivo models, the results also consider the tumour microenvironment and other factors in the response to the treatments.</p>
<p>(2) Another strength is the molecular characterisation of the different Sotorasib-resistant tumour cells by WES, which shows that these cells do not seem to acquire secondary mutations.</p>
<p>(3) The use of MS-based proteomics also identifies proteome signatures that are associated with the acquisition of resistance, including PI3K/mTORC1/2. The combination of proteomics and phospho-proteomics results should allow the identification of several mechanisms that are deregulated in Sotorasib-resistant cells.</p>
<p>(4) The results show a strong response of the NSCLC cells and PDXs to copanlisib, a drug for which there is limited information in this cancer type.</p>
<p>(5) The way they develop the PDX-resistant and the PDXO seems to be appropriate.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In general, the data is of good quality, but due to the sheer amount of data included and the way it is presented and discussed, several of the claims or conclusions are not clear.</p>
<p>(1) The abstract is rather long and gives details that are not usually included in one. This makes it very complicated to identify the most relevant findings of the work. The use of acronyms PDX, PDXO, and CDX without defining them makes it complicated for the non-specialist to know what the models are. Rewriting and reorganisation of the abstract would benefit the manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) Expression, presentation, and grammar should be reviewed in all sections of the manuscript.</p>
<p>(3) In the different parts of the result section where the models shown in Figure 2 are described the authors indicate &quot;Whole-exome sequencing (WES) confirmed that XXX model retained the KRASG12C mutation with no additional KRAS mutations detected&quot; however, it is not indicated where this data is shown and in not all the cases there is explanation to other possible modifications that might relate to mechanisms of resistance. This information should be included in the manuscript, and the WES made publicly available.</p>
<p>(4) The way the proteomics analysis of the TC303 and TC314 parental and resistant PDX is described in the text is confusing. The addition of an experimental layout figure would facilitate the understanding. As it is written, it is not obvious that the parental PDX were also analysed. For instance, the authors say, &quot;The global and phosphoproteomic analyses identified over 8,000 and 4,000 gene protein products (GPPs), respectively&quot;. Is this comparing only resistant cells, or from the comparison of the parental and resistant pairs? And where are these numbers presented in the figures? Also, there is information that seems more adequate for the materials and methods sections, i.e., &quot;Samples were analyzed using label-free nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) on a Thermo Fusion Mass Spectrometer. The resulting data were processed and quantified using the Proteome Discoverer 2.5 interface with the Mascot search engine, referencing the NCBI RefSeq protein database (Saltzman, Ruprecht). Two-component analysis is better named principal component analysis.&quot;</p>
<p>(5) While the presentation of the proteomics data could be done in different ways, the way the data is presented in Figure 3 does not allow the reader to get an idea of many of the findings from this experiment. Although it is indicated that a table with the data will be made available, this should be central to the way the data is presented and explained. A table (ie, Excel doc) where the raw data and all the analysis are presented should be included and referenced. Additionally, heat maps for the whole proteomes identified should be included. In the text, it is said, &quot;Global proteomic heatmap analysis revealed unique protein profiles in TC303AR and TC314AR PDXs compared to their sensitive counterparts (Figure 3C).&quot; However, this figure only shows the histogram of the differentially regulated cells. Inclusion of the histogram showing all the cells is necessary, and it might be informative to include the histogram comparing the two isogenic pairs, which could identify common mechanisms and differences between both sets. In Figure 3C, the protein names should be readable, or a reference to tables where the proteins are listed should be included.</p>
<p>(6) In Figure 3, the pathway enrichment tool and GO used should be mentioned in the text. The tables with all significant tables should also be provided. The proteomics data seems to convincingly identify mTOR as one of the pathways deregulated in resistant cells, but there is little explanation of what is considered a significant FDR value and if there are other pathways or networks that are also modified, which might not be common to both isogenic models. In MS-based Phosphoproteome could help with the identification of differentially regulated pathways, but it is not really presented in the current manuscript. Most of the analysis of phospho-proteomics comes from the RPPA analysis, which is targeted proteomics. With the way the data is presented, the authors show evidence for a role of mTOR in the acquisition of resistance, but unfortunately, they do not discuss or allow the reader to explore if other pathways might also contribute to this change.</p>
<p>(7) Where is the proteomics data going to be deposited, and will it be made public to comply with FAIR principles?</p>
<p>(8) The authors claim that the resistance shown for H23AR and H353AR cells is due to reactivation of KRAS signalling. This is done by looking to phosphorylation of ERK as a surrogate, as they claim, &quot;KRAS inhibition is commonly assessed by evaluating the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation (p-ERK)&quot;. While this might be true in many cases, the data presented does not demonstrate that the increase in p-ERK is due to reactivation of KRAS. To make this claim, the authors should measure activation of KRAS (and possibly H- and NRAS) using GST-pull down or an image-based method.</p>
<p>(9) The experiments in Figure 4 are very confusing, and some controls are missing. There is no blot where they show the effect of Sotorasib treatment in H23 and H358 parental cells. Is the increase shown in resistant cells shown in parental or is it exclusive for resistant cells only (and therefore acquired)? Experiment 4B should include this control. What is clear is that there is an increase in the expression of AKT and PI3K.</p>
<p>(10) The main point here is whether this is acquired resistance or the sensitivity to the drug is already there, and there was no need to do an omics experiment to find this. In some cases, it seems that the single treatment with PI3K inhibitors is as effective as Sotorasib treatment, promoting the death of the parental cells. This is in line with previous data in H23 and H353 that show sensitivity to PI3K inhibition ( i.e., H358 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2005.06.051 ; 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2005.06.051H23 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2018.0361). The data is clear, especially for copanlisib, but would it be the case that this treatment could be used for the treatment of NSCLC alone or directly in combination with Sotorasib and prevent resistance? The results shown in Figure 4C strongly support that a single treatment might be effective in cases that do not respond to Sotorasib. The data in figure 4D-F (please correct typo &quot;inhibition&quot; in labels) seem to support that PI3K treatment of parental cells is as effective as in the resistant cells.</p>
<p>(11) The experiments presented in Figure 7 show synergy between Sotorasib and copanlisib treatment in some of the resistant cells. But in Figure 7G, the single treatment of H23AR is as effective as the combination. Did the authors check the effect of this drug on the parental cells? As they do not include this control, it is not possible to know if this is acquired sensitivity to PI3K inhibition or if the parental cells were already sensitive (as indicated by the Figure 4 results).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors investigate mechanisms of acquired resistance (AR) to KRAS-G12C inhibitors (sotorasib) in NSCLC, proposing that resistance arises from signaling rewiring rather than additional mutations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Using a panel of AR models - including cell lines, PDXs, CDXs, and PDXOs - they report activation of KRAS and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, with elevated PI3K levels. Pharmacologic inhibition or CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of PI3K partially restores sotorasib sensitivity, and p-4EBP1 upregulation is implicated as an additional contributor, with dual mTORC1/2 inhibition more effective than mTORC1 inhibition alone.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the study addresses an important clinical question, it is limited by several weaknesses in experimental rigor, data interpretation, and presentation. The mechanistic findings are not entirely novel, since the role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in therapeutic resistance is already well-established in the literature. Rather than uncovering new resistance mechanisms, the study largely confirms known pathways. Several key conclusions are not supported by the data, and critical alternative explanations - such as additional mutations or increased KRAS expression - are not thoroughly investigated or ruled out. Furthermore, while the authors use CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out PI3K and 4E-BP1 in H23-AR and H358-AR cells to restore sotorasib sensitivity, they do not perform reconstitution experiments to confirm that re-expressing PI3K or 4E-BP1 reverses the sensitization. This prevents full characterization of PI3K and p-4EBP1 upregulation as contributors to resistance. The manuscript also has several errors, poor figure quality, and a lack of proper quantification. Additional experimental validation, data improvement, and text revisions are required.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Acquired resistance to KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitors such as sotorasib or adagrasib remains a significant clinical challenge. Therefore, the identification of mechanisms of acquired resistance, along with the development of alternative therapeutic strategies, including combination therapies with KRAS inhibitors, represents an urgent unmet clinical need. The emergence of secondary KRAS mutations or new mutations in other oncogenic drivers has been observed as a primary cause of acquired resistance in a fraction of patients. No identifiable mutations were detected in more than half of the tumors from patients who developed acquired resistance after treatment with sotorasib or adagrasib.</p>
<p>Using a discovery-based approach that integrated global proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses in the TC303AR and TC314AR PDX models, we identified distinct protein signatures associated with KRAS reactivation, upregulation of mTORC1 signaling, and activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. These findings prompted further investigation into these mechanisms of resistance and evaluation of novel therapeutic combinations to overcome resistance. Notably, the combination of sotorasib with copanlisib (a PI3K inhibitor), or the combination of sotorasib with AZD8055 or sapanisertib (mTORC1/2 dual inhibitors) demonstrated strong potential for future clinical use. These regimens effectively restored sotorasib sensitivity in both in vitro and in vivo models and produced robust, synergistic antitumor effects across various acquired resistance models.</p>
<p>CRISPR-Cas9-mediated PI3K and 4E-BP1 knockout clones were generated in more than one resistant cell line that expressed a robust level of the knockout target, and multiple independent clones in each cell line were evaluated with and without gene disruption. Given the thorough nature of this analysis, additional reconstitution experiments were deemed unnecessary, as they would not yield further insight.</p>
<p>Whole exome sequencing was performed on resistant cells or PDX models to confirm retention of the KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> mutation and to identify secondary KRAS mutations, none of which were found. We acknowledge that additional resistance mechanisms may be involved. These will be the focus of future investigations.</p>
<p>The revised manuscript will feature improved figure quality, complete and clarified figure legends, and corrected textual errors to enhance overall clarity and presentation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors focus on the identification of the mechanisms involved in the acquired resistance to Sotorasib in non-small lung KRASG12C mutant cells. To perform this study, the authors generate different clones of cell lines, cell-derived xenografts, patient-derived xenograft organoids, and patient-derived xenografts. In all these models, the authors generate resistant forms (i.e., resistant cell lines PDXs and organoids) and the genetic and molecular changes were characterised using whole-exome sequencing, proteomics, and phospho-proteomics. This analysis led to the identification of an important role of the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1/2 signalling network in the acquisition of resistance in several of the models tested. Molecular characterisation identified changes in the expression of some of the proteins in this network as key changes for the acquisition of resistance, and in particular, the authors show that changes in 4E-BP1 are common to some of the cells downstream of PI3K. Using pharmacological testing, they show that different drugs targeting PI3K, AKT, and MTORC1/2 sensitise some of the resistant models to Sotorasib. The analyses showed that the PI3K inhibitor copanlisib has an effect in NSCLC cells that, in some cases, seems to be synergistic with Sotorasib. Based on the work performed, the authors conclude that the PI3K/mTORC1/2 mediated 4E-BP1 phosphorylation is one of the mechanisms associated with the acquisition of resistance to Sotorasib and that targeting this signalling module could result in effective treatments for NSCLC patients.</p>
<p>The work as presented in the current manuscript is very interesting, provides cell models that benefit the community, and can be used to expand our knowledge of the mechanism of resistance to KRAS targeting therapies. Overall, the techniques and methodology seem to be performed in agreement with standard practice, and the results support most of the conclusions made by the authors. However, there are some points that, if addressed, would increase the value and relevance of the findings and further extend the impact of this work. Some of the recommendations for changes relate to the way things are explained and presented, which need some work. Other changes might require the performance of additional experiments or reanalysis of the existing data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) One of the stronger contributions of this article is the different models used to study the acquisition of resistance to Sotorasib. The resistant cell lines, PDXs and PDXOs, and the fact that the authors have different clones for each, made this collection especially relevant, as they seem to show different mechanisms that the cells used to become resistant to Sotorasib. Although logically, the authors focus on one of these mechanisms, the differential responses of the different clones and models to the treatments used in this work show that some of the clones used additional mechanisms of resistance that can be explored in other studies. Importantly, as they use in vitro and in vivo models, the results also consider the tumour microenvironment and other factors in the response to the treatments.</p>
<p>(2) Another strength is the molecular characterisation of the different Sotorasib-resistant tumour cells by WES, which shows that these cells do not seem to acquire secondary mutations.</p>
<p>(3) The use of MS-based proteomics also identifies proteome signatures that are associated with the acquisition of resistance, including PI3K/mTORC1/2. The combination of proteomics and phospho-proteomics results should allow the identification of several mechanisms that are deregulated in Sotorasib-resistant cells.</p>
<p>(4) The results show a strong response of the NSCLC cells and PDXs to copanlisib, a drug for which there is limited information in this cancer type.</p>
<p>(5) The way they develop the PDX-resistant and the PDXO seems to be appropriate.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In general, the data is of good quality, but due to the sheer amount of data included and the way it is presented and discussed, several of the claims or conclusions are not clear.</p>
<p>(1) The abstract is rather long and gives details that are not usually included in one. This makes it very complicated to identify the most relevant findings of the work. The use of acronyms PDX, PDXO, and CDX without defining them makes it complicated for the non-specialist to know what the models are. Rewriting and reorganisation of the abstract would benefit the manuscript.</p>

<p>(3) In the different parts of the result section where the models shown in Figure 2 are described the authors indicate &quot;Whole-exome sequencing (WES) confirmed that XXX model retained the KRASG12C mutation with no additional KRAS mutations detected&quot; however, it is not indicated where this data is shown and in not all the cases there is explanation to other possible modifications that might relate to mechanisms of resistance.

<p>We agree that KRAS activation can be assessed through various methods. In this manuscript, which primarily focuses on mechanisms of resistance, pathway analysis revealed upregulation of KRAS signaling. This finding correlated with the incomplete inhibition of p-ERK by sotorasib in resistant cells. Notably, p-ERK status is widely recognized and routinely used as a surrogate marker for KRAS pathway activation.</p>

<p>H23 and H358 cells are highly sensitive to sotorasib, as demonstrated by the cell viability assays presented in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 3, sotorasib treatment led to complete inhibition of p-ERK in these parental cell lines. In contrast, p-ERK inhibition was incomplete in the resistant H23AR and H358AR cells. Moreover, these AR cells were continuously cultured under sotorasib pressure to maintain resistance.</p>

The data in figure 4D-F (please correct typo &quot;inhibition&quot; in labels) seem to support that PI3K treatment of parental cells is as effective as in the resistant cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. Based on our in vitro (Figure 4) and in vivo (Figure 7) data, copanlisib was able to overcome sotorasib resistance, demonstrating either synergistic or additive effects depending on the specific model. These findings support the potential of combining PI3K inhibition with KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibition as a promising strategy to address acquired resistance.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) The experiments presented in Figure 7 show synergy between Sotorasib and copanlisib treatment in some of the resistant cells. But in Figure 7G, the single treatment of H23AR is as effective as the combination. Did the authors check the effect of this drug on the parental cells? As they do not include this control, it is not possible to know if this is acquired sensitivity to PI3K inhibition or if the parental cells were already sensitive (as indicated by the Figure 4 results).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Both H23 and H23AR cells showed high sensitivity to copanlisib, as shown in Figure 4. Combination index analysis for the copanlisib + sotorasib treatment (Figure 7A) revealed synergistic effects on cell viability at specific concentrations. However, in the in vivo experiment (Figure 7G), we did not observe a clear synergistic effect of the combination treatment against H23AR xenografts. This may be attributed to the dose of copanlisib used, which was potentially sufficient on its own to produce a strong antitumor response, thereby masking any additional benefit from the combination.</p>
