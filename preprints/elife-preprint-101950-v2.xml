<title>Abstract</title><p>The amygdala is a subcortical region in the mesiotemporal lobe that plays a key role in emotional and sensory functions. Conventional neuroimaging experiments treat this structure as a single, uniform entity, but there is ample histological evidence for subregional heterogeneity in microstructure and function. The current study characterized subregional structure-function coupling in the human amygdala, integrating <italic>post mortem</italic> histology and <italic>in vivo</italic> MRI at ultrahigh fields. Core to our work was a novel neuroinformatics approach that leveraged multiscale texture analysis as well as non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques to identify salient dimensions of microstructural variation in a 3D <italic>post mortem</italic> histological reconstruction of the human amygdala. We observed two axes of subregional variation in this region, describing inferior-superior as well as medio-lateral trends in microstructural differentiation that in part recapitulated established atlases of amygdala subnuclei. Translating our approach to <italic>in vivo</italic> MRI data acquired at 7 Tesla, we could demonstrate generalizability of these spatial trends across 10 healthy adults. We then cross-referenced microstructural axes with functional blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal analysis obtained during task-free conditions, and revealed a close association of structural axes with macroscale functional network embedding, notably the temporo-limbic, default mode, and sensory-motor networks. Our novel multiscale approach consolidates descriptions of amygdala anatomy and function obtained from histological and <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging techniques.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The amygdala is a central hub for socio-affective and cognitive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Over the past decades, lesion studies in animals and humans have been crucial in our understanding of this structure’s functional role. Studies performed in animal models have reported significant deficits in a vast array of social and affective functions following amygdala lesions, including affective blunting, perturbed social interest and affiliation behaviors, increased aggression, altered sexual and maternal behaviors as well as fear response to environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). In addition to altering social behavior, lesions of this structure in humans have been associated with impaired decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) and deficits in attention and arousal mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), emphasizing the importance of the amygdala in a broad array of functional domains.</p>
<p>Although earlier work on amygdala function in humans has considered this region as a single, unitary structure, the distinct roles of its individual subdivisions are now increasingly highlighted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Notably, early research on the amygdala in non-human primates has been instrumental in understanding its intricate structure, function and patterns of anatomical connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). This foundational study highlights the amygdala’s different subdivisions, most notably the basomedial nucleus (BM), basolateral nucleus (BL), and central nucleus (Ce) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Furthermore, this work describes a dense network between these subdivisions and the prefrontal cortex, most strongly found in the posterior orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate areas.</p>
<p>In humans, qualitative examinations of <italic>post mortem</italic> specimens have identified several subdivisions within the amygdala, each with distinct cytoarchitectural characteristics and distinguishable connectivity profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). These individual subnuclei have often been grouped into larger subdivisions, specifically centromedian, laterobasal and superficial regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Distinguishable connectivity profiles in these subdivisions have been previously observed through the analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). This non-invasive technique has been instrumental to interrogate grey matter (GM) connectivity and map functional networks in the brain by detecting coordinated hemodynamic signal fluctuations across regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). For instance, previous work has shown synchronized functional signals between the centromedial (CM) subdivision of the amygdala and middle and anterior cingulate cortices, frontal cortex, striatum, insula, cerebellum and precuneus, supporting processes such as attention control and visceral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Conversely, the laterobasal (LB) region shows unique connectivity with the inferior and middle temporal gyri and middle occipital gyrus which have been associated with associative processing of environmental information and the integration with self-relevant cognition for decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). The superficial (SF) subdivision of the amygdala has rather been associated with social information processing and social interaction via its unique connectivity to the paracentral lobule, posterior cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Given these differences across amygdala subregions, combining structural and functional analyses can shed light on the multi-faceted contribution of the amygdala to affective and cognitive functioning by potentially revealing variable participation of its subdivisions in different functional networks.</p>
<p>Our current understanding of the amygdala highlights its multidimensional roles, supported by its complex anatomy and participation in multiple brain networks. However, microstructural atlases of this area developed using quantitative techniques are still lacking but are essential for large-scale investigations of structure-function coupling within this region. Emerging strategies for quantitative segmentations of amygdala subdivisions have shown promising results. For example, a dual-branch convolutional network model trained with features extracted from T1- weighted images could find strong overlap between automatically segmented labels and a manual segmentation of lateral, basal, cortico-superficial and centromedial subregions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Similarly, a machine learning-based correction model could achieve comparable accuracy using a multi-atlas segmentation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Despite the promise of these methods, they remain to be validated in histology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), which remains a key technique to validate MRI-based features with access to ground-truth measures of cytoarchitecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Indeed, regions with different cytoarchitecture often show distinct myelination patterns, which can be observed through various MRI contrasts. Such myelin-sensitive imaging contrasts can differentiate regions with distinct intracortical myeloarchitectonic profiles, demonstrating ties between variations in cellular architecture and myelin distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study seeks to elucidate the intricate structure-function relationships within the amygdala by leveraging advanced data-driven quantitative methods and high-resolution histology. Our approach first leveraged computer vision techniques to map major subdivisions of the amygdala in BigBrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), a <italic>post mortem</italic>, high-resolution 3D histological dataset providing direct measurements of brain cytoarchitecture. We translated this approach to <italic>in vivo</italic> MRI data acquired at ultra-high fields enabling individual-specific assessments of microstructure-function coupling in the amygdala. Harnessing myelin-sensitive contrasts and multi-echo rsfMRI, our study identifies a principal axis of microstructural and functional network dissociation within the human amygdala from a data-driven analysis of its cyto-and myeloarchitecture.</p>

<title>Data-driven histological analysis of the human amygdala</title>
<p>Using a radiomics approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), we computed the four central moments (mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) from cell body staining intensities in the amygdala provided by the BigBrain dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). These voxel-wise metrics were computed across different kernel sizes, with local 3-dimensional neighborhoods ranging from a radius of 2 to 10 voxels. As expected, increasing kernel values produced smoother images for all central moments. Thus fine-grain features were emphasized at small kernel values and coarser features with larger kernel values.</p>

</fig>
<p>The resulting feature bank showed heterogeneous feature profiles across selected moments and kernel sizes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Mean intensities smoothly increased in the ventral to dorsal direction, culminating in highest intensity values in the dorsal subnucleus regions, and mainly coinciding with the CM subdivision of the amygdala. Variance, however, was highest along the amygdala’s borders with the entorhinal cortex and in the amygdala-striatum transition zone. Skewness and kurtosis maps generally co-varied spatially and both highlight high skewness and kurtosis within the lateral nucleus. Together, these findings indicate that the selected features captured both unique and shared characteristics of histological signal variations within the amygdala.</p>
<p>We then applied Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that preserves the local and global structure of high-dimensional data by projecting it into a lower-dimensional space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>) to the resulting 20-feature matrix (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) to derive a 2-dimensional embedding of amygdala cytoarchitecture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). This approach allowed us to bring the high dimensional histological feature space to a 2D embedding space composed of every amygdala voxel. As such, amygdala voxels were ordered along two dimensions, U1 and U2, capturing two axes of variance in amygdala cytoarchitecture. To better visualize which features may be driving each UMAP dimension, we sorted all input features along U1 and U2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Ordering the mean along U1 highlighted increasing intensity values at all different kernel sizes, where highest intensity voxels co-localized with low values in U1. While the variance, skewness and kurtosis showed less systematic changes at lower kernel values, patterns became more evident at higher kernels. Indeed, variance and kurtosis seemed to show an opposite trend to the mean along U1, where higher skewness and kurtosis co-localized more strongly with positive values of U1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1427">Supplementary Table S1.1</xref>). In contrast, sorting the feature matrix by U2 showed very similar trends between all features, independent of its moment and kernel value. More specifically, the highest intensity voxels were mostly found to show higher values along U2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1427">Supplementary Table S1.2</xref>). Overall, these UMAP-driven visualizations of the histological feature space suggest our dimensionality reduction approach could recover moment-specific (U1) as well as global intensity covariations across moments (U2).</p>
<p>To contextualize variations in U1 and U2 values across the amygdala, we computed voxel-wise correlations between each UMAP component and the amygdala coordinate space. U1 primarily varied along the inferior-superior axis (U1: r = 0.8340; U2: r =-0.0137), followed by posterior-anterior (U1: r =-0.5282; U2: r = 0.2793) and medial-lateral directions (U1: r = 0.1399; U2: r =- 0.2657) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Statistical significance of correlations was assessed using a variogram matching approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>) implemented in the BrainSpace toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Both UMAP components were found to significantly co-vary along the posterior-anterior axis (U1: <italic>p<sub>null</sub></italic>&lt; 0.001; U2: <italic>p<sub>null</sub></italic> = 0.002), while only U1 was significantly correlated with the inferior-superior axis (U1: <italic>p<sub>null</sub></italic> &lt; 0.001; U2: <italic>p<sub>null</sub></italic> = 0.909). Neither U1 or U2 were significantly correlated with the medial-lateral coordinate (U1: <italic>p<sub>null</sub></italic> = 0.441; U2: <italic>p<sub>null</sub></italic> = 0.068).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Validation of histological space using independent post mortem dataset</title>
<p>We contextualize our data-driven approach using established probability maps of amygdala microstructure. These openly available probability maps generated from visual inspection of 10 <italic>post mortem</italic> brains divide the amygdala into CM, SF, and LB subregions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Maps were thresholded to retain only voxels with highest 5% probability values and binarized. Plotting the probability values of retained voxels for each subregion showed that UMAP could dissociate these established cytoarchitectural subdivisions of the amygdala (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). The three subregions could be particularly segregated along the U1 component. Indeed, we found significant differences in U1 values across the three amygdala subdivisions (F = 1630.8; <italic>p<sub>null</sub></italic>&lt; 0.001), while no significant difference was found across U2 (F = 30.3; <italic>p<sub>null</sub></italic> &lt; 0.581) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Together, these findings show our theoretically grounded framework can successfully distinguish different subregions in the amygdala in a purely data-driven way. Additionally, results could be replicated when analyzing signals from the right amygdala, supporting the potential generalizability of our framework (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1427">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p>

We leverage quantitative T1 imaging collected at a field strength of 7 Tesla (7T) in 10 unrelated, healthy participants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). These images offered a resolution of 500um and were run through a similar analytical framework as the BigBrain dataset. We used individual-specific segmentations of the amygdala obtained with VolBrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Once again, a feature bank was rendered from the same central moments, specifically mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Kernel sizes varied from size 1-5, resulting in 20 distinct feature maps (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The new feature bank was again submitted to UMAP for dimensionality reduction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), and values of each component were plotted back to their respective coordinates in the amygdala.</p>

<p>We then compared spatial variations of the two UMAP components uncovered in each participant with the UMAP space derived from the BigBrain dataset. When examining the spatial layout of the UMAP components, we find similar neuroanatomical trends in all subjects to those found in histology (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Notably, the U1 vector of all subjects are found to be significantly correlated to the inferior-superior axis from a variogram matching test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1427">Supplementary Table S2.1</xref>), similarly to BigBrain, suggesting the potential for this framework to capture important structural features in histology as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> MRI. We also find that the medial-lateral axis correlations to U1 across all subjects are consistent from the variogram test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1427">Supplementary Table S2.1</xref>). The spatial layout of U2, on the other hand, showed lower consistency across participants, as none of the coordinate axes were significantly correlated with U2 in more than 7/10 subjects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1427">Supplementary Table S2.2</xref>). In sum, we identify a single axis (U1) able to pick up on important amygdala microstructural features in both <italic>post mortem</italic> histology and <italic>in vivo</italic> markers of GM microstructure.</p>

<title>Association with macroscale function</title>
<p>We next sought to investigate associations between amygdala microstructural organization and this region’s macroscale functional organization across subjects. Given U1’s strong spatial consistency across participants and microstructural modalities, we generated subject-specific masks segregating this component’s highest and lowest 25% of values within the amygdala for each participant. This resulted in two distinct regions of interest, reflecting the anchors of maximal microstructural dissociation within the amygdala for each participant, from which we could extract corresponding functional activity recorded at rest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>Voxel-wise rsfMRI timeseries were averaged within each microstructural subregion and correlated to vertex-wise cortical timeseries. A linear mixed effect model comparing amygdalo-cortical connectivity profiles between both subregions showed that functional network affiliations significantly differed across U1 subregions, with stronger connectivity observed between the superior portions of the amygdala (top 25% U1 values) and the prefrontal lobe (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Stratifying functional connectivity patterns of each amygdala subregion to the cortex according to established intrinsic functional network communities further highlighted the relatively stronger connectivity of the superior subregions to all cortical networks, particularly the limbic, frontoparietal, and default mode networks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Meta-analytical decoding of subregional connectivity profiles using NeuroSynth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>) emphasized the functional dissociation in connectivity patterns of both microstructurally-defined areas. This analysis showed that the functional connectivity pattern of the region with highest 25% U1 values was most strongly associated with terms relating to autobiographical memory (‘autobiographical’ and ‘autobiographical memory’), while the other seed region’s connectivity profile overlapped with activation patterns related to emotional input (‘happy faces’, ‘neutral faces’ and ‘fearful faces’) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, decoding our statistical effects map (Region 1 connectivity &gt; Region 2 connectivity) highlighted associations with terms relating to the self, introspection, and reward (‘self referential’, ‘referential’, ‘moral’, ‘autobiographical’, ‘smoking’, ‘craving’). Collectively, these findings show that our theoretically-grounded approach, developed in histology and generalizable to microstructurally-sensitive <italic>in vivo</italic> MRI data, can delineate distinct functional network embeddings in the human amygdala.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The amygdala is a crucial structure for several aspects of cognitive and socio-affective functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). These functions are supported by complex connectivity patterns to other brain regions, stemming from distinct subnuclei with unique microstructural properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). However, current investigations of structure-function coupling in the amygdala are limited by a lack of datasets and tools for individualized and observer-independent delineation of its subregions. Indeed, the strong inter-individual variability of its structural and functional organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>) motivates more personalized approaches to reliably study the microstructural determinants of amygdala function and connectivity. In the current paper, we present a data-driven exploration of subcortical cytoarchitecture applied to the human amygdala. We could translate this approach to microstructurally-sensitive <italic>in vivo</italic> MRI data as a bridge, to ultimately examine associations between microstructural subregions and functional networks. As such, the present work defines a quantitative and integrated account of the amygdala’s microstructural composition and functional organization. In doing so, our approach sets the stage for novel investigations spanning other subcortico-cortical systems, and shows potential to deliver new insights into brain-wide principles of structure-function coupling and how this interplay may be altered in clinical populations.</p>
<p>The proposed framework aimed to delineate amygdala subnuclear organization by leveraging a multiscale texture processing pipeline designed to retain finer and coarser regional cytoarchitectonic properties. We specifically harness radiomics, a field with established diagnostic and prognostic potential in medical imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Feature selection in our study was motivated by previous work conducted at the level of the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) and focused on the four central moments, specifically, the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of voxel subsets, to reflect regional texture variability related to amygdala cytoarchitecture. In contrast to qualitative approaches based on single features, such as investigations based on the detection of specific cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>), our pipeline captures several aspects of amygdala microstructure informing non-linear dimensionality reduction methods applied to a high-dimensional feature space. The resulting components U1 and U2 reflected complex combinations of central moments, with U1 being mainly scaled to mean intensities and U2 being associated to weighted combinations of the different moments. Crucially, we validated this coordinate space using openly available maps of amygdalar subdivisions from histological examinations performed by expert neuroanatomists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). This approach complements previous work harnessing subnuclear parcellations of the amygdala derived from visual inspections of post mortem specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) and deep-learning algorithms applied to <italic>in vivo</italic> MRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>) to contextualize variations in functional connectivity profiles within this region. Indeed, a significant advantage of our framework lies in the ease with which it may be applied to new datasets. For instance, our method overcomes the time-consuming nature and high level of expertise required for precise manual subnuclear segmentations. Furthermore, this approach circumvents the need for large datasets required to validate deep learning-based applications, a particular concern in the case of histological data which are often limited to few or even single specimens. However, it is important to note that both datasets analyzed in this work are limited by their small sample size (n=1 for BigBrain and n=10 for MICA-PNI). We speculate that the signal variations captured by U2 may be sensitive to artifacts or subject-specific sources of variance, potentially explaining why it was not consistent between subjects and modalities. Moving forward, this hypothesis could be assessed in future work via the analysis of larger histological and neuroimaging datasets to better track recurring features picked up by U2 or the association of these unique topographies with behavioral markers. Overall, the proposed framework lays the groundwork for future investigations of subcortical structure-function coupling by anchoring connectivity and task-related activations within measurements of regional microarchitecture.</p>
<p>The present works described a continuous coordinate space of amygdala subregional microstructure. However, this region has been previously described as consisting of three main subdivisions: LB, CM, and SF, each composed of smaller subnuclei with distinct connectivity patterns and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). These subregions are largely conserved between humans and monkeys, reflecting their evolutionary relationship. However, there are still some considerable differences such as in the SF subregion, where its description in monkeys additionally contains the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). Although qualitative histological accounts have indeed delineated multiple subunits within these general regions, the present work focuses on three subdivisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). To account for resolution disparities when translating our findings to in vivo MRI data. The LB subdivision includes the basomedial nucleus (Bm), basolateral nucleus (BL), lateral nucleus (LA) and paralaminar nucleus (PL). Moving medially, the CM subdivision includes the central (Ce) and medial nuclei (Me), while the SF subdivision includes the anterior amygdaloid area (AAA), amygdalohippocampal transition area (AHi), amygdalopiriform transition area (APir), and ventral cortical nucleus (VCo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). However, disagreement on the precise attribution of nuclei to broader subdivisions motivated our investigations of probabilistic subunits of the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The development of new tools to segment amygdala subnuclei <italic>in vivo</italic> opens opportunities for future work to further validate our framework at the precision of these nuclei within subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). We selected UMAP for its potential to recover this nuclear architecture via the identification of discrete clusters of microstructural similarity within the amygdala. While these dimensions partially align with traditional concepts of arealization, they also provide a complementary, graded representation of amygdala microarchitecture. Although our framework leverages ultra-high resolution histological and myelin-sensitive MRI, the inherent spatial autocorrelation of feature intensities in these modalities may have emphasized the continuous signal variations we identify within the amygdala and hindered the discovery of discrete boundaries between known subdivisions. We address this limitation by benchmarking U1 and U2 distributions against validated probabilistic maps of major amygdala subdivisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), enabling us to recover the established biological validity of its nuclear organization. Furthermore, this approach allowed us to derive discrete clusters of maximal microstructural differentiation within the amygdala; these clusters served as seed regions for microstructurally-grounded and individualized investigations of the functional connectome embedding of amygdala subregions. Following an inferior-superior and medial-lateral axis of differentiation in both <italic>post mortem</italic> histology and myelin-sensitive <italic>in vivo</italic> MRI, this bipartite division is in line with previous work investigating the structural connectivity of the amygdala using diffusion-weighted imaging and probabilistic tractography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>) as well as functional connectivity from rsfMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). Indeed, both modalities highlight the existence of two distinct clusters segregating amygdala connectivity to temporopolar and orbitofrontal cortices. These findings mirror macroscale associations seen in the neocortex between microstructure and connectivity, which emphasize close correspondence between the strength of interareal connectivity and microstructural similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). In the case of the amygdala, our framework could thus recover these distinct anatomical pathways from a data-driven, texture-based analysis of microarchitectural information alone, supporting the potential of such contrasts to provide insights into the large-scale network embeddings of subcortical systems.</p>
<p>In line with this suggested association between amygdala microarchitecture and functional connectivity, we conclude our analyses by leveraging subject-specific representations of amygdala microstructure to map large-scale variations in its functional connectivity to the neocortex. We isolated and contrasted the highest and lowest 25% of U1 values for each participant to define an individualized bipartite parcellation of the amygdala. Qualitatively, we found that the subregion defined by the highest 25% of U1 values mainly overlapped with what is commonly defined as the superficial and centromedial subregions, whereas the lowest 25% U1 values subregion overlapped mostly with the laterobasal division. Interestingly, CM and SF characterized subregions showed significantly stronger functional connectivity to prefrontal structures. This finding aligns with previous work demonstrating unique affiliations between the CM subregion and anterior cingulate and frontal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), as well as between the SF subregion and the orbitofrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Although these findings are promising, we also observe considerable overlap between functional connectivity networks of both our defined subregions. Indeed, the amygdala is a relatively small structure, leading to likely interconnectivity between its subregions and locally high signal autocorrelation. Functional connectivity and microstructure in the amygdala are certainly related, however previous work suggests they do not perfectly overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). In addition, this region is affected by relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as is observed in broader temporobasal and mesiotemporal territories. Decoding of subregional functional connectivity results indicated possible dissociations in cognitive (<italic>e.g.,</italic> memory) and affective <italic>(e.g.,</italic> emotional face processing) functions of the amygdala, echoing previous accounts of this region’s functional specialization and subregional segregation of associative processing of emotional stimuli. Notably, these findings link the functional connectivity profile of a subregion partially co-localizing with LB to emotional face processing. The LB subregion has been previously linked to associative processing related to the integration of sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), which is consistent with the association with visual emotional information processing identified in the present work. For the right amygdala, dissociation in functional connectivity patterns were more subtle, leading to overall similar functional decoding across the two clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e1427">Figure S2</xref>). Overall, our findings suggest that this microstructurally-grounded delineation of U1 subregions could capture dissociations in their respective functional associations and potentially with fear-related processes. These results echo previous chemoarchitectural descriptions of the amygdala involving the 5-HT receptor, which has been closely associated with fear responses in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). Indeed, this receptor is expressed in lower densities in the CM region, overlapping with our U1 subregions that show lower connectivity to regions involved in fear-related responses. The present work thus offers an important step towards a more integrated account of the amygdala’s microstructural composition and functional organization.</p>
<p>By harnessing an openly available arsenal of tools and methods from histology, radiomics, and neuroinformatics, we define a comprehensive framework enhancing our understanding of individual differences in amygdala organization. Our findings contribute to a growing body of research emphasizing the importance of integrating structural and functional data to elucidate the complex roles of the amygdala in both health and disease. This multimodal, multiscale, and subject-specific approach not only advances our knowledge of the amygdala’s microstructural and functional intricacies but also offers a valuable resource for future studies exploring subcortical structures and their implications in various neurological and psychiatric conditions. This integrated perspective is essential for developing more precise and personalized interventions for disorders associated with amygdala dysfunction.</p>

<title>Histological feature extraction</title>
<p>We built a histological feature bank of amygdala cell-body-staining using methods from the field of radiomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). Our approach for feature selection was also inspired by quantitative cytoarchitectural analyses developed in foundational neuroanatomical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), involving the parameterization of intensity profiles with four central moments to characterize regional cytoarchitecture across the neocortex. In the present work, we computed these same four central moments (<italic>i.e.,</italic> mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) of cell body staining intensities in the amygdala to characterize intensity differences across this region. We used pyRadiomics v3.0.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) to compute voxel-based maps for each of the selected first-order features, varying the size of 3D-feature extraction to a voxel neighbourhood of 500μm sections, silver-stained for cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), and digitized. As such, imagem to 2100μm sections, silver-stained for cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), and digitized.

Outlier values (&gt; 1 standard deviation from the mean intensity value) were excluded from moment calculations at each kernel size.

Automated, individual-specific segmentations of the amygdala were obtained with VolBrain, and were manually inspected and corrected prior to image processing. In a similar fashion to the histological data, a feature bank was rendered from the same central moments, although kernel sizes varied from size 1-5, rather than 2-10 in order to take into account the difference in image resolution between the two datasets. Thus, voxel neighborhoods ranged from 1500μm sections, silver-stained for cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), and digitized.

The new feature bank was again submitted to UMAP for dimensionality reduction, independently for all 10 participants. This procedure generated a 2-dimensional feature space unique to each participant recapitulating the organization of the amygdala. We then plotted the values generated in our UMAP space onto their original coordinate points inside the amygdala in the original qT1 space of each subject for further visualization and analysis.</p>
<p>To finally compare subject-specific <italic>in vivo</italic> MRI findings to our previously defined histological components, we first co-registered each subject’s qT1 scan to the ICBM152 template and applied the resulting transform to each participant’s U1 map. We applied existing transformations to bring the histological-space U1 to the same template space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). This allowed us to contrast the UMAP components of all 10 subjects and BigBrain, along <italic>x, y,</italic> and <italic>z</italic> coordinate axes.</p>
<p><italic>c) rsfMRI image processing and analysis.</italic> Processing employed micapipe v.0.2.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>), which combines functions from AFNI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>), FastSurfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>), workbench command (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>), and FSL</p>
<p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>). Images were reoriented, as well as motion and distortion corrected. Motion correction was performed by registering each timepoint volume to the mean volume across timepoints, while distortion correction utilized main phase and reverse phase encoded field maps. Leveraging our multi-echo acquisition protocol, nuisance variable signals were removed with tedana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>). Volumetric timeseries were averaged for registration to native FastSurfer space using boundary-based registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>), and mapped to individual surfaces using trilinear interpolation. Cortical timeseries were mapped to the hemisphere-matched fs-LR template using workbench tools then spatially smoothed with a 10mm Gaussian kernel. Surface-and template-mapped cortical timeseries were corrected for motion spikes using linear regression of motion outliers provided by FSL. Functional and anatomical spaces were co-registered using label-based affine registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>) and the SyN algorithm available in ANTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>).</p>

<title>Functional network mapping of amygdala microstructural subregions</title>
<p>We averaged the rsfMRI timeseries within amygdala subregions defined by the highest and lowest 25% of values in each participant’s own qT1-derived U1 component. Functional connectivity of each amygdala subregion to the rest of the cortex was determined using Pearson correlation between the timeseries of each amygdala subregion and each cortical vertex. Resulting correlation coefficients underwent Fisher R-to-Z transformation to increase the normality of the distribution of functional connectivity values.</p>
<p>A mixed effects model implemented with the BrainStat toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>) assessed differences between the cortical connectivity profiles of each U1 subregion, while considering age and sex and fixed effects and subject identity as a random effect. We corrected findings for family-wise errors (FWE) using random field theory (p<sub>FWE</sub> &lt; 0.05; cluster-defining threshold (CDT) = 0.01). We further contextualized differences in each connectivity map using decoding functions from NeuroSynth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>) that are made available via BrainStat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>), by contrasting the overall connectivity profile of the amygdala to those of each of its microstructurally-defined subregions. First, we divided subregional amygdala-cortical connectivity profiles into seven established functional network communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) and contrasted their average connectivity strength across each network. Meta-analytic functional decoding of the connectivity patterns of both amygdala subregions and the whole amygdala also highlighted different cognitive affiliations of each seed. Spatial correlations between the amygdala’s cortical connectivity profile and spatial activation maps associated with each term allowed us to retain ten terms associated with different cognitive domains. We then compared the association between the activation patterns associated with each of the retained terms and the cortical connectivity profiles of each amygdala U1 subregion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study bridges a micro- to macroscale understanding of the organization of the amygdala. First, using a data-driven approach, the authors identify structural clusters in the human amygdala from high-resolution post-mortem histological data. Next, multimodal imaging data to identify structural subunits of the amygdala and the functional networks in which they are involved. This approach is exciting because it permits the identification of both structural amygdalar subunits, and their functional implications, in individual subjects. There are, however, some differences in the macro and microscale levels of organization that should be addressed.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of data-driven parcellation on a structure that is important for human emotion and cognition, and the combination of this with high-resolution individual imaging-based parcellation, is a powerful and exciting approach, addressing both the need for a template-level understanding of organization as well as a parcellation that is valid for individuals. The functional decoding of rsfMRI permits valuable insight into the functional role of structural subunits. Overall, the combination of micro to macro, structure, and function, and general organization to individual relevance is an impressive holistic approach to brain mapping.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>The paper by Auer et. makes several contributions: (1) The study developed a novel approach to map the microstructural organization of the human amygdala by applying radiomics and dimensionality reduction techniques to high-resolution histological data from the BigBrain dataset. (2) The method identified two main axes of microstructural variation in the amygdala, which could be translated to in vivo 7 Tesla MRI data in individual subjects.

<p>We thank the Reviewer for the positive comments and insightful evaluation of the work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.1) Although these are meritorious contributions there are some concerns that I will summarize below. The paper makes little-to-no contact with the monkey literature regarding the anatomy of amygdala subregions, their functionality, and their patterns of anatomical connectivity. This is surprising because such literature on non-human primates is a very important starting point for understanding the human amygdala. I recommend taking a careful look at the work by Helen Barbas, among others. There are too many papers to cite but a notable example is: Ghashghaei, H. T., Hilgetag, C. C., &amp; Barbas, H. (2007). Sequence of information processing for emotions based on the anatomic dialogue between prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Neuroimage, 34(3), 905-923. The work of Amaral is also highly relevant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, we included the important work of Amaral et al. as well as Ghashghaei et al. highlighting its contribution to mapping the intricate anatomy and function of the amygdala in non-human primates. We comment on this in the Introduction of the manuscript. Please see P.3.</p>
<p>“Early research on the amygdala in non-human primates has been instrumental in understanding its intricate structure, function and patterns of anatomical connectivity (Amaral and Price 1984; Ghashghaei et al. 2007). This foundational study highlights the amygdala’s different subdivisions, most notably the basomedial nucleus (BM), basolateral nucleus (BL), and central nucleus (Ce) (Amaral et al. 1992). Furthermore, this work describes a dense network between these subdivisions and the prefrontal cortex, most strongly found in the posterior orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate areas.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.2) Furthermore, the authors subscribe to a model with LB, CM, and SF sectors. How does the SF sector relate to monkey anatomy?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The overall organization of these subregions is largely conserved between humans and monkeys, reflecting their evolutionary relationship. While the basic subregional organization is conserved, there are still some important structural and functional differences between human and monkey amygdalae. For example, the SF subregion, often described in humans includes parts of the cortical nuclei (VCo), anterior amygdaloid area (AAA), amygdalohippocampal transition area (AHi), amygdalopiriform transition area (APir) as well as the lateral olfactory tract (LOT). This remark was added in the Discussion, on P.12:</p>
<p>“However, this region has been previously described as consisting of three main subdivisions: LB, CM, and SF, each composed of smaller subnuclei with distinct connectivity patterns and functions (Amunts et al. 2005; Ball et al. 2007; Bzdok et al. 2013; de Olmos and Heimer 1999). These subregions are largely conserved between humans and monkeys, reflecting their evolutionary relationship. However, there are still some considerable differences such as in the SF subregion, where its description in monkeys additionally contains the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) (De Olmos 1990).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.3) The authors use meta-analytical decoding via NeuroSynth. If the authors like those results of course they should keep them but the quality of coordinate reporting in the literature is insufficient to conclude much in the context of amygdala subregion function in my opinion. I believe the results reported are at most &quot;somewhat suggestive&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that use of data from NeuroSynth poses unique challenges, particularly relating to investigations of a small structure such as the amygdala. However, to clarify, these analyses decode the cortex-wide functional connectivity patterns of amygdala subregions and not activations within subregions defined by our microanatomical analyses. Additionally, comments from Reviewer 2 suggested expanding the NeuroSynth decoding to the contralateral hemisphere. As such, we decided to keep this analysis in the main manuscript but rephrase the interpretation of these findings in the Discussion to emphasize their exploratory nature on P.13:</p>
<p>“Functional decoding of subregional functional connectivity patterns indicated possible dissociations in cognitive (e.g., memory) and affective (e.g., emotional face processing) functions of the amygdala, echoing previous accounts of this region’s involvement in associative processing of emotional stimuli. Notably, these findings link the functional connectivity profile of a subregion partially co-localizing with LB to emotional face processing. The LB subregion has been previously linked to associative processing related to the integration of sensory information (Bzdok et al. 2013; Ghods-Sharifi, St Onge, and Floresco 2009; Pessoa 2010; Winstanley et al. 2004; Boyer 2008), which is consistent with the association with visual emotional information processing identified in the present work.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.4) Another significant concern has to do with the results in Figure 3. The red and yellow clusters identified are quite distinct but the differences in functional connectivity are very modest. Figure 3C reveals very similar functional connectivity with the networks investigated. This is very surprising, and the authors should include a careful comparison with related findings in the literature. Overall, there is limited comparison between the observed results and those obtained via other methods. On a more pessimistic note, the results of Figure 3 seem to question the validity of the general approach.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that we can indeed observe considerable overlap between functional connectivity profiles of amygdala subregions. The amygdala is a relatively small structure, leading to likely interconnectivity between its subregions (Bzdok et al. 2013) in addition to considering BOLD signal autocorrelation within this region. In addition, functional signals in the amygdala are affected by relatively lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a limitation extending to temporobasal and mesiotemporal regions. Despite these challenges, our technique remained sensitive to detect subtle differences in connectivity patterns even in this small group of subjects in this restricted subcortical territory.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we further highlight these caveats in the Discussion (P.13):</p>
<p>“Although these findings are promising, we also observe considerable overlap between functional connectivity networks of both our defined subregions. Indeed, the amygdala is a relatively small structure, leading to likely interconnectivity between its subregions and locally high signal autocorrelation. Functional connectivity and microstructure in the amygdala are certainly related, however previous work suggests they do not perfectly overlap (Bzdok et al. 2013). In addition, this region is affected by relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as is observed in broader temporobasal and mesiotemporal territories.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.5) Some statements in the Discussion feel unwarranted. For example, &quot;significant dissociation in functional connectivity to prefrontal structures that support self-referential, reward-related, and socio-affective processes.&quot; This feels way beyond what can be stated based on the analyses performed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this interpretation may reach beyond the analyses performed and reported findings. We have adjusted this portion of the text accordingly in our Discussion on functional connectivity findings (P.13):</p>
<p>“Qualitatively, we found that the subregion defined by the highest 25% of U1 values mainly overlapped with what is commonly defined as the superficial and centromedial subregions, whereas the lowest 25% U1 values subregion overlapped mostly with the laterobasal division. Interestingly, CM and SF characterized subregions showed significantly stronger functional connectivity to prefrontal structures. This finding aligns with previous work demonstrating unique affiliations between the CM subregion and anterior cingulate and frontal cortices (Kapp, Supple, and Whalen 1994; Barbour et al. 2010), as well as between the SF subregion and the orbitofrontal cortex (Goossens et al. 2009; Caparelli et al. 2017; Pessoa 2010; Klein-Flügge et al. 2022).”</p>
<p>Additionally, we have also edited our Discussion to ensure that our interpretations are grounded in the analyses conducted, while framing the findings as potential avenues for future work. Please see P.13.</p>
<p>“Functional decoding of functional connectivity results indicated possible dissociations in cognitive (e.g., memory) and affective (e.g., emotional face processing) functions of the amygdala, echoing previous accounts of this region’s functional specialization and subregional segregation of associative processing of emotional stimuli.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p>(1.6) Figure 1 has panels A-I but only A-D are discussed in the caption. The orientation of the slices is not indicated which makes it very hard to follow for most readers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The subpanels are now referred to in the revised Results. We also added a notation on the orientation of the slices and described them accordingly in our Figure 1 description. (P.5-6):</p>
<p>“(A) The amygdala was segmented from the 100-micron resolution BigBrain dataset using an existing subcortical parcellation (Xiao et al. 2019). Slice orientation is consistent across all panels in this figure.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.7) Some figure references in the text seem to be incorrect; please check that the text refers to the correct figure number and panel.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing this out. We thoroughly revised the correspondence between figure panel labels and their referencing in the text.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(2.1) UMAP 1, as calculated from the histological data, appears to correlate well across individuals, and decently with the MRI data, although the medial-lateral coordinate axis is an outlier. UMAP 2, on the other hand, does not appear to correlate well with imaging data or across individuals. This does pose a problem with the claim that this paper bridges micro- and macroscale parcellations. One might certainly expect, however, that different levels of organization might parcellate differently, but the authors should address this in the discussion and offer ways forward.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Data driven methods hold several advantages for the quantitative extraction of signal from the underlying data in an observer-independent manner. However, these techniques are also sensitive to potential idiosyncrasies in the data. In the present work, our main analyses rely on the processing of a histological dataset (BigBrain) providing a unique opportunity for high-resolution analysis of amygdala histology and <italic>in vivo</italic> translation of findings leveraging ultra-high field MRI (n=10). However, both datasets are limited by their small sample size (n=1 for BigBrain and n=10 for MICA-PNI). As a result, we speculate that signal variations captured by U2 may be sensitive to artifacts or subject-specific sources of variance. Moving forward, this hypothesis could be assessed in future work via the analysis of larger histological and neuroimaging datasets to better track recurring features picked up by U2 or the association of these unique topographies with behavioural markers.</p>
<p>As suggested, we included a section in our Discussion highlighting this shortcoming and the importance for larger datasets moving forward. Please see P.11-12.</p>

<p>(2.1) It would be interesting to see functional decoding for the right amygdala. This could be included in the supplementary material. A discussion of differences in the results in the two hemispheres could be illuminating.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In accordance with the Reviewer’s suggestion, we added Supplementary figure S2 exploring the decoding of connectivity profiles of the right amygdala stratified by its cytoarchitectural embedding with UMAP.</p>
<p>Upon analysis, dissociation in functional connectivity patterns over the right amygdala were less evident, leading to overall similar functional decoding across the two clusters. We refer to this Supplementary Figure in our Discussion on P.13.</p>
<p>“For the right amygdala, dissociation in functional connectivity patterns were more subtle, leading to overall similar functional decoding across the two clusters. (Figure S2)”</p>

<p>(2.3) The authors acknowledge that this mapping matches some but not all subunits that have been previously described in the amygdala. It would be helpful to neuroanatomists if the authors could discuss these differences in more detail in the discussion, to identify how this mapping differs and what the implications of this are.</p>

<p>In our work, we focus on mapping the three well characterized amygdala subregions, specifically the superficial (SF), centromedial (CM) and laterobasal (LB) subdivisions. Qualitative histological accounts have indeed delineated multiple subunits within these subregions which we now describe in the revised manuscript. Due to the lower resolution of in vivo MRI data used in this work relative to post mortem histology, we focused our analyses on larger subregions that could be more reliably mapped to native quantitative T1 spaces of each participant. We now overview this issue in the Discussion. Please see P.12.</p>
<p>“Although qualitative histological accounts have indeed delineated multiple subunits within these general regions, the present work focuses on three subdivisions (Amunts et al. 2005) to account for resolution disparities when translating our findings to in vivo MRI data. The LB subdivision includes the basomedial nucleus (Bm), basolateral nucleus (BL), lateral nucleus (LA) and paralaminar nucleus (PL). Moving medially, the CM subdivision includes the central (Ce) and medial nuclei (Me), while the SF subdivision includes the anterior amygdaloid area (AAA), amygdalohippocampal transition area (AHi), amygdalopiriform transition area (APir), and ventral cortical nucleus (VCo) (Heimer et al. 1999). However, disagreement on the precise attribution of nuclei to broader subdivisions motivated our investigations of probabilistic subunits of the amygdala (Kedo et al. 2018). The development of new tools to segment amygdala subnuclei in vivo offers opens opportunities for future work to further validate our framework at the precision of these nuclei within subjects (Saygin et al. 2017).”</p>

<p>(2.4) The acronym UMAP is not explained. A brief explanation and description would be useful to the reader.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We moved the expanded acronym from the <italic>Methods</italic> to the first instance of the term UMAP in our paper, found in the <italic>Introduction</italic>. As suggested, we also added a sentence describing the technique. Please see P.6.</p>
<p>“We then applied Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that preserves the local and global structure of high-dimensional data by projecting it into a lower-dimensional space (Becht et al. 2018), to the resulting 20-feature matrix to derive a 2-dimensional embedding of amygdala cytoarchitecture (Figure 1D).”</p>
