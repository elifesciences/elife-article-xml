<abstract>
<p>Cell surface receptors transmit information across the plasma membrane to connect the extracellular environment to intracellular function. While the structures and interactions of the receptors have been long established as mediators of signaling, increasing evidence suggests that the membrane itself plays an active role in both suppressing and enhancing signaling. Identifying and investigating this contribution has been challenging owing to the complex composition of the plasma membrane. We used cell-free expression to incorporate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) into nanodiscs with defined membrane compositions and characterized ligand-induced transmembrane conformational response and interactions with signaling partners using single-molecule and ensemble fluorescence assays. We observed that both the transmembrane conformational response and interactions with signaling partners are strongly lipid dependent, consistent with previous observations of electrostatic interactions between the anionic lipids and conserved basic residues near the membrane adjacent domain. Strikingly, the active conformation of EGFR and high levels of ATP binding were maintained regardless of ligand binding with high anionic lipid content typical of cancer cells, where EGFR signaling is enhanced. In contrast, the conformational response was suppressed in the presence of cholesterol, providing a mechanism for its known inhibitory effect on EGFR signaling. Our findings introduce a model of EGFR signaling in which the lipid environment can override ligand control, providing a biophysical basis for both robust EGFR activity in healthy cells and aberrant activity under pathological conditions. The membrane-adjacent protein sequence, likely responsible for the lipid dependence, is conserved among receptor tyrosine kinases, suggesting that active regulation by the plasma membrane may be a general feature of this important class of proteins.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>Our study introduces a biophysical model for EGFR regulation in which membrane composition directly modulates receptor conformation and signaling output. Our findings demonstrate that high anionic lipids promote the actice state of EGFR even in the absence of ligand, mimicking the hyperactivation seen in cancer cells, whereas cholesterol stabilizes the inactive conformation, explaining its inhibitory role in signaling. In this revised version, we have strengthened the justification for these conclusions with additional analyses, reorganized figures, and clarifications throughout the text.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the canonical receptor tyrosine kinase, maintains basic cellular processes in mammals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> EGFR phosphorylates adaptor proteins that trig-ger an array of signaling cascades responsible for cell proliferation and differentiation or, upon aberrant activity, leads to disorders such as cancer and fibrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> Ligand binding to the extracellular region of the receptor initiates a signaling response that propagates across the plasma membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> The composition of the membrane changes from healthy to disease states in a manner known to influence EGFR activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> A basic understanding of the ligand-induced structural reorganization of the receptor has been established,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> yet the contribution of the plasma membrane in regulating this reorganization remains underinvestigated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The chemical composition of the human plasma membrane is complex. The membrane composition is well maintained in healthy cells, yet becomes dysregulated in a diseased state, where EGFR signaling is often aberrant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> In healthy cells, the plasma membrane is an asymmetric lipid bilayer containing 30% anionic lipids in the inner leaflet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> These anionic lipids modulate the surface charge of the membrane, affecting protein localization and cluster-ing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> Anionic lipids also act as signaling molecules and regulate several fundamental cellular processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> The anionic lipid content increases in cancer cells, where EGFR signaling is typically increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> Similarly, dysregulation of lipid metabolism and distribution coupled with hyperactivation of EGFR are major hallmarks of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, dementia, and sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> Cholesterol is the major sterol component of mammalian cell membranes, averaging 20% – 25% of the lipid bilayer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> Cholesterol maintains the structural integrity and regulates the fluidity of the bilayer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> Increasingly, cholesterol has been implicated in the modulation of signal transduction and cellular trafficking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> In the case of EGFR, cholesterol has been shown to suppress ligand-induced signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> While a relationship between the plasma membrane and the signaling cascade has been established, how individual components, particularly anionic lipids and cholesterol, influence the protein-level transmembrane conformational response of EGFR remains unclear.</p>
<p>Several studies have investigated the role of anionic lipids and cholesterol for individual domains of EGFR. The plasma membrane was found to abrogate the catalytic activity of the intracellular kinase domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and reduce the ligand binding affinity for an unliganded protomer in a dimer of the extracellular domain, leading to a negative cooperativity model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> Cholesterol has also been shown to impede phosphorylation for EGFR in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> In transmembrane-juxtamembrane constructs of EGFR, electrostatic interactions between the positively charged juxtamembrane region and the negatively charged anionic lipids have been identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> While these studies have provided some understanding of the impact of the plasma membrane on in-dividual domains, transmembrane conformational signaling requires propagation through these domains to cross the membrane. Piecewise studies inherently cannot probe how such propagation is regulated by membrane composition.</p>
<p>Here, we report the observation of a transmembrane conformational response of EGFR in membranes with different compositions using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), ensemble fluorescence assays, and molecular dynamics simulations. These measurements showed a robust ligand-induced conformational response in membranes that mimic healthy cells, consistent with previous observations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> However, in membranes enriched with anionic lipids and/or cholesterol, we found a suppression of this response—revealing a previously unrecognized effect of these lipid components. These results indicate that membrane composition actively modulates EGFR function through both its charge and mechanics, playing a key role in robust signaling. Therapeutic development targeting EGFR may, therefore, require the context of the plasma membrane for optimal efficacy.</p>

<title>EGFR in membrane nanodiscs</title>
<p>EGFR-containing discoidal membranes, termed ‘nanodiscs’, were produced by in vitro co-expression of EGFR and an apolipoprotein in the presence of lipid vesicles, leading to self-assembly of the structures shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> Nanodiscs were produced with different ratios of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (POPS) and cholesterol and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

<title>Role of anionic lipids in EGFR kinase activity</title>
<p>The enzymatic activity of the catalytic site in the EGFR kinase domain can be regulated through its accessibility to ATP and other substrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> To investigate how the membrane composition impacts accessibility, we measured ATP binding levels for EGFR in membranes with different anionic lipid content. 1 µM of fluorescently-labeled ATP analogue, atto647N-1 ATP, which binds irreversibly to the active site, was added to samples of EGFR nanodiscs with 0%, 15%, 30% or 60% anionic lipid content in the absence or presence of EGF. The fluorescence intensity from the bound ATP analogue and the fluorescence intensity from snap surface 488, which binds stoichiometrically to the snap tag at the EGFR C-terminus, were measured for each sample from a fluorescent gel image.

<p>How the level of ATP binding changed with anionic lipid content depended on the presence of EGF. In the absence of EGF, ATP binding was high in neutral bilayers (0% POPS) and in highly anionic (60% POPS) bilayers, but low at physiologically relevant POPS levels (15% and 30% POPS). This suggests that nucleotide binding is suppressed in the physiological regime, likely to ensure EGF can promote catalytic activity. In the presence of EGF, ATP binding overall increased with anionic lipid content with the highest levels observed in 60% POPS bilayers. In the neutral bilayer, ligand seemed to suppress ATP binding, indicating anionic lipids are required for the regulated activation of EGFR. Similar, and relatively high, levels of ATP binding were observed in the physiological regime, consistent with the model of EGF-promoted activity. The high ATP binding at 60% POPS —even without EGF —is consistent with the enhanced levels of catalytic activity characteristic of cancer cells, which show high anionic lipid content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> In previous work, experiments and molecular dynamics simulations identified electrostatic interactions between anionic lipids and the kinase domain of EGFR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> These results highlight that membrane composition, through electrostatic interactions with anionic lipids, can regulate accessibility of the ATP binding site, likely as a mechanism to modulate EGFR catalytic activity.</p>
<p>The accessibility of the ATP binding site was also examined through additional molecular dynamics simulations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c-f</xref>). Simulations were carried out on EGFR in a neutral and par-tially (30%) anionic lipid bilayer in the absence and presence of EGF. For each condition, the number of contacts between the ATP binding site and the membrane was determined (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c, d</xref>). The number of contacts was defined as the number of coarse-grained atom pairs between the lipid membrane and the ATP binding site that have a smaller than 16 Å distance. In the absence of EGF, increasing the anionic lipid content from 0% POPS to 30% POPS increased the number of ATP-lipid contacts from 58.6 <italic>±</italic> 0.7 to 74.4 <italic>±</italic> 1.2, indicating reduced accessibility, consistent with the experimental results and suggesting anionic lipids are required for ligand-induced EGFR activity. In the presence of EGF, increasing the anionic lipid content decreased the number of contacts from 71.8 <italic>±</italic> 1.8 to 67.8 <italic>±</italic> 2.4, indicating increased accessibility, again in line with the experimental findings. Because detection of EGFR relies on labeling at the C-terminus and ATP binding requires an intact kinase domain, the ATP-binding assay is for receptors that are properly folded and competent for nucleotide binding. The consistency between experimental results and MD simulations suggests that the observed lipid-dependent changes are more likely due to modulation of functional EGFR than to artifacts from misfolding.</p>

<title>Anionic lipid dependence of kinase domain position</title>
<p>To experimentally investigate the intracellular conformations responsible for the lipid-dependent ATP accessibility, we performed smFRET measurements that probed the relative organization of the kinase domain and the C-terminal tail. EGFR was embedded in 0% and 30% POPS nanodiscs with snap surface 594 on the C-terminal tail as the donor and a fluorescently labeled ATP analog (atto647N) as the acceptor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). The affinity tag on the belting protein was used for immobilization of EGFR nanodiscs at dilute concentration on a coverslip so the donor fluorescence could be recorded for individual constructs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g-i</xref>, <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> These measurements monitored the donor fluorescence lifetime, which decreases with donor-acceptor distance or as energy transfer to the acceptor increases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> The donor lifetime distributions of the EGFR samples in the absence and presence of EGF (1 µM) are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2j, k</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The corresponding donor-acceptor distances were calculated using the lifetime of the donor only sample as a reference (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). In the neutral bilayer (0% POPS), the distributions in the absence of EGF peaks at 8.1 nm (95% CI: 8.0–8.2 nm) and in the presence of EGF peaks at 8.6 nm (95% CI: 8.5–8.7 nm) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In the physiological regime of 30% POPS nanodiscs, the peak of the donor lifetime distribution shifts from 9.1 nm (95% CI: 8.9–9.2 nm) in the absence of EGF 11.6 nm (95% CI: 11.1–12.6 nm) in the presence of EGF (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), which is a larger EGF-induced conformational response than in neutral lipids.

<title>Anionic lipid dependence of transmembrane conformational response</title>
<p>To investigate the role of anionic lipids in EGFR transmembrane conformational response, the smFRET distributions were compared for nanodisc samples with increasing anionic lipid content (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). In the physiological regime for anionic lipid content (15%–30% POPS; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), the smFRET distributions exhibited a EGF-induced conformational response. In the absence of EGF, a conformational equilibrium was observed where the amplitude of the open conformation was similar at 69% and 74% for 15% and 30% POPS, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). In the presence of EGF, the conformational equilibrium was dominated by the open conformation with an amplitude of 91% and 96% for 15% and 30% POPS, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). For both lipid compositions, this corresponds to an increase in amplitude of the open conformation by ∼25%. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g, h</xref>). These results suggest that EGF-induced transmembrane conformational response is robust around the physiological anionic lipid content (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g, h</xref>, <xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 6</xref>).</p>
<p>In the neutral bilayer (0% POPS; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), the distributions also exhibited a EGF-induced conformational response, but the response was the reverse of that in the physiological regime. As described in the previous section, in the absence of EGF, the conformational equilibrium was dominated by the open conformation at 87% whereas in the presence of EGF an equilibrium was observed where the amplitude of the open conformation was 60% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). The reversal of the conformational response in the neutral bilayer strongly suggests that electrostatic interactions are playing an important role in transmembrane conformational response, consistent with previous smFRET experiments on EGFR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the highly anionic bilayer (60% POPS; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), the EGF-induced conformational response nearly disappeared. In the absence of EGF, the conformational equilibrium was dominated by the open conformation &gt; 90%, which, in the presence of EGF, increased slightly by ∼5%(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, g, h</xref>, <xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). The dominance of the open conformation in both conditions is similar to the EGF-bound conditions in the physiological regime, indicating that the receptor is held in the active conformation by the anionic bilayer. The amplitude of the open conformation correlated with the ATP binding site accessibility from the experimental and computational studies (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>), consistent with a picture in which the open conformation enables access by all signaling partners. High levels of EGFR signaling are often present in cancer cells, where anionic lipid content is also high.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> Thus, the open conformation in the anionic bilayer may be constituitively active - and thereby the biophysical origin of the high signaling that drives cancer cell growth. Similar effects may be playing a role in the observed overactivation of EGFR in neurodegenerative disorders. Anionic lipids are increasingly recognized as biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases, with EGFR emerg-ing as a dual molecular target for both cancer and Alzheimer’s disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> Specifically, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which are commonly used for cancer treatment, show promise in mitigating Alzheimer’s disease by targeting this overactive EGFR signaling pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup></p>

<title>Electrostatic interactions in transmembrane conformational response</title>
<p>The molecular dynamics simulations were further examined to investigate how anionic lipids influence EGFR transmembrane coupling. EGF binding was found to switch the extracellular domain from prostrate on the membrane to upright,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> which, in turn, switched the transmembrane domain from a tilted to vertical orientation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> The orientation switch caused the juxtamembrane domain to move from embedded inside to extended outside the lipid bilayer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> The simulations showed the position of the juxtamembrane domain influenced two key interactions in the intracellular domain: (1) attraction between the basic residues in the juxtamembrane/kinase domains and the anionic lipids; and (2) repulsion between the acidic residues on the N-terminal portion of the C-terminal tail and the anionic lipids (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The competition between these interactions dictates the overall conformation of the intracellular domain.</p>
<p>In the absence of EGF, the more embedded juxtamembrane domain meant that the attraction between the juxtamembrane/kinase domains and the lipids dominated, inducing a more closed conformation. The dominant closed conformation was consistent with the high compact state percentage observed in the smFRET distributions for 15% POPS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Within this picture of competing electrostatic interactions, the repulsion between the C-terminal tail and the anionic lipids is expected to dominate at high anionic lipid content likely because the number of negative charges on the C-terminus is greater than the number of positive charges on either the juxtamembrane or kinase domains. Consistently, a higher open state percentage was observed for 30% and 60% POPS. In the presence of EGF, the more extended juxtamembrane domain separated the juxtamembrane/kinase domains and the lipids, decreasing their attraction and leading to a more open conformation again consistent with the higher open state percentage for all partially anionic bilayers.</p>
<p>Oncogenic mutations such as K745E and K757E introduce negative charges into the kinase domain, which likely decrease the attraction between the kinase domain and the anionic lipids to allow the repulsion and thus the open conformation to dominate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> As the open conformation also dominates in the presence of EGF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, g</xref>), these mutations likely increase signaling levels, consistent with their role in cancer.

<title>Mechanism of cholesterol inhibition of EGFR transmembrane conformational response</title>
<p>Cholesterol is known to impact both the thickness and the fluidity of lipid bilayers. Previ-ous computational and experimental results showed high cholesterol can increase the thickness of a phospholipid bilayer, defined as the separation between lipid phosphate head groups, by ∼0.3 – 0.5 nm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> Evidence suggests that transmembrane helices tilt to minimize hydrophobic mismatch,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> changing the conformation of embedded membrane proteins. The incorporation of cholesterol into the lipid bilayer has also been shown to alter its fluidity. The altered fluidity was also found to modulate the mobility and oligomerization of ErbB2, a member of the EGFR family.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> Either factor —bilayer thickness or fluidity —could, therefore, give rise to the suppressed conformational response observed in the smFRET measurements.</p>
<p>To identify the mechanistic origin of the cholesterol-induced suppression of the conformational response, smFRET experiments were performed on EGFR-containing nanodiscs with two different lipids, DMPC and POPC (<xref rid="figs17" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 17</xref>, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 3</xref>-<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). DMPC is a fully saturated version of POPC that forms a thinner bilayer (3.7 nm for DMPC and 3.9 nm for POPC,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> which is similar in magnitude to the thickness change observed upon the addition of cholesterol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>). The fluidity of the lipid bilayer is described through the order parameter (S), which is the average ordering of the lipid chains. S is ∼0.3 for nanodiscs of the same size and containing the same number of DMPC or POPC lipids, indicating comparable fluidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>In both POPC and DMPC bilayers, the distribution was dominated by the open conformation (∼12 nm) in the absence of EGF, whereas the equilibrium shifted towards the compact conformation (∼8 nm) in the presence of EGF (<xref rid="figs17" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 17</xref>). The amplitude of the open conformation decreased from ∼87% to 60% in its presence for POPC and decreased from 95% in the absence of EGF to 42% in its presence for DMPC (<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). The similar behavior between POPC and DMPC strongly implies the transmembrane conformational response is independent of bilayer thickness, suggesting that the decreased membrane fluidity in the presence of cholesterol is likely responsible for the suppression of the conformational response.</p>

Our results complement and expand upon previous molecular dynamic simulations of the kinase domain that increasing amounts of anionic lipids (up to 30%) induce a corresponding decrease in the accessibility of the ATP binding site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Similar interactions were observed for PIP2 lipids as for PS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> suggesting similar effects may be induced during PIP2-mediated processes.

Excitation light was then spectrally filtered for pulses centered at 550 nm or 640 nm and focused with an oil immersion objective lens (UPLSAPO100×, Olympus, NA = 1.4). Fluorescence emission was collected by the same objective and fed to the avalanche photodiodes (SPCMAQRH-15, Excelitas). A 5 µm ×5 µm area of a coverslip with immobilized receptors was scanned. Diffraction limited and spatially separated single molecule spots were then probed individually by unblocking the laser beam to record fluorescence until photo-bleaching. For 550 nm excitation, fluorescence was separated with a dichroic filter SP01-561RU (Laser 2000) and passed through FF01-629/56-25 (Semrock) for donor fluorescence collection. For experiments at 640 nm, ET 645/30×(Chroma) was used as the excitation filter, FF01-629/56-25 (Semrock) as the dichroic and FF02-685/40-25 (Semrock) for acceptor fluorescence collection.

Following the typical Martini protocol,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref></sup> we used a time step of 20 fs, and a temperature of 303 K in all of our simulations. We further used the umbrella sampling technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref></sup> to enhance the exploration of the EGFR conformational space, biasing two collective variables: the contact number between the KD domain and the C-terminal tail, and the distance between the JMA domain and the N-terminal part of the CTT domain. Details of the simulation are described in a previous publication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>We analyzed our simulations using WHAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref></sup> to reweight the umbrella biases and compute the average values of various metrics introduced in this manuscript. Specifically, we calculated the distance between Residue 721 and Residue 1186 (EGFR C-terminus) of the protein. To quantify the accessibility of the ATP-binding site, we calculated the number of contacts between lipid molecules and the residues forming the ATP-binding pocket (residues 694-703, 719, 766-769, 772-773, 817, 820, and 831).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref></sup> Close contact between the bilayer and these residues would sterically hinder ATP binding; thus, the contact number serves as a proxy for ATP-site accessibility. The cutoff distance for defining a contact was set to 16 Å, corresponding to the largest molecular radius of the fluorescent ATP analogue (atto647N-ATP, 16.96 Å <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref></sup>). Accordingly, we defined a contact as a pair of coarse-grained atoms, one from the lipid membrane and one from the ATP binding site, within a mutual distance of less than 16 Å.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work addresses a key question in cell signalling, how does the membrane composition affect the behaviour of a membrane signalling protein? Understanding this is important, not just to understand basic biological function but because membrane composition is highly altered in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disease. Although parts of this question have been addressed on fragments of the target membrane protein, EGFR, used here, Srinivasan et al. harness a unique tool, membrane nanodisks, which allow them to probe full length EGFR in vitro in great detail with cutting-edge fluorescent tools. They find interested impacts on EGFR conformation in differently charged and fluid membranes, explaining previously identified signalling phenotypes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The nanodisk system enables full length EGFR to be studied in vitro and in a membrane with varying lipid and cholesterol concentrations. The authors combine this with single-molecule FRET utilising multiple pairs of fluorophores at different places on the protein to probe different conformational changes in response to EGF binding under different anionic lipid and cholesterol concentrations. They further support their findings using molecular dynamics simulations which help uncover the full atomistic detail of the conformations they observe.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Much of the interpretation of the results comes down to a bimodal model of an 'open' and 'closed' state between the intracellular tail of the protein and the membrane. Some of the data looks like a bimodal model is appropriate but not all. The authors have just this bimodal model statistically and although adding a third component is a better fit, I agree with the authors that it cannot be justified statistically, given the data. Further work beyond the scope of this study would be needed to try to define further states.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work addresses a key question in cell signalling: how does the membrane composition affect the behaviour of a membrane signalling protein? Understanding this is important, not just to understand basic biological function but because membrane composition is highly altered in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disease. Although parts of this question have been addressed on fragments of the target membrane protein, EGFR, used here, Srinivasan et al. harness a unique tool, membrane nanodisks, which allow them to probe full-length EGFR in vitro in great detail with cutting-edge fluorescent tools. They find interesting impacts on EGFR conformation in differently charged and fluid membranes, explaining previously identified signalling phenotypes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The nanodisk system enables full-length EGFR to be studied in vitro and in a membrane with varying lipid and cholesterol concentrations. The authors combine this with single-molecule FRET utilising multiple pairs of fluorophores at different places on the protein to probe different conformational changes in response to EGF binding under different anionic lipid and cholesterol concentrations. They further support their findings using molecular dynamics simulations, which help uncover the full atomistic detail of the conformations they observe.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Much of the interpretation of the results comes down to a bimodal model of an 'open' and 'closed' state between the intracellular tail of the protein and the membrane. Some of the data looks like a bimodal model is appropriate, but its use is not sufficiently justified (statistically or otherwise) in this work in its current form. The experiments with varying cholesterol in particular appear to suggest an alternate model with longer fluorescent lifetimes. More justification of these interpretations of the central experiment of this work would strengthen the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the strengths of the study, including the use of nanodiscs, single-molecule FRET, and MD simulations to probe full-length EGFR in controlled membrane environments.</p>
<p>We agree that statistical justification is important for interpreting the distributions. To address this, we performed global fits of the data with both two- and three-Gaussian models and evaluated them using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which balances the model fit with a penalty for additional parameters. The three-Gaussian model gave a substantially lower BIC, indicating statistical preference for the more complex model. However, we also assessed the separability of the Gaussian components using Ashman’s D, which quantifies whether peaks are distinct. This analysis showed that two Gaussians (µ = 2.64 and 3.43 ns) are not separable, implying they represent one broad distribution rather than two states.</p>
<table-wrap id="sa3table1">
<label>Author response table 1.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-108789-sa3-table1.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>Both the two- and three-Gaussian models include a low-value component (µ = ~1.3 ns), but the apparent improvement of the three-Gaussian model arises only from splitting the central population into two overlapping Gaussians. Thus, while the BIC favors the three-Gaussian model statistically, Ashman’s D demonstrates that the central peak should not be interpreted as bimodal. Therefore, when all the distributions are fit globally, the data are best explained as two Gaussians, one centered at ~1.3 ns and the other at ~2.7 ns, with cholesterol-dependent shifts reflecting changes in the distribution of this population rather than the emergence of a separate state. Finally, we acknowledge that additional conformations may exist, but based on this analysis a bimodal model describes the populations captured in our data and so we limit ourselves to this simplest framework.</p>
<p>We have clarified this in the revised manuscript by adding a section in the Methods (page 26) titled Model Selection and Statistical Analysis, which describes the results of the global two- versus three-Gaussian fits evaluated using BIC and Ashman’s D. Additional details of these analyses are also provided in response to Reviewer #1, Question 8 (Recommendations for the authors).</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for noting the strengths of our approach, particularly the use of complementary techniques and the development of a new pipeline to study lipid effects on membrane protein function.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Due to the relative novelty of the approach, a number of concerns remain.</p>
<p>(1) I am a little skeptical about the good correlation of the nanodisc compositions with the liposome compositions. I would rather have expected a kind of clustering of individual lipid types in the liposome membrane, in particular of cholesterol. This should then result in an uneven distribution upon nanodisc assembly, i.e., in a notable variation of lipid composition in the individual nanodiscs. Could this be ruled out by the implemented assays, or can just the overall lipid composition of the complete nanodisc fraction be analyzed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We monitored insertion of anionic lipids into nanodiscs by performing zeta potential measurements, which report on surface charge, and cholesterol insertion by Laurdan fluorescence, which reports on membrane order. Both assays provide information at the ensemble level, not single-nanodisc resolution. We clarified this in the Methods section (see below).</p>
<p>Cholesterol clustering is well documented in ternary systems with saturated lipids and sphingolipids [Veatch, Biophys J., 2003; Risselada, PNAS, 2008]. However, in unsaturated POPC-cholesterol mixtures such as those used here, cholesterol primarily alters bilayer order and large-scale segregation is not typically observed.  The addition of POPS to the POPC-cholesterol mixture perturbs cholesterol-induced ordering, lowering the likelihood of cholesterol-rich domains [Kumar, J. Mol. Graphics Modell., 2021].</p>
<p>Lipid heterogeneity between nanodiscs would be expected to give rise to heterogeneity in hydrodynamic properties, including potentially broadening the dynamic light scattering (DLS) distributions. However, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) values from the DLS measurements (see Author response table 2) do not indicate a broadening with cholesterol. Statistical testing (Mann-Whitney U test for non-normal data) showed no significant difference between samples with and without cholesterol (p = 0.486; n = 4 per group). While the sample size is small making firm conclusions challenging, these results suggest that large-scale heterogeneity is unlikely.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>In the case of POPS lipids, clustering of POPS in EGFR embedded nanodiscs is a recognized property of receptor-lipid interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations have shown that POPS, although constituting only 30% of the inner leaflet, accounts for ~50% of the lipids directly contacting EGFR [Arkhipov, Cell, 2013], underscoring that anionic lipids are preferentially recruited to the receptor’s immediate environment.</p>
<p>For nanodiscs containing cholesterol and anionic lipids, our smFRET experiments were designed to isolate the effect of EGF binding. The nanodisc population is the same in the ± EGF conditions as EGF was introduced just prior to performing sm-FRET experiments, and not during nanodisc assembly. Thus, for a given lipid composition, any observed differences between ligand-free and ligand-bound states reflect conformational changes of EGFR.</p>
<p>Methods, page 23, “Zeta potential measurements to quantify surface charge of nanodiscs: Data analysis was processed using the instrumental Malvern’s DTS software to obtain the mean zeta-potential value. This ensemble measurement reports the average surface charge of the nanodisc population, verifying incorporation of anionic POPS lipids.”</p>
<p>Methods, page 23, “Fluorescence measurements with Laurdan to confirm cholesterol insertion into nanodiscs: The excitation spectrum was recorded by collecting the emission at 440 nm and emission spectra was recorded by exciting the sample at 385 nm. Laurdan fluorescence provides an ensemble readout of membrane order and confirms cholesterol incorporation into the nanodisc population. While laurdan does not resolve the composition of individual nanodiscs, prior work has shown that POPC–cholesterol mixtures are miscible without forming cholesterol-rich domains[91,92], thus the observed ordering changes likely reflect the intended input cholesterol content at the ensemble level.”</p>

<p>(2) Both templates have been added simultaneously, with a 100-fold excess of the EGFR template. Was this the result of optimization? How is the kinetics of protein production? As EGFR is in far excess, a significant precipitation, at least in the early period of the reaction, due to limiting nanodiscs, should be expected. How is the oligomeric form of the inserted EGFR? Have multiple insertions into one nanodisc been observed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these insightful questions. Yes, the EGFR:ApoA1∆49 template ratio of 100:1 was empirically determined through optimization experiments now shown in the revised Supplementary Fig. 3. Cell-free reactions were performed across a range of EGFR:ApoA1∆49 template ratios (1:2 to 1:200) and sampled at different time points (2-19 hours). As shown in the gels, EGFR expression increased with higher template ratios and longer reaction times up to ~9 hours, while ApoA1 expression became clearly detectable only after 6 hours. Based on these results, we selected an EGFR:ApoA1∆49 ratio of 100:1 and 8-hour reaction time as the optimal condition, which yielded sufficient full-length EGFR incorporated into nanodiscs for ensemble and single-molecule experiments.</p>
<p>In cell-free systems, protein yield does not scale directly with DNA template concentration, as translation efficiency is limited by factors such as ribosome availability and co-translational membrane insertion [Hunt, Chem. Rev., 2024; Blackholly, Front. Mol. Biosci., 2022]. Consistent with this, we observed that ApoA1∆49 is produced at higher levels than EGFR despite the lower DNA input (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Providing an excess EGFR template prevents the reaction from becoming limited by scaffold availability and helps compensate for the fact that, as a large multi-domain receptor, EGFR expression can yield truncated as well as full-length products. This strategy ensures that sufficient full-length receptors are available for nanodisc incorporation. We will clarify this in the Methods section (see below).</p>
<p>We observed little to no visible precipitation under the reported cell-free conditions, likely due to the following reasons: (i) EGFR and ApoA1∆49 are co-expressed in the cell-free reaction, and ApoA1∆49 assembles into nanodiscs concurrently with receptor translation, providing an immediate membrane sink (ii) ApoA1∆49 is expressed at high levels, maintaining disc concentrations that keep the reaction in a soluble regime.</p>
<p>The sample contains donor-labeled EGFR (snap surface 594) together with acceptor-labeled lipids (cy5-labeled PE doped in the nanodisc). We assess the oligomerization state of EGFR in nanodiscs using single-molecule photobleaching of the donor channel. Snap surface 594 is a benzyl guanine derivative of Atto 594 that reacts with the SNAP tag with near-stoichiometry efficiency [Sun, Chembiochem, 2011]. Most molecules (~75%) exhibited a single photobleaching step, consistent with incorporation of a single EGFR per nanodisc [Srinivasan, Nat. Commun., 2022]. A minority of traces (~15%) showed two photobleaching steps and about ~10% of traces showed three or more photobleaching steps, consistent with occasional multiple insertions. For all smFRET analysis, we restricted the dataset to single-step photobleaching traces, ensuring measurements were performed on monomeric EGFR.</p>
<p>Methods, page 20, “Production of labeled, full-length EGFR nanodiscs: Briefly, the E.Coli slyD lysate, in vitro protein synthesis E.Coli reaction buffer, amino acids (-Methionine), Methionine, T7 Enzyme, protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermofisher Scientific), RNAse inhibitor (Roche) and DNA plasmids (20ug of EGFR and 0.2ug of ApoA1∆49) were mixed with different lipid mixtures. The DNA template ratio of EGFR:ApoA1∆49 = 100:1 was empirically chosen by testing different ratios on SDS-PAGE gels and selecting the condition that maximized full-length EGFR expression in DMPC lipids (Supplementary Fig. 3).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The IMAC purification does not discriminate between EGFR-filled and empty nanodiscs. Does the TEM study give any information about the composition of the particles (empty, EGFR monomers, or EGFR oligomers)? Normalizing the measured fluorescence, i.e., the total amount of solubilized receptor, with the total protein concentration of the samples could give some data on the stoichiometry of EGFR and nanodiscs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Negative-stain TEM was performed to confirm nanodisc formation and morphology, but this method does not resolve whether a given disc contains EGFR. To directly assess receptor stoichiometry, we instead relied on single-molecule photobleaching of snap surface 594-labeled EGFR (see response to Point 2). These experiments showed that the majority of nanodiscs contain a single receptor, with a minority containing two receptors. For all smFRET analyses, we restricted data to single-step photobleaching traces, ensuring measurements were performed on monomeric EGFR.</p>
<p>We did not normalize EGFR fluorescence to total protein concentration because the bulk protein fraction after IMAC purification includes both receptor-loaded and empty nanodiscs. The latter contribute to ApoA1∆49 mass but do not contain receptors and including them would underestimate receptor occupancy. Importantly, the presence of empty nanodiscs does not affect our measurements as photobleaching and single-molecule FRET analyses selectively report only on receptor-containing nanodiscs. This clarification has been added to the Methods.</p>
<p>Methods, page 26, “Fluorescence Spectroscopy: Traces with a single photobleaching step for the donor and acceptor were considered for further analysis. Regions of constant intensity in the traces were identified by a change-point algorithm95. Donor traces were assigned as FRET levels until acceptor photobleaching. The presence of empty nanodiscs does not influence these measurements, as photobleaching and single-molecule FRET analyses selectively report on receptor-containing nanodiscs.”</p>

<p>(4) The authors generally assume a 100% functional folding of EGFR in all analyzed environments. While this could be the case, with some other membrane proteins, it was shown that only a fraction of the nanodisc solubilized particles are in functional conformation. Furthermore, the percentage of solubilized and folded membrane protein may change with the membrane composition of the supplied nanodiscs, while non-charged lipids mostly gave rather poor sample quality. The authors normalize the ATP binding to the total amount of detectable EGFR, and variations are interpreted as suppression of activity. Would the presence of unfolded EGFR fractions in some samples with no access to ATP binding be an alternative interpretation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that not all nanodisc-embedded EGFR molecules may be fully functional and that the fraction of folded protein could vary with lipid composition. In our ATP-binding assay, EGFR detection relies on the C-terminal SNAP-tag fused to an intrinsically disordered region. Successful labeling requires that this segment be translated, accessible, and folded sufficiently to accommodate the SNAP reaction, which imposes an additional requirement compared to the rigid, structured kinase domain where ATP binds. Misfolded or truncated EGFR molecules would therefore likely fail to label at the C-terminus. These factors strongly imply that our assay predominantly reports on receptor molecules that are intact and well folded.</p>
<p>Additionally, our molecular dynamics simulations at 0% and 30% POPS support the experimental ATP-binding measurements (Fig. 2c, d). This consistency between both the experimental and simulated evidence, including at 0% POPS where reduced receptor folding might be expected, suggests that the observed lipid-dependent changes are more likely due to modulation of the functional receptor rather than receptor misfolding. We have clarified these points by adding the following</p>
<p>Results, page 7, “Role of anionic lipids in EGFR kinase activity: In the presence of EGF, increasing the anionic lipid content decreased the number of contacts from 71.8 ± 1.8 to 67.8 ± 2.4, indicating increased accessibility, again in line with the experimental findings. Because detection of EGFR relies on labeling at the C-terminus and ATP binding requires an intact kinase domain, the ATPbinding assay is for receptors that are properly folded and competent for nucleotide binding. The consistency between experimental results and MD simulations suggests that the observed lipiddependent changes are more likely due to modulation of functional EGFR than to artifacts from misfolding.”</p>

<p>The experimental program presented here is excellent, and the results are highly interesting. My enthusiasm is dampened by the presentation in places which is confusing, especially Figure 3, which contains so many of the results. I also have some reservations about the bimodal interpretation of the lifetime data in Figure 3.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment of our experimental approach and results. In the revised version, we have improved figure organization and readability by adding explicit labels for lipid composition and EGF presence/absence in all lifetime distributions, moving key supplementary tables into main text, and reorganizing the supplementary figures as Extended Data Figures following <italic>eLife’s</italic> format. Figures and tables now appear in the order in which they are referenced in the text to further improve readability.</p>
<p>Regarding the bimodal interpretation of the lifetime distribution, we have performed global fits of the data with both two- and three-Gaussian models and evaluated them using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Ashman’s D analysis, which supported the bimodal interpretation. Details of this analysis are provided in our response to comment (8) below and included in the manuscript.</p>

<p>(3) Figure 2b - it would be easier to compare if these were plotted on top of each other. Are we at saturating ATP binding concentration or below it? Also, please put a key to say purple - absent and orange +EGF on the figure. I am also confused as to why, with no EGF, ATP binding is high with 0% POPS, but low when EGF is present, but that then reverses with physiological lipid content.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we agree that a direct comparison would be easier, the ATP-binding experiments for the ± EGF conditions were actually performed independently on separate SDS-PAGE gels, which unfortunately precludes such a comparison. We have added a color key to clarify the -EGF and +EGF datasets.</p>
<p>The experiments were carried out at 1 µM of the fluorescently labeled ATP analogue (atto647Nγ ATP). Reported kinetic measurements for the isolated EGFR kinase domain indicate an K<sub>m</sub> of 5.2 µM suggesting that our experimental concentration is below, but close to the saturating range ensuring sensitivity to changes in accessibility of the binding site rather than saturating all available receptors.</p>
<p>We have revised the manuscript to clarify these details by including the following text:</p>
<p>Results, page 6, “To investigate how the membrane composition impacts accessibility, we measured ATP binding levels for EGFR in membranes with different anionic lipid content. 1 µM of fluorescently-labeled ATP analogue, atto647N-γ ATP, which binds irreversibly to the active site, was added to samples of EGFR nanodiscs with 0%, 15%, 30% or 60% anionic lipid content in the absence or presence of EGF.”</p>
<p>Methods, page 24, “ATP binding experiments: Full-length EGFR in different lipid environments was prepared using cell-free expression as described above. 1μM of snap surface 488 (New England Biolabs) and atto647N labeled gamma ATP (Jena Bioscience) was added after cell-free expression and incubated at 30 °C , 300 rpm for 60 minutes. 1μM of atto647N-γ ATP was used, corresponding to a concentration near the reported Km of 5.2 µM for ATP binding to the isolated EGFR kinase domain[93], ensuring sensitivity to lipid-dependent changes in ATP accessibility.”</p>
<p>(ii) Nucleotide binding is suppressed under basal conditions, likely to ensure that the catalytic activity is promoted only upon EGF stimulation.</p>
<p>The molecular dynamics simulations at 0% and 30% POPS further support this interpretation, showing that anionic lipids modulate the accessibility of the ATP-binding site in a manner consistent with experimental trends (Fig. 2c and 2d).</p>
<p>We have clarified these points in the main text with the following additions:</p>
<p>Results, page 6, “In the presence of EGF, ATP binding overall increased with anionic lipid content with the highest levels observed in 60% POPS bilayers. In the neutral bilayer, ligand seemed to suppress ATP binding, indicating anionic lipids are required for the regulated activation of EGFR.”</p>
<p>Results, page 7, “In the absence of EGF, increasing the anionic lipid content from 0\% POPS to 30% POPS increased the number of ATP-lipid contacts 58.6±0.7 to 74.4±1.2, indicating reduced accessibility, consistent with the experimental results and suggesting anionic lipids are required for ligand-induced EGFR activity.”</p>

<p>(4) Figure 2d - how was the 16A distance arrived at?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The 16 Å cutoff was chosen based on the physical dimensions of the ATP analogue used in the experiments. Specifically, the largest radius of the atto647N-γ ATP molecule is ~16.9 Å, which defines the maximum distance at which lipid atoms could sterically obstruct access of ATP to the binding pocket. Accordingly, in the simulations, contacts were defined as pairs of coarse-grained atoms between lipid molecules and the residues forming the ATP-binding site (residues 694-703, 719, 766-769, 772-773, 817, 820, and 831) separated by less than 16 Å.</p>
<p>We have rewritten the rationale for selecting the 16 Å cutoff in the Methods section to improve clarity.</p>
<p>Methods, page 28, “Coarse-grained, Explicit-solvent Simulations with the MARTINI Force Field: We analyzed our simulations using WHAM[108,109] to reweight the umbrella biases and compute the average values of various metrics introduced in this manuscript. Specifically, we calculated the distance between Residue 721 and Residue 1186 (EGFR C-terminus) of the protein. To quantify the accessibility of the ATP-binding site, we calculated the number of contacts between lipid molecules and the residues forming the ATP-binding pocket (residues 694-703, 719, 766-769, 772-773, 817, 820, and 831)[110]. Close contact between the bilayer and these residues would sterically hinder ATP binding; thus, the contact number serves as a proxy for ATP-site accessibility. The cutoff distance for defining a contact was set to 16 Å, corresponding to the largest molecular radius of the fluorescent ATP analogue (atto647N-γ ATP, 16.96 Å111). Accordingly, we defined a contact as a pair of coarse-grained atoms, one from the lipid membrane and one from the ATP binding site, within a mutual distance of less than 16 Å.”</p>

<p>(5) Figure 2e-h - I think a bar chart/violin plot/jitter plot would make it easier to compare the peak values. The statistics in the table should just be quoted in the text as value +/- error from the 95% confidence interval. The way it is written currently is confusing, as it implies that there is no conformational change with the addition of EGF in neutral lipids, but there is ~0.4nm one from the table. I don't understand what you mean by &quot;The larger conformational response of these important domains suggests that the intracellular conformation may play a role in downstream signaling steps, such as binding of adaptor proteins&quot;?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. For the smFRET lifetime distributions (Figure 2j, k; previously Figure 2e, f), we have now included jitter plots of the donor lifetimes in the Supplementary Figure 11 to facilitate direct visual comparison of the median and distribution widths for each lipid composition and ±EGF conditions. The distance distributions for the ATP to C-terminus in Figure 2e, f (previously Figure 2g, h) were obtained from umbrella-sampling simulations that calculate free-energy profiles rather than raw, unbiased distance values. Because the sampling is guided by biasing potentials, individual distance values cannot be used to construct violin or jitter plots. We therefore present the simulation data only as probability density distributions, which best reflect the equilibrium distributions derived from them.</p>
<p>We have also revised the text to report the median ± 95% confidence interval, improving clarity and consistency with the statistical table.</p>
<p>Results, page 9: “In the neutral bilayer (0% POPS), the distributions in the absence of EGF peaks at 8.1 nm (95% CI: 8.0–8.2 nm) and in the presence of EGF peaks at 8.6 nm (95% CI: 8.5–8.7 nm) (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1). In the physiological regime of 30% POPS nanodiscs, the peak of the donor lifetime distribution shifts from 9.1 nm (95% CI: 8.9–9.2 nm) in the absence of EGF to 11.6 nm (95% CI: 11.1–12.6 nm) in the presence of EGF (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1), which is a larger EGF-induced conformational response than in neutral lipids.”</p>
<p>Finally, we have rephrased the sentence in question for clarity. The revised text now reads:</p>
<p>Results, page 9: “The larger conformational response observed in the presence of anionic lipids suggests that these lipids enhance the responsiveness of the intracellular domains to EGF, potentially ensuring interactions between C-terminal sites and adaptor proteins during downstream signaling.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) &quot;r, highlighting that the charged lipids can enhance the conformational response even for protein regions far away from the plasma membrane&quot; - is it not that the neutral membrane is just very weird and not physiological that EGFR and other proteins don't function properly?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that completely neutral (0% POPS) membranes are not physiological and likely do not support the native organization or activity of EGFR. We have revised the text to clarify that the 30% POPS condition represents a more native-like lipid environment that restores or stabilizes the expected conformational response, rather than &quot;enhancing&quot; it. The revised sentence now reads:</p>
<p>Results, page 10: “Both experimental and computational results show a larger EGF-induced conformational change in the partially anionic bilayer, consistent with the notion that a partially anionic lipid bilayer provides a more native environment that supports proper receptor activation, compared to the non-physiological neutral membrane.”</p>

<p>(8) Figure 3 - the bimodality in many of these plots is dubious. It's very clear in some, i.e. 0% POPS +EGF, but not others. Can anything be done to justify bimodality better?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that statistical justification is important for interpreting lifetime distributions. To address this, we performed global fits of the data with both two- and three-Gaussian models and evaluated them using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which balances the model fit with a penalty for additional parameters. The three-Gaussian model gave a substantially lower BIC, indicating statistical preference for the more complex model. However, we also assessed the separability of the Gaussian components using Ashman’s D, which quantifies whether peaks are distinct. This analysis showed that two of the Gaussians are not separable, implying they represent one broad distribution rather than two discrete states. Therefore, when all the distributions are fit globally, the data are best described as two Gaussians, one centered at ~1.3 ns and the other at ~2.7 ns, with cholesterol-dependent shifts reflecting changes in the distribution of this population rather than the emergence of a separate state. We better justified our choice of model by incorporating the results of the global two- vs three-Gaussian fits with BIC and Ashman’s D analysis in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Methods, page 27: “Model Selection and Statistical Analysis</p>
<p>Global fitting of lifetime distributions was performed across all experimental conditions using maximum likelihood estimation. Both two-Gaussian and three-Gaussian distribution models were evaluated as described previously.62 Model performance was compared using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC),[101] which balances model likelihood and complexity according to</p>
<p>BIC = -2 ln L + k ln n</p>
<p>where L is the likelihood, k is the number of free parameters, and n is the number of singlemolecule photon bunches across all experimental conditions. A lower BIC value indicates a statistically better model[101]. The separation between Gaussian components was subsequently assessed using the Ashman’s D where a score above 2 indicates good separation[102].

<p>(10) Figure 3g - it looks like cholesterol causes a shift in both the peaks, such that the previous open and closed states are not the same, but that there are 2 new states. This is key as the authors state: &quot;Remarkably, high anionic lipids and cholesterol content produce the same EGFR conformations but with opposite effects on signaling-suppression or enhancement.&quot; But this is only true if there really are the same conformational states for all lipid/cholesterol conditions. Again, the bimodal models used for all conditions need to be justified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment. We agree that the interpretation of the lifetime distributions depends on whether cholesterol and anionic lipids modulate existing conformational states or create new ones. To test this, we performed global fits of all distributions using the two- and three-Gaussian models and compared them using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Ashman’s D, the results of which are described in detail in response to (8) above.</p>
<p>Both fitting models, two- and three-Gaussian, identified the same short lifetime component (µ = 1.3 ns), suggesting this reflects a well separated conformation. While the three-Gaussian model gave a lower BIC, Ashman’s D analysis indicated that the two of the three components (µ = 2.6 ns and 3.4 ns) are not statistically separable, suggesting they represent a single broad conformational population rather than distinct states. If instead these two components reflected distinct states present under different conditions, Ashman’s D analysis would have found the opposite result. This supports our interpretation that high cholesterol and high anionic lipid content produce similar conformation ensembles with opposite effects on signaling output.</p>
<p>Finally, we acknowledge that additional conformations may exist, but based on this analysis a bimodal model describes the populations captured in our data and so we limit ourselves to this simplest framework. We have clarified this rationale in the revised manuscript and added the results of the BIC and Ashman’s D analysis to support this interpretation.</p>

This normalization accounts for the different amounts of EGFR produced in each condition.</p>
<p>We did not observe any visible precipitation under the reported cell-free conditions, likely due to the following reasons:</p>
<p>(i) EGFR and ApoA1 are co-expressed in the cell-free reaction, and ApoA1 assembles into nanodiscs concurrently with receptor translation, providing an immediate membrane sink</p>
