<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a critical component of tuberculosis first-line therapy due to its ability to kill both growing and non-replicating drug-tolerant populations of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> within the host. Recent evidence indicates that PZA acts through disruption of coenzyme A synthesis under conditions that promote cellular stress. In contrast to its bactericidal action <italic>in vivo</italic>, PZA shows weak bacteriostatic activity against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in axenic culture. While the basis for this striking difference between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> PZA activity has yet to be resolved, recent studies have highlighted an important role for cell-mediated immunity in PZA efficacy. These observations suggest that host-derived antimicrobial activity may contribute to the bactericidal action of PZA within the host environment. In this study we show that the active form of PZA, pyrazinoic acid (POA), synergizes with the bactericidal activity of host-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS). We determined that POA can promote increased cellular oxidative damage and enhanced killing of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Further, we find that the thiol oxidant diamide is also able to potentiate PZA activity, implicating thiol oxidation as a key driver of PZA susceptibility. Using a macrophage infection model, we demonstrate the essentiality of interferon-γ induced ROS production for PZA mediated clearance of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Based on these observations, we propose that the <italic>in vivo</italic> sterilizing activity of PZA can be mediated through its synergistic interaction with the host oxidative burst leading to collateral disruption of coenzyme A metabolism. These findings will enable discovery efforts to identify novel host- and microbe-directed approaches to bolster PZA efficacy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a cornerstone drug of the first-line therapy for tuberculosis (TB). Following its initial discovery as an antitubercular agent, PZA was administered as monotherapy in humans due to the paucity of effective treatment options (<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">Yeager, Munroe et al. 1952</xref>). As a monotherapy, PZA treatment led to initial uniform improvement of clinical symptoms with approximately one-third of patients showing no detectable tubercle bacilli in their sputum (<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">Yeager, Munroe et al. 1952</xref>). Subsequent clinical trials involving combination therapy with rifampicin, isoniazid and ethionamide demonstrated that inclusion of PZA could dramatically reduce treatment duration and disease relapse rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">British-Medical-Research-Council 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ormerod and Horsfield 1987</xref>). These benefits have been attributed to the unique ability of PZA to kill non-replicating, drug-tolerant populations of bacilli (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Hu, Coates et al. 2006</xref>) as well as its ability to penetrate and accumulate within granulomatous lesions (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">Prideaux, Via et al. 2015</xref>) and within the phagosomes of infected macrophages (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">Santucci, Greenwood et al. 2021</xref>, <xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">Santucci, Aylan et al. 2022</xref>). Based on its unique role in current TB therapy, PZA is anticipated to be a component of future regimens for treatment of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB infections (<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Tweed, Dawson et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the fundamental role of PZA in TB therapy, the mechanisms that govern its antitubercular activity are not fully understood. It is known that PZA is a prodrug that must be converted to pyrazinoic acid (POA) by the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> nicotinamidase PncA (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">Sreevatsan, Pan et al. 1997</xref>). Since PncA activity is non-essential for <italic>in vivo</italic> fitness of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Boshoff, Xu et al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Vilchèze, Weinrick et al. 2010</xref>), the principal mechanism for clinical PZA resistance is through loss-of-function mutations in <italic>pncA</italic> (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">Sreevatsan, Pan et al. 1997</xref>). Unlike other antitubercular agents, PZA shows a unique conditional bacteriostatic activity <italic>in vitro</italic> against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> under environments that promote cell envelope stress, such as low pH (<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">Thiede, Dillon et al. 2022</xref>). In contrast to its bacteriostatic action in laboratory culture, PZA shows bactericidal activity in murine models of infection involving immune competent mice (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Lanoix, Lenaerts et al. 2015</xref>). Further, removal of anti-inflammatory signals through blockade or deletion of IL-10 has been shown to enhance PZA-mediated clearance of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Dwivedi, Gautam et al. 2023</xref>). In contrast, PZA bactericidal activity is abolished in models of TB infection in which cell-mediated immunity has been impaired or dysregulated (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Almeida, Tyagi et al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Lanoix, Lenaerts et al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Lanoix, Ioerger et al. 2016</xref>), highlighting a fundamental connection between PZA action and host response.</p>
<p>Mounting evidence demonstrates that PZA acts through disruption of coenzyme A biosynthesis (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Lamont, Dillon et al. 2020</xref>). Biochemical and biophysical studies indicate that coenzyme A disruption occurs via interaction of POA with aspartate decarboxylase, PanD (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Gopal, Nartey et al. 2017</xref>, <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Gopal, Sarathy et al. 2020</xref>, <xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">Sun, Li et al. 2020</xref>). Consequently, supplementation of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> with coenzyme A intermediates can antagonize PZA action and mutations within the <italic>panD</italic> gene have been associated with resistance to POA and PZA (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Dillon, Peterson et al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Shi, Chen et al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Gopal, Nartey et al. 2017</xref>, <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Gopal, Tasneen et al. 2017</xref>, <xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">Ramirez-Busby, Rodwell et al. 2017</xref>). Despite these key advancements in our understanding of the antitubercular activity of PZA, how these findings relate to the unique bactericidal action of this drug within the host environment has yet to be resolved.</p>
<p>As an intracellular pathogen, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> exploits host immune defenses to establish a niche environment for its survival and propagation. Upon inhalation of infectious aerosols by the host, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is deposited within alveolar sacs and is engulfed by alveolar macrophages. Through secretion of effector molecules, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> arrests phagosomal maturation and prevents phagosome-lysosome fusion (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">Pethe, Swenson et al. 2004</xref>). Modulation of this initial intracellular environment permits continued bacterial growth through impairment of phagosomal acidification and limited production of reactive oxygen species. In a healthy host, the onset of adaptive immunity marks the end of the acute phase of infection. Through predominantly T<sub>h</sub>1 inflammatory responses driven by interferon-γ (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">Nathan, Murray et al. 1983</xref>, <xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Flynn, Chan et al. 1993</xref>) and tumor-necrosis factor-α (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Chan, Xing et al. 1992</xref>, <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Flynn, Goldstein et al. 1995</xref>), activated macrophages undergo phagosomal maturation and induce phagosome lysosome fusion. Once activated, macrophages increase their production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species resulting in abatement of bacterial growth and containment of the bacilli within granulomatous lesions.</p>
<p>Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a critical mechanism for control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> within human phagocytes. Superoxide is generated within the phagosome through the transfer of electrons from NADPH to molecular oxygen mediated by the multi-protein complex NADPH phagocyte oxidase. Inside the phagosomal environment, superoxide dismutates to the more stable hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), which can react with metal ions to produce highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (<sup>•</sup>OH). <sup>•</sup>OH induces microbial death through broad oxidative damage to proteins, DNA, and lipids. Defects in the ROS producing NADPH phagocyte oxidase complex are associated with increased susceptibility to mycobacteria in humans (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Bustamante, Aksu et al. 2007</xref>, <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Lee, Chan et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior studies in cell-free systems have established that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated oxidation of hydrocarbons can be accelerated in the presence of POA-iron complexes (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">Shulpin, Attanasio et al. 1993</xref>). While the chemical mechanism governing this oxidation is unclear, it is predicted to involve the direct formation of <sup>•</sup>OH from the interaction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with POA-coordinated iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kirillov and Shul’pin 2013</xref>). Whether POA-mediated formation of <sup>•</sup>OH is associated with the <italic>in vivo</italic> bactericidal action of PZA has not been reported. However, Lien and colleagues recently demonstrated that deletion of a novel mycobacterial nanocompartment involved in oxidative stress defense sensitized <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to PZA in a murine model of infection (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">Lien, Dinshaw et al. 2021</xref>). In this report, we investigate the association between PZA susceptibility and oxidative stress in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to delineate the role of the host environment in bactericidal action. We demonstrate that normally sub-inhibitory concentrations of PZA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can act synergistically against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> resulting in bactericidal activity. Moreover, we demonstrate that potentiation of PZA action is driven through thiol stress. Finally, we find that this activity correlates with the bactericidal action of PZA within infected macrophages. Taken together, these observations support a role for host-induced oxidative stress in the <italic>in vivo</italic> bactericidal action of PZA.</p>

<p>Given the critical role of host-derived ROS in controlling tuberculosis infections and the diminished antitubercular efficacy of PZA in infection models with impaired macrophage activation (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Almeida, Tyagi et al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Lanoix, Lenaerts et al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Lanoix, Ioerger et al. 2016</xref>), we explored the potential interaction between PZA and ROS on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in culture. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> was grown in 7H9 medium (pH 5.8) supplemented with 10% ADS, 0.2% glycerol and 0.05% tyloxapol. At mid-exponential phase, PZA (200 µg/mL) or vehicle (DMSO) was added and cultures were incubated for an additional 3 days. Aliquots of cultures were then exposed to a geometric concentration series of ROS generating compounds (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, menadione or clofazimine) for 24 hrs. Cells were serially diluted and plated on 7H10 agar to determine the titer of surviving colony forming units (CFU). PZA pretreated cultures were significantly more susceptible to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> mediated killing with a ≥16-fold decrease in the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC, minimum concentration required to kill &gt;99% of bacterial cells) relative to the no PZA control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This combinatorial approach was also applied with menadione and clofazimine which have been reported to interact with the mycobacterial respiratory chain resulting in superoxide production (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Akhtar, Srivastava et al. 2006</xref>, <xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">Yano, Kassovska-Bratinova et al. 2011</xref>). While both menadione and clofazimine were also found to elicit bactericidal activity against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> as previously reported, neither showed the same level of enhanced activity against PZA-treated cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, C</xref>).</p>

<p>To further examine the extent of interaction between H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and PZA, checkerboard assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Odds 2003</xref>) were conducted with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to determine the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values for this combination. Similar to the prior experiment, cells were exposed to PZA in 7H9 for 72 hours prior to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure. Cultures were then incubated for 7 days and growth was assessed by measuring OD<sub>600</sub>. Cultures that showed less than 10% growth relative to the no drug control were considered inhibited. The interaction of PZA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was found to be strongly synergistic (FICI ≤ 0.5) against strains H37Rv (FICI of 0.19) and H37Ra (FICI of 0.06) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, 2B</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="628853v1_fig2.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Since the antitubercular action of PZA is dependent upon PncA-mediated conversion to POA, we sought to determine whether PncA activity was essential for the observed synergy with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> is naturally resistant to PZA due to a loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>pncA</italic> gene rendering this species incapable of generating POA (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">Sreevatsan, Pan et al. 1997</xref>). Ectopic expression of a functional copy of <italic>pncA</italic> enables POA conversion thereby restoring PZA susceptibility in the attenuated <italic>M. bovis</italic> vaccine strain Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) Pasteur (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Baughn, Deng et al. 2010</xref>). Checkerboard assays with PZA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were carried out in <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG and BCG-<italic>pncA</italic> to assess the role of POA conversion in synergy between PZA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Like previous observations for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, PZA was synergistic with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> against the BCG-<italic>pncA</italic> strain (FICI of 0.31) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). However, synergy with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was not observed for the parental BCG strain, indicating that conversion of PZA to POA is essential for synergy between H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and PZA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Since oxidative stress results in broad oxidation of cellular thiols within biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baba and Bhatnagar 2018</xref>) and PZA is known to disrupt synthesis of the thiol cofactor coenzyme A, we were curious to determine whether thiol oxidation is sufficient to potentiate susceptibility of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to PZA. It has previously been shown that diamide can elicit growth-inhibitory thiol stress in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and this effect is enhanced under conditions of low pH (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Coulson, Johnson et al. 2017</xref>). Consistent with a role for thiol stress in potentiation of PZA action, co-exposure of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to diamide and PZA in checkerboard format revealed synergy under acidic (pH 5.8, FICI of 0.5) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) and more so under circumneutral (pH 6.8, FICI of 0.28) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>) conditions. These observations suggest that thiol oxidation is likely to be a key contributor to the enhanced activity of PZA under conditions of oxidative stress.</p>

<title>PZA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> result in synergistic oxidation of cellular targets</title>
<p>To assess the ability of POA to accelerate intrabacterial release of <sup>•</sup>OH, we utilized the fluorogenic probe CellRox Green to quantify the abundance of oxidative radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Yang and Choi 2018</xref>) in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> following exposure to PZA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv was pretreated with PZA (100 and 200 µg/mL) or vehicle control (DMSO) for 3 days. Cultures were subsequently treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (0.5-10 mM) for up to 24 hrs. In the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> there was no discernable increase in oxidative radical production due to the administration of PZA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). However, pretreatment with PZA followed by exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in signal relative to the vehicle control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>). Together these data suggest that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> synergizes with PZA through enhanced intrabacterial release of <sup>•</sup>OH.</p>

<p>Through damaging multiple cellular components, host-derived ROS plays a key role in eliminating pathogenic bacteria. If POA activity is mediated through ROS, then PZA treated cultures of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> should have increased levels of oxidative damage. Protein carbonylation, which occurs when protein side chains become carbonylated upon exposure to ROS, is a biologically quantifiable marker of oxidative damage. Carbonyl groups can be derivatized with 2,4 dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) and then quantified by measuring the adduct abundance in a given protein sample spectrophotometrically. An assay using bovine serum albumin (BSA), Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was implemented to assess POA associated protein carbonylation in a cell-free system. Within 30 minutes after the addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, BSA associated carbonylation was increased approximately 4-fold by POA compared to baseline (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). To measure carbonylation from whole cells, <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> H37Ra was treated with PZA at pH 5.8 for 72 hours, challenged with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 24 hours, cultures lysed, and extracted for total protein that was later derivatized with DNPH. PZA treatment significantly increased protein carbonylation in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> when compared to the untreated (2.6-fold, p=0.0077) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> only (2.8-fold, p=0.0060) controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Interestingly, PZA treatment alone in the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> trended to higher, yet statistically insignificant, levels of protein carbonylation than either the untreated (1.5-fold, p=0.4681) or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> only (1.6-fold, p=0.3766) controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). The addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to PZA treated cells led to an additional 1.7-fold (p=0.0602) increase in protein carbonylation over that observed with PZA only.</p>

<title>Bactericidal activity of PZA is dependent upon host-derived ROS within macrophages</title>
<p>Previous <italic>in vivo</italic> studies indicate a dependence on cell-mediated responses for PZA bactericidal activity. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that PZA activity against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in the host is mediated through POA-driven sensitization to the oxidative burst in macrophages. To directly test this hypothesis, we examined the requirement for host derived ROS for PZA activity using virulent H37Rv and the minimal unit of TB infection, the macrophage (<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">VanderVen, Huang et al. 2016</xref>). We utilized well established macrophage cell line infection models, a murine RAW 264.1 and PMA differentiated human THP-1 macrophages exposed to virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv. Macrophages were either left resting or activated with IFN-γ prior to infection. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv infected macrophages were treated daily with PZA (400 ug/mL) or DMSO vehicle control and monitored up to 10 days (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,B</xref>). In both RAW 264.1 and THP-1 cell lines, IFN-γ activation led to an approximate 4-fold reduction in bacterial CFUs compared to resting macrophages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,B</xref>). The addition of PZA to IFN-γ activated macrophages decreased the bacterial burden a further ∼1.5-fold, yet, surprisingly, had no discernable effect on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth in resting cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,B</xref>). IFN-γ signaling activates enhanced anti-mycobacterial macrophage functions, which includes elevated production of ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">MacMicking 2014</xref>, <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Kak, Raza et al. 2018</xref>). We therefore assessed the role of host produced ROS in PZA action by treating <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infected IFN-γ activated macrophages with the well-established ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-L cysteine (NAC). In both macrophage subsets the addition of NAC in the context of PZA treatment resulted in the complete abolishment of drug related bactericidal activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,B</xref>). CFU burden in NAC treated cultures were comparable to those of resting macrophages with and without PZA treatment, demonstrating the importance of host-derived ROS for bactericidal activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite several decades of PZA use in first-line TB therapy, the underlying basis for its divergent activity against <italic>M. tuberculosis in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> has remained elusive. Recent investigations utilizing murine models of TB infection have suggested that the <italic>in vivo</italic> bactericidal activity of PZA relies on activation of the cell-mediated immune response (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Almeida, Tyagi et al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">Lanoix, Lenaerts et al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Lanoix, Ioerger et al. 2016</xref>). These findings indicate that antimicrobial effectors within the host microenvironment are of fundamental importance in the bactericidal action of PZA. Through the use of axenic cultures and macrophage infections, our study demonstrates that ROS plays a pivotal role in driving bactericidal activity of PZA against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Consistent with the crucial role of pyrazinamidase in PZA activation, we observed that strains with <italic>pncA</italic> loss-of-function become resistant to this bactericidal action. Additionally, we demonstrate PZA treatment leads to increased intrabacterial oxidative damage. The role of ROS in driving PZA bactericidal activity in the host environment was supported by its indispensability in macrophage infection models and highlights the importance of localization of PZA to the phagosome (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">Santucci, Greenwood et al. 2021</xref>, <xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">Santucci, Aylan et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>IFN-γ activation is a key signal for phagosomal ROS production in monocytic cells. In this study, IFN-γ activation was found to be crucial for bactericidal activity of PZA against intracellular tubercle bacilli. While IFN-γ activation induces various antimicrobial responses in phagocytes, the finding that the ROS scavenger NAC abolishes drug activity allows these other factors to be decoupled from PZA action within this niche. However, contribution of other important oxidative antimicrobial factors such as nitric oxide (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Chan, Xing et al. 1992</xref>) and metabolic aldehydes (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Berry, Espich et al. 2023</xref>) cannot be excluded and warrant further investigation. In axenic culture, POA may also interact with endogenously-derived ROS. Previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is more susceptible to perturbations in endogenous ROS production relative to other mycobacteria (<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">Tyagi, Dharmaraja et al. 2015</xref>). In line with these findings, our study demonstrates that PZA-treated cells undergo sublethal oxidative damage even without exogenously supplied H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. However, the abundance of endogenous ROS alone is insufficient to drive bactericidal action of PZA. These observations indicate that the varying ROS levels in different environments likely contribute to the disparate action of PZA in laboratory culture versus the host environment which is in line with the role for peroxide stress in PZA susceptibility in murine infection models (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">Lien, Dinshaw et al. 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the highly reactive nature of <sup>•</sup>OH radicals, PZA-mediated enhanced susceptibility to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is likely to have pleiotropic effects on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> resulting in oxidative damage to lipids, nucleic acids and various central metabolites. In this study, we used protein carbonylation as a readout for cellular oxidative damage. While additional investigation is necessary to define the full extent of molecular interactions at play, the finding that PZA action is potentiated by the thiol oxidant diamide suggests thiol stress as a major mediator.</p>
<p>In the ongoing pursuit of improved anti-mycobacterial therapies, this study reveals new opportunities for potentiating PZA action. Given that immune impairment is both associated with progression of TB disease and in animal models of infection is associated with PZA treatment failure, it is of vital importance to identify means by which to drive PZA action independent of host immune status. Such approaches could include microbe-directed approaches that impair mycobacterial oxidative stress defense or disrupt thiol homeostasis, or could include host-directed approaches that bolster production of host-derived antimicrobial products such as reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species or other toxic molecules such as reactive aldehydes.</p>

<title>MIC and FIC determinations</title>
<p>Drug susceptibility was determined by measuring their optical densities at 600 nm in comparison to untreated controls. MIC assays were conducted by determining the minimum amount of drug that was required to inhibit 90% of the growth in treated cultures when compared to untreated controls. POA stocks were made in water and the pH was adjusted with NaOH to match the pH of the medium prior to its addition. Synergies between different combinations of antimicrobials were determined by conducting fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) experiments. The FIC experiments were carried out by setting up checkerboard assays with varying 2-fold concentrations of each antimycobacterial compound examined. Inhibition was scored in the FIC experiments based on the lowest amount of antimicrobial that was required to inhibit 90% of the growth in untreated cultures during concurrent exposure to a constant concentration of the other antimicrobial being tested. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was determined by calculating the sum of the measured FIC values for each compound at each point and then reporting the lowest value determined. All MIC and FIC assays were conducted in 7H9 complete medium with ADS (pH 5.8) at 37°C on a 100 rpm rotary shaker in triplicate.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated all cell culture incubations were conducted at 37°C in a humidified chamber containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. RAW 264.7 murine macrophage and THP-1 monocytic cell lines were generous gifts by Kaylee Schwertfeger (University of Minnesota). RAW 264.7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Minimal Essential Medium (DMEM) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% pen/strep solution at 37°C. THP-1 cells were maintained in ATCC formulated RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, 1% pen/strep solution, and 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, herein referred to as RPMI 1640 complete. RAW cells were seeded at a density of 2.0 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in 24 well plates in culture medium and allowed to adhere overnight. THP-1 cells were seeded separately at the same density as RAW 264.7 cells and differentiated for 3 days using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 20 nM). PMA was subsequently removed from THP-1 cells by washing cells thrice in Hank’s Buffered Salt Solution. THP-1 cells were allowed to rest for 24 hrs in RPMI 1640 complete. All cells were washed thrice using 1X Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (D-PBS) and incubated for a further 24 hr in appropriate culture medium without antibiotic. Designated cell plates were activated with mouse IFN-γ (5 ng/mL; Shenandoah Biotechnology Inc.) or human IFN-γ (5 ng/mL; Shenandoah Biotechnology Inc.) overnight.

<p>This study reports <bold>important</bold> advances in understanding how pyrazinamide, a first-line antibiotic for tuberculosis treatment, is effective in vivo. The experimental design and data provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence that the production of reactive oxygen species by host cells contributes to how pyrazinamide is more potent in the host than in culture conditions; however, additional experiments and controls would strengthen these conclusions. This work is of interest to the antibiotic drug development field.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a key drug in the anti-TB arsenal, yet despite over 50 years of clinical use, its precise mechanism of action remains unclear. This study offers valuable insights into the in vitro potentiating effect of PZA when used with exogenous oxidative agents. The authors suggest that oxidative stress, specifically thiol oxidation, may be a primary driver of PZA/POA's bactericidal activity. Although the work is substantial, conceptually innovative, and timely, the evidence supporting the authors' conclusions requires further investigation with additional controls and experiments to fully validate the proposed mechanism of action. Once revised, this work will undoubtedly be of significant interest to the TB drug discovery community and researchers focusing on mycobacterial diseases.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The authors have long-standing experience in the field of PZA mode of action, with several publications that have been highly relevant to the field. They are particularly well aware of the literature, and this is clearly visible in the introduction of the manuscript which is beautifully articulated. The biological question(s) and their hypotheses are also well-formulated in the introduction section.</p>
<p>The understanding of PZA mode of action is a long-lasting question in the TB community, therefore studies reporting well-conducted research that aims at deciphering the underlying mechanism responsible for PZA peculiar activity is always appreciated. Since PZA/POA are poorly active in conventional 7H9 media, but very potent in cellulo or in vivo; looking at host-mediated stress that can eventually lead to an increased vulnerability is extremely relevant. In that context, most of the work has been focused on host-cell endolysosomal pH but very little information is available on other stress. Thus, investigating the contribution of oxidative stress and ROS as specific host environments that might contribute to PZA/POA activity is overall novel and conceptually very interesting.</p>
<p>To address this question, the authors combine multiple approaches including conventional antimicrobial susceptibility profiling, CFU-based counting, and checkerboard assays to report the potentiating effect of PZA pre-treatment on hydrogen peroxide- and diamide-mediated antibacterial action. The use of multiple reference strains including Mtb H37Ra, Mtb H37Rv, M.bovis BCG, and M.bovis BCG::pncA is a great asset of the manuscript, even though they might have been more appropriately used to get further mechanistical insights on the proposed model of action. The findings are reported in 4 major figures that are clear and in an order that appears logical for the understanding of the story.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>Although the manuscript is conceptually very interesting and contains intriguing results, it sometimes fails to fully convince and some additional controls/experiments might help to better back up the authors' claims and really strengthen the study. Indeed, some conclusions seem premature therefore leading to some molecular assumptions regarding a potential mode of action that is not fully supported by the presented data.</p>
<p>
The rationale behind some of the experiments is not always clearly explained which makes difficult to follow the authors ideas, the biological hypothesis/model that they test, and therefore the overall scientific story.</p>
<p>The authors conclude their study by proposing a mechanism by which the active form of the drug POA acts in concert with exogenous ROS to promote cellular oxidative damage. This is tested within two models of macrophage infection where they propose that IFN-γ mediated ROS production is essential for PZA activity. Unfortunately, the in cellulo part presents some weaknesses and inconsistencies that the authors need to carefully address.</p>
<p>Finally, the in vitro experiments performed in this manuscript mainly report that PZA pre-treatment increases H2O2-mediated killing or inhibition. There is no direct evidence that clearly shows that oxidative stress drives the potent bactericidal activity of PZA. In these settings, the oxidative stress is always applied after PZA pre-treatment and is therefore likely displaying the major lethal effect.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors tested how ROS and PZA affected Mycobacterium survival to determine if ROS could have a role in the remarkable in vivo efficacy of PZA.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a well-written and clear manuscript convincingly demonstrating the synergy between PZA and reactive oxygen species in the inhibition of growth and survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript would benefit from a clear statement of the rationale for the protocols used to examine the synergy of PZA with ROS, the possible models their protocols could be testing, and then how their data supports or disproves the models being tested. The manuscript appears to propose, as stated in the title, that &quot;Oxidative stress drives potent bactericidal activity of pyrazinamide...&quot;. However their experimental design more likely tests the effect of PZA on ROS sensitivity. Indeed, by the last figure, the authors begin the present their data as PZA sensitizing the bacteria to ROS. More clarity on these possible models and the different interpretations of the data should be considered.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>The data provide important insight to expand our understanding of the in vivo efficacy of PZA in the treatment of tuberculosis.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive assessment of our manuscript. We agree that additional clarity on some key points in the manuscript will be valuable additions to this work. Both reviewers expressed a related concern regarding the basis for design and interpretation of our pyrazinamide ROS synergy experiments.</p>

<p>We agree that the data presented in the current version of the manuscript is incomplete in supporting our assertion that oxidative stress drives bactericidal activity of pyrazinamide. As both reviewers note, pretreatment of bacilli with pyrazinamide followed by challenge with ROS indicates that pyrazinamide enhances susceptibility to oxidative stress but does not address whether oxidative stress enhances susceptibility to pyrazinamide. Further, we neglected to provide information regarding why we chose to pretreat bacilli with pyrazinamide before ROS exposure. Over the course of our work, we had found that pyrazinoic acid, the active form of pyrazinamide, showed potent synergy with hydrogen peroxide.  In contrast to the time-dependent synergy that we observed between pyrazinamide and peroxide, synergy between pyrazinoic acid and peroxide did not require pretreatment. We will revise our manuscript to include results that address these key issues and we will carefully consider revising our interpretations accordingly.</p>
