<title>Abstract</title><p>The trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein mediates viral attachment facilitating cell entry. Most COVID-19 vaccines direct mammalian cells to express the Spike protein or deliver it directly via inoculation to engender a protective immune response. The trafficking and cellular tropism of the Spike protein <italic>in vivo</italic> and its impact on immune cells remains incompletely elucidated. In this study we inoculated mice intranasally, intravenously, and subcutaneously with fluorescently labeled recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Using flow cytometry and imaging techniques we analyzed its localization, immune cell tropism, and acute functional impact. Intranasal administration led to rapid lung alveolar macrophage uptake, pulmonary vascular leakage, and neutrophil recruitment and damage. When injected near the inguinal lymph node medullary, but not subcapsular macrophages, captured the protein, while scrotal injection recruited and fragmented neutrophils. Wide-spread endothelial and liver Kupffer cell uptake followed intravenous administration. Human peripheral blood cells B cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and myeloid dendritic cells all efficiently bound Spike protein. Exposure to the Spike protein enhanced neutrophil NETosis and augmented human macrophage TNF-α and IL-6 production. Human and murine immune cells employed C-type lectin receptors and Siglecs to help capture the Spike protein. This study highlights the potential toxicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein for mammalian cells and illustrates the central role for alveolar macrophage in pathogenic protein uptake.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2019 a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of an epidemic outbreak of an acute respiratory syndrome in Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 used the same cell entry receptor—angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)—as did SARS-CoV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein mediates cell entry and is a single-pass transmembrane proteins that forms homotrimers. It has a large N-terminal ectodomain exposed to the exterior, a transmembrane helix, and a short C-terminal tail located within the virus. Each Spike monomer contains two regions termed S1 and S2. In the assembled trimer the S1 regions contain the receptor binding domain while the S2 regions forms a flexible stalk, which mediates membrane fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The S1 region is divided into a N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain, the latter interacts with the target cell ACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Like other Coronavirus spike proteins SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is heavily N-linked glycosylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) and blocking N- and O-glycans dramatically reduced viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins is activated by host cell proteases that cleave the protein at the S1-S2 boundary and subsequently at the S2’ site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Because Spike proteins are located on the surface of the virus, they are a major antigen targeted by the host immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>).</p>
<p>During natural infection host immune cells encounter Spike proteins via several different avenues. First, by direct contact with Spike protein bearing viral particles released from infected cells. Second, although the SARS-CoV-2 virions assemble in intracellular compartments of infected cells, unincorporated Spike proteins can reach the plasma membrane. Infected cells expressing Spike proteins may bind to cellular receptors present on resident or recruited immune cells. Third, extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by virally infected cells can contain Spike proteins. Mass spectrometry and nanoscale flow cytometry demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein incorporation into EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Fourth, Spike proteins are preprocessed during viral assembly utilizing the furin protease cleavage site between the S1 and S2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). When the Spike protein adopts a fusion conformation the ACE2 receptor-binding domain separates from the membrane-bound S2 subunit. Soluble S1 subunits shed from infected cells or from the virions <italic>in vivo</italic> may bind to other cells via ACE2 or other binding partners. Intriguingly 60% of the plasma samples from patients with post-acute sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (PASC) had detectable levels of Spike protein using an ultrasensitive antigen capture assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Prolonged exposure to Spike protein has been suggested to be responsible for Long-COVID syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Humans also encounter SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein via vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Serious adverse events following vaccination are rare but include vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis; myocarditis and pericarditis; and a variety of autoimmune illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Due to waning effectiveness humans require repeated immunizations to maintain immunity and protection against potentially severe disease raising some concerns about the impact of repeated exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins.</p>
<p>To better understand the localization and trafficking of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein following administration and perhaps during natural infection we prepared a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike ectodomain stabilized in a prefusion conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). This variant (S-2P) contained two consecutive proline substitutions in the S2 subunit. This double-proline substitution (SARS-CoV-2 S-2P) has allowed the rapid determination of high-resolution cryo-EM structures. Fluorescently labeled SARS-CoV-2 Spike ectodomain, a D614G variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), a high mannose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), and de-glycosylated version were injected into mice to characterize uptake and identify human mononuclear cells that bound these proteins, and to perform functional studies. In some instances, we used viral like particles (VLPs) expressing the full-length Spike protein. Our results identified the <italic>in vivo</italic> cellular tropism of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins, delineated their human mononuclear cell targets, provided insights into their functional effects, thereby, helping afford a basis for understanding their impact on humans.</p>

<title>Preparation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins and VLPs expressing them</title>
<p>We purified a stabilized exodomain of the original SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) using media conditioned by transfected CHO-S or HEK293F cells. Because of higher yields most experiments used CHO-S derived protein. The strategy for producing the recombinant protein is shown (<bold><xref rid="fig1-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref></bold>). Based on its mobility on size exclusion chromatography the Spike proteins spontaneously formed trimers. Kifunensine treated cultures were used to generate a high mannose version, and PNGase F treated protein generated an N-glycan deficient version, and they will be referred to as such. The PNGase F treatment resulted in two distinct chromatography peaks that exhibited slightly different mobilities on SDS-PAGE. As discussed below we predominately used the preparation from fractions 9-11. The D614G mutant of the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein was also purified. Each of the recombinant proteins was subjected to two rounds of Triton X-114 extraction to remove any residual lipopolysaccharide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). The N-termini of the recombinant proteins were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488. In some experiments we used viral like particles (VLPs) that expressed the original Wuhan Spike protein. We produced the VLPs using HEK293T cells along with a plasmid encoding the human immunodeficiency GAG protein fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein expression vector. Mice received the Spike protein preparations or the SARS-CoV-2 VLPs by intranasal instillation, while only the Spike proteins were injected intravenously or subcutaneously.</p>

<title>Instillation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins and Spike protein expressing VLPs affects the lung cellular composition and architecture</title>
<p>At various time points after Spike protein or VLP nasal instillation lungs from mice were processed for confocal microscopy. A Siglec-F antibody identified alveolar macrophages (AMs) while CD169 (Siglec-1) immunostaining delineated a subset of large airway associated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Interstitial and inflammatory macrophages do not express Siglec-F. At 3 hours post instillation low magnification images of mouse lung sections revealed Spike protein (Trimer) uptake by Siglec-F positive cells. Due to the uneven distribution of the instilled Spike protein the Siglec-F positive cells in the lower portion of the image lack signal (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="fig1-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2A</xref></bold>). The Siglec-F positive macrophages located near the bronchial epithelium and in the nearby alveoli initially accumulated the labeled protein <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>)</bold>. Even at the 30-minute time point AMs had already accumulated it <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>)</bold>. Most of the macrophages that acquired the Spike proteins were Siglec-F positive, lacked CD169 <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>)</bold>, but were wheat germ agglutinin positive, a mucin marker <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>)</bold>. Repeating the experiment but substituting the Spike protein with VLPs expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein revealed a similar pattern of uptake by AMs, but with greater neutrophil recruitment and granulation compared to delta Env VLPs. <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="fig1-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2B</xref>, C)</bold>. Immunostaining with LYVE-1 and CD31 to identify the lymphatic and blood vessel endothelium, respectively, <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>)</bold> or with Podoplanin another lymphatic endothelial cell marker <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="fig1-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2D</xref>)</bold> showed the rapid accumulation of the Spike protein bearing VLPs in small and large lymphatic vessels. Within 3 hours of administration of either the VLPs <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>)</bold> or the Spike protein (data not shown) areas of alveolar collapse and lung damage were evident.</p>
<p>To assess the cellular response to Spike protein instillation and to delineate the cells that had acquired Spike protein <italic>in vivo</italic> we collected mouse lungs 18 hours post exposure to different SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein preparations. Saline instillation served as a control. Lung fragments were digested, and then pushed through a 40-micron cell strainer. Analysis of the collected cells by flow cytometry revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein increased the number of neutrophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells in the lung, but did not affect lymphocyte or eosinophil numbers <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>)</bold>. Due to the uneven distribution of the instilled protein and because of their rapid turnover the neutrophil numbers likely underestimate the local neutrophil recruitment. As the imaging experiments indicated AMs most avidly acquired the Spike protein, some interstitial macrophages also retained it, while only a low percentage of the lung neutrophils and dendritic cells were positive following isolation <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>)</bold>. Instillation of the glycan deficient Spike protein reduced the monocyte cellular infiltrate and decreased the % of alveolar macrophages that retained the protein. The high mannose Spike protein slightly increased the numbers of neutrophil and macrophages in the lung despite a lower uptake by alveolar and interstitial macrophages. Finally, the D614G mutation reduced the cellular infiltrate compared to the unmutated protein and had a slightly different cell binding profile as a greater percentage of monocytes, eosinophils, and dendritic cells retained it <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>)</bold>. We also tested whether the addition of human ACE2 affected the cellular uptake of the Spike protein following intranasal administration by comparing wild type and the human ACE2 transgenic mice. While we saw little difference by imaging, we did note some minor changes in the cellular uptake pattern, most notably an increase uptake by AM and decrease by interstitial macrophages <bold>(<xref rid="fig2-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>)</bold></p>

<title>Altered lung vascular permeability, neutrophil recruitment, and lung damage 3 hours post instillation of the Spike protein</title>
<p>The increase lung leukocytes following the Spike protein nasal instillation suggested that it may have altered the vascular permeability of the lung. To assess whether vasculature permeability changes had occurred, we intravenously injected Evans blue dye, which in the absence of a permeability defect remains confined to the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Prior to injecting the Evans blue, we instilled in the nasal cavity the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, the S1 subunit of the HCoV-HKU1 Spike protein, or a saline control. Inspection of the lungs from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein treated mice revealed a strong increase in Evan blue staining while the lungs from the S1 subunit HCoV-HKU1 treated mice had a minimal increase. Quantifying the Evans blue dye in collected lungs and liver confirmed the increase in vasculature permeability in the lungs of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein treated mice <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</bold> Next, we compared the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to the HCoV-HKU1 S1 subunit. The S1 subunit preparations were purified from transfected HEK 293 cells. The results of administrating the S1 subunit of HCoV-HKU1 Spike protein did not differ from the saline control while the S1 subunit from SARS-CoV-2 like the SARS-CoV-2 trimer increased the lung vascular permeability to Evans blue (<bold><xref rid="fig3-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</xref>)</bold>. We also tested whether the presence of hACE2 affected the response by using K18-hACE2 transgenic mice as the recipients. The presence of the K18-hACE2 transgene slightly increased the lung vasculature permeability upon SARS-CoV-2 trimer instillation <bold>(<xref rid="fig3-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B</xref>).</bold> Consistent with the increase in lung vascular permeability 3 hours post SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein instillation, Siglec-F positive lung macrophages bearing the Spike protein were surrounded by neutrophils and neutrophil fragments <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, C</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<p>Next, we investigated the potential impact of modifying the glycans displayed by the spike proteins on lung vasculature homeostasis and neutrophil recruitment. Imaging fixed lung tissue from mice instilled with saline, SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, glycan-deficient protein, high mannose protein, and the HCoV-HKU1 S1 subunit recombinant protein revealed enhanced neutrophil recruitment with each SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein preparation. We analyzed the neutrophil count in a 200 × 200 μm² area at six different locations. The surveyed areas of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein instilled mice had approximately a 6.5-fold higher neutrophil density compared to the saline-treated control mice. The high mannose version of the Spike protein recruited fewer neutrophils at the three-hour time point while the PNGase F treated version did not differ from the untreated trimer <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="fig3-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1C</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<title>Neutrophil recruitment and damage in the cremaster muscle following local protein injection, and in the liver following intravenous injection</title>
<p>An exteriorized cremaster muscle is commonly used to intravitally image mouse neutrophil transmigration and interstitial motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Although this model lacks Siglec F-positive macrophages, it is worth monitoring the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein on neutrophils recruited into an inflammatory site. Within 3 hours local IL-1β injection recruits bone marrow neutrophils and leads to their transmigration into the nearby tissue. Co-injecting fluorescently labeled Ly6G and Gp1bβ antibodies identified neutrophils and platelets, respectively. Local PBS injection and intermittent imaging over a 6-hour time frame revealed occasional blood neutrophil and numerous flowing platelets <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, Video 1)</bold>. Local intrascrotal injection of unlabeled SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein caused a modest recruitment of neutrophils at 4-6 hours post injection <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="fig4-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>, Video 1)</bold>. To better assess the long-term effect of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, we co-injected Il-1β and waited until the following day to image. Typically, at 24 hours post Il-1β the inflammatory response is resolving, and the interstitial neutrophil numbers are declining from their peak <bold>(Video 2)</bold>. In contrast, each of the Spike protein preparations adversely affected neutrophil motility and morphology. Numerous neutrophils and neutrophil fragments localized along the blood vessel walls and were scattered within the interstitium <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, Video 2)</bold>.

<p>We also assessed the impact of injecting the labeled SARS-CoV-2 protein into the blood on the liver sinusoids using intravital microscopy. Snapshots at three hours post infusion revealed Spike protein outlined liver sinusoid endothelial cells co-localized with the CD31 delineated sinusoid endothelial membranes. Kupffer cells identified by F4-80 immunostaining rapidly acquired large amounts of the infused Spike protein <bold>(<xref rid="fig4-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 2A</xref>, Video 3)</bold>. The sinusoids, normally devoid of neutrophils, contained many Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils. However, by 18 hours post infusion the amount of Spike protein outlining the sinusoids had declined as had the Kupffer cell associated material <bold>(<xref rid="fig4-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 2B</xref>)</bold>. The neutrophil infiltration had largely resolved suggesting that the inflammatory signals had declined. The origin of the white dots interspersed between the sinusoids is unknown, but they were not present at 3 hours post infusion despite identical imaging conditions. One possibility is that altered vascular permeability had allowed some labeled antibodies to leak into the liver parenchyma. To determine whether other endothelial beds also acquired intravenous administered Spike protein we examined the spleen, heart ventricle, and Peyer’s patches. At 3 hours post infusion endothelial cells at these three sites had acquired the labelled Spike proteins, most prominently in Peyer’s patches <bold>(<xref rid="fig4-s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 3A, B, C</xref>)</bold>. Finally, we intravitally imaged the inguinal lymph node at 3 and 18-hour after local injection. Typically, locally injected material rapidly enters nearby afferent lymphatics for delivery to the lymph node where subcapsular sinus macrophages first encounter it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). If it bypasses these macrophages lymph borne material flows into the lymph node medullary region, where medullary macrophages reside <bold>(<xref rid="fig4-s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 3D</xref>)</bold>. At both the 3-hour time point (data not shown) and at 18 hours subcapsular macrophages showed little interest in the Spike protein, but medullary macrophages avidly acquired it.

<title>Murine and human neutrophils NETosis following exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein</title>
<p>Live cell imaging of lung sections following intranasal instillation of the Spike protein revealed ongoing neutrophil damage and likely NETosis (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). Time-lapse images show several disrupted neutrophils near a Siglec-F positive AM along with Spike protein bound to a dying neutrophil. This observation along with the cremaster muscle imaging suggested direct neutrophil toxicity. Furthermore, a previous study had shown Spike protein induced neutrophil NETosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). To confirm that the Spike protein can trigger neutrophil NETosis and to compare different Spike protein preparations, we briefly exposed murine bone marrow neutrophils and assessed the % of cells undergoing cell death using a flow-based assay. Exposure to fMLP served as a positive control. The lowest concentration of Spike protein (0.1 µg) tested increased the number of dying neutrophils <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>)</bold>. Switching to human neutrophils purified from human peripheral blood, exposure to TNFα, LPS or PMA for 4 hours or overnight reduced their viability as expected. Addition of SARS-CoV-2 or the D614G mutant protein (1 µg/ml) decreased their viability at 4 hours and more dramatically upon overnight exposure. The high mannose versions of the Spike protein and D614G Spike had a slightly greater toxicity at 4 hours but had a similar impact in the overnight assay <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>)</bold>.

<title>Murine and human cells use Siglecs to help capture the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein</title>
<p>Since murine and human leukocytes lack significant ACE2 levels, the major entry receptor for SARS-CoV-1 and −2, they likely use other receptors to capture the Spike proteins. The strong co-localization with Siglec-F expressing murine AMs prompted an examination of the role of Siglec-F and other Siglecs in capturing the Spike proteins. Siglecs are transmembrane proteins that exhibit specificity for sialic acids attached to the terminal portions of cell-surface glycoproteins. Several viruses take advantage of sialic acid-Siglec interactions for cell targeting, spreading, and trans-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Initially, we established a bead assay to assess the binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins.

Flow cytometry analysis revealed strong binding of the Spike protein antibody, human ACE2, but not murine ACE2 as expected <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>)</bold>.

<p>Despite the poor binding to the recombinant human Siglecs in the bead assay, we elected to test them in context of a human cell by expressing them in HEK293 cells. We chose HEK293 cells as they exhibited little Spike protein binding. We established ACE2, Siglec5, Siglec-8, Siglec-5/8, ACE2/Siglec-5, and ACE2/Siglec-8 expressing cell lines <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>)</bold>. The ACE2 transfected cells behaved as anticipated binding the original Spike protein and even better the D614G version; and binding the S1 protein. The high mannose and glycan deficient Spike proteins bound poorly. In contrast to the bead assay both the Siglec-5 and the Siglec-8 expressing HEK293 cells bound the Spike protein, although less efficiently than did the ACE2 expressing cells. They bound the D614G version less well, and very weakly bound the S1 domain protein. The high mannose and glycan deficient Spike proteins exhibited little binding to the Siglec expressing cells. Co-expression of Siglec-5 and −8 did not improve binding, although the ACE2/Siglec co-expressing cells bound the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein slightly better than did ACE2 only cells. We also imaged the Siglec-5 expressing HEK293 with labeled protein <bold>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>)</bold>.

In contrast, we did observe significant increases in TNF-α and IL-6 secretion by the original SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein treated macrophages irrespective of whether it was produced in CHO or HEK293F cells. The spike protein produced in HEK293F is predicted to contain more complex carbohydrates than that expressed in CHO cells. While both preparations increased IL-6 and TNF-α production, the spike protein produced by HEK293F cell elicited more TNF-α and less IL-6 compared with the CHO produced spike protein. The spike protein produced in CHO cells treated with Kifunesine elicited a similar cytokine profile as did the spike protein produced in CHO cells in the absence of Kifunesine.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study analyzed the cell tropism of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and some of its variants using fluorescently labeled proteins, flow cytometry, and mice to assess <italic>in vivo</italic> binding. The intranasal administration of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to mice led to its rapid uptake by Siglec-F positive AMs and an increased the number of neutrophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells in the lung 18 hours after instillation. Modifying the carbohydrate content of the Spike protein or using a Spike protein with a D614G mutation slightly altered the cell recruitment pattern. The high mannose Spike protein purified from the Kifunensine treated CHO cells increased the number of lung macrophages at 18 hours despite a lower % of macrophages having retained it. As alveolar macrophages express the mannose receptor (MR, CD206), a member of the C-type lectin (CLEC) family, perhaps the high mannose Spike protein is more rapidly endocytosed and degraded accounting for a lower percentage of cells retaining it. This receptor binds high-mannose structures present on the surface of pathogens helping to neutralize them by phagocytic engulfment. Other cell types including immature dendritic cells (DCs), and endothelial cells in hepatic, splenic, lymphatic, and dermal microvasculature express the mannose receptor and would be expected to be targeted by the high mannose Spike protein. We confirmed Siglec-F as a capturing receptor, as it efficiently bound to the S1 domain, and the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Yet alveolar macrophages employ additional receptors to capture the Spike protein as they still accumulated the PNGase F treated Spike protein, which had lost binding to Siglec-F.</p>
<p>Arguing against a role for mSiglec-1, CD169<sup>+</sup> lung macrophages and CD169<sup>+</sup> subcapsular sinus macrophages failed to accumulate the Spike protein <italic>in vivo</italic>. The closest human paralog of mouse Siglec-F is hSiglec-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). While expressed on human eosinophils and mast cells, human AMs apparently lack it. In contrast, human AMs do express Siglec-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Along with its paired receptor, hSiglec-14, Siglec-5 can modulate innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). When tested in a bead binding assay, in contrast to Siglec-F, neither hSiglec-5 or −8 bound the recombinant Spike protein, yet their expression in a cellular context allowed binding. Additionally, recombinant hSiglec-5 partially inhibited the transduction of Spike protein bearing viral like particles into ACE2 expressing HEK293 cells. Evidently the recombinant protein binding assay we employed did not fully capture the properties of hSiglec-5 or hSiglec-8 in a cellular context. A recent study of human lungs revealed scant alveolar ACE2 expression, highlighting the importance of alternative Spike protein receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). <italic>Ex vivo</italic> infected human lungs and COVID-19 autopsy samples showed AMs positive for SARS-CoV-2 and single-cell transcriptomics revealed nonproductive virus uptake, and activation of inflammatory and anti-viral pathways. Another study which analyzed pulmonary cells from COVID-19 patients found that myeloid cell C-type lectin engagement induced a robust proinflammatory responses that correlated with COVID-19 severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). The robust Spike binding to AMs and their potential roles in COVID-19 lung infection warrants a further exploration of their Spike protein binding partners.</p>
<p>The intranasal administration of the Spike protein resulted in an increase in lung vascular permeability and local tissue damage. While the mechanisms are unknown, infectious agents that target AMs can trigger the secretion of factors that disrupt the integrity of the pulmonary microvascular cell barrier. For example, Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infected AMs trigger transcriptional changes in genes in co-cultured microvascular endothelial cells that reduce vascular integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Lung endothelial cells may also be directly targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Spike protein/ACE2 interactions reduce endothelial cell ACE2 expression, which can alter vascular permeability. Yet, the low affinity of mouse ACE2 for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein presumably precludes this mechanism in this study. Also arguing against a role for ACE2 in our model, the responses to intranasal Spike protein in human ACE2 transgenic mice resembled those of wild type mice. The Spike protein RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic Acid) motif can also bind α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrins present on endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). This affects VE-cadherin function and vascular integrity. However, we did not detect any Spike protein on the pulmonary blood vessels following intranasal administration although a low level of binding may have escaped visualization. In sum, the rapid and intense uptake of Spike protein by AMs supports a role for these cells in the localized neutrophil recruitment, nearby tissue damage, and increased vascular permeability that follows its intranasal administration.</p>
<p>The intravenous administration of the Spike protein, led to its accumulation by Kupffer cells in the mouse liver. This uptake was accompanied by a transitory increase in liver sinusoid neutrophils. Human Kupffer cells express LSECtin (liver Siglec and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin, CLEC4G) a C-type lectin receptor encoded within the L-SIGN/DC-SIGN/CD23 gene cluster. LSECtin acts as a pathogen attachment factor for Ebola virus and the SARS coronaviruses suggesting that it contributed to the Kupffer cell uptake we noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). The liver sinusoid endothelial cells also avidly accumulated the Spike protein. These cells express another C-type lectin receptor L-SIGN (CD209L/CLEC4M), which has been shown to interact in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner with high-mannose–type N-glycans on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Based on our mouse studies, blood borne SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins, viral particles, or exosomes bearing the Spike protein are likely to accumulate in the liver during severe or prolonged COVID-19 infection.</p>
<p>Local injection of the Spike protein in the region of the cremaster muscle recruited low numbers of neutrophils, but co-administration with IL-1β caused severe neutrophil damage. The Spike protein also proved toxic to purified mouse and human neutrophils cultured <italic>ex vivo</italic> in its presence. Most human neutrophils bound the recombinant Spike protein. The presence of cations in the binding buffer substantially enhanced the binding suggesting that a cation dependent receptor accounted for a significant portion of the binding. While the high mannose version bound neutrophils less well, in the NETosis assay it produced a similar level of neutrophil cell death. Neutrophils likely employ several different receptors to capture the Spike protein. Human neutrophils express several C-type lectin receptors including CLEC5A, which has been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 triggered neutrophil NETosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). They also express Siglec-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), which bound the Spike protein when expressed in HEK293 cells.</p>
<p>We also assessed the binding of various Spike protein preparations to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and their impact on cytokine production by M0, M1, and M2 human monocyte derived macrophages. Monocytes, neutrophils, and B cells bound the full-length trimer best, while T and NK cells exhibited little binding. All the cellar subsets bound more of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in the presence of cations arguing for a major role for cation dependent receptors. The high mannose Spike protein bound less well to all tested cell types and its binding exhibited the highest cation dependence. Among the eight cytokines measured in the supernatants conditioned by human monocyte derived macrophages treated with Spike proteins only TNF-α and IL-6 were elevated compared to untreated or HKU1 S1 treated cells. We found little or no change in IL-1β levels suggesting that the tested Spike protein preparations did not activate inflammasomes. Nor did we find any material difference between recombinant Spike protein prepared from HEK293F and CHO cells. Further studies are needed to identify the monocyte, neutrophil, and B cell receptors that account for the Spike protein binding and additional functional studies to assess the consequences of that binding.</p>
<p>Several conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, instilled SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and VLPs bearing the Spike protein rapidly accumulated on mouse AMs suggesting a similar uptake by human alveolar macrophages during an active SARS-CoV-2 infection. In mice, the nasal instillation of the Spike protein is accompanied by lung leukocyte infiltration. Second, murine alveolar macrophages likely use Siglec-F as a capturing receptor although other receptors contribute. Third, following nasal instillation of the Spike protein, the integrity of the pulmonary vasculature weakens. Fourth, resident and recruited neutrophils suffer, either directly targeted by the Spike protein, or secondarily due to the inflammatory response. A similar scenario would be expected during SARS-CoV-2 infection, following direct instillation of the Spike protein in the upper airway of humans, or following an intranasal vaccine that directs the synthesis of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein or fragments. Fifth, blood monocytes, B cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells efficiently bind the Spike protein, while only a low percentage of CD8 T cells and even fewer CD4 T cells do. Spike protein binding to human monocyte derived macrophages increases the TNF-α and IL-6 secretion. Sixth, altering the glycan composition of the Spike and the D614G mutation had surprisingly little impact on the initial inflammatory response. Seventh, viral particles and soluble Spike protein that spills into the blood during SARS-CoV-2 infection or following immunization will likely be cleared by liver Kupffer cells but will also target blood vessel endothelial cells in multiple organs. Finally, injection of the Spike protein as occurs following vaccination rapidly delivers it to the draining lymph node via afferent lymphatics. Surprisingly, lymph node medullary macrophages, which largely serve a degradative function, preferentially uptake the Spike protein. Designing a less toxic Spike protein immunogen that targets subcapsular sinus macrophages might better deliver the immunogen to B cells, thereby eliciting a more efficacious antibody response.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the impact of intranasal instillation of SARS CoV2 spike protein in mouse models of lung inflammation. The authors conclude that the spike protein can interact with macrophages through carbohydrate recognition and can induce recruitment and NETosis of neutrophils, contributing to lung inflammation. They also use the cremaster muscle model to investigate effect of the spike proteins on neutrophil dynamics and death using intravital microscopy. Given that mucosal vaccines using SARS CoV2 spike variants could be envisioned as desirable, the observation that spike can induce lung/mucosal inflammation even without an adjuvant is <bold>important</bold>. Despite limitations of some loose terminology and some weak controls, the key observations are <bold>solid</bold> and demand further attention given the importance of the antigen.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Park et. al. examines the interaction of macrophages with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and subsequent inflammatory reactions. The authors demonstrate that following intranasal delivery of spike it rapidly accumulates in alveolar macrophages. Inflammation associated with internalized spike recruits neutrophils to the lung, where they undergo a cell death process consistent with NETosis. The authors demonstrate that modifications spike to contain high mannose reduces uptake of spike protein and limits the inflammation induced. This finding could have implications for vaccine development, as vaccines containing modified spike could be safer and better tolerated.</p>
<p>The authors use a number of different techniques, including in vivo modeling, imaging, human and murine systems to interrogate their hypotheses. These systems provide robust supporting information for their conclusions. There are two key aspects from the current manuscript which would add key evidence. The authors suggest that neutrophils exposed to spike protein undergo a process of NETosis. To confirm this hypothesis inhibitors of NETosis should be used to demonstrate that the cell death is prevented. Additionally, vaccination of a murine model with the modified spike protein would add additional support to the conclusion that modified spike protein would be less inflammatory while maintaining its utility as a vaccine antigen.</p>

<p>The study focuses on in vivo and in vitro cellular responses intranasal instillation of glycoforms and mutants of SARS-CoV2 spike trimer or spike bearing VLP in mice. Collectively, the experiments suggest that SARS-CoV2 spike has pro-inflammatory roles through increase M1 macrophage associated cytokines and induction of neutrophil netosis/necrosis, a proinflammatory cell death pathway. These effects seem largely independent of hACE2 interaction and partly depend upon interactions with SIGLECs on macrophages and neutrophils. A strength of the study is that a number sophisticated methods are used, including intravital microscopy in the cramaster and liver as well as acute lung slice models, to look at uptake of the spike proteins and immune cell dynamics. The weakness is that some of the reagents maybe contaminated with uncharacterized glycoforms and some important controls, such as control spike protein and control VLP are unevenly applied or not included. The authors have revised the manuscript through some improvements in the writing, but the survey nature and suggestive level of evidence is still a weakness. The study calls attention to sources of proinflammatory activity in the SARS CoV2 spike that may involve some carbohydrate interactions.</p>

<p>‐ Preparation of spike proteins and VLPs. Although Triton‐X114 extraction was done to remove endotoxin from the recombinant spike protein preparations, its removal efficiency depends on the levels of endotoxin in the samples. Therefore, the residual endotoxin levels in each of the test samples and batches should be measured. Even very low but varying levels of residual endotoxin would substantially impact the reported results, as they create inconsistent data that are not interpretable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Certainly, endotoxin contamination in instilled materials is always an issue. Established protocols for inducing acute inflammatory responses using endotoxin outline specific ranges of endotoxin levels in the instillation materials. To induce acute lung inflammation in mice at least 2 µg of endotoxin must be instilled. We have endeavored to reduce the possibility of endotoxin contamination in our recombinant proteins by using a mammalian expression system; careful aseptic culture and protein purification techniques; and a final Triton-X114 partitioning protocol. We assessed the possibility of endotoxin contamination using the Pierce™ Chromogenic Endotoxin Quant Kit, which is based on the amebocyte lysate assay. Our analysis revealed that the endotoxin level in the purified recombinant protein preparation is below 1.0 EU/ml, which closely aligns with the levels specified for recombinant proteins. An endotoxin concentration of 1.0 EU/ml is equivalent to approximately 0.1 ng/ml. Throughout all mouse nasal instillation experiments, the total volume of recombinant protein administered did not exceed 6 µl. The amount of contaminant endotoxin instilled did not exceed 1 pg (50 µl of 0.02 ng/ml of endotoxin). Consequently, we can confirm that the extent of endotoxin contamination is at trace levels. Moreover, our study reveals multiple results indicating that the level of endotoxin contamination in the recombinant protein was inadequate to independently induce neutrophil recruitment in the cremaster muscle, lymph nodes, and liver. For further insights, refer to Figure 5.</p>

<p>‐ Doses of spike and VLPs: The amount of spike protein incorporated into HIV Gag‐based VLPs should be determined and compared to that found in the native SARS‐CoV‐2 virus particles. This should provide more physiologic doses (or dose ranges/titration) of spike than the arbitrary doses (3 ug or 5 ug) used in the mouse experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To visualize the acquisition of spike protein and track cells that have acquired the spike protein, we conducted a series of tests and optimizations using different concentrations of Alexa 488 labeled spike protein, ranging from 0.5 to 5 µg. During the processing of lung tissue for microscopic imaging, it was of utmost importance to preserve the integrity of the labeled spike protein in the tissue samples. We determined that instillation of 3 µg of Alexa 488 labeled spike protein yielded the optimal signal strength across the lung sections. Notably, in many mouse models employing intra-nasal instillation protocols for SARS-CoV2 spike protein or RBD domain-only recombinant proteins, a dosage of approximately 3 µg or higher were commonly used. Regarding the titer of spike-incorporated VLPs, it is important to highlight that we did not directly compare the quantity of spike protein present in NL4.3 VLPs to that of the naïve SARS-CoV-2 virus. HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses typically carry around 70 gp120 spikes and 30 spikes, respectively.
We estimated that SARS-CoV-2 spike-incorporated NL4.3 VLPs may display twice the number of spikes compared to naïve SARS-CoV-2. Notably, our measurements of SARS-CoV-2 spike on NL4.3 VLPs demonstrated similar behavior to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of specific binding to ACE2-expressing 293T cells, indicating their functional similarity in this context.</p>

<p>‐ The PNGase F‐treated protein was not studied in Fig 1. In Fig 2, glycan‐removal by PNGaseF has little effects on cell uptake and cell recruitment in the lung. If binding to one of the Siglec lectins is a critical initial step, experiments should be designed to evaluate this aspect of the spike‐cell interaction in a greater depth.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer states results with the PNGase F-treated protein were not shown in Fig. 1 although we showed results in Figs. 2 &amp; 3. See discussion below about our preparation of the PNGase F-treated protein. Perhaps because we elected to use a purified fraction that retained ACE2 binding, the protein we used likely retained some complex glycans. As the reviewer notes the PNGase F treated protein had similar overall cellular recruitment and uptake profiles compared to the untreated spike protein. The PNGase Ftreated fraction we used no longer bound Siglec-F in the flow-based assay, shown in Fig. 7. This argues that the initial uptake and cellular recruitment following intranasal instillation of the Spike protein did not depend upon the engagement of Siglec-F. While Siglec-F on the murine alveolar macrophage can likely efficiently capture the spike proteins other cellular receptors contribute and the overall impact of the spike protein on alveolar macrophages likely reflects its engagement of multiple receptors.</p>

<p>To obtain the de-glycosylated form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we employed PNGase F enzymatic digestion to remove glycans. Subsequently, the spike protein was purified using a size exclusion column. During this purification process, the PNGase F-treated spike protein segregated into two distinct fractions, specifically fraction 6 to 8 and fraction 9 to 11 (see revised Figure 1- figure supplement 1).</p>

<p>The Coomassie blue staining of an SDS-PAGE gel revealed that fractions 6 to 8 likely underwent a more pronounced de-glycosylation by PNGase F compared to fractions 9 to 11. Additionally, during the size column purification, we noticed that fraction 6 to 8 exhibited a faster mobility than the untreated spike protein, implying a potentially substantial modification of the protein's conformation. To probe the functional characteristics of the de-glycosylated spike protein in fraction 6 to 8, we conducted binding tests with human ACE2. Strikingly, the spike protein in fraction 6 to 8 completely lost its binding affinity to ACE2, indicating a loss of its ACE2-binding capability. Conversely, the protein in fraction 9 to 11 showed partial de-glycosylation but still retained its original functionality to bind to ACE2 and its antibody.</p>

<p>Based on these results, we concluded that fraction 9 to 11 would be the most suitable choice for further studies as the de-glycosylated spike protein, considering its retained functional properties relevant for ligating ACE2 and antibody motifs yet had lost Siglec-F binding. In the revised manuscript we have describe in more detail the purification of the PNGase F treated Trimer and its functional assessment.</p>

<p>‐ Increases in macrophages and alveolar macrophages by Kifunensine Tx spike in Fig 2A suggest effects that are not related to Siglec lectins. These effects are not seen with the wild type or D614 spike trimers, so the relevance of high‐ mannose spike is unclear. On the other hand, there were clear differences between Wuhan and D614 trimers seen in Fig 2A and 2B, but there was no verification to ascertain whether these differences were indeed due to strain differences and not due to batch‐to‐batch variability of the recombinant protein production. The overall glycan contents of the Wuhan and D614 spike protein samples should be measured. If Siglec interaction is the main interest in this study, the terminal sialic acid contents should be determined and compared to those in the corresponding strains in the context of native
SARS‐CoV‐2 virions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our initial observation that Siglec-F positive alveolar macrophages (AMs) avidly acquired spike proteins followed by a rapid leukocyte recruitment provided the rational for us to examine the impact of modifying the glycosylation pattern on the spike protein (de-glycosylated and spike variants) on their binding tropism and their cellular recruitment profiles in the lung.  In this context, we examined the influence of several glycan modification on spike proteins, hypothesizing that these modifications would alter the acquisition of the spike protein by mouse AMs compared to the wild-type trimer. While we did not conduct an indepth analysis of the glycan composition and terminal sialic acid contents of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins we used we did verify that the different proteins behaved as expected. Most of the biochemical studies were performed in Jim Arthos’ laboratory, which has a long interest in the glycosylation of the HIV envelope protein. On SDS-PAGE the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein purified from the Kifunesine treated CHO cells exhibited a 12 kDa reduction. It bound much better to L-Sign, DC-Sign, and maltose binding lectin, and poorly to Siglec-F. In the cellular studies it bound less well to most of the cellular subsets examined including murine alveolar macrophages. In studies with human blood leukocytes, it relied on cations for binding. However, it retained its toxicity directed at mouse and human neutrophils and it elicited a similar cytokine profile when added to human macrophages. The D614G mutation increased the spike protein binding to P-Selectin, CD163, and snowdrop lectin (mannose binding) suggesting that the mutation  had altered the glycan content of the protein. We used the D614G spike protein in a limited number of experiments as it behaved like the wild-type protein except for a slightly altered cellular retention pattern 18 hrs after intranasal instillation. In the revised manuscript we have included its binding to peripheral blood leukocytes. The D614G mutation conferred stronger binding to human monocytes than the original Spike protein. As discussed above, we recovered two fractions following the PNGase F treatment, one with a 40 kDa reduction on SDS-PAGE and the other a 60 kDa decrease and we chose to evaluate the fraction with a 40 kDa reduction in subsequent experiments. Consistent with a loss of N-linked glycans the PNGase F treatment reduced the binding to the lectin PHA, which recognizes complex carbohydrates, and it resulted in a sharp reduction in Siglec-F binding. The lower molecular weight fraction recovered after PNGase F treatment no longer bound ACE2. While our studies showed that alveolar macrophages likely employ Siglec-F as a capturing receptor they possess other receptors that also can capture the spike protein. The downstream consequences of engaging SiglecF and other Siglecs by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein will require additional studies.</p>
<p>While acknowledging the possibility of some batch-batch variation in recombinant protein preparation, we don’t think this was a major issue. We have noted some batch-batch variations in yield- efficiency, however the purified proteins consistently gave similar results in the various experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>‐ Fig 3: The same concern described above applies to the hCoV‐HKU1 spike protein. In Panel D, the PNGase and Kifunensine treatment did not appear to abrogate the neutrophil recruitment. Panel A did not include PNGase and Kif Tx spike proteins. Quantification of images in panel D is missing and should be done on many randomly selected areas.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We analyzed the neutrophil count of images in panel D and the results are presented. (Figure 3-figure supplement 1C). The Kifunensine treatment reduced the neutrophil recruitment at 3 hours, while the PNGase F treated Spike protein recruited as well or slightly more neutrophils. The hCoV-HKU1 S1 domain did not differ much from the saline control.</p>

<p>‐ Fig 4: Kifunensine Tx spike caused more increase in neutrophil damage after intrascrotal injections.
PNGase Tx spike was not tested. Connection between Siglec‐spike binding and neutrophil recruitment/damage is lacking.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Exteriorized cremaster muscle imaging functions as a model system for monitoring neutrophil behavior recruited by spike proteins within the local tissue, distinct from Siglec F-positive alveolar macrophages residing in lung tissue. Hence, our primary focus was not on investigating the Siglec/Spike protein interaction. Consequently, we did not utilize PNGase F-treated spike protein in these experiments. To clarify this issue, we added a sentence in main text ‘Although this model lacks Siglec F-positive macrophages, it is worth monitoring the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein on neutrophils recruited in the inflammatory local tissue.’</p>

<p>‐ Fig 5. Neutrophil injury was also seen after inhalation (intranasal) of spike protein in mice and in vitro with human neutrophils. Panel B shows no titrating effects of spike (from 0.1 to 2) on Netosis of murine neutrophils. Panel C: Netosis was seen with human neutrophils at 1 but not 0.1. Is this species difference important?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Given the observation of neutrophil NETosis in the mouse imaging experiment, our objective was to characterize the direct impact of the spike protein on human and murine neutrophils. The origins of the neutrophils are different as the murine neutrophils were purified from mouse bone marrow while the human neutrophils were purified from human blood. Both purification protocols led to greater than 98% neutrophils.  However, the murine neutrophils contain many more immature cells (50-60%) because the bone marrow served as their source. Furthermore, the murine neutrophils are from 6–8-week-old mice while the human neutrophils are from 30-50 year-old humans.  More work would be needed to sort out whether there is any difference between human and mouse neutrophils in their propensity to undergo netosis in response to Spike protein.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>‐ Kifunensine Tx again did not cause any reduction, indicating the lack of involvement of sialic acid. How was this related to Siglec participation directly or indirectly? There was no quantification for Panel D.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not think that Siglecs play a role in the induction of neutrophil netosis as the Spike proteins lacking Siglec interactions induced similar levels of netosis. Likely other neutrophil receptors are important. As noted in the text,</p>
<p>&quot;human neutrophils express several C-type lectin receptors including CLEC5A, which has been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 triggered neutrophil NETosis.&quot; Our goal with the data in Panel D was to visualize human neutrophil NETosis on trimer-bearing A549 cells we relied on the flow cytometry assays for quantification.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>‐ The rationale for testing cation dependence is unclear and should be described. What is the significance of &quot;cations enhanced leukocyte binding particularly so with the high mannose protein&quot;? Are there cationdependent receptors for spike independent of glycans and huACE‐2? If so, how is this relevant to the main topic of this paper?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is well known that many glycan bindings by C-type lectins are calcium-dependent, involving specific amino acid residues that coordinate with calcium ions and bind to the hydroxyl groups of sugars. As discussed in our previous draft, the C-type lectin receptor L-SIGN has been suggested as a calciumdependent receptor for SARS-CoV-2, specifically interacting with high-mannose-type N-glycans on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Therefore, it was worthwhile to investigate the calcium-dependent manner of spike protein binding to various types of immune cells. We added some data to this figure.  It now includes the binding profile of the D614G protein. In addition, we corrected the binding data by subtracting the fluorescent signal from the unstained control cells.</p>

<p>‐ Fig 7: human Siglec 5 and 8 were studied in comparison with mouse Siglec F. Recombinant protein data are not congruent with transfected 293 cell data. Panel A, the best binding to hSiglec 5 and 8 are the PNGase F Tx spike protein; how to interpret these data? Panel B: only the WT and D614G spike proteins binding to Siglec 5 and 8 on transfected cells. It made sense that kif Tx (high‐mannose) and PNGaseF Tx
(no glycan) spike would not bind to the Siglecs, but they did not bind to ACE2 either, indicative of nonfunctional spike proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We discussed this as follows: ‘The closest human paralog of mouse Siglec-F is hSiglec-8 (reference 40). While expressed on human eosinophils and mast cells, human AMs apparently lack it. In contrast, human AMs do express Siglec-5 (reference 37). Along with its paired receptor, hSiglec-14, Siglec-5 can modulate innate immune responses (reference 41). When tested in a bead binding assay, in contrast to Siglec-F, neither hSiglec-5 or -8 bound the recombinant spike protein, yet their expression in a cellular context allowed binding. The in vitro bead binding assay we established demonstrated the specific binding of the bait molecule to target molecules. However, it does have limitations in replicating the complexities of the actual cellular environment. As discussed previously the PNGase Tx fraction we used in these experiments retained ACE2 binding, but loss binding to Siglec-F in the bead assay.  In a biacore assay, not shown, the PNGase Tx fraction bound L-Sign and DC-Sign better than the untreated trimer, and it retained human ACE2 binding although it bound less well than wild type-trimer. Why the PNGase Tx fractions bound poorly to the human ACE2 transfected HEK293 cells is unclear. A higher density of recombinant ACE2 on the beads compared to that expressed on the surface of HEK293 may explain the difference. Alternatively in the bead assay we used a recombinant human ACE2-Fc fragment fusion protein purified from HEK293 cells, while in the transfection assay, we expressed human full length ACE2. The biacore, the bead binding, and the functional assays we performed all suggest that we had used intact recombinant proteins.</p>

<p>‐ Fig 8: This last set of experiment was to measure cytokine release by different types of macrophage cultures treated with spike from different cells with vs without Kifunensine Tx. The connection of these experiments to the rest is tenuous and is not explained. This is one of the examples where bits of data are presented without tying them together.</p>

<p>Dysregulated cytokine production significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 infection. Since we had observed strong binding of the spike protein to human monocytes and murine alveolar macrophages, we tested whether the spike protein altered cytokine production by human monocyte-derived macrophages. Depending on the culture conditions human monocytes can be differentiated M0, M1, or M2 phenotypes. Each type of macrophage responds differently to stimulants, often leading to distinct patterns of cytokine secretion. These patterns offer valuable insights into the immune response. The cytokine profiling conducted in this study enhances our understanding of how distinct macrophage types react to the spike protein.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>‐ The authors may want to refer to &quot;intranasal instillation&quot; to distinguish it from inhalation of an aerosolised liquid. How was the dose of the spike protein selected? There is some dose information in different settings, but usually between 0.1‐1 µg/ml or 0.1 µg‐5 µg range for in vivo injection, but the rationale for these ranges should be discussed. Is this mimicking a real situation during infections or a condition that might be used for vaccines?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While inhalation of aerosolized liquid closely mimics the natural route of human exposure to respiratory infectious materials, intranasal instillation with a liquid inoculum remains a widely accepted standard approach for virus or vaccine inoculation across various laboratory species. To clearly define our mouse model, we are changing the term 'inhalation' to 'instillation'. We previously answered to Reviewer #2 as following: To visualize the acquisition of spike protein and track cells that have acquired the spike protein, we conducted a series of tests and optimizations using different concentrations of Alexa Fluor 488 labeled spike protein, ranging from 0.5 to 5 µg. During the processing of lung tissue for microscopic imaging, it was of utmost importance to preserve the integrity of the labeled spike protein on the tissue samples. Through our investigations, we determined that an instillation of 3 µg of Alexa Fluor 488 labeled spike protein yielded the most optimal signal strength across the lung sections. Notably, in many mouse models employing intra-nasal instillation protocols for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or RBD domain-only recombinant proteins, a dosage of approximately 3 µg or higher was commonly used. Hence, based on these references and our preliminary studies, we selected 3 µg as the optimal concentration of instilled spike protein per mouse.</p>

<p>‐ Controls are not evenly applied. In some cases, the control for the large and complex SARS‐CoV2 spiker trimer is PBS. This seems insufficient to control against effects of injecting such complex proteins that can undergo significant conformational changes after uptake by a cell. In some cases, human coronavirus spike proteins from different viruses are used, but not much is said about these proteins and the different glycoforms are not explored. Are these prepared in the same way and do they have similar glycoforms.
For example, if the Siglecs bind sialic acid on N‐linked glycans, then why do the purified Siglecs or Siglecs expressed in cells not bind the HKU‐1 spike, which would have such sialic acids if expressed in the same way as the CoV2 spike?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have taken careful consideration to select an appropriate control material for these experiments. Initially, we opted to employ Saline or PBS for intranasal instillation as a vehicle control, a choice aligned with the approach taken in numerous previous studies involving lung inflammation mouse models. However, as the reviewer pointed out, we share the concern for achieving more meaningful and comparable control materials, particularly considering the size and complexity of the recombinant protein. In accordance with this perspective, we introduced glycan-modified spike proteins and the HCoV-HKU1 S1 subunit. Figure 3 illustrates our comprehensive evaluation of various spike proteins in terms of their impact on neutrophil recruitment. The diversity of sialic acid structures observed on recombinant proteins expressed within the same cell emerges from the intricate interplay of multiple factors within the cellular glycosylation machinery. This complex enzymatic process empowers cells to finely modulate glycan structures and sialic acid patterns, tailoring them to suit the diverse biological functions of distinct proteins. Despite structural similarities between the HCoV-HKU1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, their glycan modifications vary, thereby leading to distinct binding properties with various Siglec subtypes. All recombinant proteins used in this study except for the S1 subunits were generated within our laboratory. These include the wild-type spike protein, the D614G Spike protein, the Kifunensine-treated high mannose spike proteins, and the PNGase F-treated deglycosylated spike proteins. All the proteins were produced using the same protocol using CHO cells or on occasion HEK293F cells. We have indicated in the manuscript where we used HEK293F cells for the protein production otherwise they were produced in CHO cells.</p>

<p>‐ Figure 1 F‐I, there should be a control for VLP without SARS‐CoV2 spike as the VLP will contain other components that may be active in the system.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We tested the delta Env VLP for alveolar macrophage acquisition and neutrophil recruitment. We found a similar alveolar macrophage acquisition of the VLPs, but significantly less neutrophil recruitment compared to the free Spike protein. Since the uptake pattern with the VLPs matched that of the spike protein we did not consider adding a non-spike bearing VLP as a control. The rapid VLPs clearance into the lymphatics shortly after instillation may account for the reduced neutrophil recruitment following their instillation  (Figure 1 figure supplement 2B, C).</p>

<p>‐ In Figure 1H, that do they mean by autofluorescence? Is this the cyan signal?</p>
<p>Is the green signal also autofluorescence as this is identified as the VLP?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate reviewer pointing out the typo regarding autofluorescence in the figure image. To provide clarity regarding the background in all lung section images, we have included additional supplemental data. During the fixation process of lung tissue, various endogenous elements in the tissue sample contribute to autofluorescence when exposed to lasers in the confocal microscope. Specifically, collagen and elastin present in the lung vasculature, including airways and blood vessels, are dominant structures that generate autofluorescence. To address this issue, we have implemented optimizations to distinguish between real signals and the noise caused by autofluorescence. We inadvertently failed to indicate the source of the strong cyan signal. The signal is due to Evans Blue dye delineating lung airway structures, which contain collagen and elastin—known binding materials for Evans Blue dye. This explains the strong fluorescence signals observed in the airways. We conjugated the recombinant spike protein with Alexa Fluor 488, and viral-like particles (VLPs) were visualized with gag-GFP. (Figure 1 figure supplement 2A, D)</p>

<p>‐ The control for SARS‐CoV2 spike trimer is PBS, but how can the authors distinguish patterns specific to the spike trimer from any other protein delivered by intranasal instillation. Could they use another channel with a control glycoprotein to determine if there is anything unique about the pattern for spike trimer?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Alveolar macrophages employ numerous receptors to capture glycoproteins that have mannose, Nacetylglucosamine, or glucose exposed. Galactose-terminal glycoproteins are typically not bound. We do not think that the Spike protein is unique in its propensity to target alveolar macrophages.</p>

<p>‐ What is the parameter measured in Figure S2B?</p>

<p>‐ The Spike trimer with high mannose oligosaccharides may gain binding to the mannose receptor. It may be helpful to state the distribution of this receptor and comment is it could be responsible for this having the largest effect size for some cell types.</p>

<p>We agree that the spike trimer with high mannose should target cells bearing the mannose receptor. We have modified the discussion to address this point and have mentioned some of the cell types likely to bind the high mannose bearing spike protein.</p>

<p>‐ A key experiment is the Evans Blue measure of lung injury in Figure 3A. A control with the HKU‐1 spike is also performed, but more details on the matching of this proteins production to the SARS‐CoV2 spike trimer and the quantification of these comparative result should be provided. To show that the SARSCoV2 spike trimer can cause tissue injury on its own seems like a very important result, but the impact is currently reduced by the inconsistent application of controls and quantification of key results.
Furthermore, if these results can be repeated in the B6 and B6 K18‐hACE2 mouse model it might further increase the impact by demonstrating whether or not hACE2 contributes to this effect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We repeated the lung permeability assay using the S1 subunit from the original SARS-CoV-2 and the S1 subunit from HCoV-HKU1. Both proteins were made by the same company using a similar expression system and purification protocol. Consistent with our original data, the instillation of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit led to an increase in lung vasculature permeability, whereas the HCoV-HKU-1 S1 subunit had a minimal impact. (Figure 3 figure supplement 1A). This experiment suggests that it the S1 subunit that leads to the increase in vascular permeability. To address the contribution of hACE2 in this phenomenon, we conducted a lung permeability assay using K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. The K18-hACE2 transgenic mice exhibited a slight increase in lung vasculature permeability upon SARS-CoV-2 trimer instillation compared to the non-transgenic mice. This suggests that the hACE2-Spike protein interaction may contribute to an increase in lung vascular permeability during SARS-CoV-2 lung infection (Figure 3 figure supplement 1B).</p>

<p>‐ For Figure 4A, could they provide quantification. The neutrophil extravasation with Trimer appears quite robust, but the authors seem to down‐play this and it's not clear without quantification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this issue, we analyzed and graphed the neutrophil numbers in each image. Injection of the trimer along with IL-1β significantly increased neutrophil infiltration. (Figure 4 figure supplement 1)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>‐ In Figure 4B, there are no neutrophils at all in the BSA condition. Is this correct? Intravascular neutrophils were detected with PBS injection in Figure 4A.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We demonstrated that the neutrophil behaviors occur within the infiltrated tissue rather than within the blood vessels. Even when examining the blood vessels in all other images, it is challenging to identify neutrophils adhering to the endothelium of the blood vessels. Neutrophils observed in the PBS 3-hour control group are likely acute responders to the local injection, as a smaller number of neutrophils were observed in the 6-hour image.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>‐ In Figure 5A the observation of neutrophil response in lung slices seems to be presented an anecdotal account. The neutrophil appears to polarize, but is this a consistent observation? How many such observations were made?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have consistent observations across three different experiments. In addition, highly polarized and fragmented neutrophils were consistently observed in the fixed lung section images.</p>

<p>‐ The statement: &quot;human Siglec‐5 and Siglec‐8 bound poorly despite being the structural and functional equivalents of Siglec F, respectively (37)&quot;. How can one Siglec be the structural and the other the functional equivalent of Siglec‐F? It might help to provide a little more detail as to how these should be seen.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Mouse Siglec-F has two distinct counterparts in the human Siglec system, both in terms of structure and function. In the context of domain structure, human Siglec-5 serves as the counterpart to mouse Siglec-F. However, it's important to note that while human Siglec-8 is not a genetic ortholog of mouse Siglec-F, it is expressed on similar cellular populations and functions as a functional paralog.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>‐ The assay using purified proteins and proteins expressed in cells don't fully agree. For example, it's very surprising that recombinant Siglec 5 and 8 bind better to the non‐glycosylated form than to the glycosylated trimer. It appears from Figure S1 that the PNGaseF treated Spike contains at least partly glycosylated monomers and it also appears that the Kifunesine effect may be partial. PNGaseF may have a hard time removing some glycans from a native protein.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We were also surprised by the results using the PNGase F treated Spike protein in that it lost binding to Siglec-F and retained binding to human Siglec-5 and 8 in the bead assay, shown in Figure 7A. As explained above we used a purified fraction of the PNGase F treated protein that retained some functional activity as assessed in the ACE2 binding assay and in biacore assays not shown.  The persistent binding of Siglec-5 and Siglec-8 suggests that removal of some of the complex glycans had revealed sites capable of binding Siglec-5 and 8. We would agree with the reviewer that the PNGase treatment we used only removed some of the glycans from the native protein. In data not shown the high mannose spike protein behaved as predicted in biacore assays, binding better to DC-SIGN and maltose binding lectin, but less well to PHA and less well to ACE2. The high mannose trimer also bound less to the HEK293 cells expressing ACE2, Siglec-5, or Siglec-8 as well as peripheral blood leukocytes.</p>
