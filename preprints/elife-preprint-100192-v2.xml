<title>Abstract</title><p>We explored neural mechanisms underlying sighing. Photostimulation of parafacial (pF) neuromedin B <italic>(</italic>NMB) or gastrin releasing peptide (GRP), or preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) NMBR or GRPR neurons elicited ectopic sighs with latency inversely related to time from preceding endogenous sigh. Of particular note, ectopic sighs could be produced without involvement of these peptides or their receptors in preBötC. Moreover, chemogenetic or optogenetic activation of preBötC SST neurons induced sighing, even in the presence of NMBR and/or GRPR antagonists. We propose that an increase in the excitability of preBötC NMBR or GRPR neurons not requiring activation of their peptide receptors activates partially overlapping pathways to generate sighs, and that preBötC SST neurons are a downstream element in the sigh generation circuit that converts normal breaths into sighs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Endogenous sighs generated periodically, typically every few minutes in rodents and humans, reinflate collapsed alveoli to maintain proper gas exchange in the mammalian lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Two largely parallel medullary pathways from the parafacial region (pF) to preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) appear critical for generation of these physiological sighs: pF neurons expressing neuromedin B (NMB) or gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) project to preBötC neurons expressing their cognate receptors, NMBR and GRPR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. These pathways also appear to mediate confinement-induced claustrophobic sighing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, and by extension, other forms of sighing associated with emotional states such as during sadness, anxiety, depression, relief, or happiness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In rodents, the preBötC receives inputs from NMB and GRP pF neurons, and genetic deletion of NMBRs or GRPRs or local antagonism of NMBRs or GRPRs in preBötC significantly reduces endogenous sighing, while local injection into preBötC of bombesin, NMB or GRP significantly increases spontaneous sighing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. In order to determine whether NMB and GRP are obligatory for sighs, and to better understand the mechanisms within the preBötC underlying sigh generation, we investigated whether activation of pF NMB or GRP neurons can generate sufficient input to preBötC to induce sighs and whether activation of preBötC GRPRs or NMBRs is necessary for generation of sighs.</p>
<p>Using transgenic mice that express Cre- or Flp-recombinase in <italic>Nmb</italic>-, <italic>Grp</italic>-, <italic>Nmbr</italic>- or <italic>Grpr</italic>- expressing neurons, we investigated the effects on sighing and other aspects of breathing pattern <italic>in vivo</italic>: i) of optogenetic activation of ChR2-transfected pF GRP or NMB neurons; ii) of optogenetic or chemogenetic activation of ChR2-transfected preBötC GRPR or NMBR neurons, including in the presence of their antagonists, and; iii) determined whether activating preBötC SST neurons, presumptive preBötC output neurons, can generate sighs. Moreover, by using electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging, we investigated the activity profiles of <italic>Grpr</italic>- or <italic>Nmbr</italic>-expressing preBötC neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>We conclude that: i) activation of either pF NMB or GRP neurons generates sufficient input to preBötC to generate ectopic sighs; ii) sighs can be generated by activation of preBötC GRPR and NMBR neurons even after blockade of NMBR and GRPR receptors; iii) preBötC GRPR or NMBR neurons act via partially overlapping pathways to produce sighs via preBötC SST neurons; iv) preBötC NMBR neurons are not rhythmogenic, and; v) activation of preBötC SST neurons can generate sighs.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A sigh is an inspiratory effort that results in significantly increased tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>), typically two to five times larger compared to normal breaths with a range of airflow profiles. Here, we define sighs as inspiratory efforts that result in transient significantly (&gt;2-fold) increased V<sub>T</sub>, which occur periodically at intervals longer than eupneic, i.e., normal, breaths. For all analyses, we designated sighs by their larger V<sub>T</sub> irrespective of their shape. Thus, monophasic ‘augmented breaths’, biphasic ‘partial doublets’ or ‘full doublets’ were all considered sighs (Extended Data Fig. 1). The mechanisms underlying formation of these different sigh subtypes are outside the scope of this publication.</p>

<title>Activation of <italic>Nmb</italic>- or <italic>Grp</italic>-expressing pF neurons induces sighs</title>
<p>To test whether selective activation of pF NMB or GRP neurons, i.e., bombesin peptide- expressing pF neurons) generates sighs, we established Grp-ChR2 or Nmb-ChR2 mouse lines (see <italic>Methods</italic>) by crossing floxed-ChR2-tdTomato mice with Grp<sup>Cre</sup> and Nmb<sup>Cre</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, c</xref>). We then measured the effects of targeted pF photostimulation (long pulse photostimulation, LPP, single bilateral 4-10 s 5mW pulse or short pulse photostimulation, SPP, single bilateral 100-500 ms pulse; see <italic>Methods</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> in anesthetized Grp-ChR2 or Nmb-ChR2 mice.</p>

<p>In Grp-ChR2 mice, LPP in pF elicited a large breath equivalent to an endogenous sigh in both amplitude and tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) when initiated during phase 0.3-1.0 of the sigh cycle (see <italic>Methods</italic>); we refer to such events as ectopic sighs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, bottom). Ectopic sighs in Grp-ChR2 mice were of partial doublet or augmented breath shape (See Extended Data Fig.1) and were indistinguishable from endogenous sighs in both V<sub>T</sub> and inspiratory (<italic>T<sub>I</sub></italic>) and expiratory (<italic>T<sub>E</sub></italic>) duration and exhibited a postsigh apnea (<italic>T<sub>E</sub></italic> immediately following ectopic sighs increased to 216 ± 35% of <italic>T<sub>E</sub></italic> of eupneic breaths, Fig.1b). During sigh phase 0.3-0.9, the interval from the previous endogenous sigh to the LPP-induced ectopic sigh, i.e., the perturbed sigh cycle, was shorter than the prior control sigh cycle. The interval between an ectopic sigh and the next (endogenous) sigh was, on average, indistinguishable from the interval between endogenous sighs, indicating that ectopic sighs reset the sigh cycle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). No ectopic sighs could be generated by bilateral pF SPP in Grp-ChR2 mice during inspiration or expiration (phase: 0.0- 1.0).</p>
<p>In Nmb-ChR2 mice, the effects of pF SPP and LPP were similar to those in Grp-ChR2 mice, as SPP (phase: 0.0-1.0) had no effect on sighing while LPP induced ectopic sighs, which appeared as partial doublet or augmented breaths, and reset the sigh cycle during 0.4-0.9 sigh phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>). Ectopic sighs were also indistinguishable from spontaneous sighs in V<sub>T</sub>, <italic>T<sub>E</sub></italic> and <italic>T<sub>I</sub></italic> and they exhibited a postsigh apnea (<italic>T<sub>E</sub></italic> after evoked sighs increased to 151 ± 22% of <italic>T<sub>E</sub></italic> of eupneic breaths, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, in either Grp-ChR2 or Nmb-ChR2 mice, pF LPP did not elicit ectopic sighs when applied very shortly after an endogenous sigh (phase range: 0.0–0.2 and 0.0–0.3 of endogenous sigh cycle, respectively; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>), indicating a postsigh refractory period for sigh induction. LPP in these cases had no subliminal effect on the sigh cycle, as the expected time to the next endogenous sigh was unchanged.</p>
<p>When pF LPP was initiated immediately following the end of the postsigh refractory period, the perturbed sigh cycle was significantly shorter than the control sigh cycle. For pF LPP later in the sigh cycle, i.e., closer to when the next endogenous sigh was expected, ectopic sighs occurred at even shorter latencies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Thus, after the refractory period during which ectopic sighs could not be elicited, this inverse relationship between photostimulation phase and sigh latency indicated that acute activation of the peptidergic microcircuit was more effective as the sigh phase advanced.</p>

<title>NMBR and GRPR are expressed primarily in excitatory neurons in preBötC</title>
<p>To understand how the activity of peptide-expressing pF neurons results in the generation of sighs, we next examined expression pattern of <italic>Nmbr</italic>- and <italic>Grpr</italic>- expressing cells in the preBötC using fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The vast majority of NMBR and GRPR cells (&gt;97%) did not colocalize with the specific astrocytic marker Aldh1l1, indicating that these cells are neurons (Extended Data Fig. 3). GRPR neurons were present caudal to pF, in a stream continuing dorsocaudally from pF to preBötC. In contrast, with the exception of sparse NMBR/ChAT neurons in nucleus ambiguus (Amb. ∼4 neurons in each section) that were excluded from subsequent analysis, NMBR neurons were mainly found in preBötC. As previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, some neurons coexpressed <italic>Nmbr</italic> and <italic>Grpr</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). In our sample, 57% of NMBR neurons coexpressed <italic>Grpr</italic>, which constituted 32% of the GRPR population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b, c</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we assessed colocalization with the vesicular glutamate transporter VGlut2 to determine whether NMBR and GRPR neurons are glutamatergic. Approximately 85% of NMBR and GRPR neurons co-expressed VGlut2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b, c</xref>). Finally, we asked whether <italic>Nmbr</italic> and <italic>Grpr</italic> were expressed on preBötC SST neurons. We found scant colocalization of SST and NMBR or GRPR (∼10%), indicating that the substantial majority of these peptide receptors are not on SST neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b, c</xref>).</p>

<p>Activation of <italic>Nmb</italic>- or <italic>Grp</italic>-expressing pF neurons generates sufficient input to preBötC to generate ectopic sighs, but is activation of neuropeptide-receptor expressing preBötC neurons via their cognate receptors necessary for sigh production? We tested whether bypassing the peptidergic receptors and directly activating preBötC <italic>Grpr</italic>- or <italic>Nmbr</italic>-expressing neurons could also generate sighs. To do this, we expressed ChR2 or the excitatory DREADD hM3Dq in discrete subsets of preBötC neurons (see <italic>Methods</italic>).</p>
<p>To express ChR2 in preBötC GRPR neurons, we microinjected a Flp-dependent ChR2 virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> into the preBötC of Grpr<sup>Flp</sup> mice (Extended data <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). While no ectopic sighs could be generated by bilateral preBötC SPP in these mice (phase: 0.0-1.0), preBötC LPP during 0.2–0.9 sigh phases elicited ectopic sighs which appeared as partial doublet or augmented breaths, and reset the sigh cycle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, bottom). Ectopic sighs elicited by preBötC LPP of GRPR neurons were no different from spontaneous sighs in V<sub>T</sub> and <italic>T<sub>E</sub></italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) and exhibited a postsigh apnea (<italic>T<sub>E</sub></italic> following evoked sighs increased to 194 ± 22%, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>

<p>Similarly, in Nmbr-ChR2 mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, top), preBötC SPP (phase: 0.0-1.0) had no effect on sighing, while LPP during 0.4-0.9 sigh phases elicited ectopic sighs which appeared as a partial doublet or an augmented breath, and reset the sigh cycle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, bottom). V<sub>T</sub> and postsigh <italic>T<sub>E</sub></italic> of ectopic sighs were no different from that of spontaneous sighs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Ectopic sighs elicited by preBötC LPP of NMBR neurons exhibited a postsigh apnea (postsigh <italic>T<sub>E</sub></italic> increased to 225 ± 33%, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>
<p>As with photostimulation of pF NMB and GRP neurons, there was a postsigh refractory period during which we could not generate ectopic sighs in preBötC NMBR or GRPR neurons. Again, the latency from LPP to ectopic sigh onset was inversely related to phase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3e</xref>).</p>
<p>We also tested whether activation of preBötC NMBR neurons using an excitatory DREADD could induce sighing. To do this, we transduced preBötC <italic>Nmbr</italic>-expressing neurons by microinjection of Cre-dependent AAV-hM3Dq in Nmbr<sup>Cre</sup> mice. In these mice, application of the selective agonist clozapine-n-oxide (CNO) to the brainstem surface increased sigh frequency ∼threefold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>; see Extended data <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4</xref> for control CNO application). Sighs induced by CNO in Nmbr<sup>Cre</sup> mice were of the doublet shape. Thus, increasing the excitability of preBötC NMBR neurons increases sighing.</p>

<title>preBötC NMBR neurons are rhythmically active</title>
<p>We next asked: what are the electrophysiological properties of the <italic>Grpr</italic>- and <italic>Nmbr</italic>-expressing preBötC neurons? We took several approaches. First, using inspiratory rhythmic slices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> from neonatal Grpr-EGFP or Nmbr-tdTomato reporter mice, we obtained whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from preBötC GRPR or NMBR neurons while monitoring hypoglossal nerve (XII) inspiratory activity. In Grpr-EGFP mice, only 3 of 21 preBötC GRPR neurons were inspiratory- modulated, i.e., fired during XII inspiratory bursts. In contrast, in Nmbr-tdTomato mice, the majority of preBötC NMBR neurons (10/16) were inspiratory-modulated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). This finding was confirmed using two-photon calcium imaging of rhythmic slices from Nmbr-GCaMP6f mice, in which we could monitor the activity of up to 10 neurons simultaneously (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). The majority of preBötC NMBR neurons (35/58; n = 6) exhibited inspiratory-modulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations coincident with XII bursts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>); however, episodes of non-breathing-modulated episodic bursting, i.e., bursts not in phase with XII, were also seen (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>) and varied in frequency from 0.025 to 0.1 Hz (Extended Data Fig. 5). Almost all NMBR neurons that had Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations during inspiratory bursts also had elevations during sighs (34/35), but not during the pre-I period, consistent with whole-cell recordings (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>), indicating that they are likely Type II, i.e., presumptive non-rhythm generating, neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). The burst duration of the GCaMP6f signal associated with sighs was longer-lasting than those associated with eupneic events in the same neuron (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d-e</xref>).</p>

<title>NMB converts NMBR neurons inspiratory burstlets into sighs and bursts</title>
<p>In typical recording conditions <italic>in vitro</italic> ([K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ACSF</sub> = 9 mM), the preBötC population activity burst and the periodic XII discharges are in sync. Under conditions of low excitability ([K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ACSF</sub> &lt; 7 mM), however, in addition to these coincident high amplitude bursts in preBötC and XII, there are low amplitude burstlets in preBötC but not in XII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.

<title>Activating preBötC GRPR- or NMBR-only neurons has distinct effects on sighing</title>
<p>Photoactivation of preBötC GRPR or NMBR neurons can induce sighs.

We used an intersectional genetic approach to target neurons that express only one of these receptors, excluding double-positive (GRPR/NMBR) neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Thus, using Cre-on/Flp-off and Cre-off/Flp-on viral vectors for the delivery of ChR2 in Nmbr<sup>Cre</sup>;Grpr<sup>Flp</sup> double mutant mice, we expressed ChR2 in preBötC NMBR- only (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>) or GRPR-only neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>), respectively. We examined the effect of preBötC LPP and SPP of these neurons on sighing. When targeting NMBR-only neurons, preBötC SPP elicited ectopic bursts which appeared similar to partial doublets or augmented breaths with smaller V<sub>T</sub> compared to spontaneous sighs due to a decrease in <italic>T<sub>I</sub></italic> to 64 ± 8% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). <italic>T<sub>E</sub></italic> immediately following these ectopic bursts were longer than the <italic>T<sub>E</sub></italic> of eupneic breaths (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p>

<p>In contrast, in Nmbr-ChR2 mice, preBötC LPP delivered during a postsigh refractory period did not generate ectopic sighs but decreased <italic>f</italic> to 83 ± 4% (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>) and increased V<sub>T</sub> to 140 ± 12% (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>) of baseline. preBötC SPP or LPP of NMBR-only neurons increased V<sub>T</sub> to 274 ± 41% or 264 ± 17% of control, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>).</p>
<p>The effect on inspiratory burst amplitude was also observed in Nmbr<sup>Cre</sup> mice that had preBötC NMBR neurons transfected with Cre-dependent AAV-HM3Dq; CNO applied to the brainstem surface significantly increased V<sub>T</sub> by 343 ± 56% (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>) and decreased <italic>f</italic> by 63 ± 8.4% (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). Note that although such breaths were of the same V<sub>T</sub> as eupneic sighs before administration of CNO (Fig.3c), in line with our definition of sighs (Extended Data Fig.1), we classify this outcome as large amplitude breaths rather than “all sigh” breathing rhythm, according to our definition of sighs (Extended Data Fig.1).</p>
<p>Thus, stimulation of preBötC NMBR and/or GRPR neurons also has a profound effect on the eupneic, nonsigh, breathing pattern, and GRPR and NMBR neurons appear to differently affect inspiratory burst amplitude.</p>

<title>Sighs can be induced after inhibition of GRPRs or NMBRs</title>
<p>Expression of <italic>Grpr</italic> and/or <italic>Nmbr</italic> defines subsets of preBötC neurons that affect sigh generation. Is activation of these peptide receptors <italic>necessary</italic> for sigh generation?</p>
<p>For that we investigated the effects of activating peptide-expressing pF neurons in the presence of bombesin receptor antagonists. First, we confirmed that bilateral microinjection of the NMBR antagonist BIM23042 and GRPR antagonist RC3095 (300 µM each, 50 nl/side) into the preBötC in anesthetized mice eliminates spontaneous sighs (Extended Data Fig. 6). Next, we determined the effects of such NMBR and GRPR antagonism on LPP-evoked sighs. After blockade, no sighs were elicited by pF LPP in Nmb-ChR2 mice; in contrast, pF LPP of GRP neurons still elicited ectopic sighs of a doublet shape. The V<sub>T</sub> was not significantly different from that of spontaneous sighs; <italic>T<sub>E</sub></italic> of the following respiratory cycle was unaffected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). Thus, when pF NMB neurons were stimulated, preBötC NMBR neurons require NMBR activation to contribute to sigh generation, whereas when pF GRP neurons were stimulated, sighs could still be generated after antagonism of preBötC GRPR receptors.</p>
<p>We next investigated whether explicit activation of preBötC NMBRs and/or GRPRs is necessary to produce sighs, i.e., could sighs be generated simply by depolarizing these preBötC neurons to fire action potentials? In ChR2-transduced Grpr<sup>Flp</sup> or Nmbr-ChR2 mice after antagonism of both receptors sufficient to eliminate spontaneous sighs (Extended Data Fig. 6), LPP of preBötC GRPR or NMBR neurons still elicited sighs of doublet shape. V<sub>T</sub> and <italic>T<sub>I</sub></italic> of the sighs elicited in Grpr<sup>Flp</sup> or Nmbr-ChR2 mice after blockade of both receptors was no different from spontaneous sighs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>).

<p>Thus, initiating or increasing the activity of pF GRP neurons, or preBötC GRPR or NMBR neurons, can generate sighs without activation of these receptors, either endogenously or exogenously.</p>

<p>In hM3Dq-transduced Sst<sup>Cre</sup> anesthetized mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>), excitation of preBötC SST neurons by CNO application onto ventral brainstem surface affected eupneic breathing: <italic>f</italic> decreased by 60 ± 6.2%, V<sub>T</sub> increased by 222 ± 21%. CNO application increased sigh rate ∼tenfold with sighs appearing as doublets (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref>).

Thus, excitation of preBötC SST neurons can produce sighs in an NMBR- and GRPR- independent manner.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated whether sighs induced by the NMBR- and GRPR-dependent pathway requires activity of preBötC SST neurons. For that we transfected preBötC SST neurons with Cre-dependent ultrapotent inhibitory DREADD AAV-PSAM4-GlyR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> in Sst<sup>Cre</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7g</xref>).

<p>Note that similar to excitatory DREADD effects in Nmbr<sup>Cre</sup> mice, manipulations increasing V<sub>T</sub> of all breaths were classified to affect V<sub>T</sub> of eupneic breaths rather than induce an “all sigh” rhythm, according to our definition of sighs (Extended Data Fig.1).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In all mammals, sighs are generated periodically to maintain lung function and, in humans, are episodically associated with such emotional states as relief, sadness, yearning, exhaustion, stress, and joy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and in rodents are associated with inferred indicators of emotional states such as stress and anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The signals producing these large periodic inspiratory efforts originate within the preBötC, a heterogeneous medullary population that is the kernel for generation of breathing rhythm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Molecularly-defined preBötC subpopulations underlie different functions during breathing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Ablation, genetic deletion or pharmacological excitation or inhibition of preBötC neurons expressing receptors (NMBR and GRPR) for bombesin-related peptides (NMB and GRP) significantly affect rhythmic (∼25-40/hour) sighing in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Here, we further explored the mechanisms of sigh generation.</p>
<p>Sighs exhibit various shapes, i.e., augmented single inspiratory effort, partial doublets, and full doublets, that have two unifying characteristics: i) significant transient increase in V<sub>T</sub> and; ii) occur at a much lower frequency compared to eupneic breaths; often these augmented inspiratory efforts are followed by a lengthened interburst interval, i.e., postsigh apnea. We use these criteria as a definition of sighs, which unifies observations and conclusions in this and previous <italic>in</italic> vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> studies that used various, often incongruent definitions of sighs.</p>
<p>Here, we investigated two novel properties of sigh generation: sigh phase and postsigh refractory period. By using the same approach that we employed for differentiating the effects of optogenetic stimulation on various preBötC subpopulations on the eupneic cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, we found that sighs evoked by optogenetic stimulation of various subpopulations reset the sigh cycle and delayed the onset of the next endogenous sigh. Also, similar to a postinpiratory refractory period in the respiratory cycle, during which ectopic breaths cannot be evoked immediately following termination of an inspiratory effort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, we similarly observed a postsigh refractory period following an endogenous sigh, during which ectopic sighs could not be evoked. We suggest that these subpopulations have intrinsic “sigh-generating” properties, e.g., unique signaling pathways or connectivity that affects excitability of these subpopulations. Although vagotomy transiently abolishes eupneic sighs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, they can be evoked in absence of sensory feedback <italic>in vivo</italic> after vagotomy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> or <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, suggesting that sensory inputs by themselves are not necessary, but likely modulate activity of these subpopulations to affect frequency of sighs. The mechanisms that underlie the slow sigh rhythm (∼minutes) remains to be discovered, and might involve intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In mice, sigh-like movements appear <italic>in utero</italic> between E17 and E18<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, when at least two types of inspiratory-modulated neurons can be differentiated in rhythmic slices: neurons that fire in sync with regular “eupneic” XII bursts, and those that fire only during sigh-like bursts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. This could result from increased activity in a single population with a distribution of activation thresholds or from recruitment of a distinct high threshold population. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the majority of NMBR preBötC neurons recorded were active in both eupneic and sigh bursts, a few GRPR preBötC neurons recorded were active in eupnea, but none were active exclusively during sighs, q.v.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Rhythmic preBötC NMBR neurons in neonatal mice were active during both eupneic and sigh bursts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), but not during burstlets or the pre-I period. These results suggest that NMBR preBötC neurons are Type II neurons that participate in generation of the burst patterns of sighs and eupneic breaths, but are not rhythmogenic.</p>
<p>Sighs can be induced by activation of various subpopulations within two structures: NMB or GRP in pF and NMBR, GRPR or SST in preBötC. We previously reported a microcircuit capable of generating sighs involving pF neurons producing bombesin-related peptides that project to preBötC neurons expressing cognate NMBRs and GRPRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, and that activation of these preBötC neurons via their peptide receptors was sufficient to generate sighs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Here, in significantly extending this work, we show that sighs can be evoked by direct photoexcitation of GRP, NMBR or GRPR neurons, bypassing activation of these receptors. Photostimulation of preBötC GRPR or NMBR neurons can elicit ectopic sighs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), even in the presence of GRPR and NMBR antagonists at sufficient concentration to block the effect of exogenous application of peptides that increase sigh rate (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref> and Extended data <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Thus, sighs can be induced by increasing the excitability of these subpopulations, without obligatory participation of pathways activated by bombesin-related peptides. In other words, while it can provide sufficient external input to trigger sighs, activation of preBötC NMBRs and/or GRPRs is not necessary for sigh production. This suggests that sighs are not the unique product of a preBötC bombesin-peptide signaling pathway.</p>
<p>We studied photoactivation of pF NMB- and GRP-expressing neurons in transgenic mice. Could our protocol have also activated GRP or NMB containing presynaptic terminals originating from brainstem neurons outside pF, such as found in the parabrachial nuclei and NTS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>? This is unlikely in the case of NMB, since NMB-expressing neurons are limited to pF in the medulla<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Also, unlikely the case of GRP, as there is no evidence that pF neurons express GRPRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. However, our protocol would result in the expression of ChR2 in neurons that expressed NMB-or GRP-expressing neurons at any point since conception, even transiently. Thus, we cannot rule out that; in our adult mice there were neurons in pF that once expressed these peptides but no longer did so, and that these vestigial NMB or GRP neurons could have been perturbed in our protocol. Such determination requires additional studies outside the scope of the work reported here.</p>
<p>preBötC neurons expressing SST, mostly distinct from NMBR and GRPR populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), receive input from rhythmogenic preBötC neurons, many have an inspiratory firing pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, that appear to serve a premotor role to shape inspiratory motor output<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Photostimulation of preBötC SST neurons increases peak inspiratory amplitude in both anesthetized and awake mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Here, DREADD-mediated excitation of SST neurons significantly increased sigh rate, with the effect much larger than DREADD-mediated excitation of NMBR neurons (16- vs 3-fold increase). Additionally, unlike the significant 1-5s latency to induce an ectopic sigh when photostimulating GRPR or NMBR preBötC neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>), photostimulating preBötC SST neurons during inspiration induced a second augmented inspiration immediately following the eupneic burst to convert it into a sigh (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). Importantly, effects of such photostimulation were unaffected by blockade of both NMBR and GRPR receptors (Fig.7d), and sighs evoked by microinjection of peptides NMB and GRP into preBötC were completely eliminated by inhibition of SST neurons that expressed an inhibitory DREADD PSAM4 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7g</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7h</xref>). We conclude that activation of preBötC SST neurons is also sufficient to induce sighs and further suggest they can induce sighs, downstream from NMBR and GRPR preBötC neurons, and may be necessary to do so (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Our initial delineation of a microcircuit of four subpopulations, i.e., pF NMB and GRP neurons and preBötC NMBR and GRPR neurons, that affected sighs led us to hypothesize its role in sigh generation, but we were agnostic as to its role in the production of eupneic breaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Our data here, consistent with a previous report of effects from intravenous administration of bombesin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, suggests that this microcircuit is tightly integrated within the eupneic CPG with NMBR, GRPR and SST populations having distinct though overlapping roles in modulation of the eupneic breathing pattern as well as in the generation of sighs. The majority of preBötC neurons expressing NMBR, GRPR (or both) receptors are glutamatergic and excitatory (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, no NMBR preBötC neurons were active during burstlets or the pre-I period, suggesting that NMBR preBötC neurons are Type II neurons that participate in generation of breathing pattern but not rhythm generation (similar to the properties of preBötC SST neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>). <italic>In vivo</italic> we observed distinctly different effects from activation of preBötC GRPR and NMBR neurons: photoactivation of GRPR neurons increased breathing frequency, whereas photo- or chemo- activation of NMBR neurons decreased breathing frequency and increased amplitude (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>); otherwise, their effects on sighing appeared similar (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Notably, some neurons express both NMBR and GRPR receptors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). When the overlapping subpopulation of preBötC neurons expressing both GRPRs and NMBRs was excluded, we could activate the two discrete pathways independently. Photostimulating GRPR-only neurons had no effect on inspiratory burst amplitude, whereas photostimulating NMBR-only neurons increased amplitude (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). Additionally, DREADD-mediated excitation of the SST population increased both the sigh rate and the inspiratory burst amplitude (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref>). Microinjection of peptides NMB and GRP into preBötC increased sigh rate and inspiratory burst amplitude; subsequent ultrapotent chemogenetic inhibition of preBötC SST<sup>+</sup> neurons selectively abolished sighs, but not an increase in inspiratory amplitude (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7g</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7h</xref>), suggesting that modulation of breathing pattern by NMBR and GRPR neurons is independent of SST neurons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
<p>Sighing is a relatively straightforward behavior that appears to result from a delineable microcircuit that could only be discovered because of the close relationship between the essential, readily localizable, compact circuitry with a definitive precisely measurable functional physiologically relevant output. How this unexpected complexity for sigh generation reflects on strategies for unraveling ever more complex and difficult to quantify behaviors remains to be determined.</p>

<p>Grp<sup>Cre</sup> was obtained from Jackson Labs (Strain #033174). Grpr<sup>flp</sup>, Nmb<sup>Cre</sup> and Nmbr<sup>Cre</sup> animals were designed and generated by Cyagen Biosciences Inc (see below). Transgenic ChR2 mice were generated by crossing Cre mice with floxed-ChR2-tdTomato mice (Jackson Labs Strain #012567). These crosses generated mice expressing ChR2 in GRP neurons (Grp-ChR2), NMB neurons (Nmb-ChR2) or NMBR neurons (Nmbr-ChR2). To express ChR2 selectively in preBötC neurons, AAV injections were performed on adult Sst<sup>Cre</sup> mice (Jackson Labs Strain #013044) or Grpr<sup>flp</sup> mice. All <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments were performed on adult male or female mice (10-14 weeks old, 24-32g). Unless otherwise specified, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine. For <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, transgenic Grpr-EGFP, Nmbr-tdTomato, and Nmbr-GCamp6s were used.</p>
<p>These mice were generated by crosses between Nmbr<sup>Cre</sup> or Grpr<sup>Flp</sup> mice and one of the following lines: Ai14 (Jackson Labs Strain #007914), RCE:FRT (MMRRC Strain #032038-JAX), GCaMp6f (Jackson Labs Strain #029626).</p>
<p>To generate Nmb<sup>Cre</sup> mice the open reading frame of Cre recombinase together with SV40 polyA signal was cloned downstream of the mouse Nmb promoter, such that the expression of Cre mimicked the endogenous mouse Nmb gene. The PiggyBac ITRs was inserted into the BAC backbone flanking the genomic insert, to facilitate transposes mediated BAC integration. The modified BAC was co-injected with transposes into single cell stage fertilized eggs from C57BL/6 mice. Resulting pups were then genotyped by PCR for the presence of the modified BAC and the Cre cassette. To generate Grpr<sup>Flp</sup> mice, the Grpr gene was first located on mouse chromosome X. Three exons have been identified, with the ATG start codon in exon 1 and TAG stop codon in exon 3; the TAG stop codon was then replaced with the Flp cassette. To engineer the targeting vector, homology arms were generated by PCR using BAC clone RP23-402H23 and RP23-50M18 from the C57BL/6J library as template. In the targeting vector, the Neo cassette was flanked by FRT sites. DTA was used for negative selection. The constitutive knock-in allele was obtained after FRT-mediated recombination. C57BL/6 ES cells were then used for gene targeting to introduce knock-in alleles into host embryos followed by transfer into surrogate mothers. Resulting pups were then genotyped by PCR for the presence of the Flp cassette. To generate Nmbr<sup>Cre</sup> mice, the Nmbr gene was first located on mouse chromosome 10. Three exons have been identified, with the ATG start codon in exon 1 and TGA stop codon in exon 3; the TGA stop codon was then replaced with the Cre cassette. To engineer the targeting vector, homology arms was generated by PCR using BAC clone RP24-232I16 and RP24-124K10 from the C57BL/6J library as template. In the targeting vector, the Neo cassette was flanked by LoxP sites. DTA was used for negative selection. The constitutive knock-in allele was obtained after Cre-mediated recombination. C57BL/6 ES cells were then used for gene targeting to introduce knock-in alleles into host embryos followed by transfer into surrogate mothers. Resulting pups were then genotyped by PCR for the presence of the Cre cassette.</p>

<title>Viral injections</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% for induction and 2% for maintenance) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments) with Bregma and Lambda skull landmarks level. Two holes were drilled in the skull 6.80 mm caudal to Bregma and 1.2 mm lateral to the midline. Virus was delivered 4.65 mm from the dorsal surface of the brain into the preBötC through a glass pipette using either a pressure ejection system (Picospritzer II; Parker Hannafin) or Micro4 microinjection system (World Precision Instruments). For ChR2 experiments, we used 100-200 nl of virus solution (1-6 x 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> vg/ml) per side, and for DREADD experiments, 30-50 nl of virus solution (4.6 x 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> vg/ml) per side. The pipettes were left in place for 5 min after injection to minimize backflow. The wound was closed with 5-0 gauge non-absorbable sutures. Mice were returned to their home cage and given 2-3 weeks to recover to allow for sufficient levels of protein expression. All virus injection sites were subsequently confirmed by immunostaining and only mice with sufficient and localized transfection in preBötC were used for all analysis (see Extended Data Fig. 2 for representative confocal images).</p>

<title>Surgical procedures for ventral approach</title>
<p>Adult mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine (100 and 10 mg/kg, respectively). Isoflurane (1-2% volume in air) was administered throughout an experiment. The level of anesthesia was assessed by the suppression of the withdrawal reflex. A tracheostomy tube was placed in the trachea through the larynx, and respiratory flow was detected with a flow head connected to a transducer to measure airflow (Mouser Electronics). The mice were placed in a supine position in a stereotaxic instrument (David Kopf Instruments). The larynx was denervated, separated from the pharynx, and moved aside. The basal aspect of the occipital bone was removed to expose the ventral aspect of the medulla. The canal of the hypoglossal nerve (XII) served as a suitable landmark. The preBötC were 0.15 mm caudal to the hypoglossal canal, 1.2 mm lateral to the midline, and 0.24 mm dorsal to the ventral medullary surface.</p>

<sec id="s4e">
<title>Photostimulation</title>
<p>A 473 nm laser (OptoDuet Laser; IkeCool) was targeted bilaterally to the preBötC or pF with a branching fiber patch cord (200 µm diameter; Doric Lenses) brought to the exposed ventral medullary surface. Laser power was set at 5 mW. Short Pulse Photostimulation (SPP; 200 ms) and Long Pulse Photostimulation (LPP; 5 s) waveforms were delivered under the command of a pulse generator (Pulsemaster A300 Generator; WPI) connected to the laser power supply. In instances where breathing frequency was decreased, e.g. after BIM23042 and RC3095 microinjections, SPP and LPP of longer durations (500 ms and 8 s, respectively) were used to confirm consistency of results. Stimulating 500 µm rostral to preBötC or pF in mice expressing ChR2 that served as a control did not produce significant output effects (Extended data <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). No output effects and no sigh were produced by preBötC or pF photostimulation in Grp-RFP, Grpr-EGFP, Nmbr-EGFP, Nmb-RFP reporter mice (Extended data <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>).</p>

<title>Pharmacological injection experiments</title>
<p>The NMBR antagonist BIM23042 (Tocris Bioscience) and the GRPR antagonist RC3095 (Sigma-Aldrich) were injected together (300 µM each, 50-60 nl/side) to block NMBR and GRPR activation. Injections were made using micropipettes (∼40 µm tip), placed bilaterally into the preBötC. Injections targeted to the center of the preBötC were placed 0.15 mm caudal to the hypoglossal canal, 1.2 mm lateral to the midline, and 0.24 mm dorsal to the ventral medullary surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Small corrections were made to avoid puncturing of blood vessels on the surface of the medulla. All injections were made using a series of pressure pulses (Picospritzer, Parker- Hannifin; or Micro4, World Precision Instruments). For activation of hM3Dq receptors, 50µL of CNO solution was applied to the ventral surface of the brainstem. CNO (Tocris Biosciences) was dissolved in saline at concentration of 1 mg/ml with 0.5% dimethylsulfoxide. Solution was prepared fresh daily. For activation of PSAM4-GlyR receptors, 30µL of uPSEM817 tartrate solution (10mM) was applied to the ventral surface of the brainstem. In chemogenetic experiments CNO or uPSEM817 were applied to the ventral surface of the brainstem instead of microinjection in order to avoid preBötC damage from multiple microinjections; in control experiments application of the same dose of CNO or uPSEM817 does not produce responses in any breathing parameters.</p>

<title><italic>In situ</italic> hybridization and immunostaining</title>
<p>Nmbr<sup>Cre</sup>, SST<sup>Cre</sup> or wild-type mice (10-14 weeks) were euthanized with isoflurane overdose, their brainstems were rapidly removed and flash frozen in dry ice. Fresh frozen brainstems were sectioned sagittally on a cryostat (CryoStar NX70, Thermo Scientific), mounted on SuperFrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific) and stored at -80 °C for at least 1 day. They were then processed according to manufacturer’s protocol (RNAscope version 1, Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Briefly, tissue samples were postfixed in 10% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde, washed, and dehydrated in sequential concentrations of ethanol (50, 70, and 100%). Samples were treated with protease IV and incubated for 2 hours at 40 °C in HybEZ<sup>TM</sup> Hybridization Oven (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) in the presence of target probes. We used combinations of following probes for hybridization: <italic>Mm-ChAT</italic>, <italic>Mm-Grpr, Mm-Nmbr, Mm-Sst</italic>, <italic>Mm-Slc17a6 (VGluT2), Mm-Aldh1l1, Cre</italic> and <italic>Flp</italic>. A probe for <italic>Mm-ChAT</italic> was used in all probe combinations to mark the location of nucleus ambiguus, which is necessary for determining the location of preBötC. After a 4-step amplification process, samples were counterstained with DAPI and coverslipped with ProLong Gold (Invitrogen) used as a mounting agent. Images were acquired on a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM710 META, Zeiss). High-resolution z-stack confocal images were taken at 1 µm intervals and then merged using ImageJ software.</p>
<p>Immunohistochemistry was performed according to the following protocol. Free-floating sections were rinsed in PBS and incubated with 10% normal donkey antiserum (NDS) and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 60 min to reduce nonspecific staining and increase antibody penetration. Sections were incubated overnight with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 1% NDS and 0.2% Triton X-100. The following day, sections were washed in PBS, incubated with the specific secondary antibodies conjugated to the fluorescent probes diluted in PBS for 2 h. Sections were further washed in PBS, mounted, and coverslipped with Fluorsave mounting medium (Millipore). The primary antibodies used for this study were as follows: rabbit polyclonal anti-somatostatin-14 (1:500; Peninsula Laboratories), mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN (1:500; Millipore; MAB377), goat anti-ChaT (1:500, Chemicon) and chicken polyclonal anti-GFP (1:500; Aves Labs). DyLight488 donkey anti-chicken, Rhodamine Red-X donkey anti-rabbit, and Cy5 donkey anti-mouse conjugated secondary antibodies (1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used to detect primary antibodies. Slides were observed under an AxioCam2 Zeiss fluorescent microscope connected with AxioVision acquisition software or under a LSM510 Zeiss confocal microscope with Zen software (Carl Zeiss). Images were acquired, exported in TIFF files, and arranged to prepare final figures in Zen software (Carl Zeiss) and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe).</p>

<p>Slices were placed in a recording chamber with the rostral face of preBötC facing up and continuously superfused with warmed ACSF (at 28-30°C) equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and extracellular K<sup>+</sup> was increased to 9 mM to elevate preBötC excitability. Inspiratory- related motor output was recorded from the hypoglossal nerve (XII) using a suction electrode and a differential AC amplifier (AM systems), filtered at 2-4 kHz, integrated, and digitized at 10 kHz. Whole-cell recordings were made using a MultiClamp 700A (Molecular Devices), filtered at 2-4 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz. Borosilicate glass recording electrodes (G150-4, Warner Instruments) had tip resistances of 4-8 MΩ and were filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM): 140 potassium gluconate, 10 HEPES, 5 NaCl, 1.1 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, and 0.1 CaCl<sub>2</sub> (∼305 mOsm; pH 7.3). In two-photon imaging experiments, field potentials were recorded from the contralateral preBötC, using an extracellular electrode and a differential AC amplifier (AM systems), filtered at 2-4 kHz, integrated, and digitized at 10 kHz. Digitized data were analyzed off-line using custom procedures written for IgorPro (Wavemetrics). Agonists were bath applied at the specified concentrations while monitoring field potentials and XII output.</p>

<p>Breathing frequency is measured by the time interval between peaks. <italic>T<sub>I</sub></italic> was calculated by the time interval from start to the maximum of the peak, <italic>T<sub>E</sub></italic> was calculated by the time interval from the previous inspiratory peak to the onset of the next inspiratory burst and V<sub>T</sub> was calculated from the inspiratory peak. Due to high reproducibility of effects of photostimulation, V<sub>T</sub>, <italic>T<sub>I</sub></italic> and <italic>T<sub>E</sub></italic> during ectopic sighs were calculated as an average of 3-5 sighs, paired t-tests were used to determine statistical significance of changes before and after pharmacological injections or photostimulation. For statistical comparisons of more than two groups, repeated-measures (RM) ANOVAs were performed. For one-way RM ANOVAs, post hoc significance for pairwise- comparisons was analyzed using Holm-Sidak method. Significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Data are shown as mean ± SE.</p>

<p><bold>a,</bold> Three types of sighs observed in adult mice <italic>in vivo</italic>. A sigh is a spontaneous inspiratory effort that results in significantly increased inspiratory tidal volume, typically two to five times compared to normal breaths. Under anesthesia in mice, sighs <italic>in vivo</italic> can take multiple shapes. The most common shape is partial doublet, a biphasic double-sized breath with an initial phase that is identical to a normal breath (eupnea) and a later high- amplitude inspiration, coincident with a biphasic genioglossus<sub>EMG</sub> (GG<sub>EMG</sub>) event (left). An <italic>in vivo</italic> sigh in mice can also present as one large breath, a monophasic augmented inspiration that has two to five times the volume of a normal breath, coincident with a monophasic GG<sub>EMG</sub> event (middle); or a double-peaked breath (doublets) with the first breath immediately followed by a similar amplitude second breath (right). <bold>b</bold>, Raw and expanded traces show three types of shape observed in one mouse. <bold>c</bold>, Sigh shapes are related to basal breathing frequency (45 spontaneous sighs from 3 mice). Different sigh shapes represent a continuum from “augmented breath” on one side of the spectrum to “doublet” on the other. Exact shape appears to be related to basal breathing frequency, with augmented breaths and occasional partial doublets exhibited during conditions with high basal respiratory rate/low amplitude; while doublets and partial doublets occur mostly with low basal respiratory rate/high amplitude. The latter is similar to conditions of vagotomy and <italic>in vitro</italic>, where breathing <italic>f</italic> is substantially reduced, and during which sighs often appeared as doublets. <bold>d</bold>, Measurement of respiratory parameters of eupneic breath and three types of sighs. <bold>e,</bold> Sighs exhibiting a doublet shape occur periodically at a frequency significantly lower than normal eupneic breaths after NMB and GRP microinjection into preBötC in ketamine/xylazine anesthetized mice. <bold>f,</bold> Doublets are not artefacts resulting from any damage to preBötC, since doublet-shaped sighs induced by microinjection of NMB and GRP were blocked by subsequent preBötC microinjection of NMBR and GRPR antagonists BIM23042 and RC3095. <bold>g,</bold> Chemogenetic excitation of SST preBötC neurons evokes frequent doublet-shaped sighs in ketamine/xylazine mice, while in awake mice it induces frequent sighs of augmented breath shape, suggesting that doublets are indeed sighs.</p></caption>

<p>Summary of what is achieved: This manuscript validates and extends upon the sigh generating circuit between the NMB/GRP+ RTN/parafacial neurons and the NMBR/GRPR+ preBötC neurons established in Li et al., 2016. The authors generate multiple transgenic lines that enable selective targeting of these various sub-populations of cells and demonstrate the sufficiency of each type in generating a sigh breath. Additionally, they show that NMBR and GPRP preBötC neurons are glutamatergic, have overlapping and distinct expression, and do not express SST. Beyond this validation, the authors show that ectopic stimulation of SST neurons is sufficient to evoke sighs and that they are necessary for NMB/GRP induced sighing. This data is the first time that preBötC neurons downstream of NMBR/GRPR neurons have been identified that transform a eupneic breath into a sign breath. The five conclusions stated at the end of the introduction are supported by the data.</p>
<p>Summary of a primary weakness: A strong emphasis throughout the manuscript is the identification of an unsubstantiated slow sigh rhythm that is produced by NMBR/GRPR neurons. It is even suggested that this is an intrinsic property of these neurons. However, to make such a novel (and quite surprising) claim requires many more studies and the conclusion is dependent on how the authors have defined a sigh. Moreover, some data within the paper conflicts with this idea. The resubmitted manuscript does not contain any revisions and the rebuttal does not sufficiently address the critiques.</p>
<p>In summary, the optogenetic and chemogenetic characterization of the neuropeptide pathway transgenic lines nicely aligns with and provides important validation of the previous study by Li et. al., 2016 and the SST neuron studies provide a new mechanism for the transformation of NMBR/GRPR neuropeptide activation into a sigh. These are important findings, and they should be the points emphasized. The proposal of a slow sigh rhythm should be more rigorously established with new experiments and analysis or should be more carefully described and discussed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates in mice neural mechanisms generating sighs, which are periodic large-amplitude breaths occurring during normal breathing that subserve physiological pulmonary functions and are associated with emotional states such as relief, stress, and anxiety. Sighs are generated by a structure called the preBötzinger complex (preBötC) in the medulla oblongata that generates various forms of inspiratory activity including sighs. The authors have previously described a circuit involving neurons producing bombesin-related peptides Neuromedin B (NMB) and gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) that project to preBötC neurons expressing receptors for NMB (NMBRs) and GRP (GRPRs) and that activation of these preBötC neurons via these peptide receptors generates sighs. In this study the authors further investigated mechanisms of sigh generation by applying optogenetic and chemogenetic strategies to selectively activate the subpopulations of preBötC neurons expressing NMBRs and/or GRPRs, and a separate subpopulation of neurons expressing somatostatin (SST) but not NMBRs and GRPRs. The authors present convincing evidence that sigh-like inspirations can be evoked by photostimulation of the preBötC neurons expressing NMBRs or GRPRs. Photostimulation of SST neurons can independently evoke sighs, and chemogenetic inhibition of these neurons can abolish sighs. The results presented support the authors' conclusion that the preBötC neurons expressing NMBRs or GRPRs produce sighs via pathways to downstream SST neurons. Thus, these studies have identified some of the preBötC cellular elements likely involved in generating sighs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This study employs an effective combination of electrophysiological, transgenic, optogenetic, chemogenetic, pharmacological, and neuron activity imaging techniques to investigate sigh generation by distinct subpopulations of preBötC neurons in mice.</p>
<p>(2) The authors extend previous studies indicating that there is a peptidergic circuit consisting of NMB and GRP expressing neurons that project from the parafacial (pF) nucleus region to the preBötC and provides sufficient input to generate sighs, since photoactivation of either pF NMB or GRP neurons evoke ectopic sighs in this study.</p>
<p>(3) Solid evidence is presented that sighs can be evoked by direct photostimulation of preBötC neurons expressing NMBRs and/or GRPRs, and also a separate subpopulation of neurons expressing somatostatin (SST) but not NMBRs and GRPRs.</p>
<p>(4) The mRNA-expression data presented from in situ hybridization indicates that most preBötC neurons expressing NMBR, GRPR (or both) are glutamatergic and excitatory.</p>
<p>(5) Measurements in slices in vitro indicate that only the NMBR expressing neurons are normally rhythmically active during normal inspiratory activity and endogenous sigh activity.</p>
<p>(6) Evidence is presented that activation of preBötC NMBRs and/or GRPRs is not necessary for sigh production, suggesting that sighs are not the unique product of the preBötC bombesin-peptide signaling pathway.</p>
<p>(7) The novel conclusion is presented that the preBötC neurons expressing NMBRs and/or GRPRs produce sighs via the separate downstream population of preBötC SST neurons, which the authors demonstrate can independently generate sighs, whereas chemogenetic inhibition of preBötC SST neurons selectively abolishes sighs generated by activating NMBRs and GRPRs.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While these studies have identified subpopulations of preBötC neurons capable of episodically evoking sigh-like inspiratory activity, mechanisms producing the normal slow sigh rhythm were not investigated and remain unknown.</p>
<p>(2) The authors have addressed some of the reviewers' main technical concerns and issues relating to interpretation of the results in their rebuttal letter, but have minimally revised the manuscript. Accordingly, there remain important technical and interpretation issues requiring resolution in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have clarified in their rebuttal letter the rationale for utilizing two different photostimulation paradigms but have not incorporated any of this explanation in Methods, which would be helpful for readers.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Cui et al., studies the mechanisms for the generation of sighing, an essential breathing pattern. This is an important and interesting topic, as sighing maintains normal pulmonary function and is associated with various emotional conditions. However, the mechanisms of its generation remain not fully understood. The authors employed different approaches, including optogenetics, chemogenetics, intersectional genetic approach, and slice electrophysiology and calcium imaging, to address the question, and found several neuronal populations are sufficient to induce sighing when activated. Furthermore, ectopic sighs can be triggered without the involvement of neuromedin B (NMB) or gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) or their receptors in the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) region of the brainstem. Additionally, activating SST neurons in the preBötC region induces sighing, even when other receptors are blocked. Based on these results, the authors concluded that increased excitability in certain neurons (NMBR or GRPR neurons) activates pathways leading to sigh generation, with SST neurons serving as a downstream component in converting regular breaths into sighs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors employed a combination of various sophisticated approaches, including optogenetics, chemogenetics, intersectional genetic approach, and slice electrophysiology and calcium imaging, to precisely pinpoint the mechanism responsible for sigh generation. They utilized multiple genetically modified mouse lines, enabling them to selectively manipulate and observe specific neuronal populations involved in sighing.</p>
<p>
Using genetics and calcium imaging, the authors record the neuronal activity of NMBR and GRPR neurons, respectively, and identified their difference in activity pattern. Furthermore, by applying the intersectional approach, the authors were able to genetically target and manipulate several distinct neuronal populations, such as NMBR+, GRPR- neurons and GRPR+, NMBR- neurons, and conducted a detailed characterization of their functions in influencing sighing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors employed two conditions for optogenetic activation: long pulse photostimulation (LPP) and short pulse photostimulation (SPP), with durations ranging from 4-10s for LPP and 100-500 ms for SPP. These could generate huge variability in the experiments. The rationale behind the selection of these conditions in each experiment remains unclear in the manuscript. Additionally, it is not explained why these specific durations were chosen. Furthermore, the interpretation for the varied responses observed under these conditions is not provided. Clarification on the rationale and interpretation of these experimental parameters would enhance the understanding of the results. The description of the experiment conditions should be consistent throughout the manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the fiber optics, my understanding is that they are placed outside of the brainstem from the ventral side. Given the locations of the pF and preBötC neurons, could the differences in responses be attributed to the varying distances of each population from the ventral surface? In fact, in Figure 8, NMBR is illustrated as being closer to the ventral surface. Does it represent the actual location of these neurons?</p>
<p>(3) The results of recording on NMBR neurons in Figure 4 were compelling. However, I'm curious why the recording of GRPR neurons and their response to the neuropeptide were not presented or examined. Additionally, considering the known cross-reaction between peptides and their receptors, it might be worthwhile to investigate how GRP modulates NMBR neurons and how NMB modulates GRPR neurons.</p>
<p>(4) The authors found that activation of several preBötC populations, including NMBR, GRPR, and SST neurons, despite pharmacological inhibition of NMBR and GRPR, can still induce sighing, and concluded that &quot;activation of preBötC NMBRs and/or GRPRs is not necessary for sigh production&quot;. I disagree with this conclusion. Even when the receptors are silenced, artificial (optogenetic or chemogenetic) activation could still activate the same downstream pathways. This cannot be used as evidence to claim that the receptors are not required for sighing in vivo, because it is possible that the receptors are still necessary for the activation of these neurons under natural conditions. For instance, while diaphragm activation induces breathing, it does not negate the crucial role of the nervous system in regulating this process in physiological conditions.</p>
<p>(5) The authors noted varied responses upon activating specific subpopulations of the preBötC neurons, namely NMBR, GRPR, and SST neurons. Could these differences be attributed to variations in viral labeling efficiency among different mouse genetic lines? Are there discrepancies in the number of labeled neurons across the lines? Additionally, the authors did not thoroughly characterize the specificities of AAV targeting in their Cre and Flp lines. It's uncertain whether the AAV-labeled neurons are strictly restricted to the designated population without notable leakage into other populations. This is particularly crucial for the experiments manipulating SST neurons. If there's substantial labeling of NMBR or GRPR neurons, it could undermine the conclusions drawn. Further examination of the precision and selectivity of the labeling techniques is necessary to ensure the accurate interpretation of the experimental findings.</p>
<p>(6) The authors have addressed some of the reviewers' concerns in the revision; however, many important issues remain unaddressed.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) Reviewer 3: Moreover, the conclusion that preBötC NMBR and GRPR activations are unnecessary for sighing is not fully supported by the current experimental design. While the study shows that sighing can still be induced despite pharmacological inhibition of NMBR and GRPR, this does not conclusively prove that these receptors are not required under natural conditions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We concluded that “NMBR and GRPR receptors are not necessary for sigh generation”. We acknowledge that under normal conditions these receptors almost certainly play a role; in fact, microinjection of saporin conjugated to bombesin, which presumably ablates NMBR<sup>+</sup> and GRPR<sup>+</sup> preBötC neurons, completely eliminated endogenous sighing activity in awake mice (Li et al., Nature, 2015). However, that study did not establish that the receptors <italic>per se</italic> are essential in this context, since the protocol ablated not just the receptors but also the preBötC neurons that happened to express these receptors. Here, we show that we could evoke sighs AFTER complete pharmacological blockade of NMBRs <italic>and</italic> GRPRs. Also, we show that sighs can be elicited by stimulation of a distinct subpopulation of preBötC neurons expressing the peptide somatostatin (SST<sup>+</sup>). These results demonstrate that sighs can be evoked in absence of activation of NMBRs and/or GRPRs, leading to the conclusion that NMBRs and/or GRPRs are not required for sighs but rather contribute to periodic sigh generation under normal conditions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Reviewer 1: To make such a novel (and quite surprising) claim requires many more studies and the conclusion is dependent on how the authors have defined a sigh. Moreover, some data within the paper conflicts with this idea.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our definition of sighs was carefully chosen so that it applied across different experimental conditions, including in vitro slices, anesthetized or awake in vivo. We defined sighs as transient changes in minute ventilation on a time scale slower than eupneic breathing period, to avoid classifying breathing after vagotomy or under isoflurane anesthesia as “all-sigh breathing”. This is why induction of persistent large amplitude breaths (such as in Figures 5-6) were not counted as sighs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Reviewer 2: Several key technical aspects of the study require further clarification to aid in interpreting the experimental results, including issues relating to the validation of the transgenic mouse lines and virally transduced expressions of proteins utilized for optogenetic and chemogenetic experiments, as well as justifying the optogenetic photostimulation paradigms used to evoke sighs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The rationale for using SPP and LPP stems from our published observations of the effects of optogenetic stimulation of various preBötC neuronal subpopulations. Thus, SPP and LPP evoke the same responses in GlyT2 (Sherman et al., 2015) and Dbx1 (Cui et al., 2016) neurons, while for other subpopulations, e.g., SST (Cui et al., 2015), the effects of SPP are markedly different from LPP. Hence, in this study we examined both. As effects of SPP and LPP of SST neurons were examined previously (Cui et al., 2016), these protocols were not repeated except for evoking sighs after blockade of NMBR/GRPRs. SPP of pF NMB or GRP did not evoke any respiratory responses and hence were not presented in any figures (see Results, section “Activation of Nmb- or Grp-expressing pF neurons induces sighs”).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Reviewer 3: however, the rationale and experimental details require further explanation, and their impacts on the conclusion require clarification. For instance, how and why the variability in optogenetic activation conditions could impact the experimental outcomes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Refractory periods reported here for pF NMB, pF GRP, preBötC NMBR and preBötC GRPR were all obtained using the same intensity LPP. We acknowledge the possibility, even the likelihood that higher intensity LPP would shorten refractory periods. In line with this, we observed that ectopic sighs were evoked earlier during the LPP as the sigh phase progressed. As described in RESULTS, such effects were observed for pF NMB, pF GRP, preBötC NMBR and preBötC GRPR only and not for preBötC SST, which might suggest that timing of intrinsically generated sighs depends on the NMB-GRP signaling pathway, yet sigh production depends on the SST pathway.</p>
