<title><bold>Abstract</bold></title><p>The <italic>hox</italic> operon in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803, encoding bidirectional hydrogenase responsible for H2 production, is transcriptionally upregulated under microoxic conditions. Although several regulators for <italic>hox</italic> transcription have been identified, their dynamics and higher-order DNA structure of <italic>hox</italic> region in microoxic conditions remain elusive. We focused on key regulators for the <italic>hox</italic> operon: cyAbrB2, a conserved regulator in cyanobacteria, and SigE, an alternative sigma factor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing revealed that cyAbrB2 binds to the <italic>hox</italic> promoter region under aerobic conditions, with its binding being flattened in microoxic conditions. Concurrently, SigE exhibited increased localization to the <italic>hox</italic> promoter under microoxic conditions. Genome-wide analysis revealed that cyAbrB2 binds broadly to AT-rich genome regions and represses gene expression. Moreover, we demonstrated the physical interactions of the <italic>hox</italic> promoter region with its distal genomic loci, and the interactions are lowered in microoxic conditions. In the absence of cyAbrB2, the interactions stayed low both in aerobic and microoxic conditions. From these results, we propose that cyAbrB2 is a cyanobacterial nucleoid- associated protein (NAP), modulating chromosomal conformation, which blocks RNA polymerase from the <italic>hox</italic> promoter in aerobic conditions. We further infer that cyAbrB2, with altered localization pattern upon microoxic conditions, modifies chromosomal conformation in microoxic conditions, which allows SigE-containing RNA polymerase to access the <italic>hox</italic> promoter. The coordinated actions of this NAP and the alternative sigma factor are crucial for the proper <italic>hox</italic> expression in microoxic conditions. Our results highlight the impact of cyanobacterial chromosome conformation and NAPs on transcription, which have been insufficiently investigated.</p>

<title><bold>Introduction</bold></title>
<p>Cyanobacteria carry out oxygenic photosynthesis but sometimes experience microoxic conditions during the night. Subsequently, cyanobacteria perfrom fermentation, using glycolytic products as electron acceptors. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Cyanobacteria have multiple fermentation pathways according to the environment. For example, the freshwater living cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter referred to as <italic>Synechocystis</italic>) produces acetate, lactate, dicarboxylic acids, and hydrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Genetic manipulations on <italic>Synechocystis</italic> have demonstrated that modulating the expression of certain enzymes can alter fermentative metabolic flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). This provides evidence that transcription regulates the fermentative pathway.</p>
<p>Hydrogen has attracted significant attention among other cyanobacterial bioproducts owing to its potential as a biofuel. Bidirectional hydrogenase is a key enzyme for H2 production from protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) and is commonly found in cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Cyanobacterial hydrogenase comprises five subunits (HoxEFUHY) containing nickel and Fe-S clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). This enzyme can utilize NADH, reduced ferredoxin, and flavodoxin as substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Hydrogenase can also use excess electrons from the photosynthetic electron transport chain, but photosystem II-generated oxygen can inhibit its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Another metal-ion-harboring and O2-sensitive enzyme, pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), oxidizes pyruvate to produce acetyl- CoA during fermentation. PFOR works coordinatedly with hydrogenase to reduce ferredoxin, which hydrogenase uses as an electron donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Despite their O2 sensitivity, hydrogenase and PFOR work under mixotrophic (i.e., aerobic) conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Therefore, uncontrolled expression of <italic>hox</italic> operon and <italic>nifJ</italic> may hamper metabolism under photosynthetic conditions or shorten the supply of inorganic cofactors. Thus, transcriptional regulation in response to the environment is essential for optimal energy cost performance.</p>
<p>Promoter recognition by RNA polymerases is an essential step in transcriptional regulation. Sigma factors, subunits of RNA polymerase, recognize core promoter sequences. Transcription factors can also bind to promoter regions to suppress or promote RNA polymerase transcription. As well as recruitment or blocking of RNA polymerase, some transcriptional factors, known as Nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs), modulate chromosomal conformation to regulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). NAPs are common in bacteria, but cyanobacterial NAPs remain unidentified, and higher order of DNA structure in cyanobacteria is yet to be shown. A recent study suggested that the manipulation of chromosomal supercoiling impacts transcriptional properties in cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). There is room for consideration of NAPs modulating chromosomal conformation and regulating expression in cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>In <italic>Synechosysits</italic>, the coding genes of HoxEFUHY form a single operon (sll1220â1226), while PFOR is encoded in the <italic>nifJ</italic> (sll0741) gene. Both <italic>hox</italic> and <italic>nifJ</italic> operons are highly expressed under microoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Genetic analysis has revealed that multiple global transcriptional regulators control <italic>hox</italic> and <italic>nifJ</italic> expression. Sigma factor SigE (Sll1689) promotes the expression of <italic>hox</italic> and <italic>nifJ</italic> operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), while transcription factor cyAbrB2 (Sll0822) represses them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Positive regulators for the <italic>hox</italic> operon include LexA (Sll1626) and cyAbrB1 (Sll0359) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).</p>
<p>SigE, an alternative sigma factor, controls the expression of genes involved in glycogen catabolism and glycolysis, as well as PFOR/<italic>nifJ</italic> and hydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). SigE shares a high amino acid sequence homology with the primary sigma factor SigA, which is responsible for transcribing housekeeping and photosynthetic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). A ChIP-seq study revealed that, while most SigE-binding sites are the same as SigA, SigE exclusively occupies the promoters of glycogen catabolism and glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>
<p>CyAbrB2 and its homolog cyAbrB1 are transcription factors highly conserved in cyanobacteria. For example, cyAbrB homologs in <italic>Anabaena</italic> sp. PCC7120 is involved in heterocyst formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). CyAbrB2 in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> regulates the expression of several genes involved in carbon metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). CyAbrB2 binds to the <italic>hox</italic> promoter <italic>in vitro</italic> and represses its expression <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). CyAbrB1, an essential gene, physically interacts with the cyAbrB2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) and binds the <italic>hox</italic> promotor region <italic>in vitro</italic> to promote its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>).</p>
<p>To explore the dynamics of those transcription factors governing the expression of <italic>hox</italic> operon, we conducted a time-course analysis of the transcriptome and ChIP-seq of SigE and cyAbrB2. Our ChIP-seq and transcriptome analysis showed the NAPs-like nature of cyAbrB2, which prompted us to conduct chromosomal conformation capture assay. 3C analysis revealed the physical interaction between the <italic>hox</italic> promoter region and its downstream and upstream genomic region in the aerobic condition, and that the interaction decreased upon entry to the microoxic condition. Furthermore those interactions in the Î<italic>cyabrB2</italic> mutant were low both in aerobic and microoxic conditions. From those experiments, we propose that cyAbrB2 modulates chromosomal conformation like NAPs, allowing access to the SigE-containing RNA polymerase complex on the <italic>hox</italic> promoter, by which the <italic>hox</italic> operon achieves distinct expression dynamics. Chromosomal conformation of bacteria is a growing area of interest, and the findings of this study have brought insight into the transcriptional regulation of cyanobacteria.</p>

<title>Transcriptomes on entry to dark microoxic conditions</title>
<p>To understand transcriptional regulation under microoxic conditions, we conducted a time-course transcriptome capturing aerobic and microoxic conditions at 1-, 2-, and 4-hours timepoints (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis based on KEGG pathway revealed that many biological pathways, including photosynthesis and respiration (oxidative phosphorylation), were downregulated under microoxic conditions compared to aerobic conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Upregulated pathways included butanoate metabolism and two-component systems, but the actual cyanobacterial catabolic pathway differed slightly from that described in the KEGG pathway. Within 1 hour of switching from aerobic to microoxic conditions, the expression levels of 508 genes increased more than 2-fold. Furthermore, genes with increased expression levels were classified into four based on the time-course (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Of the 508 genes, 28 were termed âtransiently upregulated genesâ due to their decreased expression upon the comparison of 1- and 4- hours incubation under microoxic conditions (log2 fold change &lt; â0.5), and 119 were termed âcontinuously upregulated genes.â, which continuously increased between 1- and 4-hours incubation under microoxic conditions (log2-fold change &gt; 0.5). Other than 508 genes 2-fold upregulated within 1 hour, 28 genes showed more than 4-fold increment within 4 hours but not upregulated within 1 hour. We combined those âLate upregulated genesâ with 508 genes and referred to as âAll upregulated genesâ in the subsequent analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Mapping the classified genes to central carbon metabolism revealed that <italic>nifJ</italic> encoding PFOR and <italic>hox</italic> operon encoding a bidirectional hydrogenase complex were transiently upregulated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

<title>SigE and cyAbrB2 control the expression of transiently upregulated genes</title>
<p>The functional correlation between hydrogenase and PFOR, encoded by the <italic>hox</italic> operon and <italic>nifJ,</italic> suggests that transient upregulation has physiological significance. We focused on transiently upregulated genes and attempted to reveal the regulatory mechanism underlying transient upregulation. While SigE promotes the expression of <italic>hox</italic> and <italic>nifJ</italic>, cyAbrB2 represses them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). We confirmed that the deletion of <italic>sigE</italic> and <italic>cyabrb2</italic> (Î<italic>sigE</italic> and Î<italic>cyabrb2</italic>, respectively) affected the expression of <italic>hoxF</italic>, <italic>hoxH</italic>, and <italic>nifJ</italic> by RT- qPCR (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, we conducted a time-course transcriptome analysis of Î<italic>sigE</italic> and Î<italic>cyabrb2</italic> under aerobic conditions and after 1- and 2-hours cultivation in dark microoxic conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and S2A).</p>

<p>The transcriptome data confirmed that SigE and cyAbrB2 regulated <italic>hox</italic> operon expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). At each time point, we searched for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between mutants and wildtype with a more than 2-fold expression change and a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05. We found that deleting <italic>sigE</italic> or <italic>cyabrb2</italic> preferentially affected the expression of transiently upregulated genes, not limited to <italic>hox</italic> and <italic>nifJ</italic> operons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>cyabrb2</italic> deletion resulted in the upregulated expression of transient genes under aerobic conditions, in contrast to 1-hour cultivation under microoxic conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>Genome-wide analysis of cyAbrB2, cyAbrB1, and SigE via ChIP-seq</title>
<p>To decipher the regulatory mechanism of transiently upregulated genes, we must first comprehend the fundamental features and functions of these transcriptional regulators. Therefore, a genome-wide survey of cyAbrB2 and SigE occupation (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>) combined with transcriptome data was done. Specifically, we generated a <italic>Synechocystis</italic> strain in which cyAbrB2 was epitope-tagged and performed a ChIP-seq assay under aerobic and microoxic conditions (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2B</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2C</xref>). SigE-tagged strains previously constructed and analyzed elsewhere were also employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). The primary sigma factor SigA was also analyzed to determine SigE-specific binding. In addition to cyAbrB2, we tagged and analysed cyAbrB1, which is the interactor of cyAbrB2 and positively regulates the <italic>hox</italic> operon.</p>

<title>CyAbrB2 binds to long tracts of the genomic region and suppresses genes in the binding region</title>
<p>The ChIP-seq data showed that cyAbrB2 bound to long tracts of the genomic region with lower GC content than the whole genome <italic>Synechocystis</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Vice versa, regions exhibiting lower GC contents showed a greater binding signal of cyAbrB2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). This correlation was not a systematic bias of next-generation sequencing because the binding signals of SigE, SigA, and control showed no negative correlation to GC contents (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>). The binding regions of cyAbrB2 called by peak-caller covered 15.7% of the entire genome length. 805 of 3614 genes overlapped with cyAbrB2 binding regions, and almost half (399 of 805 genes) were entirely covered by cyAbrB2 binding regions. The cyAbrB2 binding regions included 80 of 125 insertion sequence elements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Comparison with the transcriptome of Î<italic>cyabrB2</italic> revealed cyAbrB2 tended to suppress the genes overlapping with its binding regions under aerobic conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). A survey of the genomic localization of cyAbrB1 under aerobic conditions revealed that cyAbrB1 and cyAbrB2 shared similar binding patterns (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and S4C). Due to the essentiality of cyAbrB1, we did not perform transcriptome analysis on a cyAbrB1- disrupted strain.</p>

<title>Physiological significance of transient upregulation of <italic>hox</italic> and <italic>nifJ</italic> operons</title>
<p>The transcriptional upregulation of fermentative genes in response to the microoxic condition is adaptive for energy acquisition. Our time-course transcriptome showed upregulation of several genes involved in catabolism upon exposure to the microoxic condition. The transient upregulation of <italic>hox</italic> and <italic>nifJ</italic> operons is distinctive among them (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>The reason for transient upregulation may be the resource constraints of inorganic cofactors and the reusability of fermentative products. Hydrogenase and PFOR (the product of <italic>nifJ</italic> gene) have ironâsulfur clusters, and hydrogenase requires nickel for its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Continuous expression of the <italic>hox</italic> operon should be futile under physiological conditions, as the overexpression of <italic>hoxEFUYH</italic> and <italic>hypABDCEF</italic> (hydrogenase maturation factors) does not yield a proportional increase in hydrogenase activity without an adequate nickel supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Furthermore, hydrogenase-produced H2 is diffusive and thus difficult to store and reuse as reducing power when cells return to aerobic conditions. Unlike hydrogen fermentation, the reverse tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle produces dicarboxylic acids, which are reusable for generating NADPH via the TCA cycle under aerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). However, adding bicarbonate to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is a rate-limiting step in the rTCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Hydrogenase may favor fermentation initiation since it uses only protons as a substrate, and the rTCA cycle may become active subsequently. In fact, <italic>citH</italic>/<italic>mdh</italic> (sll0891) encoding a key enzyme of the rTCA cycle was classified as continuously upregulated genes in this study (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Mechanisms for transient expression mediated by SigE and cyAbrB2</title>
<p>SigE and cyAbrB2 can independently contribute to the transient transcriptional upregulation.

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Three types of the localization pattern and function of cyAbrB2</title>
<p>Herein, we classified three types of binding patterns for cyAbrB2 based on the ChIP-seq data of cyAbrB2. The first is that cyAbrB2 binds a long DNA tract covering the entire gene or operon, represented by the insertion sequence elements. CyAbrB2 suppresses expression in this pattern, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>. In the second pattern, cyAbrB2 binds on promoter regions, such as <italic>hox</italic> operon and <italic>nifJ</italic>. Binding on those promoters fluctuates in response to environmental changes, thus regulating expression. This pattern also applies to the promoter of <italic>sbtA</italic> (Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO3<sup>â</sup> symporter), as the previous study reported that cyAbrB2 is bound to the <italic>sbtA</italic> promoter in a CO2 concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). The last one is cyAbrB2 binding in the middle or downstream of operons. The middle of <italic>hox</italic>, <italic>pntAB</italic>, and <italic>nifJ</italic> operons and the downstream of <italic>nrt</italic> operon are the cases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Our data show that genes in the same operon separated by the cyAbrB2 binding region behave differently. In particular, <italic>pntB</italic> is classified as the transiently upregulated gene, while <italic>pntA</italic> is not, despite being in the same operon. This might be explained by the recent study which reported that cyAbrB2 affects the stability of mRNA transcribed from its binding gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). The cyAbrB2-mediated stability of mRNA may also account for the decrease in transcript from transient upregulated genes at 4 hours of cultivation. Hereafter, we will focus on the mechanism of the second pattern, regulation by cyAbrB2 on the promoter.</p>

<sec id="s3d">
<title>Insights into transcriptional regulation of <italic>hox</italic> operon and <italic>nifJ</italic></title>
<p>Genome-wide analysis indicates that the cyAbrB2-bound region blocks SigE and SigA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). This is presumably because sigma factors recognize the promoter as a large complex of RNA polymerase. CyAbrB2 binds to the <italic>hox and nifJ</italic> promoter region and may inhibit access to RNA polymerase complex under aerobic conditions. When cells entered microoxic conditions, the binding pattern of cyAbrB2 on the <italic>hox</italic> and <italic>nifJ</italic> promoters got less specific, and SigE binding peaks on those promoters became prominent (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Notably, cyAbrB2 ChIP efficiency at the <italic>hox</italic> promoter is higher in the microoxic condition than in the aerobic condition (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5C</xref>). Hence, the mechanism by which cyAbrB2 inhibits SigE-containing RNAP in the aerobic condition is not solely based on exclusion by occupancy. Rather, it is plausible that chromosomal conformation change governed by cyAbrB2 provides SigE- containing RNAP with access to the promoter region (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

<title>Chromosomal conformation in <italic>hox</italic> region changes according to the environmental change</title>
<p>3C analysis demonstrated the interaction between the <italic>hox</italic> promoter and its distal genomic region, which decreased on entry to the microoxic condition. CyAbrB2 mediates the interaction between the <italic>hox</italic> fragment and the distal downstream region. The observed conformational change correlates with the expression of the <italic>hox</italic> operon, though further investigations are needed to establish causality (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B</xref> and S7, locus (f), (g), and (j)). A recent study demonstrated that manipulating the expression of topoisomerase, which influence chromosomal conformational change through supercoiling, affect transcriptional properties in cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Moreover, Song et al. pointed out that DNA looping may inhibit transcription in cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) because artificial DNA looping by the LacI repressor of <italic>E. coli</italic> can repress cyanobacterial transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Thus, we infer conformation change detected by the present 3C experiment regulates expression of <italic>hox</italic> operon.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3f">
<title>A possible mechanism for cyAbrB2-mediated chromosomal conformation</title>
<p>The <italic>hox</italic> promoter region possesses the cyAbrB2 binding region, and locus (c) is adjacent to the cyAbrB2 binding region. Consequently, cyAbrB2 may mediate chromosomal conformation by bridging its binding regions, as other NAPs do. However, no biochemical data mentioned the DNA bridging function of cyAbrB2 in the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). CyAbrB1, the homolog of cyAbrB2, may cooperatively work, as cyAbrB1 directly interacts with cyAbrB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), and their distribution is similar (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In the microoxic condition, cyAbrB2 binding became blurry, which might reduce the specific interaction between the <italic>hox</italic> region and locus (c). On the other hand, cyAbrB2 indirectly mediates interaction with its proximal upstream region (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, locus (j)), as this region is devoid of cyAbrB2 binding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> locus (i) to (l)).</p>

<title>Generality for chromosomal conformation in cyanobacteria</title>
<p>Our 3C analysis revealed that local chromosomal conformation changes upon entry to the microoxic conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). As cyAbrB2 occupies about 15% of the entire genome and globally regulates gene expression, cyAbrB2 likely governs the whole chromosomal conformation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Furthermore, the conformational changes occur in both AbrB2-dependent and AbrB2-independent manners. Cyanobacteria face various environmental changes besides the microoxic condition, and there are potential NAPs in cyanobacteria yet to be characterized. It is speculated that conformational change of the entire chromosome occurs to deal with many environmental stresses.</p>

<sec id="s3h">
<title>The sigE-mediated mechanism for the transient expression</title>
<p>One possible SigE-mediated mechanism for transient expression is the post-transcriptional activation and degradation of SigE in the dark; i.e., SigE is sequestered by binding to the H subunit of Magnesium- chelatase under light conditions and released under dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), enabling acute transcription of <italic>hox</italic> operon and <italic>nifJ</italic>. Transcripts of <italic>sigE</italic> were continuously downregulated in our time-course transcriptome, while <italic>sigB</italic> (sll0306) and <italic>sigC</italic> (sll0184) were classified as continuous upregulated genes (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplemental Table S1</xref>). It is possible that upregulated SigB and SigC outcompete SigE in prolonged incubation under microoxic conditions. Finally, SigE is degraded under dark within 24 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).</p>
<p>Another reason for the microoxic specific expression may exist in the sequence of the <italic>hox</italic> promoter. We previously determined the consensus sequence of -10 element for SigE regulon in the aerobic condition as âTANNNT,â where N is rich in cytosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). The -10 sequence of the <italic>hox</italic> promoter âTAACA<underline>A</underline>â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) deviates from the consensus, and no hexamer precisely fitting the consensus are found in the <italic>nifJ</italic> promoter. This deviation can inhibit SigE from binding during aerobic conditions, aside from cyAbrB2-mediated inhibition. Under the microoxic condition, transcription factors LexA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and Rre34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) may aid SigE binding to the promoter of <italic>hox</italic> and <italic>nifJ</italic>, respectively. Overall, multiple environmental signals are integrated into the <italic>hox</italic> and <italic>nifJ</italic> promoter through the cyAbrB2 and SigE dynamics.</p>

EdgeR package (ver. 3.40.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) was used to perform the differential expression analysis. Fold changes in expression and FDR were used for gene classification. Supplemental Table S6-S8 contains fold change in gene expression calculated by edgeR.</p>

<p>Peaks were called using the MACS3 program (ver. 3.0.0b1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). For paired-end reads for SigE, SigA, and untagged control ChIP, narrow peaks were called with &lt;1eâ20 of the q-value cut-off and â--call- summitsâ options. The peak summits from two replicates and the untagged control were merged if summits were located within 40 bp of each other. Peak summits identified in both replicates but not in the control, were considered for further analysis. The midpoint of the peak summits for the two merged replicates was further analyzed.</p>
<p>Broad peak calling methods were applied to paired-end reads for cyAbrB2, cyAbrB1, and untagged control ChIP using the ââbroadâ option, with a q-value cut-off of &lt; 0.05 and a q-value broad cut-off of &lt; 0.05. The intersection of broad peaks from two replicates, excluding those called by the control, was used in subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>The positions of the TSS, including internal start sites, were obtained as reported by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). The read count, merging, and the intersection of the binding region were calculated using BEDTools (ver. 2.30.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Supplemental Tables S9âS15 contain SigA and SigE peaks and the broad binding regions of cyAbrB2 and cyAbrB1, respectively.</p>
<p>Binding signals in every 100 bp bin for scatter plots were calculated as (IP read counts within 100 bp window) / (input read counts within 100 bp window) * (total input read counts/total IP read counts). GC contents were calculated within 500 bp in 100 bp sliding windows by seqkit (ver. 2.3.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>).</p>

<title>Genome extraction, digestion, and ligation for 3C assay</title>
<p>A 3C assay was conducted based on the previous prokaryotic Hi-C experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), with certain steps modified. To begin, <italic>Synechocystis</italic> were fixed with 2.5% formaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature. Fixation was terminated by adding a final concentration of 0.5M of glycine, and cells were stored at -80Â°C until use. Fixed cells were disrupted using glass beads and shake master NEO (Bio Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan), following the previous studyâs instructions for preparing cell lysate for ChIP. The lysates were incubated with buffer containing 1mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 0.1mM EDTA, and 0.5% SDS for 10min at room temperature, and 1% Triton X-100 quenched SDS. Genomes in the cell lysate were digested by 600U/mL of HindIII (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) for 4 hours at 37Â°C, and RNA in the lysate was simultaneously removed by 50 Âµg/mL of RNaseA (Nippon genetics, Tokyo, Japan). The digestion was terminated by adding 1% SDS and 22 mM EDTA. The fill-in reaction and biotin labeling steps were omitted from the procedure. The digested genomes were diluted by ligation buffer containing 1% triton-X100 to the final concentration of approximately 1Âµg/mL and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Ligation was performed with 2 U/mL of T4 DNA ligase (Nippon Gene) overnight at 16Â°C. Crosslinking was reversed under 65Â°C for 4 hours in the presence of 2.5 mg/mL of proteinase K (Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan), and DNA was purified with the phenol-chloroform method and ethanol precipitation method.</p>

<title>Preparation of calibration samples for 3C qPCR</title>
<p>Based on a previous study, calibration samples for possible ligated pairs were prepared in parallel with 3C ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). In brief, the purified genome of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> was digested by HindIII, and DNA was purified with the phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation. Purified DNA was dissolved into the ligation buffer at a concentration of about 600ng/ÂµL and ligated with 2 U/mL of T4 DNA ligase at 16Â°C overnight. As a result, DNA â¼600-fold condensed DNA than 3C samples were ligated.</p>

<title>Quantification of crosslinking frequency for 3C assay</title>
<p>Before the real-time PCR assay, we confirmed that each primer set amplified single bands in a ligation- dependent manner by GoTaq Hot Start Green Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI) (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>). Real-time PCR was performed with StepOnePlus (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Interaction frequency was calculated by ÎÎCt method using dilution series of calibration samples described above. We confirmed each primer set amplified DNA fragment with a unique Tm value. The amount of the bait fragment containing <italic>hox</italic> operon were quantified and used as an internal control. Supplemental Table S4 contains the list of primers used in the 3C quantification. Interaction frequency for each primer position was calculated as the relative abundance of ligated fragments against the calibration samples and normalized among samples by internal control.</p>

<p>Strength:</p>
<p>
At first glance, I had a very positive impression of the overall manuscript. The experiments were well done, the data presentation looks very structured, and the text reads well in principle.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>
Having a closer look, the red line of the manuscript is somewhat blurry. Reading the abstract, the introduction, and parts of the discussion, it is not really clear what the authors exactly aim to target. Is it the regulation of fermentation in cyanobacteria because it is under-investigated? Is it to bring light to the transcriptional regulation of hydrogenase genes? The regulation by SigE? Or is it to get insight into the real function of cyAbrB2 in cyanobacteria? All of this would be good of course. But it appears that the authors try to integrate all these aspects, which in the end is a little bit counterintuitive and in some places even confusing. From my point of view, the major story is a functional investigation of the presumable transcriptional regulator cyAbrB2, which turned out to be a potential NAP. To demonstrate/prove this, the hox genes have been chosen as an example due to the fact that a regulatory role of cyAbrB2 has already been described. In my eyes, it would be good to restructure or streamline the introduction according to this major outcome.</p>
<p>Points to consider:</p>
<p>
The authors suggest that the microoxic condition is the reason for the downregulation of e.g. photosynthesis (l.112-114). But of course, they also switched off the light to achieve a microoxic environment, which presumably is the trigger signal for photosynthesis-related genes. I suggest avoiding making causal conclusions exclusively related to oxygen and recommend rephrasing (for example, &quot;were downregulated under the conditions applied&quot;).</p>
<p>The authors hypothesized that cyAbrB2 modulates chromosomal conformation and conducted a 3C analysis. But if I read the data in Figure 5B &amp; C correctly, there is a lot of interaction in a range of 1650 and 1700 kb, not only at marked positions c and j. Positions c and j have been picked because it appears that cyAbrB2 deletion impacts this particular interaction. But is it really significant? In the case of position j the variation between the replicates seems quite high, in the case of position c the mean difference is not that high. Moreover, does all this correlate with cyAbrB2 binding, i.e. with positions of gray bars in panel A? If this was the case, the data obtained for the cyabrB2 mutant should look totally different but they are quite similar to WT. That's why the sentence &quot;By contrast, the interaction frequency in Îcyabrb2 mutant were low and unchanged in the aerobic and microoxic conditions&quot; does not fit to the data shown. But I have to mention that I am not an expert in these kinds of assays. Nevertheless, if there is a biological function that shall be revealed by an experiment, the data must be crystal clear on that. At least the descriptions of the 3C data and the corresponding conclusions need to be improved. For me, it is hard to follow the authors' thoughts in this context.</p>
<p>The figures are nicely prepared, albeit quite complex and in some cases not really supportive of the understanding of the results description. Moreover, they show a rather loose organization that sometimes does not fit the red line of the results section. For example, Figure 1D is not mentioned in the paragraph that refers to several other panels of the same figure (see lines110-128). Panel 1D is mentioned later in the discussion. Does 1D really fit into Figure 1 then? Are all the panels indeed required to be shown in the main document? As some elements are only briefly mentioned, the authors might also consider moving some into the supplement (e.g. left part of Figure 1C, Figure 2A, Figure 3B ...) or at least try to distribute some panels into more figures. This would reduce complexity and increase comprehensibility for future readers. Also, Figure 3 is a way too complex. Panel G could be an alone-standing figure. The latter would also allow for an increase in font sizes or to show ChIP data of both conditions (L+O2 and D-O2) separately. Moreover, a figure legend typically introduces the content as a whole by one phrase but here only the different panels are described, which fits to the impression that all the different panels are not well connected. Of course, it is the decision of the authors what to present and how but may they consider restructuring and simplifying.</p>
<p>The authors assume a physiological significance of transient upregulation of e.g. hox genes under microoxic conditions. But does the hydrogenase indeed produce hydrogen under the conditions investigated and is this even required? Moreover, the authors use the term &quot;fermentative gene&quot;. But is hydrogen indeed a fermentation product, i.e. are protons the terminal electron acceptor to achieve catabolic electron balance? Then huge amounts of hydrogen should be released. Comment should be made on this.</p>
<p>The authors also mention a reverse TCA cycle. But is its existence an assumption or indeed active in cyanobacteria, i.e. is it experimentally proven? The authors are a little bit vague in this regard (see lines 241-246).</p>

<p>This work probes the control of the hox operon in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis, where this operon directs the synthesis of a bidirectional hydrogenase that functions to produce hydrogen. In assessing the control of the hox system, the authors focused on the relative contributions of cyAbrB2, alongside SigE (and to a lesser extent, SigA and cyAbrB1) under both aerobic and microoxic conditions. In mapping the binding sites of these different proteins, they discovered that cyAbrB2 bound many sites throughout the chromosome repressed many of its target genes, and preferentially bound regions that were (relatively) rich in AT-residues. These characteristics led the authors to consider that cyAbrB2 may function as a nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) in Synechocystis, given its functional similarities with other NAPs like H-NS. They assessed the local chromosome conformation in both wild-type and cyabrB2 mutant strains at multiple sites within a 40 kb window on either side of the hox locus, using a region within the hox operon as bait. They concluded that cyAbrB2 functions as a nucleoid-associated protein that influences the activity of SigE through its modulation of chromosome architecture.</p>
<p>The authors approached their experiments carefully, and the data were generally very clearly presented and described.</p>
<p>Based on the data presented, the authors make a strong case for cyAbrB2 as a nucleoid-associated protein, given the multiple ways in which it seems to function similarly to the well-studied Escherichia coli H-NS protein. It would be helpful to provide some additional commentary within the discussion around the similarities and differences of cyAbrB2 to other nucleoid-associated proteins, and possible mechanisms of cyAbrB2 control (post-translational modification; protein-protein interactions; etc.). The manuscript would also be strengthened with the inclusion of biochemical experiments probing the binding of cyAbrB2, particularly focussing on its oligomerization and DNA polymerization/bridging potential.</p>
<p>Previous work had revealed a role for SigE in the control of hox cluster expression, which nicely justified its inclusion (and focus) in this study. However, the results of the SigA studies here suggested that SigA both strongly associated with the hox promoter, and its binding sites were shared more frequently than SigE with cyAbrB2. The focus on cyAbrB2 is also well-justified, given previous reports of its control of hox expression; however, it shares binding sites with an essential homologue cyAbrB1. Interestingly, while the B1 protein appears to bind similar sites, instead of repressing hox expression, it is known as an activator of this operon. It seems important to consider how cyAbrB1 activity might influence the results described here.</p>
