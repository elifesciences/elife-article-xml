<title>Abstract</title><p>The role of striatal pathways in cognitive processing is unclear. We studied dorsomedial striatal cognitive processing during interval timing, an elementary cognitive task that requires mice to estimate intervals of several seconds, which involves working memory for temporal rules as well as attention to the passage of time. We harnessed optogenetic tagging to record from striatal D2-dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs) in the indirect pathway and from D1-dopamine receptor-expressing MSNs (D1-MSNs) in the direct pathway. We found that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs exhibited opposing dynamics over temporal intervals as quantified by principal component analyses and trial-by-trial generalized linear models. MSN recordings helped construct and constrain a four-parameter drift-diffusion computational model. This model predicted that disrupting either D2-MSN or D1-MSNs would increase interval timing response times and alter MSN firing. In line with this prediction, we found that optogenetic inhibition or pharmacological disruption of either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs increased response times. Pharmacologically disrupting D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs also increased response times, shifted MSN dynamics, and degraded trial-by-trial temporal decoding. Together, our findings demonstrate that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs make complementary contributions to interval timing despite opposing dynamics, implying that striatal direct and indirect pathways work together to shape temporal control of action. These data provide novel insight into basal ganglia cognitive operations beyond movement and have implications for a broad range of human striatal diseases and for therapies targeting striatal pathways.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The basal ganglia have been heavily studied in motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Albin et al., 1989</xref>). These subcortical nuclei are composed of two pathways defined by medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum: the indirect pathway, defined by D2-dopamine receptor-expressing MSNs (D2-MSNs) and the direct pathway, defined by D1-dopamine receptor-expressing MSNs (D1-MSNs). It has been proposed that the indirect and direct pathways play opposing roles in movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alexander and Crutcher, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cruz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>), although recent work identified how these pathways can play more complex and complementary roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tecuapetla et al., 2016</xref>). MSNs receive dense input from both motor and cognitive cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Averbeck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Graybiel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Middleton and Strick, 2000</xref>), but the respective roles of D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs in cognitive processing are largely unknown. Understanding basal ganglia cognitive processing is critical for diseases affecting the striatum such as Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andreasen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hinton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Narayanan and Albin, 2022</xref>). Furthermore, pharmacological and brain stimulation therapies directly modulate D2-MSNs, D1-MSNs, and downstream basal ganglia structures such as the globus pallidus or subthalamic nucleus. Determining basal ganglia pathway dynamics cognition will help avoid side effects of current treatments and inspire novel therapeutic directions.</p>
<p>We studied striatal D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs during an elementary cognitive task, interval timing. This task requires estimating an interval of several seconds and provides an ideal platform to study cognition in the striatum because 1) interval timing requires cognitive resources including working memory for temporal rules and attention to the passage of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Parker et al., 2013</xref>); 2) it is reliably impaired in human striatal diseases such as Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Merchant and de Lafuente, 2014</xref>); 3) interval timing requires nigrostriatal dopamine that modulates MSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Emmons et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gouvea et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Matell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Monteiro et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wang et al., 2018</xref>); and 4) can be rigorously studied in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Balci et al., 2008</xref>). Past work has shown that disrupting D2-dopamine receptors (D2s) in the dorsomedial striatum powerfully impairs interval timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">De Corte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Drew et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Meck, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stutt et al., 2023</xref>). These studies have also suggested that D1-dopamine receptors (D1s) are involved in interval timing. We and others have found that striatal MSNs encode time across multiple intervals by time-dependent ramping activity, or monotonic changes in firing rate across a temporal interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Emmons et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gouvea et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wang et al., 2018</xref>); however, the respective roles of D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs are unknown. Prior motor studies predict that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs will exhibit opposing dynamics during interval timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alexander and Crutcher, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cruz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tecuapetla et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>We investigated dorsomedial striatal MSNs during interval timing with a combination of optogenetics, neuronal ensemble recording, computational modeling, and behavioral pharmacology. We use a well-described mouse-optimized interval timing task in which switching responses between two nosepokes reflects temporal control of action<underline><sup>1–</sup></underline><sup>4</sup>. Strikingly, optogenetic tagging of D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs revealed that these populations have opposing neuronal dynamics, with D2-MSNs increasing firing over an interval and D1-MSNs decreasing firing over the same interval. MSN dynamics helped construct and constrain a four-parameter drift-diffusion model of interval timing. This model predicted that disrupting either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs would increase interval timing response times. Accordingly, we found that optogenetic inhibition of either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs increased interval timing response times. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of either D2- or D1-receptors also increased response times and degraded trial-by-trial temporal decoding from MSN ensembles. Thus, D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs have opposing temporal dynamics yet disrupting either MSN type produced similar effects on behavior. These data demonstrate that striatal pathways play complementary roles in elementary cognitive operations and are highly relevant for understanding the pathophysiology of human diseases and therapies targeting the striatum.</p>

<title>D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs have opposite patterns of temporal encoding</title>
<p>We investigated cognitive processing in the striatum using a well described mouse-optimized interval timing task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Balci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bruce et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Larson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tosun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Weber et al., 2023</xref>), which required mice to respond by switching between two nosepokes after an ∼6 second interval (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>; see Methods). We focus on the time that mice depart the first nosepoke as the switch ‘response’. Departing the first nosepoke is guided by temporal control of action because no external cue indicates when to switch from the first to the second nosepoke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Balci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bruce et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tosun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Weber et al., 2023</xref>). Responses are infrequent early in the interval, peak after 6 seconds and taper off before the end of the 18-second trial, after which mice collect a 20 mg sucrose reward (data from 30 wild-type mice; response times (response time median (IQR) = 8.2 (7.2-9.8) seconds; see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for a summary of experiments; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B-C</xref>). Movement peaked before 6 seconds as animals traveled to the front nosepoke (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1A-B</xref>). The first nosepokes occurred before switching responses and the second nosepokes occurred much later in the interval in anticipation of reward delivered at 18 seconds (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1C-D</xref>). We studied dorsomedial striatal D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs using a combination of optogenetics and neuronal ensemble recordings in 9 transgenic mice (4 D2-Cre mice: response time 9.75 (7.02-10.35) seconds; 5 D1-Cre mice: 8.19 (7.69-8.72) seconds; rank sum <italic>p</italic> = 0.73; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>Striatal neuronal populations are largely composed of MSNs expressing D2-dopamine or D1-dopamine receptors. We optogenetically tagged D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs by implanting optrodes in the dorsomedial striatum and conditionally expressing channelrhodopsin (ChR2; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2</xref>) in 4 D2-Cre (2 female) and 5 D1-Cre transgenic mice (2 female). This approach expressed ChR2 in D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A-B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kim et al., 2017a</xref>). We identified D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs by their spiking response to 5 millisecond pulses of 473-nm light (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2B-C</xref>). We tagged 32 D2-MSNs and 41 D1-MSNs in a single recording session during interval timing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C-F</xref>). There were no consistent differences in overall firing rate between D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs (D2-MSNs: 3.4 (1.5-7.2) Hz; D1-MSNs 5.2 (3.1-8.6) Hz; F=2.7, p=0.11 controlling for effects across individual mice). However, over the 6-second interval immediately after trial start, we discovered that D2-MSN populations appeared to ramp up (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>) while D1-MSN populations appeared to ramp down (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref>). These data suggest that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs might exhibit opposing dynamics during interval timing.</p>

</fig>
<p>To quantify differences in D2-MSNs vs D1-MSNs, we turned to principal component analysis (PCA), a data-driven tool to capture the diversity of neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kim et al., 2017a</xref>). We analyzed MSN populations calculated from peri-event matrices from D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs over the 6-second interval immediately after trial start. PCA identified time-dependent ramping activity as PC1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), a key temporal signal that explained 56% of variance among tagged MSNs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Narayanan, 2016</xref>). In line with population averages from <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>&amp;H, D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs had opposite patterns of activity with negative PC1 scores for D2-MSNs and positive PC1 scores for D1-MSNs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>; PC1 for D2-MSNs: -5.1 (-6.4–3.4); PC1 for D1-MSNs: 4.21 (-4.5–6.9); F=8.7, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004 controlling for effects across individual mice; Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.7; no reliable effect of sex (p=0.81) or switching direction (p=0.36)). Thus, PCA analyses also showed that D2-MSN populations ramped up, while D1-MSN populations ramped down.</p>

C) Differences between D2-MSNs (red) and D1-MSNs (blue) were captured by PC1 which exhibited time-dependent ramping. D) These differences were also apparent in the linear slope of firing rate vs time in the interval, with D1-MSNs (blue) having a more negative slope than D2-MSNs (red). The differences were unlikely to be driven by movement because most responses occur after 6 seconds, our GLMs included nosepokes as a regressor, and nosepoke GLM βs were similar between D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs.

</fig>
<p>To interrogate these dynamics at a trial-by-trial level, we calculated the linear slope of D2-MSN and D1-MSN activity over the first 6 seconds of each trial using generalized linear modeling (GLM) of trial-by-trial firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Latimer et al., 2015</xref>). Nosepokes were included as a regressor for movement. GLM analysis also demonstrated that D2-MSNs had a positive linear slope of firing rate vs time in the interval (0.02 spikes/second (-0.07–0.21)), implying that D2-MSNs ramped up compared to D1-MSNs, which ramped down (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>; negative linear slope of -0.14 spikes/second (-0.35–0.01); F=5.6, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04 controlling for effects across individual mice; Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.7; no reliable effect of sex (p=0.18) or switching direction (p=0.41)). These findings are in line with population averages in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>&amp;H as well as PCA results in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A-C</xref>, and could not be fully explained by movement because 1) few responses occurred before 6 seconds (23%) and 44% of tagged neurons were recorded in sessions without a single nosepoke before 6 seconds (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B-C</xref>), 2) our GLM included a regressor accounting for the nosepokes when present, and 3) nosepoke GLM βs were not reliably different between D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs (rank sum <italic>p</italic> = 0.61). Furthermore, differences between D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs were consistent over the entire 0–18 second interval (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3</xref>). Together, these data provide convergent evidence that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs had opposing dynamics during the interval timing task.</p>
<p>Striatal MSNs can predict response times during interval timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gouvea et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mello et al., 2015</xref>). We examined how D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs predicted response times during our task. For each mouse, we divided response times into tertiles. Then, we used MSN ensembles to predict response time tertiles using neural network-based machine-learning classifiers. We found that response time predictions did not reliably differ between D2-MSN ensembles and D1-MSN ensembles (classifier prediction accuracy from D2-MSN ensembles: 38% (32%-42%); from D1-MSN ensembles: 38% (30%-56%); rank sum <italic>p</italic> = 0.68).</p>
<p>In summary, we used optogenetic tagging to record from D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs during interval timing. Although MSN activity is diverse (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E-F</xref>), linear differences both in slope and PC1 captured differences between D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs, suggesting that D2 MSNs and D1-MSNs had opposing dynamics during interval timing. These data provide insight into temporal processing by striatal MSNs.</p>

<title>Drift-diffusion models of opposing D2-MSN and D1-MSN dynamics</title>
<p>Our data demonstrate that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs have opposite activity patterns. However, past computational models of interval timing have relied on drift-diffusion dynamics with a positive slope that accumulates evidence over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Simen et al., 2011</xref>). To reconcile how these MSNs might complement to effect temporal control of action, we constructed a four-parameter drift-diffusion model (DDM), where <italic>x</italic> represents the neuronal firing rate, <italic>t</italic> represents time measured in seconds, and <italic>dx</italic> and <italic>dt</italic> mean “change” in <italic>x</italic> and <italic>t</italic> respectively (equivalent to the derivative <italic>dx</italic>⁄<italic>dt</italic>):

<p>This instantiation of DDMs captured the complimentary D2-MSN and D1-MSN dynamics that we discovered in our optogenetic tagging experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G-H</xref> vs. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A-B</xref>). The model’s parameters were chosen as: <italic>F</italic> = 1, <italic>b</italic> = 0.52 (so <italic>T</italic> = 0.87), <italic>D</italic> = 0.135, <italic>σ</italic> = 0.053 for intact D2-MSNs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, in black); and <italic>F</italic> = 0, <italic>b</italic> = 0.48 (so <italic>T</italic> = 0.12), <italic>D</italic> = 0.141, <italic>σ</italic> = 0.053 for intact D1-MSNs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>, in black). Interestingly, we observed that two-parameter gamma distributions almost perfectly accounted for the model dynamics (D2-MSNs: Gamma parameters α = 6.08, β = 0.69, R<sup>2</sup> vs Model = 0.99; D1-MSNs α = 5.89, β = 0.69; R<sup>2</sup> vs Model = 0.99; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C-D</xref>, dotted black lines). Gamma distributions provided a surprisingly good approximation for the probability distribution and cumulative distribution functions of mouse response times (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B-C</xref>). Thus, in the next sections, we used gamma distributions as a proxy for both the distribution of times generated by the model and the distribution of mice response times, when comparing those for the goodness of fit.</p>
<p>Our model provided the opportunity to computationally explore the consequences of disrupting D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs. Because both D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs accumulate temporal evidence, disrupting either MSN type in the model changed the slope.

<title>Disrupting D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs increases response times</title>
<p>DDMs captured opposing MSN dynamics and predicted that disrupting either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs should slow temporal processing and increase response times (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). We tested this idea with optogenetics. We bilaterally implanted fiber optics and virally expressed the inhibitory opsin halorhodopsin in the dorsomedial striatum of 10 D2-Cre mice (5 female) to inhibit D2-MSNs (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4</xref>; this group of mice was entirely separate from the optogenetic tagging mice).

</fig>
<p>Next, we investigated D1-MSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>). In 6 D1-Cre mice (3 female), optogenetic inhibition of dorsomedial striatal D1-MSNs increased response times (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C-D</xref>; Laser Off: 8.7 (8.0–9.1) seconds; Laser On: 10.5 (9.6–11.1) seconds; signed rank <italic>p</italic> = 0.03, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 1.4; no effect in no-opsin controls; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig S5</xref>). DDM predictions again were highly concordant with D1-MSN inhibition behavioral data (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.56) and with laser off trials (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.64; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig S6</xref>).</p>
<p>To test the generality of the effects observed in the optogenetic inhibition experiment, we turned to systemic pharmacology. We used sulpiride (12.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally (IP)) to block D2-dopamine receptors in 10 wild-type (WT) mice, which increased response times relative to saline sessions (median (IQR); saline: 8.9 (8.4-9.8) seconds; D2 blockade: 10.1 (9.4-10.8) seconds; signed rank <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 1.0; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E-F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stutt et al., 2023</xref>). Of note, there was no difference in response time between saline sessions and laser off trials from D2-MSN optogenetic inhibition in D2-Cre mice, implying that in optogenetic sessions, D2-MSN inhibition did not disrupt behavior during laser off trials (rank sum <italic>p</italic> = 0.31). These data are consistent with past work demonstrating that disrupting dorsomedial D2-MSNs slows timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">De Corte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Drew et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stutt et al., 2023</xref>). In the same 10 wild-type mice, systemic drugs blocking D1-dopamine receptors (D1 blockade; SCH23390 0.05 mg/kg IP) increased response times (saline: 9.7 seconds (9.0-9.9); D1 blockade: 10.1 seconds (9.3-11.4); signed rank <italic>p</italic> = 0.04, Cohen <italic>d</italic> = 0.7; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G-H</xref>). Once again, there was no difference between saline sessions and D1-MSN inhibition laser off trials in D1-Cre mice (rank sum <italic>p</italic> = 0.18). These results are in line with our DDM predictions and demonstrate that disrupting either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs increases response time.</p>
<p>We found no evidence that inhibiting D2-MSNs in the dorsomedial striatum changed task-specific movements such as nosepoke duration (i.e., time of nosepoke entry to exit; signed rank <italic>p</italic> = 0.63; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig S7</xref> for the 10 D2-Cre mice in optogenetics trials) or switch traversal time between the first and second nosepokes (signed rank <italic>p</italic> = 0.49; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig S7</xref>). Similarly, we found no evidence that D1-MSN inhibition changed nosepoke duration (signed rank <italic>p</italic> = 0.31; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig S7</xref> for the 6 D1-Cre mice) or traversal time (signed rank <italic>p</italic> = 0.22; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig S7</xref>). Furthermore, disrupting D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs did not change response time standard deviations or the number of rewards (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig S8</xref>). These results demonstrate that disrupting dorsomedial striatal D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs specifically slowed interval timing without consistently changing task-specific movements.</p>

<p>We analyzed MSN ensembles in sessions with saline (158 neurons), D2 blockade (167 neurons), or D1 blockade (144 neurons; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B-C</xref>). There were no consistent changes in MSN firing rate with D2 blockade or D1 blockade (F=2.0, p=0.13 controlling for effects across individual mice; saline: 4.8 (3.2-8.3) Hz; D2 blockade 4.8 (2.3-7.6) Hz)); D1 blockade (4.1 (2.3- 7.1) Hz), suggesting that blocking D2 or D1 dopamine receptors may have complex effects on dorsomedial striatal MSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kreitzer, 2009</xref>). We used PCA to analyze these dynamics during interval timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bruce et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Emmons et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kim et al., 2017a</xref>). Population analyses were performed by constructing principal components (PC) from z-scored peri-event time histograms of firing rate from saline, D2 blockade, and D1 blockade sessions together (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D-E</xref>; <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig S9</xref> for analysis of the same neurons across sessions). Examination of the individual components revealed that the first component (PC1), which explained 55% of neuronal variance, exhibited “time-dependent ramping”, or monotonic changes over the 6 second interval immediately after trial start (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D-E</xref>). Because PC1 scores can either be positive or negative, this metric likely represented changes in the drift rate from our DDMs.</p>
<p>Interestingly, PC1 scores shifted with dopaminergic blockade (F = 3.3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04 controlling for effects across individual mice; no reliable effect of sex (p=0.58) or switching direction (p=0.58); D2 blockade: (0.7 (-6.4–5.1) vs saline: 3.7 (-4.4–5.8), post-hoc <italic>p</italic> = 0.02; D1 blockade (0.7 (-6.7–5.2), post-hoc vs saline <italic>p</italic> = 0.03; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>). The second component (PC2) explained 31% of the variance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D-E</xref>), and few reliable differences were found in PC2 or higher components (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>). This data-driven analysis shows that D2 and D1 blockade produced similar shifts in MSN population dynamics represented by PC1. As with our tagging data in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, it is remarkable that despite MSN diversity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>) linear dynamics captured by PC1 shift with D2 and D1 blockade; deeper analyses are detailed in <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig S9</xref>. The decrease in PC1 scores of the MSN neuronal ensemble observed during the pharmacological blockade (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>) is in line with predictions made by our DDM, which simulated delayed response times in MSN inhibition by lowering the drift rate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we quantified striatal MSN temporal encoding via a naïve Bayesian classifier that generates trial-by-trial predictions of time from MSN ensemble firing rates (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A-C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bruce et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Emmons et al., 2017</xref>). Our DDMs predict that disrupted temporal decoding would be a consequence of an altered DDM drift rate. We used leave-one-out cross-validation to predict objective time from the firing rate within a trial. Saline sessions generated strong temporal predictions for the first 6 seconds of the interval immediately after trial start (0–6 seconds; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91 (0.83–0.94)) with weaker predictions for later epochs (6–12 seconds: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.55 (0.33–0.70); rank sum <italic>p</italic> = 0.00002 vs 0–6 seconds, Cohen <italic>d</italic> = 2.1; 12–18 seconds: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.16 (0.08–0.64); rank sum <italic>p</italic> = 0.00005 vs 0–6 seconds, Cohen <italic>d</italic> = 2.3; analyses considered statistically independent; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). We found that temporal encoding early in the interval (0–6 seconds) was degraded with either D2 blockade (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.69 (0.59–0.84); rank sum <italic>p</italic> = 0.0003 vs saline, Cohen <italic>d</italic> = 1.4) or D1 blockade (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.70 (0.47–0.87); rank sum <italic>p</italic> = 0.006 vs saline, Cohen <italic>d</italic> = 1.2; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>), in line with predictions made from DDMs. Later in the interval (6–12 and 12-18 seconds), there were no significant differences between saline sessions and D2 blockade or D1 blockade (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). Disrupting either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs degraded MSN temporal encoding.</p>

<p>We compared machine-learning predictions of response time tertiles using neural network-based classifiers between saline, D2 blockade, and D1 blockade sessions.

As with our earlier analyses of tagged D2-MSN and D1-MSN ensembles, these data show that MSNs marginally predict response time over chance (33%), and these predictions were not reliably affected by D2 or D1 blockade. Taken together, these data demonstrate that disrupting D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs degrades temporal encoding by MSN ensembles. In combination with our optogenetic tagging, computational modeling, and optogenetic inhibition experiments, these data provide insight into cognitive computations by the striatum.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We describe how striatal MSNs work together in complementary ways to encode an elementary cognitive process, interval timing. Strikingly, optogenetic tagging showed that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs had opposing patterns of activity with D2-MSNs ramping up over the interval and D1-MSNs ramping down. MSN dynamics helped construct and constrain a four-parameter drift-diffusion model in which D2- and D1-MSN spiking accumulated temporal evidence. This model predicted that disrupting either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs would increase response times. Accordingly, we found that optogenetically or pharmacologically disrupting striatal D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs increased response times without affecting task-specific movements. Disrupting D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs shifted MSN temporal dynamics and degraded MSN temporal encoding. These data, when combined with our model predictions, demonstrate that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs contribute temporal evidence to controlling actions in time. Our results provide new insight into how opposing patterns of striatal MSN activity control behavior in similar ways and show that they play a complementary role in elementary cognitive operations.</p>
<p>Striatal MSNs are critical for temporal control of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Emmons et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gouvea et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mello et al., 2015</xref>). Three broad models have been proposed for how striatal MSN ensembles represent time: 1) the striatal beat frequency model, in which MSNs encode temporal information based on neuronal synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Matell and Meck, 2004</xref>); 2) the distributed coding model, in which time is represented by the state of the network(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Paton and Buonomano, 2018</xref>); and 3) the DDM, in which neuronal activity monotonically drifts toward a threshold after which responses are initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Emmons et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Simen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). While our data do not formally resolve these possibilities, our results show that D2-MSN and D1-MSNs exhibit opposing linear changes in firing rate dynamics in PC1 over the interval. Past work by our group and others have demonstrates that these linear dynamics can scale over multiple intervals to represent time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Emmons et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gouvea et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). We find that low-parameter DDMs account for interval timing behavior with both intact and disrupted striatal D2- and D1-MSNs. While other models can capture interval timing behavior and account for MSN neuronal activity, our model does so parsimoniously with relatively few parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Matell and Meck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Paton and Buonomano, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Simen et al., 2011</xref>). We and others have shown previously that ramping activity scales to multiple intervals, and DDMs can be readily adapted by changing the drift rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Emmons et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gouvea et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Simen et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, decoding performance was high early in the interval; indeed, animals may have been focused on this initial interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Balci and Gallistel, 2006</xref>) in making temporal comparisons and deciding whether to switch response nosepokes.</p>
<p>D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs play complementary roles in movement. For instance, stimulating D1-MSNs facilitates movement, whereas stimulating D2MSNs impairs movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>). Both populations have been shown to have complementary patterns of activity during movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tecuapetla et al., 2016</xref>), with MSNs firing at different phases of action initiation and selection. Further dissection of action selection programs reveals that opposing patterns of activation among D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs suppress and guide actions, respectively, in the dorsolateral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cruz et al., 2022</xref>). A particular advantage of interval timing is that it captures a cognitive behavior within a single dimension — time. When projected along the temporal dimension, it is surprising that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs have opposing patterns of activity. Past work from our group and others have shown that disrupting D2 or D1 MSNs slows timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">De Corte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Drew et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stutt et al., 2023</xref>). Computational modeling predicted that disrupting either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs increased self-reported estimates of time, which was supported by both optogenetic and pharmacological experiments. Notably, these disruptions are distinct from increased timing variability reported with administrations of amphetamine, ventral tegmental area dopamine neuron lesions, and rodent models of neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Balci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gür et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Larson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Weber et al., 2023</xref>). \Furthermore, our current data demonstrate that disrupting either D2-MSN or D1-MSN activity shifted MSN dynamics and degraded temporal encoding, supporting prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">De Corte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Drew et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stutt et al., 2023</xref>). Our recording experiments do not identify where a possible response threshold <italic>T</italic> is instantiated, but downstream basal ganglia structures may have a key role in setting response thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Toda et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Since interval timing is reliably disrupted in human diseases of the striatum such as Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hinton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Singh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ward et al., 2011</xref>), these results have relevance to human disease. Furthermore, because many therapeutics targeting dopamine receptors are used clinically, our findings illuminate how dopaminergic drugs affect cognitive function and dysfunction. Finally, D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs define indirect and direct pathways, which are targeted by deep brain stimulation for neurological and psychiatric disease.</p>
<p>Our approach has several limitations. First, systemic drug injections block D2- and D1-receptors in many different brain regions, including the frontal cortex, which is involved in interval timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kim et al., 2017a</xref>). D2 blockade or D1 blockade may have complex effects, including corticostriatal or network effects that contribute to changes in D2-MSN or D1-MSN ensemble activity. Despite these limitations, pharmacology is compatible with neuronal ensemble recordings, whereas optogenetic inhibition would silence a large fraction of neurons, complicating interpretations. Second, optogenetic tagging is low-yield, and it is possible that recording more of these neurons would afford greater opportunity to identify alternative coding schemes, such as neuronal synchrony. Larger neuronal ensembles might improve prediction of response times, although we note that it is remarkable that MSNs strongly predicted time but marginally predicted responses. Third, the striatum includes diverse cell types, some of which express D1 and D2 dopamine receptors and these cell types may also contribute to cognitive processing. Fourth, MSNs can laterally inhibit each other, which may profoundly affect striatal function. Regardless, we show that cell-type-specific disruption of D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs both slow timing, implying that these cell types play a key role in interval timing, and our optogenetic tagging experiments describe their activity at high temporal resolution. Future experiments may record from non-MSN striatal cell types, including fast-spiking interneurons that shape basal ganglia output. Fifth, there may be key anatomic differences between dorsal striatal regions that we did not capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gerfen, 1984</xref>). Sixth, we did not deliver stimulation to the striatum, because our pilot experiments triggered movement artifacts or task-specific dyskinesias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>). Future stimulation approaches carefully titrated to striatal physiology may affect interval timing without affecting movement. Finally, movement and motivation contributes to MSN dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Robbe, 2023</xref>). Importantly, three lines of evidence argue that our findings cannot be directly explained by motor confounds: 1) D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs diverge early in the interval well before the first nosepoke, 2) our GLM accounted for nosepokes and nosepoke-related βs were similar between D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs, 3) optogenetic disruption of dorsomedial D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs did not change task-specific movements despite reliable changes in response time, and 4) ramping dynamics were quite distinct from movement dynamics. Furthermore, disrupting D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs did not change the number of rewards animals received, implying that these disruptions did not grossly affect motivation. Still, future work combining motion tracking with neuronal ensemble recording and optogenetics in the context of a bisection task may further unravel timing vs. movement in MSN dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Robbe, 2023</xref>). Finally, the Cre lines used here may involve off-target expression, particularly in the case of D2-Cre mice, although our spike-sorting criteria was chosen to identify MSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bruce et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Emmons et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, we examined the role of dorsomedial striatal D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs during an elementary cognitive behavior, interval timing. Optogenetic tagging revealed that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs exhibited opposite and complementary patterns of neuronal activity. These dynamics could be captured by computational drift-diffusion models, which predicted that disrupting either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs would slow the accumulation of temporal evidence and increase response time. In line with this prediction, we found that optogenetic or pharmacological disruption of either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs increased response times, with pharmacological D2 or D1 blockade shifting MSN dynamics and degrading temporal decoding. Collectively, our data provide insight into how the striatum encodes cognitive information, which could be highly relevant for human diseases that disrupt the striatum and for next-generation neuromodulation that targets the basal ganglia to avoid cognitive side effects or to treat cognitive dysfunction.</p>

<title>Interval timing switch task</title>
<p>We used a mouse-optimized operant interval timing task described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Balci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bruce et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stutt et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tosun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Weber et al., 2023</xref>). Briefly, mice were trained in sound-attenuating operant chambers, with two front nosepokes flanking either side of a food hopper on the front wall, and a third nosepoke located at the center of the back wall. The chamber was positioned below an 8-kHz, 72-dB speaker (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>; MedAssociates, St. Albans, VT). Mice were 85% food restricted and motivated with 20 mg sucrose pellets (Bio-Serv, Flemington, NJ). Mice were initially trained to receive rewards during fixed ratio nosepoke response trials. Nosepoke entry and exit were captured by infrared beams. After shaping, mice were trained in the “switch” interval timing task. Mice self-initiated trials at the back nosepoke, after which a tone and nosepoke lights were illuminated simultaneously. Cues were identical on all trial types and lasted the entire trial duration (6 or 18s). On 50% of trials, mice were rewarded for a nosepoke after 6 seconds at the designated ‘first’ front nosepoke (counterbalanced across animals to be left or right of the food hopper; included as a regressor in neuronal analyses); these trials were not analyzed. On the remaining 50% of trials, mice were rewarded for nosepoking first at the ‘first nosepoke and then switching responses to the ‘second’ nosepoke (reward given only after responding at the ‘second’ nosepoke after 18s). Switch <italic>response time</italic> was defined as switch from the first to the second nosepoke and is represented by the time mice exited the first nosepoke prior to entering the second nosepoke. Critically, switch responses are a time-based decision guided by temporal control of action because mice switch nosepokes only if nosepokes at the first location did not receive reward after 6 seconds. That is, mice estimate if more than 6 seconds have elapsed without receiving reward to decide to switch responses. Mice learn this task quickly (3-4 weeks), and error trials in which an animal nosepokes in the wrong order or does not nosepoke are relatively rare and discarded. Consequently, we focused on these switch response times as the key metric for temporal control of action. Switch <italic>response duration</italic> was defined as the time between first nosepoke entry and exit for the switch responses only. Switch <italic>traversal time</italic> was defined as the duration between first nosepoke exit and second nosepoke entry. Trials were self-initiated, but there was a intertrial interval with a geometric mean of 30 seconds between trials.</p>

<title>Surgical and histological procedures</title>
<p>Surgical procedures were identical to methods described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bruce et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized using inhaled 4% isoflurane and surgical levels of anesthesia were maintained at 1-2% for the duration of the surgery. Craniotomies were drilled above bilateral dorsal striatal anatomical targets, and optogenetic viruses (AAV5-DIO-eNHPR2.0 (halorhodopsin), AAV5-DIO-ChR2(H134R)-mcherry (ChR), or AAV5-DIO-cherry (control) from the University of North Carolina Viral Vector Core) were injected (0.5 uL of virus, +0.9, ML +/-1.3, DV –2.7). Either fiber optics (Doric Lenses, Montreal Quebec; AP +0.9, ML +/-1.3, DV –2.5) or 4 x 4 electrode or optrode arrays (AP +0.4, ML -1.4, DV -2.7 on the left side only; Microprobes, Gaithersburg, MD) were positioned in the dorsal striatum. Holes were drilled to insert skull screws to anchor headcap assemblies and/or ground electrode arrays and then sealed with cyanoacrylate (“SloZap,” Pacer Technologies, Rancho Cucamonga, CA), accelerated by “ZipKicker” (Pacer Technologies) and methyl methacrylate (AM Systems, Port Angeles, WA).

<title>Optogenetics</title>
<p>We leveraged cell-type-specific optogenetics to manipulate D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs in D2- or D1-cre mice. In animals injected with optogenetic viruses, optical inhibition was delivered via bilateral patch cables for the entire trial duration of 18 seconds via 589-nm laser light at 12 mW power on 50% of randomly assigned trials. We did not stimulate for epochs less than the interval because we did not want to introduce a cue during the interval. For optogenetic tagging, putative D1- and D2-MSNs were optically identified via 473-nm photostimulation. Units with mean post-stimulation spike latencies of ≤5 milliseconds and a stimulated-to-unstimulated waveform correlation ratio of &gt;0.9 were classified as putative D2+ or D1+ neurons(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shin et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Single-unit recordings were made using a multi-electrode recording system (Open Ephys, Atlanta, GA). After the experiments, Plexon Offline Sorter (Plexon, Dallas, TX), was used to remove artifacts. Principal component analysis (PCA) and waveform shape were used for spike sorting. Single units were defined as those 1) having a consistent waveform shape, 2) being a separable cluster in PCA space, and 3) having a consistent refractory period of at least 2 milliseconds in interspike interval histograms. Spike activity was analyzed for all cells that fired between 0.5 Hz and 20 Hz over the entire behavioral session. Putative MSNs were further separated from striatal fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) based on hierarchical clustering of the waveform peak-to-trough ratio and the half-peak width (<italic>fitgmdist</italic> and <italic>cluster.m</italic>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berke, 2011</xref>).

To preclude edge effects that might bias classifier performance, we included data from 6 seconds prior to the trial start and 6 seconds after the end of the interval. We used leave-one-out cross-validation to predict an objective time from the firing rate within a trial.

<caption><p>A) We sorted and identified the same 99 MSNs across saline sessions and sessions with D2 blockade or D1 blockade. Each row is a z-scored peri-event time histogram of MSN activity for all trials during interval timing. Each row is the same neuron identified by waveform and interspike-intervals across saline, D2 blockade, and D1 blockade sessions. B) We further explored early-interval dynamics by PCA. The matched sorting across sessions enabled paired signed rank analyses. C) The first component (PC1) explained 75% of variance among MSN ensemble dynamics between 3-6 seconds that showed maximal differences between sessions. D) As with dynamics between 0-6 seconds, PC1 was shifted relative to saline for D2 blockade (signed rank <italic>p</italic> = 0.000007) and D1 blockade (signed rank <italic>p</italic> = 0.002). We identified two clusters based on PC1, with cluster 1 (E) loading positively on PC1, and cluster 2 (F) loading negatively on PC1. For cluster 1 in (E), PCs were distinct from saline for D2 blockade (signed rank <italic>p</italic> = 3×10<sup>-12</sup>) and for D1 blockade (signed rank <italic>p</italic> = 10<sup>-7</sup>). For cluster 2 in panel (F), PC1 changes were also distinct for saline for D2 blockade (signed rank <italic>p</italic> = 0.00008) and for D1 blockade (signed rank <italic>p</italic> = 0.002).

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study examines the activity and function of dorsomedial striatal neurons in estimating time. The authors examine striatal activity as a function of time and the impact of optogenetic striatal manipulation on the animal's ability to estimate a time interval. However, the task's design and methodology present several confounding factors that mean the evidence in support of the authors' claims is <bold>incomplete</bold>. With these limitations addressed, the work would be of interest to neuroscientists examining how striatum contributes to behavior.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, the authors examine the activity and function of D1 and D2 MSNs in dorsomedial striatum (DMS) during an interval timing task. In this task, animals must first nose poke into a cued port on the left or right; if not rewarded after 6 seconds, they must switch to the other port. Critically, this task thus requires animals to estimate if at least 6 seconds have passed after the first nose poke - this is the key aspect of the task focused on here. After verifying that animals reliably estimate the passage of 6 seconds by leaving on average after 9 seconds, the authors examine striatal activity during this interval. They report that D1-MSNs tend to decrease activity, while D2-MSNs increase activity, throughout this interval. They suggest that this activity follows a drift-diffusion model, in which activity increases (or decreases) to a threshold after which a decision (to leave) is made. The authors next report that optogenetically inhibiting D1 or D2 MSNs, or pharmacologically blocking D1 and D2 receptors, increased the average wait time of the animals to 10 seconds on average. This suggests that both D1 and D2 neurons contribute to the estimate of time, with a decrease in their activity corresponding to a decrease in the rate of 'drift' in their drift-diffusion model. Lastly, the authors examine MSN activity while pharmacologically inhibiting D1 or D2 receptors. The authors observe most recorded MSNs neurons decrease their activity over the interval, with the rate decreasing with D1/D2 receptor inhibition.</p>

<p>The study employs a wide range of techniques - including animal behavioral training, electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulation, pharmacological manipulations, and computational modeling. The behavioral task used by the authors is quite interesting and a nice way to probe interval timing in rodents. The question posed by the authors - how striatal activity contributes to interval timing - is of importance to the field and has been the focus of many studies and labs; thus, this paper can meaningfully contribute to that conversation. The data within the paper is presented very clearly, and the authors have done a nice job presenting the data in a transparent manner (e.g., showing individual cells and animals). Overall, the manuscript is relatively easy to read and clear, with sufficient detail given in most places regarding the experimental paradigm or analyses used.</p>
<p>Major weaknesses:</p>
<p>I perceive two major weaknesses. The first is the impact or contextualization of their results in terms of the results of the field more broadly. More specifically, it was not clear to me how the authors are interpreting the striatal activity in the context of what others have observed during interval timing tasks. In other words - what was the hypothesis going into this experiment? Does observing increasing/decreasing activity in D2 versus D1 support one model of interval timing over another, or does it further support a more specific idea of how DMS contributes to interval timing? Or was the main question that we didn't know if D2 or D1 neurons had differential activity during interval timing?</p>
<p>In the second, I felt that some of the conclusions suggested by the authors don't seem entirely supported by the data they present, or the data presented suggests a slightly more complicated story. Below I provide additional detail on some of these instances.</p>
<p>Regarding the results presented in Figures 2 and 3:</p>
<p>I am not sure the PC analysis adds much to the interpretation, and potentially unnecessarily complicates things. In particular, running PCA on a matrix of noisy data that is smoothed with a Gaussian will often return PCs similar to what is observed by the authors, with the first PC being a line up/down, the 2nd PC being a parabola that is up/down, etc. Thus, I'm not sure that there is much to be interpreted by the specific shape of the PCs here. I think an alternative analysis that might be both easier and more informative is to compute the slope of the activity of each neuron across the 6 seconds. This would allow the authors to quantify how many neurons increase or decrease their activity much like what is shown in Figure 2.</p>
<p>Relatedly, it seems that the data shown in Figure 2D *doesn't* support the authors' main claim regarding D2/D1 MSNs increasing/decreasing their activity, as the trial-by-trial slope is near 0 for both cell types.</p>
<p>Regarding the results in Figure 4:</p>
<p>The authors suggest that their data is consistent with a drift-diffusion model. However, it is unclear how well the output from the model fits the activity from neurons the authors recorded. Relatedly, it is unclear how the parameters were chosen for the D1/D2 versions of this model. I think that an alternate approach that would answer these questions is to fit the model to each cell, and then examine the best-fit parameters, as well as the ability of the model to predict activity on trials held out from the fitting process. This would provide a more rigorous method to identify the best parameters and would directly quantify how well the model captures the data.</p>
<p>Relatedly, looking at the raw data in Figure 2, it seems that many neurons either fire at the beginning or end of the interval, with more neurons firing at the end, and more firing at the beginning, for D2/D1 neurons respectively. Thus, it's not clear to me whether the drift-diffusion model is a good model of activity. Or, perhaps the model is supposed to be related to the aggregate activity of all D1/D2 neurons? (If so, this should be made more explicit. The comment about fitting the model directly to the data also still stands).</p>
<p>Further, it's unclear to me how, or why, the authors changed the specific parameters they used to model the optogenetic manipulation. Were these parameters chosen because they fit the manipulation data? This I don't think is in itself an issue, but perhaps should be clearly stated, because otherwise it sounds a bit odd given the parameter changes are so specific. It is also not clear to me why the noise in the diffusion process would be expected to change with increased inhibition.</p>
<p>Regarding the results in Figure 6:</p>
<p>My comments regarding the interpretation of PCs in Figure 2 apply here as well. In addition, I am not sure that examining PC2 adds much here, given that the authors didn't examine such nonlinear changes earlier in the paper.</p>
<p>A larger concern though that seems potentially at odds with the authors' interpretation is that there seems to be very little change in the firing pattern after D1 or D2 blockade. I see that in Figure 6F the authors suggest that many cells slope down (and thus, presumably, they are recoding more D1 cells), and that this change in slope is decreased, but this effect is not apparent in Figure 6C, and Figure 6B shows an example of a cell that seems to fire in the opposite direction (increase activity). I think it would help to show some (more) individual examples that demonstrate the summary effect shown by the authors, and perhaps the authors can comment on the robustness (or the variability) of this result.</p>
<p>Also, it seems that if the authors want to claim that this manipulation lowers the drift rate. I think to make this claim, they could fit the DDM model and examine whether D is significantly lower.</p>
<p>Regarding the results in Figure 7:</p>
<p>I am overall a bit confused about what the authors are trying to claim here. In Figure 7, they present data suggesting that D1 or D2 blockade disrupts their ability to decode time in the interval of interest (0-6 seconds). However, in the final paragraph of the results, the authors seem to say that by using another technique, they didn't see any significant change in decoding accuracy after D1 or D2 blockade. What do the authors make of this?</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>The task and data presented by the authors are very intriguing, and there are many groups interested in how striatal activity contributes to the neural perception of time. The authors perform a wide variety of experiments and analysis to examine how DMS activity influences time perception during an interval-timing task, allowing for insight into this process. However, the significance of the key finding - that D2/D1 activity increases/ decreases with time - remains somewhat ambiguous to me. This arises from a lack of clarity regarding the initial hypothesis and the implications of this finding for advancing our understanding of striatal functions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the present study, the authors investigated the neural coding mechanisms for D1- and D2-expressing striatal direct and indirect pathway MSNs in interval timing by using multiple strategies. They concluded that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs have opposing temporal dynamics yet disrupting either type produced similar effects on behavior, indicating the complementary roles of D1- and D2- MSNs in cognitive processing. However, the data was incomplete to fully support this major finding. One major reason is the heterogenetic responses within the D1-or D2-MSN populations. In addition, there are additional concerns about the statistical methods used. For example, the majority of the statistical tests are based on the number of neurons, but not the number of mice. It appears that the statistical difference was due to the large sample size they used (n=32 D2-MSNs and n=41 D1-MSNs), but different neurons recorded in the same mouse cannot be treated as independent samples; they should use independent mouse-based statistical analysis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors used multiple approaches including awake mice behavior training, optogenetic-assistant cell-type specific recording, optogenetic or pharmacological manipulation, neural computation, and modeling to study neuronal coding for interval timing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) More detailed behavior results should be shown, including the rate of the success switches, and how long it takes to wait in the second nose poke to get a reward. For line 512 and the Figure 1 legend, the reviewer is not clear about the reward delivery. The methods appear to state that the mouse had to wait for 18s, then make nose pokes at the second port to get the reward. What happens if the mouse made the second nose poke before 18 seconds, but then exited? Would the mouse still get the reward at 18 seconds? Similarly, what happens if the mice made the third or more nosepokes within 18 seconds? It is important to clarify because, according to the method described, if the mice made a second nose poke before 18 seconds, this already counted as the mouse making the &quot;switch.&quot; Lastly, what if the mice exited before 6s in the first nosepoke?</p>
<p>(2) There are a lot of time parameters in this behavior task, the description of those time parameters is mentioned in several parts, in the figure legend, supplementary figure legend, and methods, but was not defined clearly in the main text. It is inconvenient, sometimes, confusing for the readers. The authors should make a schematic diagram to illustrate the major parameters and describe them clearly in the main text.</p>
<p>(3) In Line 508, the reviewer suggests the authors pay attention to those trials without &quot;switch&quot;. It would be valuable to compare the MSN activity between those trials with or without a &quot;switch&quot;.</p>
<p>(4) The definition of interval is not very clear. It appears that the authors used a 6-second interval in analyzing the data in Figure 2 and Figure 3. But from my understanding, the interval should be the time from time &quot;0&quot; to the &quot;switch&quot;, when the mice start to exit from the first nose poke.</p>
<p>(5) For Figure 2 C-F, the authors only recorded 32 D2-MSNs in 4 mice, and 41 D1-MSNs in 5 mice. The sample size is too small compared to the sample size usually used in the field. In addition to the small sample size, the single-cell activity exhibited heterogeneity, which created potential issues. For both D1 and D2 MSNs, the authors tried to make conclusions on the &quot;trend&quot; of increasing in D2-MSNs and decreasing in D1-MSNs populations, respectively, during the interval. However, such a conclusion is not sufficiently supported by the data presented. It looks like the single-cell activity patterns can be separated into groups: one is a decreasing activity group, one is an increasing activity group and a small group for on and off response. Because of the small sample size, the author should pay attention to the variance across different mice (which needs to be clearly presented in the manuscript), instead of pooling data together and analyzing the mean activity.</p>
<p>(6) For Figure 2, from the activity in E and F, it seems that the activity already rose before the trial started, the authors should add some longer baseline data before time zero for clarification and comparison, and show the timing of the actual start of the activity with the corresponding behavior. What behavior states are the mice in when initiating the activity?</p>
<p>(7) The authors were focused on the &quot;switch &quot; behavior in the task, but they used an arbitrary 6s time window to analyze the activity, and tried to correlate the decreasing or increasing activities of MSNs to the neural coding for time. A better way to analyze is to sort the activity according to the &quot;switch&quot; time, from short to long intervals. This way, the authors could see and analyze whether the activity of D1 or D2 MSNs really codes for the different length of interval, instead of finding a correlation between average activity trends and the arbitrary 6s time window.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The cognitive striatum, also known as the dorsomedial striatum, receives input from brain regions involved in high-level cognition and plays a crucial role in processing cognitive information. However, despite its importance, the extent to which different projection pathways of the striatum contribute to this information processing remains unclear. In this paper, Bruce et al. conducted a study using a range of causal and correlational techniques to investigate how these pathways collectively contribute to interval timing in mice. Their results were consistent with previous research, showing that the direct and indirect striatal pathways perform opposing roles in processing elapsed time. Based on their findings, the authors proposed a revised computational model in which two separate accumulators track evidence for elapsed time in opposing directions. These results have significant implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in neurological and psychiatric disorders, as disruptions in the balance between direct and indirect pathway activity are commonly observed in such conditions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors employed a well-established approach to study interval timing and employed optogenetic tagging to observe the behavior of specific cell types in the striatum. Additionally, the authors utilized two complementary techniques to assess the impact of manipulating the activity of these pathways on behavior. Finally, the authors utilized their experimental findings to enhance the theoretical comprehension of interval timing using a computational model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The behavioral task used in this study is best suited for investigating elapsed time perception, rather than interval timing. Timing bisection tasks are often employed to study interval timing in humans and animals. The main results from unit recording (opposing slopes of D1/D2 cell firing rate, as shown in Figure 3D) appear to be very sensitive to a couple of outlier cells, and the predictive power of ensemble recording seems to be only slightly above chance levels. In the optogenetic experiment, the laser was kept on for too long (18 seconds) at high power (12 mW). This has been shown to cause adverse effects on population activity (for example, through heating the tissue) that are not necessarily related to their function during the task epochs. Given the systemic delivery of pharmacological interventions, it is difficult to conclude that the effects are specific to the dorsomedial striatum. Future studies should use the local infusion of drugs into the dorsomedial striatum.</p>

<p>This valuable study examines the activity and function of dorsomedial striatal neurons in estimating time. The authors examine striatal activity as a function of time and the impact of optogenetic striatal manipulation on the animal's ability to estimate a time interval. However, the task's design and methodology present several confounding factors that mean the evidence in support of the authors' claims is incomplete. With these limitations addressed, the work would be of interest to neuroscientists examining how striatum contributes to behavior.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, the authors examine the activity and function of D1 and D2 MSNs in dorsomedial striatum (DMS) during an interval timing task. In this task, animals must first nose poke into a cued port on the left or right; if not rewarded after 6 seconds, they must switch to the other port. Critically, this task thus requires animals to estimate if at least 6 seconds have passed after the first nose poke - this is the key aspect of the task focused on here. After verifying that animals reliably estimate the passage of 6 seconds by leaving on average after 9 seconds, the authors examine striatal activity during this interval. They report that D1-MSNs tend to decrease activity, while D2-MSNs increase activity, throughout this interval. They suggest that this activity follows a drift-diffusion model, in which activity increases (or decreases) to a threshold after which a decision (to leave) is made. The authors next report that optogenetically inhibiting D1 or D2 MSNs, or pharmacologically blocking D1 and D2 receptors, increased the average wait time of the animals to 10 seconds on average. This suggests that both D1 and D2 neurons contribute to the estimate of time, with a decrease in their activity corresponding to a decrease in the rate of 'drift' in their drift-diffusion model. Lastly, the authors examine MSN activity while pharmacologically inhibiting D1 or D2 receptors. The authors observe most recorded MSNs neurons decrease their activity over the interval, with the rate decreasing with D1/D2 receptor inhibition.</p>
<p>Major strengths:</p>
<p>The study employs a wide range of techniques - including animal behavioral training, electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulation, pharmacological manipulations, and computational modeling. The behavioral task used by the authors is quite interesting and a nice way to probe interval timing in rodents. The question posed by the authors - how striatal activity contributes to interval timing - is of importance to the field and has been the focus of many studies and labs; thus, this paper can meaningfully contribute to that conversation. The data within the paper is presented very clearly, and the authors have done a nice job presenting the data in a transparent manner (e.g., showing individual cells and animals).

<p>We are glad our main points came through to the reviewer.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Our hypothesis, based on prior behavioral work from our group describing that blocking striatal D1 and D2 dopamine receptors impaired interval timing (De Corte et al., 2019; Stutt et al., 2023) was D1 and D2 MSNs would have similar patterns of activity during interval timing. We will clarify this in the revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

</disp-quote>
<p>These are insightful points. We will clarify details of our PCA analysis in the revision.  We include PCA for comparisons with our past work (Emmons et al., 2017, 2021; Bruce et al., 2021). Second, it is true that these components can be observed in smoothed data; however, when we generated random data using identical parameters, we found that the variance explained by PC1 was not commonly observed in random data. Third, our goal is to compare between D1 and D2 MSNs, not to interpret the PCs. We will make this explicit in our revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I think an alternative analysis that might be both easier and more informative is to compute the slope of the activity of each neuron across the 6 seconds. This would allow the authors to quantify how many neurons increase or decrease their activity much like what is shown in Figure 2.</p>

<p>This likely refers to Figure 3D. In the revision, we will clarify this analysis, add error bars, and note that our goal was to differentiate D2 and D1 MSNs in this analysis.  We will also add to this analysis to better make the poin that D2 and D1 MSNs are distinct, contrary to our hypothesis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>This is a great point. Our goal was to fit behavioral activity, not neuronal activity; in our revision, we will do exactly what the reviewer suggests and present data of fits to neuronal activity.</p>

<p>Our model was inspired by the averages in Figure 2G&amp;H; however, we will fit drift-diffusion models to individual neurons exactly as the reviewer suggests.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree – we will remove PC2 in Figure 6 and Figure S9 and add context to the PC analysis noting that we are including for 1) comparisons with past work, 2) our observed variance is much higher than observed in random/smoothed data, and 3) we are primarily interested in comparisons between conditions rather than interpreting the components.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A larger concern though that seems potentially at odds with the authors' interpretation is that there seems to be very little change in the firing pattern after D1 or D2 blockade. I see that in Figure 6F the authors suggest that many cells slope down (and thus, presumably, they are recoding more D1 cells), and that this change in slope is decreased, but this effect is not apparent in Figure 6C, and Figure 6B shows an example of a cell that seems to fire in the opposite direction (increase activity).

<p>We agree, although we note D1/D2 blockade changes PC1, which explains the most variance in MSN activity. In the revision, we will show more examples and comment on the robustness of PC1, exactly as the reviewer recommends. The changes in PC1 are rather consistent.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

What happens if the mouse made the second nose poke before 18 seconds, but then exited? Would the mouse still get the reward at 18 seconds? Similarly, what happens if the mice made the third or more nosepokes within 18 seconds? It is important to clarify because, according to the method described, if the mice made a second nose poke before 18 seconds, this already counted as the mouse making the &quot;switch.&quot; Lastly, what if the mice exited before 6s in the first nosepoke?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree.  These were presented in detail in our prior work (Bruce et al., 2021; Larson et al., 2022; and Weber et al., 2023) and work from others (Balci et al 2008; Tosun et al., 2016. However, we will work on a detailed behavioral schematic in the revision and move supplementary behavioral data in Figure S1 to the main manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) There are a lot of time parameters in this behavior task, the description of those time parameters is mentioned in several parts, in the figure legend, supplementary figure legend, and methods, but was not defined clearly in the main text. It is inconvenient, sometimes, confusing for the readers. The authors should make a schematic diagram to illustrate the major parameters and describe them clearly in the main text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a great suggestion – we will do this – and clarify in the above schematic.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Line 508, the reviewer suggests the authors pay attention to those trials without &quot;switch&quot;. It would be valuable to compare the MSN activity between those trials with or without a &quot;switch&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We analyzed MSN activity on errors in detail Figure 6 of Bruce et al., 2021. These errors are infrequent and inconsistent – we will discuss this in the revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The definition of interval is not very clear. It appears that the authors used a 6-second interval in analyzing the data in Figure 2 and Figure 3. But from my understanding, the interval should be the time from time &quot;0&quot; to the &quot;switch&quot;, when the mice start to exit from the first nose poke.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. The switch time can be vastly different on some trials, making it challenging to compare different lengths and slopes. However, we will clarify the interval as noted above, and we have a few ideas on how to do the analysis the reviewer suggests.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) For Figure 2 C-F, the authors only recorded 32 D2-MSNs in 4 mice, and 41 D1-MSNs in 5 mice. The sample size is too small compared to the sample size usually used in the field. In addition to the small sample size, the single-cell activity exhibited heterogeneity, which created potential issues. For both D1 and D2 MSNs, the authors tried to make conclusions on the &quot;trend&quot; of increasing in D2-MSNs and decreasing in D1-MSNs populations, respectively, during the interval. However, such a conclusion is not sufficiently supported by the data presented. It looks like the single-cell activity patterns can be separated into groups: one is a decreasing activity group, one is an increasing activity group and a small group for on and off response. Because of the small sample size, the author should pay attention to the variance across different mice (which needs to be clearly presented in the manuscript), instead of pooling data together and analyzing the mean activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We were not clear – we did this analysis exactly the reviewer suggested. We are not pooling any data – instead – as we state on line 620 – we are using linear-mixed effects models to account for mouse-specific and neuron-specific variance. This approach was developed with our statistics core for exactly the reasons the reviewer suggested.  Furthermore, we will add to this analysis demonstrative that it is resistant to outliers.  Finally, we will include measures of effect size noting that it is a medium to large effect.</p>
<p>It’s a helpful idea to plot data individually by mice, and we will do so in the revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) For Figure 2, from the activity in E and F, it seems that the activity already rose before the trial started, the authors should add some longer baseline data before time zero for clarification and comparison, and show the timing of the actual start of the activity with the corresponding behavior. What behavior states are the mice in when initiating the activity?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We can certainly include a longer baseline. We can clarify in the revision that mice initiate trials at the rear nosepoke, and this is what initiates the task cues and the temporal interval.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The authors were focused on the &quot;switch &quot; behavior in the task, but they used an arbitrary 6s time window to analyze the activity, and tried to correlate the decreasing or increasing activities of MSNs to the neural coding for time. A better way to analyze is to sort the activity according to the &quot;switch&quot; time, from short to long intervals. This way, the authors could see and analyze whether the activity of D1 or D2 MSNs really codes for the different length of interval, instead of finding a correlation between average activity trends and the arbitrary 6s time window.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a great idea, and we have some ideas on how to adapt the GLM analysis to perform this analysis.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The cognitive striatum, also known as the dorsomedial striatum, receives input from brain regions involved in high-level cognition and plays a crucial role in processing cognitive information. However, despite its importance, the extent to which different projection pathways of the striatum contribute to this information processing remains unclear. In this paper, Bruce et al. conducted a study using a range of causal and correlational techniques to investigate how these pathways collectively contribute to interval timing in mice. Their results were consistent with previous research, showing that the direct and indirect striatal pathways perform opposing roles in processing elapsed time. Based on their findings, the authors proposed a revised computational model in which two separate accumulators track evidence for elapsed time in opposing directions. These results have significant implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in neurological and psychiatric disorders, as disruptions in the balance between direct and indirect pathway activity are commonly observed in such conditions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors employed a well-established approach to study interval timing and employed optogenetic tagging to observe the behavior of specific cell types in the striatum. Additionally, the authors utilized two complementary techniques to assess the impact of manipulating the activity of these pathways on behavior. Finally, the authors utilized their experimental findings to enhance the theoretical comprehension of interval timing using a computational model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the reviewer’s consideration of our work and recognizing the strengths of our approach.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The behavioral task used in this study is best suited for investigating elapsed time perception, rather than interval timing. Timing bisection tasks are often employed to study interval timing in humans and animals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is certainly valid, and we will include these points in the revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The main results from unit recording (opposing slopes of D1/D2 cell firing rate, as shown in Figure 3D) appear to be very sensitive to a couple of outlier cells, and the predictive power of ensemble recording seems to be only slightly above chance levels.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are glad that the reviewer raised this. We will add to this analysis demonstrative that it is resistant to outliers.  Finally, we will include measures of effect size noting that it is a medium to large effect. Thus, it is significantly above chance, and rather reliable, and supported by our PCA results in Figure 3C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the optogenetic experiment, the laser was kept on for too long (18 seconds) at high power (12 mW). This has been shown to cause adverse effects on population activity (for example, through heating the tissue) that are not necessarily related to their function during the task epochs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Again, this is an important point.  We are well aware of heating effects with optogenetics. For the exact reasons noted by the reviewer, we had opsin-negative controls –when the laser was on the exact same time course and parameters – in Figure S5. There were no behavioral effects in controls with identical heating and other effects of the laser.  Furthermore, these effects are similar to pharmacological effects in this manuscript and in our prior work (De Corte et al., 2019; Stutt et al., 2023). We will better highlight these issues in the revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Given the systemic delivery of pharmacological interventions, it is difficult to conclude that the effects are specific to the dorsomedial striatum. Future studies should use the local infusion of drugs into the dorsomedial striatum.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a great point - we did exactly this experiment in De Corte et al, 2019 with local drug infusions. This earlier study was the departure point for this experiment, although it is challenging to combine focal pharmacological inactivation with recordings in mice (we have extensive experience with this in rats in Parker et al., 2015 and Parker et al, 2015). Furthermore, we have similar local optogenetics effects in this paper. We will include these points in the revised manuscript.</p>
