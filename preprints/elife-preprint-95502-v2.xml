<title>Abstract</title><p>Microbes strongly affect invasive plant growth. However, how the phyllosphere and rhizosphere soil microbes distinctively affect seedling mortality and the growth of invasive plants across ontogeny under varying soil nutrient levels remains unclear. In this study, we used the invader <italic>Ageratina adenophora</italic> to evaluate these effects in plant growth chambers. We found that leaf litter harboured more potential pathogens and thus had more adverse effects on seed germination and seedling survival than soil inoculation. Microbial inoculation at different growth stages altered the microbial community and microbial functions of seedlings, and earlier inoculation had a more adverse effect on seedling survival and growth. In most cases, the soil nutrient level did not affect microbe-mediated seedling growth and the relative abundance of the microbial community and functions involved in seedling growth. The effects of some microbial genera on seedling survival are distinct from those on growth. Moreover, the <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling-killing effects of fungal strains isolated from dead seedlings by nonsterile leaf inoculation litter exhibited significant phylogenetic signals, by which strains of <italic>Allophoma</italic> and <italic>Alternaria</italic> generally caused high seedling mortality. Our study stresses the essential role of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> litter microbes in population establishment by regulating seedling density and growth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plant-modified soil properties affect the performance of plants, which are termed ‘plant–soil feedbacks (PSFs)’. PSFs can affect species coexistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bever et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">van der Putten et al., 2013</xref>) and local plant community composition and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bauer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kardol et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Teste et al., 2017</xref>). For plant invasion, PSFs are usually positive because of escaping soil pathogens and recruiting some beneficial microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mitchell &amp; Power, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Xu et al., 2012</xref>) or negative effects because of accumulating local pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Callaway et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Flory &amp; Clay, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to soil, leaf litter can also affect plant growth, species diversity and community structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Olson &amp; Wallander, 2002</xref>), thus playing important roles in population establishment and community dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jessen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lamb, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Xiong &amp; Nilsson, 1999</xref>). However, related research has focused mainly on physical (e.g., maintaining soil moisture and temperature, increasing nutrition and reducing light) or chemical effects (e.g., releasing allelochemicals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Demey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jessen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Möhler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) but has rarely focused on leaf microbial effects. Until 2017, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Whitaker et al. (2017)</xref> extended the PSF to aboveground tissues (including leaf, stem and floral tissues), termed “plant‒ phyllosphere feedbacks (PPFs)”, and found that all four Asteraceae species experienced stronger negative PPFs than PSFs. Subsequently, this team further verified that all ten tested Asteraceae plants experienced negative PPFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zaret et al., 2021</xref>). The lack of strong mutualists and relatively high abundance of pathogens in the phyllosphere may account for the negative PPFs.</p>
<p>In addition to microbial sources (i.e., soil vs leaf litter), ontogeny (seedling growth stage) and soil nutrient levels can affect plant‒microbe interactions. For example, seedlings showed distinct sensitivity during the growth stage, and younger seedlings were more susceptible to infection by soil microbes because of fewer defense resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Geisen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jevon et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, leaf litter has an adverse effect on seedling emergence but a positive effect on later plant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbas et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Möhler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>); litter also has a stronger negative effect on earlier vegetation growth than on the elder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Loydi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Xiong &amp; Nilsson, 1999</xref>). Moreover, plants enrich distinct microbes under different nutrient conditions and affect plant performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dostál, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gustafson &amp; Casper, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Widdig et al., 2020</xref>). For example, the bacterial diversity in duckweed plants was reduced under nutrient‒deficient conditions, but the abundance of Firmicutes increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bunyoo et al., 2022</xref>), and members of Firmicutes have been reported to promote plant stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ai et al. (2018)</xref> reported that nutrient additions cause crops to enrich some bacteria and fungi from soil and increase yield.</p>
<p><italic>Ageratina adenophora</italic> (Sprengel) R.M. King &amp; H. Robinson (Asteraceae), known as Crofton weed or Mexican devil weed, has invaded more than 30 countries and areas, including South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, India and China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Julien &amp; Griffiths, 1998</xref>). It is a perennial weed and can produce high yields of seeds with a high germination rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Parsons WT, 1992</xref>). This weed commonly grows in monocultures, but a high density of seedlings is not common in the wild. Previous studies have shown that <italic>A. adenophora</italic> can enrich the beneficial soil microbial community to facilitate invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Niu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>); in contrast, <italic>A. adenophora</italic> leaves harbor diverse fungal pathogens that can cause adverse effects on itself seed germination and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kai Fang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">K. Fang et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, it is interesting to determine whether leaf microbes play a distinct role from soil microbes in regulating <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling density and whether these effects change with the <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth stage and soil nutrition level.</p>
<p>In this study, we inoculated <italic>A. adenophora</italic> with soil or leaf litter at three stages, 0 d, 21 d, and 28 d after sowing, and transplanted seedlings to grow in soils with high or low nutritional levels. We first determined the germination, seedling survival and growth of the <italic>A. adenophora</italic> plants. Then, we characterized the bacterial and fungal communities of the soils and leaf litter as inoculation sources, as well as the microbial communities enriched in the leaves and roots of the <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings after growing; we also isolated the fungi associated with the dead seedlings and tested their seedling-killing effects on <italic>A. adenophora</italic>. Finally, we correlated the microbial community with <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling mortality and growth.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the microbial communities associated with leaf litter and rhizosphere soils can account for the differential effects on <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling mortality and growth during different growth stages when growing under different nutrient conditions. We expected that 1) leaf litter would have more adverse effects on seed germination, seedling survival and growth than soil, as leaf litter often harbours more plant pathogens, and 2) inoculation at different growth stages would change the microbial community enriched by seedlings and thus affect seedling growth. Earlier inoculation had a greater adverse impact on seedling growth than later inoculation, as younger seedlings were more sensitive to pathogen infection than older seedlings. 3) The nutrient level influences seedlings to recruit microbes and thus affects seedling growth.</p>

<title>Effects of leaf litter and rhizosphere soil on the mortality and growth of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings</title>
<p>At the G0 timepoint, sterile leaf inoculation significantly delayed germination time more than did soil and sterile leaf inoculation, as well as the control (nothing inoculated) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Leaf and soil inoculation had no distinct effects on the germination rate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). In addition, the inoculation of sterile and non–sterile leaves at G0 caused a high mortality rate (19.7% vs 96.7%) for seedlings growing in petri dishes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, Fig. S1). Only nonsterile leaves caused a low percentage of seedling death (8.4%) when the seedlings were inoculated at G21 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Two weeks after transplanting these seedlings into the cups, leaf inoculation caused significantly greater seedling mortality than did soil inoculation (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001); the nonsterile sample caused greater seedling mortality than did the sterile sample, especially leaf inoculation during the G0 and G21 periods. Moreover, nonsterile leaf inoculation at earlier stages significantly increased seedling mortality compared with that at later stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, seedling mortality did not differ between the high- and low-nutrient conditions, regardless of leaf or soil inoculation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, both <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05).</p>

<title>Correlations of the microbial community and potential functions of inocula with <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling mortality at the early stage</title>
<p>The soil and leaf inocula had distinct microbial diversity, community compositions and potential functions. The microbial diversity and richness were greater in the soil than in the leaf litter (Fig. S2). Top three core bacteria were <italic>Rhodoplanes</italic> (5.65%), <italic>Bradyrizhobium</italic> (4.80%) and some unclassified Alphaproteobacteria (4.56%) for soil and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (30.33%), <italic>Massilia</italic> (17.45%) and <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> (16.35%) for leaf (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3ab</xref>). Top three core fungal genera were <italic>Mortierella</italic> (7.00%), <italic>Inocybe</italic> (5.36%) and <italic>Neonectria</italic> (3.63%) for soil and <italic>Didymella</italic> (27.30%) <italic>Alternaria</italic> (8.95%) and <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> (4.44%) for leaf (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3ef</xref>). Plant bacterial pathogens (2.29%) were the potential function of the core bacterial taxa in leaves but not in soil; soil had a greater abundance of nitrogen circle–related function (50.98%) than did leaves (17.55%) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3cd</xref>, Table S1-2). The abundance of plant fungal pathogens was greater in leaves (68.20%) than in soil (33.93%) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3gh</xref>, Table S3-4).</p>
<p>We further correlated the top 30 microbial genera of leaf and soil inocula with seed germination and seedling mortality in response to inoculation with nonsterile inocula at G0. The abundances of both the soil and leaf microbial genera were related to the seedling mortality rate (MR) but not to the germination time (GT) or germination rate (GR) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3ij</xref>). Specifically, the leaf core bacterial genera <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Sphingomonas</italic>, <italic>Massilia</italic>, <italic>Variovorax</italic>, <italic>Aureimonas</italic>, and <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> were positively correlated with MR, but the soil core bacteria, including Alphaproteobacteria_unclassified, <italic>Rhodoplanes</italic>, Vicinamibacteraceae_unclassified, and <italic>Pedomicrobium</italic>, were negatively correlated with MR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3abi</xref>). The leaf core fungal genera <italic>Didymella</italic>, Pleosporales_unclassified, <italic>Subplenodomus</italic>, and <italic>Bulleromyces</italic> were positively correlated with MR, but the soil core fungal genera <italic>Mortierella</italic>, <italic>Hypocrea</italic>, <italic>Pochonia</italic> and <italic>Volutella</italic> were negatively correlated with MR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3efj</xref>).</p>

<title>Leaf litter microbes had more adverse effects on <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seed germination and seedling survival than soil microbes</title>
<p>In support of our first expectation, leaf litter had more adverse effects on seed germination and seedling survival than soil (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Leaf litter has been previously reported to have adverse effects on seedling emergence and population establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbas et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Möhler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>) by reducing light and physical barriers and releasing allelochemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbas et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gross, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Möhler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Our study did not directly test the allelopathic effects of leaf litter. However, leaf litter possibly produces allelochemicals that adversely impact <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seed germination time and seedling survival. We observed that sterile leaf litter inoculation caused longer GTs than sterile soil and the control (nothing inoculated) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Interestingly, sterile leaf litter inoculation also caused longer GTs than nonsterile leaf litter inoculation, suggesting that some pathways through which leaf microbes alleviate the adverse effects of leaf allelopathy on GTs are unknown. Moreover, sterile leaf inoculation at G0 caused a 19.7% mortality rate for seedlings growing in petri dishes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), but no dead seedlings were observed when the plants were not inoculated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, S1).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, our study highlighted the adverse microbial role of leaf litter in seedling mortality because nonsterile leaves have significantly greater seedling mortality (96.7%) than sterile leaves (19.7%) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Indeed, we found that leaf litter harbored more abundant bacterial and fungal genera associated with seedling mortality, as well as a greater proportion of plant pathogens, than soil (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The results implied that the litter harboured many plant pathogens and thus played an essential role in mediating <italic>A. adenophora</italic> population density by killing conspecific seedlings. These findings provide novel insights for understanding plant invasion. Invasive plants are commonly characterized by rapid growth and a high yield of seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baker, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Parsons WT, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>). These traits are beneficial for rapid population establishment and range expansion at newly invaded sites. However, these invasive plant species commonly form high-density monocultures once the population is established, e.g., <italic>A. adenophora</italic>. In such a situation, high-density seedlings may exacerbate intraspecific competition. Self-limiting of the population elicited by leaf microbes may in turn help <italic>A. adenophora</italic> maintain monocultures at established sites. Thus, it is highly interesting to determine whether leaf microbe-mediated self-limitation at an early life stage is common and important in other invasive systems.</p>

<title>Peripheral microbial sources had more adverse effects on seedling survival and growth when inoculating at the early growth stage than at the later stage</title>
<p>Consistent with our second expectation, inoculation time significantly affected seedling survival and growth; in particular, seedling mortality was greater and seedling growth was poorer when inoculated at G0 than at later growth stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, d, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). The plant growth stage could change the impact of plant host-associated microbes, and such an impact is always strongest in early plant growth stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bagchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jevon et al., 2020</xref>). One potential reason is that small seedlings usually allocate most of their resources to survive and grow, while older seedlings have relatively more resources to defend against pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Geisen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schloter &amp; Matyssek, 2009</xref>). For example, smaller seedlings were more sensitive to inoculated individual fungi, soil microbiota or litter addition than older seedlings due to fewer defense resources and little chance of recovering from biomass loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Geisen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jevon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Another possible reason is related to the interaction between seed-borne microbes and peripheral microbial sources in young seedlings. There is evidence that seed–borne endophytes are likely to be beneficial for seedling growth and stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Herrera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wang &amp; Zhang, 2023</xref>). These seed endophytes might be inhibited or even excluded from young seedlings by external sources of microbes inoculated at G0, when seedlings are highly sensitive to inoculated microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Geisen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jevon et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, determining how peripheral microbial sources interact with seed–borne endophytes in seedlings across ontogeny is highly valuable.</p>
<p>We did not observe an adverse effect of leaf litter microbes on <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth, as observed previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kai Fang et al. (2019)</xref>, who inoculated <italic>A. adenophora</italic> at G0 (sowing seeds), because all seedlings inoculated with leaf litter at G0 died after transplantation into soils in this study. In contrast, both the microbial community and function were significantly positively correlated with seedling growth and had a greater relative abundance in seedlings inoculated with leaf litter than in those inoculated with soil, while those with a negative correlation showed the opposite trend (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). This finding suggested that leaf litter microbes might have a more positive effect on <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth than soil microbes if inoculated during the latter growth stage, such as at G21 and G21+28 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Interestingly, we found that N circle-related bacterial functions in seedling roots were positively correlated with seedling growth (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zhao et al. (2019)</xref> showed that <italic>A. adenophora</italic> invasion increased N circle-related bacterial functional genes in soil and subsequently directly promoted plant growth and invasion. K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fang et al. (2019)</xref> also reported that several root endophytic nitrogen–fixing bacteria of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> could significantly promote its growth. Interestingly, the abundance of these N circle–related bacterial functions was greater in seedling roots inoculated with leaf litter than in those inoculated with soil (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>), which suggests a possible way in which some N circle–related bacteria associated with leaf litter may migrate from leaves into roots after leaf litter inoculation.</p>

<title>Nutrient levels did not affect seedling mortality and microbe-mediated <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth</title>
<p>Nutrient addition can promote severe invasion, as invasive plants often have greater nutrient availability than do native plants. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Slate et al., 2022</xref>). However, it is unclear whether such an advantage is involved in a change in the microbial community-driven host growth effect. We also found that <italic>A. adenophora</italic> grew larger and more rapidly in the high-nutrient treatment than in the low-nutrient treatment (Fig. S6); moreover, the nutrient level significantly changed the microbial community and bacterial function (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Nonetheless, in contrast to our third expectation, seedling mortality was not affected by seedling growth under different nutrient levels, and nutrient levels negligently affected overall microbe-mediated <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth and the relative abundance of microbes and functions correlated with seedling growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ai et al. (2018)</xref> reported that nutrient additions cause crops to enrich some bacteria and fungi from soil and increase yield; however, there is no evidence that the increased yield effect is due to enriched microbial communities in this study. Our data indicated that the invasion advantage driven by high nutrient availability may be driven primarily by plant physiological traits, such as rapid nutrient absorption and growth strategies, rather than by enriched microbes. Alternatively, it is possible that our delayed harvest of seedlings under low nutrient levels may cover the distinct microbial role in seedling growth between the two nutrient levels (see Methods).</p>
<p>However, there was an interaction effect between nutrient level and inoculation time on seedling growth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). For example, a high nutrient level resulted in a more significant positive microbial effect on seedling growth than a low nutrient level when inoculated at G21, regardless of leaf litter or soil inoculation. It is unclear whether, during the first 21 days before inoculation, more beneficial seed endophytes are enriched to produce a more positive effect on seedling growth under high-nutrition conditions than under low-nutrition conditions, as seed endophytes can facilitate nutrient acquisition and subsequently promote plant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Khalaf &amp; Raizada, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sanchez-Lopez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Shao et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>The same microbial genera had distinct effects on <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling survival versus growth</title>
<p>Correlation analysis of the microbial community and function with seedling survival and growth revealed that several genera showed distinct correlations with seedling survival and growth. For example, the bacterial genera <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> and <italic>Massilia</italic> are positively correlated with seedling mortality and subsequent seedling growth (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>,<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Many strains belonging to these genera have been reported to promote the growth of many plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jimenez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Luo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Qiao et al., 2019</xref>), including <italic>A. adenophora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">K. Fang et al., 2019</xref>), because they are commonly involved in N<sub>2</sub> fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Albino et al., 2006</xref>). However, some microbes, e.g., the fungi <italic>Mortierella</italic> and <italic>Hypocrea</italic>, are negatively correlated with early seedling mortality but positively correlated with later seedling growth (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These fungi, as plant growth-promoting fungi (PGPFs), have been widely reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Contreras-Cornejo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ozimek &amp; Hanaka, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wani et al., 2017</xref>). These findings suggested that microbial interactions are highly complicated during the early life stage of <italic>A. adeonophora</italic>. On the one hand, there may be sequential effects for some plant growth-promoting microbial groups. For example, the bacteria <italic>Massilia, Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> may negatively affect seedling growth and even kill seedlings if the arrival time is too early after germination. On the other hand, such distinct effects of these bacterial groups on seedling survival versus growth may result from different species from the same genus or even from genetically distinct strains from one species. Interestingly, we found that most <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> ASVs enriched in the seedlings (&gt;80%) were not associated with the inoculum source (Fig. S8). This suggested that most of the bacterial ASVs positively correlated with growth might be from seeds rather than from the inocula. It is necessary to isolate these enriched microbes to test their interactions with the early life stage of <italic>A. adeonophora</italic>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, related plant pathogen guilds showed a positive correlation with <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling growth (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Because these putative plant pathogens were classified as plant pathogens based on the current database, it remains to determine whether such putative plant pathogens for most native plant species are not detrimental to invader <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth. Indeed, plant pathogens often can switch from a beneficial endophyte to a pathogen or vice versa depending on different host plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Delaye et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tian et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Seedling-killing microbes were those associated with leaf litter</title>
<p>We found that most seedling-killing microbes isolated from dead seedlings were previously reported to be leaf spot pathogens. For example, <italic>Alternaria</italic> (Pleosporaceae) and several genera belonging to the family Didymellaceae, such as <italic>Allophoma</italic>, <italic>Stagonosporopsis</italic>, <italic>Didymella</italic>, <italic>Boeremia</italic>, and <italic>Epicoccum</italic>, caused high seedling mortality (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). <italic>Alternaria</italic> sp. is often pathogenic to a large variety of plants, such as those causing stem cancer, leaf blight or leaf spot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Leiminger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Thomma, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Vergnes et al., 2006</xref>), and members of <italic>Allophoma</italic> have also been reported to cause dieback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babaahmadi et al., 2018</xref>) and leaf spot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Garibaldi et al., 2012</xref>).

<p>In particular, the numerically dominant <italic>Allophoma</italic> strains obtained in this study had the same ITS genes as the leaf endophyte and leaf spot pathogen <italic>Allophoma</italic> associated with <italic>A. adenophora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kai Fang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Yang et al., 2023</xref>).

We did not isolate fungi from healthy seedlings to determine whether the live seedlings indeed lacked or accumulated a lower abundance of the seedling-killing strains than did the dead seedlings in this study. We could assume that these fungal genera likely exist in <italic>A. adenophora</italic> mature individual experiencing a lifestyle switch from endophytic to pathogenic and play an essential role in limiting the population density of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> monocultures by killing seedlings only at very early stages.

<title>Implications for developing biocontrol agents for <italic>A. adenophora</italic> invasion</title>

In this study, the strains associated with leaf litter, such as <italic>Allophoma</italic> sp. and <italic>Alternaria</italic> sp., caused high seedling mortality and thus could control <italic>A. adenophora</italic> invasion at the seedling establishment stage. On the other hand, we found that an external source of microbes had a greater adverse effect on seedling survival and growth when inoculated at G0 than at the later growth stage.

<p>All seeds, rhizosphere soil (AAS) and leaf litter (AAL) of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> were collected from Xishan Forest Park, Kunming city, Yunnan Province (25°55′34″N; 102°38′30″E, 1890 m), on 9<sup>th</sup> April 2022. We collected dead leaves (litters) from the stems as inoculated leaves to avoid contamination by soil microbes; moreover, dead leaves could better represent litter in natural systems than fresh leaves. All leaf litter and soil samples were collected from five <italic>A. adenophora</italic> populations ∼200 m away from each other and treated as independent biological replicates. These <italic>A. adenophora</italic> plants had been grown in monoculture for more than 10 years; thus, their rhizosphere soils and leaf litters were used in our feedback experiment rather than via a typical two-phase approach (the first conditioning phase and the second testing phase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brinkman et al., 2010</xref>). The collected soil and litter samples were naturally dried in a clean room and weighed. The soil was ground to a 2 mm sieve before weighing. For convenience in the inoculation application, we prepared these samples in leaf litter bags (each containing 2 g of leaf litter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zaret et al., 2021</xref>) and soil bags (each containing 5 g of soil) as well as 0.1 g of soil or litter (cut into pieces smaller than 2×2 mm) in centrifuge tubes. All sample bags and tubes were divided into nonsterile and sterile groups and stored at 4°C until inoculation. The sterile groups (soils or litter) were sterilized by gamma irradiation (30 kGy, 30 h, Huayuan Nuclear Radiation Technology Co., Ltd., Kunming, China), which can kill all microorganisms because no colonies were formed after 7 days of inoculation on PDA media for gamma-irradiated samples (see Fig. S5); moreover, there was no evidence that this irradiation method changed the chemistry of the samples. The nonsterile groups (soils or litter) were natural samples containing live microorganisms. The natural soil or litter (0.3 g) was weighed into tubes and placed at –80°C until DNA extraction.</p>

(1) We inoculated <italic>A. adenophora</italic> with nonsterile rhizosphere soil and leaf litter of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> and sterile groups as control groups to distinguish the effects of aboveground microbes from those of underground microbes. (2) We inoculated the soils or leaf litters of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> at three growth stages (0 d, 21 d, 28 d) to explore the susceptibility of the seedlings to microbial infection and growth effects. We performed inoculation on the day of sowing the seeds on water agar plates (containing 5 g of agar and 500 mL of water) for germination, which we named G0 inoculation; on the 21<sup>st</sup> day after seedling growth, we named G21; and on the 28<sup>th</sup> day after seedling growth, we named G28. Leaf inoculation at G28 was performed to simulate natural microbial spread from the leaf litter to the above part of the seedlings by suspending the leaf bag over the transplanted seedlings without direct contact all the time (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zaret et al. (2021)</xref>). This method may result in only microbial species with easy air transmission to infect seedlings. Thus, an additional combination inoculation (named G21+28) was performed on both the 21st (with seedling contact) and 28th days (without seedling contact) to ensure that most leaf microbes had the opportunity to reach the seedlings. Therefore, we had four treatments for inoculation time. (3) We grew all the inoculated seedlings in background soil (made of Pindstrup substrate, pearlite and vermiculite at a volume ratio of 8:1:1, and nutrient content of Pindstrup substrate, see Table S9) by adding the same volume of Hoagland nutrient solution (high nutrient level) or only water (low nutrient level) to the soil. In total, our experimental design included 4 inoculation time (G0, G21, G28, G21+28) × 2 inoculum sources (leaf litter, rhizosphere soil) × 2 microbial treatments (sterile, nonsterile) × 2 nutrient levels (high, low) × 5 replicates = 160 cups. All the cups were randomly placed in the growth chamber and rearranged randomly every week to mitigate potential positional effects. Seedlings were harvested after 8 weeks of growth under high-nutrient conditions because they grew too fast and touched the PTFE cover; however, we harvested those plants grown under low-nutritional conditions after another 4 weeks of growth due to their very small size (see Fig. S6). No seedlings survived at the G0 inoculation of nonsterile leaf litters when harvested. Stem height, dry aboveground biomass and underground biomass were measured at harvest. Fresh seedling leaves and roots (0.3 g) from three seedlings per treatment as three replicates were harvested and surface-sterilized for microbial community detection. The aboveground and underground dry biomasses for seedlings with less than 0.3 g fresh weight were obtained by linear regression (see Fig. S7). Seed germination and inoculation manipulation for each inoculation treatment are detailed in supplementary method 1 (also see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Molecular sequencing of the microbial community</title>
<p>To link microbial sources (leaf litter and soil) with seed germination, seedling mortality and subsequent seedling biomass, we sequenced the microbial community associated with inoculum samples (natural <italic>A. adenophora</italic> soils (AAS) and leaf litter (AAL)), as well as fresh leaves and roots of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings grown in the nonsterile treatments. Fresh leaves and roots (0.3 g) of each seedling at harvest were chosen for surface sterilization and then stored at –80°C until total DNA was extracted. For DNA extraction, target‒gene amplification and sequencing steps, see Supplementary Method 2.</p>

<title>Seedling-killing fungus experiment</title>
<p>No dead seedlings were observed from Petri dishes inoculated with nonsterile soils at G0. Thus, we used 40 dead seedlings obtained from Petri dishes inoculated with nonsterile leaf litter at G0 to isolate fungi. Each dead seedling was cut into 1 mm × 1 mm pieces, and three tissues were placed on each PDA Petri dish and incubated at ambient temperature (20–25°C) for 6–8 days or until mycelia grew. Hyphal tip cultures were subsequently transferred onto new PDA plates and incubated until pure colonies appeared. The DNA of these purified fungal strains was extracted and identified by sequencing the ITS region (for details, see Supplementary Method 2).</p>
<p>To test the seedling-killing effects of these fungal strains on <italic>A. adenophora</italic>, sixteen surface-sterilized <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seeds were sown in a water agar plate in a Petri dish. Ten similar-sized seedlings in one Petri dish 21 days after sowing were selected for fungal inoculation. Five Petri dishes were used as five replicates for each strain. Fungi were grown on PDA for 7 days in an incubator at 25°C, after which 3 mm diameter agar discs with fungal mycelia were inoculated into seedlings by touching the leaves or stems (see Fig. S3). Seedlings were regarded as dead when the leaf and stem became brown and rotten. We recorded the number of dead seedlings after 14 days of inoculation with agar discs and then calculated the mortality rate (MR = the number of dead seedlings/10).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>It is unreasonable to directly compare seedling biomass among treatments because of different harvest time under high or low soil nutrition conditions (see methods description above), the response index (RI) was calculated to evaluate the feedback intensity (or direction) of microbes in the inocula soil or leaf on seedling growth: RI = (variable<sub>nonsterile</sub> – variable<sub>sterile</sub>)/variable<sub>sterile</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bruce Williamson &amp; Richardson, 1988</xref>), a one‒sample T test was used to determine the significance between the RI value and zero, where RI &gt; 0 and &lt; 0 represent microbes that promote or inhibit seedling growth, respectively. Because the mortality rates of some sterile groups were zero and their RIs were impossible to calculate, we had to directly compare the seedling mortality caused by nonsterile with by sterile samples and perform the analysis of correlation between the mortality rate and microbial composition. Generalized linear models (GLMs) with Gaussian error distributions (identity link) generated by the “lme4” package were used to identify the effects of inoculation source, time, nutrient level treatments and their interaction on the RIs of plant growth. The R<sup>2</sup> values of the models were obtained by the “piecewiseSEM” package, and P values were estimated using the ANOVA function via chi-squared (χ2) tests in GLMs. The nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test was used to perform all two-group comparisons, and the Kruskal–Wallis test was performed to compare the differences in mortality rate, RI or microbial relative abundances among the four inoculation time treatments.</p>
<p>Nonparametric Mann–Whitney U tests, Kruskal–Wallis tests and one‒sample T tests were performed using SPSS v. 22.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis was used to visualize the similarities in bacterial and fungal composition and function among the treatments. Permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was performed with the ADONIS function in the R (v. 4.2.0) package “vegan” to test the differences in the bacterial and fungal communities and functions among the treatment groups. Bacterial functional profiles were predicted using functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa (FAPROTAX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Louca et al., 2016</xref>). Fungal functional guilds were inferred using the program FUNGuild, and guild assignments with confidence rankings of “Highly probable” and “Probable” were retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>). The core microbial taxa were primarily selected from the ASVs that appeared (100% prevalence) among all the samples. Spearman’s correlation analysis was used to link microbial communities in inoculation sources (leaf litter and soils) with seed germination and seedling mortality in Petri dishes of the nonsterile G0 treatment, as well as to link the RI of seedling growth with microbial communities or functions in seedling leaves or roots based on all treatments. A correlation was considered significant when <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. Heatmap plotting was performed in R 4.2.0 with the “pheatmap” package. To examine the phylogenetic signal of the seedling-killing of fungal strains on <italic>A. adenophora</italic>, we calculated Pagel’s λ with the R package “phytools”, which measures the distribution of a trait across a phylogeny. A Pagel’s λ closer to 1 indicated a stronger phylogenetic signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pagel, 1999</xref>). The remaining figures were visualized in GraphPad Prism v7.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The work by Zeng et al. comprehensively explored the differences in the effects of leaf and soil microbes on the seed germination, seedling survival and seedling growth of an invasive forb, Ageratina Adenophora, and found evidence of stronger adverse effects of leaf microbes on Ageratina compared with soil microbes. By further DNA sequencing and fungal strain cultivation, the authors were able to identify some of the key microbial guilds that may facilitate such negative and positive feedbacks.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The theoretic framework is well-established;</p>
<p>
(2) Relating the direction of plant-microbe feedback to certain microbial guild is always hard, but the authors had done a great job in identifying and interpreting such relationships.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Allelopathic effects can't be directly accounted for;</p>
<p>
(2) The fungal strains accumulated in dead seedlings may also accumulate in live seedlings, thus more evidence is needed to validate the claim by the authors that Allophoma and Alternaria can increase seedling mortality.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) In the G0 and G21 inoculation experiments, allelopathic effects from leaf litters had not been accounted for, while these two experiments happened to be the ones where negative feedback was detected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not directly test the allelopathic effects. However, we actually also recorded seed germination time (GT) and rate (GR), as well as the seedling mortality rate (MR) for those treatments inoculated soil and leaf after sowing 28 days (G28 inoculation). It is allowed us to observe possible allelopathic effect by comparing sterile sample with control (nothing inoculated during the first 28 days). In this version, we added the result of GT, GR and MR for nothing inoculated (treated as control) in Figure 1, and described results as: “When inoculated at G0 period, the sterile leaf inoculation significantly delayed germination time more than soil and sterile leaves inoculation and control (nothing inoculated) (Fig. 1a, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05)” (see Line102-104). We have also discussed this point in the resubmitted version as: “Our study did not directly test the allelopathic effects of leaf litter. However, leaf litter possibly produces allelochemicals that adversely impact <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seed germination time and seedling survival. We observed that sterile leaf litter inoculation caused longer GTs than sterile soil and the control (nothing inoculated) (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, sterile leaf litter inoculation also caused longer GTs than nonsterile leaf litter inoculation, suggesting that some pathways through which leaf microbes alleviate the adverse effects of leaf allelopathy on GTs are unknown. Moreover, sterile leaf inoculation at G0 caused a 19.7% mortality rate for seedlings growing in petri dishes (Fig. 1c), but no dead seedlings were observed when the plants were not inoculated (Fig. 1a, S1).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, our study highlighted the adverse microbial role of leaf litter in seedling mortality because nonsterile leaves have significantly greater seedling mortality (96.7%) than sterile leaves (19.7%) (Fig. 1c)” in Line 289-301.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors did not compare the fungal strains accumulated in dead seedlings to those accumulated in live seedlings to prove that the live seedlings indeed accumulated lower abundances of the strains that were identified to increase seedling mortality.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your concerns. We have not isolated fungi from healthy seedlings to make a comparative study. However, our team work previously found that the seedling-killing <italic>Allophoma</italic> strains obtained in this study had the same ITS genes as the leaf endophyte and leaf spot pathogen <italic>Allophoma</italic> associated with mature <italic>A. adenophora</italic> individual; some seedling-killing <italic>Alternaria</italic> also occur in healthy seedlings inoculated by leaf litter. We thus assumed that these seedling-killing fungi, e.g., <italic>Allophoma</italic> and <italic>Alternaria</italic>, likely exist in <italic>A. adenophora</italic> mature individual by a lifestyle switch from endophytic to pathogenic, and these fungi can kill seedling only at very early life stage of <italic>A. adenophora</italic>.</p>
<p>Thus, we discussed this point as: “In particular, the numerically dominant <italic>Allophoma</italic> strains obtained in this study had the same ITS genes as the leaf endophyte and leaf spot pathogen <italic>Allophoma</italic> associated with <italic>A. adenophora</italic> (Chen et al., 2022; Kai Fang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2023). Interestingly, a previous report revealed that the dominant genera in healthy seedlings inoculated with leaf litter were <italic>Didymella</italic> and <italic>Alternaria</italic> (Kai Fang et al., 2019). We did not isolate fungi from healthy seedlings to determine whether the live seedlings indeed lacked or accumulated a lower abundance of the seedling-killing strains than did the dead seedlings in this study. We could assume that these fungal genera likely exist in <italic>A. adenophora</italic> mature individual experiencing a lifestyle switch from endophytic to pathogenic and play an essential role in limiting the population density of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> monocultures by killing seedlings only at very early stages. Thus, it is worth exploring the dynamic abundance of these strains and host resistance variation during <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling development.” in Line 432-</p>

<p>(3) The data of seed germination and seedling mortality could have been analyzed in the same manner as that of seedling growth, which makes the whole result section more coherent. I don't understand why the authors had not calculated the response index (RI) for germination/mortality rate and conducted analyses on the correlation between these RIs with microbial compositions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much. Response index (RI) was calculated as:</p>
<p>(variablenonsterile–variablesterile)/variablesterile)). Because mortality rates of some sterile groups were zero values, it is impossible to calculate their RIs. Relatively, only leaf microbes affect seed germination time (GT), leaf and soil microbes did not affect germination rate (GR) (see Fig. 1a,b). Therefore, we preferred to make a direct comparison of the difference between nonsterile and sterile treatments (also see Figure 1d) to assess microbial effect, and we also conducted a correlation by these values with microbial compositions rather than by RIs (see Fig. 3). We emphasized this point in the Materials and Methods in our resubmitted revision as: “Because the mortality rates of some sterile groups were zero and their RIs were impossible to calculate, we had to directly compare the seedling mortality caused by nonsterile with by sterile samples and perform the analysis of correlation between the mortality rate and microbial composition.” in Line 565-568.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study provides strong evidence that leaf microbes mediate self-limitation at an early life stage. It highlights the importance of leaf microbes in population establishment and community dynamics.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for your assessment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors conducted three experiments to test their hypothesis, elucidating the effects of leaf and soil microbial communities on the seedling growth of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> at different stages, screening potential microbial sources associated with seed germination and seedling performance, and identifying the fungus related to seedling mortality. The conclusions are justified by their results. Overall, the paper is wellstructured, providing clear and comprehensive information.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewing Editor (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In addition to the assessments from the reviewers, we have the following comments on your paper:</p>
<p>(1) The experimental design is complicated with regard to the multiple interacting treatments. The statistical analyses show that the interaction terms are important and significant. In this case, it could be more informative to show the detailed results at the sub-level than at the main level in the main text. For example, the main effects of inoculation sources and nutrients shown in Figure 2 are difficult to interpret, because the effects of inoculation sources and nutrients have important dependencies with each other and other factors such as inoculation time as shown in Figure S3. Therefore, Figure S3 is more informative than Figure 2. Please also be cautious that it would be necessary to clarify this context dependence when showing and citing results of the main effect to avoid any possible misunderstanding, such as the case of Figure 2 and S3.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion. We have deleted Figure 2 and placed Figure S3 in the text as Figure 2. And corresponding results have rewritten as “leaf inoculation caused significantly greater seedling mortality than did soil inoculation (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001); the nonsterile sample caused greater seedling mortality than did the sterile sample, especially leaf inoculation during the G0 and G21 periods. Moreover, nonsterile leaf inoculation at earlier stages significantly increased seedling mortality compared with that at later stages (Fig. 1d, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, seedling mortality did not differ between the high- and low-nutrient conditions, regardless of leaf or soil inoculation (Fig. 1d, both <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05).” in Line 109-115.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Response index (RI) is already a measure of microbial feedback effect, so that feedback may not be necessary as an explanatory variable in the model with RI as the response variable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry that our writing misunderstood you. Here the word “feedback” (e.g., foliage- or soil feedback) does not represent microbial feedback effect, it means leaf or soil inoculation. We have replaced “feedback” by “inoculation source” in the figures and text for better understanding.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Mortality rate is a ratio. It is unclear whether assuming a Gaussian error distribution is fine in your case. It would be important to check the residual distribution and to see whether data transformation (e.g., log) or using other error assumptions (e.g., binomial) is necessary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion. As you say, it is not appropriate to use generalized linear models (GLMs) with Gaussian error distributions (identity link) to evaluate seedling mortality, because mortality rate is a ratio, which do not meet normality. Thus, we deleted the result of GLM of seedling mortality and directly compared seedling mortality between different microbial treatments, inoculation time, nutrition level and inoculation source by Mann–Whitney U test and Kruskal–Wallis test (see Fig.1 d). All corresponding results have also been rewritten as “leaf inoculation caused significantly greater seedling mortality than did soil inoculation (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001); the nonsterile sample caused greater seedling mortality than did the sterile sample, especially leaf inoculation during the G0 and G21 periods. Moreover, nonsterile leaf inoculation at earlier stages significantly increased seedling mortality compared with that at later stages (Fig. 1d, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, seedling mortality did not differ between the high- and low-nutrient conditions, regardless of leaf or soil inoculation (Fig. 1d, both <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05).” in Line 109-115.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Please be consistent about the wording of different treatment names throughout the texts, tables, and figures. For example, &quot;feedback&quot; should only be used for microbial treatment, but not for inoculation source treatment (e.g., Figure 2). We can say there is an effect of microbial feedback only if we compare sterile vs. non-sterile groups, otherwise, there could be other effects, for example, the allelopathic effect pointed out by Reviewer #1. When writing inoculation, please be specific about whether it is for inoculation time or inoculation source (e.g., within multiple statistical tables in the appendix).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your good suggestion. We have changed “different feedback” into “different inoculation source” for better understanding our story.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Please clarify which inoculation periods they are for Figures 1d-g.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your good suggestion. We have added inoculation periods in Fig.1.</p>

<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>Lines 12-15: This sentence is too long and complicated, making it unclear what had been done and what had not in previous studies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks a lot. We have reorganized this sentence as: “However, how the phyllosphere and rhizosphere soil microbes distinctively affect seedling mortality and the growth of invasive plants across ontogeny under varying soil nutrient levels remains unclear.”.</p>

<p>Thanks. Significant phylogenetic signals represent the seedling-killing effects of fungal strains on <italic>A. adenophora</italic> were related to phylogenetic relatedness of these strains. So, we have changed “fungal strains isolated from dead seedlings inoculated with litter exhibited significant phylogenetic signals to seedling mortality” into “the <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling-killing effects of fungal strains isolated from dead seedlings by non-sterile leaf inoculation exhibited significant phylogenetic signals, by which strains of <italic>Allophoma</italic> and <italic>Alternaria</italic> generally caused high seedling mortality.”</p>

<p>We are so sorry that our writing misunderstood you.

<p>Thanks, we subdivided our Results into four sections and we changed these subtitles as:” Effects of leaf litter and rhizosphere soil on the mortality and growth of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings”, “Correlations of microbial community composition and potential function with seedling mortality at the early stage”, “Enrichment of microbial community and function by <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings under different treatments”, and “Correlations of the enriched microbial community and function with <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling growth”.</p>

<p>Lines 148-206: since there are a lot of results concerning the microbial composition, I suggest focusing on those that could directly explain the positive or negative feedback. The one concerning diversity (e.g. Figure 3 and corresponding texts) does not seem necessary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestion. We have moved figure 3 into the supplementary figures as Figure S2. To focus on core microbes that could directly explain the positive or negative feedback, we reordered Figure 3, where firstly showed the core soil and leaf bacteria, bacterial functions, as well as core soil and leaf fungi, fungal function (Fig3 a-h); and then showed the correlations of top 30 bacterial and fungal genera from soil and leaf with seedling mortality rate (Fig3 i-j).</p>

<p>Line 291-292: I don't see how the authors can distinguish between allelopathic and pathogenic effects based on their results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not directly test the allelopathic effects. However, we actually also recorded seed germination time (GT) and rate (GR), as well as the seedling mortality rate (MR) for those treatments inoculated soil and leaf after sowing 28 days (G28 inoculation). It is allowed us to observe possible allelopathic effect by comparing sterile sample with control (nothing inoculated during the first 28 days). In this version, we added the result of GT, GR and MR for nothing inoculated (treated as control) in Figure 1, and described results as: “When inoculated at G0 period, the sterile leaf inoculation significantly delayed germination time more than soil and sterile leaves inoculation and control (nothing inoculated) (Fig. 1a, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05)” (see Line102-104). We have also discussed this point in the resubmitted version as: “Our study did not directly test the allelopathic effects of leaf litter. However, leaf litter possibly produces allelochemicals that adversely impact <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seed germination time and seedling survival. We observed that sterile leaf litter inoculation caused longer GTs than sterile soil and the control (nothing inoculated) (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, sterile leaf litter inoculation also caused longer GTs than nonsterile leaf litter inoculation, suggesting that some pathways through which leaf microbes alleviate the adverse effects of leaf allelopathy on GTs are unknown. Moreover, sterile leaf inoculation at G0 caused a 19.7% mortality rate for seedlings growing in petri dishes (Fig. 1c), but no dead seedlings were observed when the plants were not inoculated (Fig. 1a, S1).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, our study highlighted the adverse microbial role of leaf litter in seedling mortality because nonsterile leaves have significantly greater seedling mortality (96.7%) than sterile leaves (19.7%) (Fig. 1c)” in Line 289-301.</p>

<p>Lines 383-414: Correlations are not necessarily causations. Sometimes a strong correlation may result from higher-order interaction. The authors should be more cautious about the discussion of microbial function in this section.</p>

<p>Thanks. We deleted all descriptions of adverse effect or beneficial effect on host plant <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth and cautiously used “negative correlation or positive correlation” to discuss the functions of these enriched microbes by <italic>A. adenophora</italic>. In the last, we also added a sentence to say: “It is necessary to isolate these enriched microbes to test the interactions with the early life stage of <italic>A. adeonophora</italic>.”</p>

<p>Lines 489-490: I don't really understand why the authors performed a combination treatment. What did they expect from such a combination?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. We described our consideration as: “Leaf inoculation at G28 was performed to simulate natural microbial spread from the leaf litter to the above part of the seedlings by suspending the leaf bag over the transplanted seedlings without direct contact all the time (see Zaret et al. (2021)). This method may result in only microbial species with easy air transmission to infect seedlings. Thus, an additional combination inoculation (named G21+28) was performed on both the 21st (with seedling contact) and 28th days (without seedling contact) to ensure that most leaf microbes had the opportunity to reach the seedlings.” see Line 498-505.</p>

<p>Figure 8: This is a very complicated experimental setup. Why did the authors harvest the plants treated with nutrient addition after the 12th day of the experiment and harvest those without nutrient addition after the 16th day? Why the time lag?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. We explained this as: “Seedlings were harvested after 8 weeks of growth under high-nutrient conditions because they grew too fast and touched the PTFE cover; however, we harvested those plants grown under low-nutritional conditions after another 4 weeks of growth due to their very small size (see Fig. S6).”</p>
