<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>The nuclear receptor, Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR/NR1H4), is increasingly recognized as a promising drug target for metabolic diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Protein coding genes regulated by FXR are well known, but whether FXR also acts through regulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which vastly outnumber protein-coding genes, remains unknown. Utilizing RNA-seq and GRO-seq analyses in mouse liver, we found that FXR activation affects the expression of many RNA transcripts from chromatin regions bearing enhancer features. Among these we discovered a previously unannotated liver-enriched enhancer-derived lncRNA (eRNA), termed <italic>FincoR</italic>. We show that <italic>FincoR</italic> is specifically induced by the hammerhead-type FXR agonists, including GW4064 and tropifexor. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated liver-specific knockdown of <italic>FincoR</italic> in dietary NASH mice reduced the beneficial effects of tropifexor, an FXR agonist currently in clinical trials for NASH and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), indicating that that amelioration of liver fibrosis and inflammation in NASH treatment by tropifexor is mediated in part by <italic>FincoR</italic>. Overall, our findings highlight that pharmacological activation of FXR by hammerhead-type agonists induces a novel eRNA, <italic>FincoR</italic>, contributing to the amelioration of NASH in mice. <italic>FincoR</italic> may represent a new drug target for addressing metabolic disorders, including NASH.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease and a leading cause of liver transplants and liver-related death <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Friedman et al., 2018</xref>)</italic>. NAFLD begins with simple steatosis but may further progress to a severe form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and later, fatal cirrhosis and liver cancer <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Friedman et al., 2018</xref>)</italic>. Despite its striking global increase and clinical importance, there is no approved drug for NASH. The urgent need for development of therapeutic agents for NASH has greatly increased research interest in the nuclear receptor, Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR, NR1H4) <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Evans &amp; Mangelsdorf, 2014</xref>)</italic>.</p>
<p>FXR is activated by its physiological ligands, bile acids (BAs), and regulates expression of genes involved in BA, lipid, and glucose metabolism and hepatic autophagy, which maintain metabolite levels and metabolic homeostasis <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Calkin &amp; Tontonoz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kliewer &amp; Mangelsdorf, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Seok et al., 2014</xref>)</italic>. Ligand-activated FXR also protects against hepatic inflammation and liver injury <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wang et al., 2008</xref>)</italic>. The action of FXR, similar to other nuclear receptors, is achieved primarily by its binding to chromatin loci to regulate the transcription of target genes <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Calkin &amp; Tontonoz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>)</italic>. Consistent with its crucial physiological functions, FXR is increasingly recognized as a promising drug target, particularly for liver diseases, such as NASH and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abenavoli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ali et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Downes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kremoser, 2021</xref>)</italic>. For example, semi-synthetic or non-steroidal synthetic agonists of FXR, including obeticholic acid (OCA) and hammerhead-type agonists, such as tropifexor and cilofexor, are currently in clinical trials for NASH and PBC patients <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abenavoli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kremoser, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sanyal et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tully et al., 2017</xref>)</italic>. However, how pharmacological activation of FXR mediates such beneficial therapeutic effects is poorly understood.</p>
<p>Non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are one of the fascinating discoveries of modern biology <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cech &amp; Steitz, 2014</xref>)</italic>. While a significant portion of the genome was initially thought to be “junk DNA”, it has been established that many non-coding regions give rise to functional non-coding RNAs <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cech &amp; Steitz, 2014</xref>)</italic>. Of these ncRNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group of transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides and play important roles in diverse biological processes <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mattick et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sartorelli &amp; Lauberth, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Statello et al., 2021</xref>)</italic>. A group of lncRNAs are produced from genomic regions bearing epigenetic features of enhancers <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mattick et al., 2023</xref>)</italic>. This is consistent with the idea that many transcriptional enhancers actively transcribe noncoding RNAs that are referred to as eRNAs (&gt;85k in humans and &gt;57k in mice) <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hirabayashi et al., 2019</xref>)</italic>, some of which are functionally important for enhancer functions <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lai &amp; Shiekhattar, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sartorelli &amp; Lauberth, 2020</xref>)</italic>. A majority of eRNAs have not yet been annotated in current lncRNA databases, such as GENCODE. Exploring eRNA landscapes and functions in diverse biology and disease states will facilitate our understanding of both lncRNAs and enhancers <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mattick et al., 2023</xref>)</italic>. Indeed, the landscape of eRNAs in mouse liver has been minimally explored <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fang et al., 2014</xref>)</italic>, and has not been well-studied in response to specific nuclear receptor activation, such as by FXR. Moreover, functional roles of eRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic> in intact organisms is understudied.</p>
<p>FXR was shown to regulate expression of small non-coding microRNA (miR) genes, for example <italic>miR-34a and miR-802 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Seok et al., 2021</xref>)</italic>, but it has not been reported whether FXR achieves its function through regulating lncRNAs, which far outnumber miRs. Because FXR directly regulates expression of its target genes <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>)</italic>, we examined if FXR regulates enhancer-derived lncRNAs (eRNAs), and if such transcripts participate in its physiological or pharmacological functions. By utilizing RNA-seq and GRO-seq analyses of livers from mice treated with FXR ligands, we identified a set of FXR-regulated eRNAs. Among these, we focused on a highly induced and abundantly expressed eRNA that we referred to as FXR-induced non-coding RNA (<italic>FincoR</italic>) for functional studies. <italic>FincoR</italic> is highly enriched in mouse liver and is induced specifically by hammerhead-type FXR agonists, including GW4064 and tropifexor. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies utilizing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated liver-specific knockdown of <italic>FincoR</italic> in dietary NASH mice indicated that <italic>FincoR</italic> is critically involved in mediating the beneficial pharmacological effects of tropifexor in reducing liver fibrosis and inflammation.</p>

<title>Activation of FXR by GW4064 induces a novel eRNA, <italic>FincoR</italic>, in mouse liver</title>
<p>To identify enhancer-derived lncRNAs (eRNAs) potentially regulated by FXR, we first obtained a list of putative enhancers in mouse liver based on ENCODE H3K27ac ChIP-Seq data (ENCFF001KMI, see <bold>methods</bold>). Then, we performed ribo-depleted total RNA-seq in the livers from mice treated with a specific FXR agonist, GW4064, to identify transcripts produced from these enhancer regions (see <bold><xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S1</xref></bold>). To avoid confounding issues of RNA signals from genes, we specifically focused on intergenic enhancer regions (+/- 3kb from H3K27ac peak center) that harbor discernible RNA-Seq signals (RPKM &gt; 1).</p>
<p>This genomic analysis resulted in identification of 190 high-confidence eRNAs in mouse liver. Among these, 14 eRNAs were upregulated and 5 were downregulated by GW4064 treatment (FDR &lt; 0.05, Log2 FC &gt; 1, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>) (see <bold>Supplementary Table S2</bold>). FXR-regulated eRNAs were produced adjacent to many genes with important roles in liver metabolism and disease, for example, <italic>Hes1</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A, B</xref></bold>). One of the most robustly induced eRNAs was <italic><underline>F</underline>XR-induced <underline>n</underline>on-<underline>co</underline>ding <underline>R</underline>NA</italic> (<italic>FincoR)</italic>, an unannotated novel transcript located on chromosome 19 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B, C</xref></bold>). Reverse transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) confirmed that treatment with GW4064 substantially induced expression of <italic>FincoR,</italic> more than 10-fold in mouse liver, which is similar to induction of <italic>Shp</italic>, a well-known FXR target gene (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>) <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Claudel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Evans &amp; Mangelsdorf, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Goodwin et al., 2000</xref>)</italic>. Induction of <italic>FincoR</italic> by GW4064 was transient, peaked within 1 h and then declined gradually, a pattern similar to that of <italic>Shp</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>). Expression of genes adjacent to <italic>FincoR</italic>, including <italic>Gcnt1, Rfk, Pcsk5 and Prune2,</italic> did not change after acute 1 h FXR activation as shown by RNA-seq (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>), and confirmed for <italic>Gcnt1</italic> by time course qPCR (<bold><xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We also found that the short-time GW4064 treatment resulted in 590 up-regulated genes and 500 down-regulated genes (FDR &lt; 0.05) (<bold><xref rid="fig1S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2A</xref></bold>). GO enrichment analysis of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed their roles in the regulation of triglyceride, fatty acid, and cholesterol metabolism (<bold><xref rid="fig1S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2B</xref></bold>), which is consistent with known roles of FXR in these physiological processes <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Claudel et al., 2005</xref>)</italic>.</p>

<title>Ligand-activated FXR directly activates transcription of eRNAs, including <italic>FincoR</italic></title>
<p>We sought to examine, 1) if these eRNAs were directly activated by FXR, and 2) if the activation takes place transcriptionally using FXR liver-specific knockout (FXR-LKO) mice that were treated with GW4064 to determine if FXR was required for induction of eRNAs by GW4064. FXR-LKO mice were generated from FXR floxed mice (FXR-flox) <bold>(<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>) and transcription of eRNAs was detected by global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq), a widely used method to detect nascent RNA transcription, including eRNAs <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sartorelli &amp; Lauberth, 2020</xref>)</italic>. GRO-seq showed that FXR-induced eRNAs were activated transcriptionally by GW4064 in FXR- flox mice, but such induction was abolished in FXR-LKO mice (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). In particular, <italic>FincoR</italic> is robustly induced in the GRO-Seq analysis and its induction is dependent on hepatic FXR (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>).

<p>We next examined if FXR binds to the enhancers that produce the identified eRNAs by analyzing published mouse liver ChIP-Seq data for FXR (<bold><xref rid="tblS3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S3</xref></bold>) <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>)</italic>. FXR binding was strongly enriched at the enhancers associated with FXR-induced eRNAs as were the enhancer marks H3K27ac and H3K4me1 (<bold><xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>).

<p>We validated FXR binding at the enhancer region that produces <italic>FincoR</italic> using mouse liver ChIP (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). We also examined binding of a well-known DNA binding partner of FXR, Retinoid x Receptor alpha (RXRα/NR2B1) <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Evans &amp; Mangelsdorf, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>)</italic>, and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), an acetylated histone reader protein that often binds at active enhancers <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Rahnamoun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sartorelli &amp; Lauberth, 2020</xref>)</italic> and is a transcriptional coactivator of FXR <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jung et al., 2020</xref>)</italic>. GW4064 treatment resulted in substantial increases in recruitment of both FXR and RXRα to the enhancer region close to the transcription start site of <italic>FincoR</italic> (arrow shown below in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), whereas binding was not detected at a control region (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). We also found that BRD4 occupancy was increased at this enhancer region after GW4064 treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). These results indicate that GW4064 activation of FXR leads to increased occupancy of the FXR/RXRα heterodimer and BRD4 to the enhancer region to upregulate <italic>FincoR</italic> eRNA in the liver.</p>
<p>We identified an inverted repeat1 (IR1) motif that is known to bind FXR <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Calkin &amp; Tontonoz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al., 2006</xref>)</italic> within the major FXR binding peak near the start site of <italic>FincoR</italic> (arrow shown below in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), which we also refer to as FXRE (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B, C</xref></bold>). We examined the functionality of this IR1 motif for mediating transcriptional activation by GW4064 using reporter assays (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). We cloned the region containing the IR1 motif into the pGL4.23 luciferase reporter and generated a mutated IR1 motif construct as a comparison (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). After transfection into human hepatic HepG2 cells, GW4064 treatment significantly elevated the luciferase activity of the reporter with the wild type IR1 motif, but not with the mutated IR1 motif (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). Together, these results suggest that GW4064-activated FXR directly upregulates <italic>FincoR</italic> expression.</p>

<p>Consistent with the phenotypes, hepatic expression of key genes involved in BA synthesis was dramatically reduced by tropifexor treatment (i.e., <italic>Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1</italic>), which is consistent with decreased gallbladder BA levels mediated by this agonist (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></bold>).

<p>Consistent with the phenotypes from histological analyses, hepatic expression of fibrosis and inflammation was altered by <italic>FincoR</italic> knockdown.

<p>To determine whether expression of <italic>FincoR</italic> is altered in chronic liver disease, we utilized mouse models of NAFLD/NASH and cholestatic liver injury. Hepatic <italic>FincoR</italic> levels were significantly increased in mice fed with a high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref></bold>) and in mice fed a HFD with high fructose (HFHF) in drinking water for 12 weeks (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref></bold>). Elevated hepatic <italic>FincoR</italic> levels were also observed in mice treated with α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT), a chemical inducer of liver cholestasis <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kim et al., 2016</xref>)</italic> (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref></bold>), and in mice with bile duct ligation (BDL), a surgical method to induce cholestatic liver injury (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>The sequence of <italic>FincoR</italic> is moderately conserved between mice and humans as displayed in the UCSC genome browser (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1E</xref></bold>). Annotation in the NCBI genome data viewer of the human sequence region with similarity to mouse <italic>FincoR</italic> revealed an functionally uncharacterized human lncRNA, XR_007061585.1, in this region <bold>(<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1F</xref>)</bold>. However, whether this sequence (or an as yet to be identified lncRNA) is functional or not has not been determined. To explore the potential changes or role of lncRNA XR_007061585.1 in human liver pathological conditions, we measured hepatic levels of the transcripts in PBC and NAFLD patients. Compared to normal individuals, hepatic lncRNA XR_007061585.1 levels were elevated in patients with PBC or NAFLD, but not in severe NASH-fibrosis patients (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S1G, H</xref></bold>). These results demonstrate that hepatic levels of a potential human analog of <italic>FincoR</italic> are elevated in NAFLD and PBC patients, as <italic>FincoR</italic> is in mouse models of chronic liver disease with hepatic inflammation and liver injury. However, whether human lncRNA XR_007061585.1 is analogous to mouse <italic>FincoR</italic> in terms of functions and mechanisms, and whether elevated XR_007061585.1 levels may have a role in the disease progression or may be an adaptive response to liver injury remains to be determined.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>FXR maintains metabolic homeostasis by transcriptional regulation of genes. Direct regulation of protein-coding genes by FXR, including <italic>Shp</italic>, is well characterized. In this study we show that FXR also mediates its functions by induction of lncRNA genes, which vastly outnumber protein-coding genes. We further show that pharmacological activation of FXR by hammerhead-type agonists induces a liver-specific enhancer-derived lncRNA, which we named <italic>FincoR</italic>, that contributes to reduction of NASH pathologies in mice.</p>
<p><italic>FincoR</italic> is specifically induced by the hammerhead class of FXR agonists, such as GW4064, cilofexor, and tropifexor. GW4064 is the mother compound of these isoxazole-type hammerhead ligands but is not an ideal therapeutic agent because of its poor water solubility and pharmacokinetics <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abel et al., 2010</xref>)</italic>. In contrast, tropifexor and cilofexor have better pharmacokinetics and are generally well-tolerated in clinical trials for NASH and PBC patients <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abenavoli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kremoser, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sanyal et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tully et al., 2017</xref>)</italic>, but the underlying mechanisms for their beneficial effects are poorly understood. Intriguingly, a recent study showed that the gene signature regulated by tropifexor-activated FXR appears to be broader than that of OCA, partly because the tropifexor backbone allows a more favorable interaction of FXR with coactivators or epigenomic modulators <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hernandez et al., 2019</xref>)</italic>. Further, tropifexor was shown to regulate distinct sets of genes in experimental NASH as compared to other FXR agonists, particularly genes involved in fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hernandez et al., 2019</xref>)</italic>. Utilizing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated liver-specific knockdown of <italic>FincoR</italic> in diet-induced NASH mice, we demonstrate that beneficial effects on reducing liver fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis mediated by tropifexor were largely dependent on <italic>FincoR</italic> (Model, <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>While this study focused on regulation of <italic>FincoR</italic> by pharmacological activation of FXR, physiological and pathological regulations of <italic>FincoR</italic> appear to be complex. Although <italic>FincoR</italic> can be induced by the hammerhead class of FXR agonists, it was not induced by the endogenous FXR ligand, cholic acid. This implies that <italic>FincoR</italic> may not contribute to the physiological functions of FXR. In an effort to investigate the potential role of FincoR in the pathological conditions, we observed that <italic>FincoR</italic> levels were elevated in mouse models of cholestasis and NASH as well as in human PBC and NAFLD patients, where BA metabolism is dysregulated. Since different BAs can activate or repress the gene-regulating function of FXR <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wahlstrom et al., 2016</xref>)</italic>, altered BA composition in these pathological conditions may contribute to induction of <italic>FincoR</italic>. Further, binding peaks for multiple nuclear receptors, FXR, LXR, PPARα, RXRα, and HNF-4α, were detected in the <italic>FincoR</italic> locus so that regulation of <italic>FincoR</italic> likely involves the combinatorial regulation by multiple nuclear receptors (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S2</xref></bold>). Interestingly, occupancy of the nuclear receptor PPARα at the enhancer region was increased in fasted mice (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S3</xref></bold>). It will be interesting to investigate whether and how <italic>FincoR</italic> is differently regulated by these nuclear receptors in response to physiological and pathological cues.</p>
<p>The roles of regulatory RNAs in liver function and diseases and their potentials as therapeutic targets are increasingly being appreciated <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brocker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sallam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>)</italic>. For example, a critical role for an oxysterol nuclear receptor LXR-induced lncRNA, <italic>LeXis</italic>, in feedback modulation of cholesterol biosynthesis has been shown <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sallam et al., 2016</xref>)</italic>. Recently, the role of a lncRNA, <italic>Pair</italic>, in liver phenylalanine metabolism has been demonstrated <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Li et al., 2021</xref>)</italic>. Enhancer RNAs are a less characterized class of lncRNAs and are highly associated with enhancer functions in gene regulation <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Li et al., 2016</xref>)</italic>. Numerous studies have revealed transcriptional roles for eRNAs in various cellular processes <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lai &amp; Shiekhattar, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sartorelli &amp; Lauberth, 2020</xref>)</italic> but most previous eRNA studies have used cultured cells <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hsieh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Li et al., 2013</xref>)</italic>, with only a few <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in mouse models <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mirtschink et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tang et al., 2023</xref>)</italic>. In our current study, through integrative analysis of transcriptome and histone mark ChIP-Seq, we identified a group of FXR- regulated eRNAs, including the highly induced <italic>FincoR</italic>. Our current work characterized the role of <italic>FincoR</italic> in gene regulation and in mediating beneficial pharmacological effects of tropifexor in NASH, representing important progress in understanding the roles of eRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>. Future work is warranted to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which <italic>FincoR</italic> facilitates action of FXR agonists to alleviate inflammation, fibrosis and apoptosis. RNA inside the cells usually associates with different RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gerstberger et al., 2014</xref>)</italic>. We identified potential binding proteins of <italic>FincoR</italic> using the ATtRACT database (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Giudice et al., 2016</xref></italic>). The top four candidates for <italic>FincoR</italic> binding are KHDRBS1, RBM38, YBX2 and YBX3 (<bold>Supplemental Table S5</bold>). KHDRBS1 and RBM38 have been reported to have important roles in RNA processing (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bielli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zou et al., 2021</xref></italic>). YBX2 and YBX3 belong to the Y-box (YBX) protein family, which have been linked to diverse forms of RNA metabolism and many other processes, including cell proliferation, DNA repair, stress responses, development, and inflammation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kleene, 2018</xref></italic>). Whether these predicted RBPs interact with <italic>FincoR</italic> and how they contribute to phenotypes should be investigated in future experimentation to understand the mechanisms involved in <italic>FincoR</italic>-regulated hepatocyte function.</p>
<p>There is limitation of some of our approaches that cannot fully dissect the underlying mechanisms of <italic>FincoR</italic>. Currently, the function of eRNA loci can be attributed to a functional eRNA transcript, or binding of transcription factors to this region, or the transcription process itself, or some combination of these effects <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sartorelli &amp; Lauberth, 2020</xref>)</italic>. In our studies to decrease expression of <italic>FincoR</italic>, the region containing the FXR binding site was deleted (<bold><xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A</xref>, right panel</bold>). While the expression of <italic>FincoR</italic> transcripts was significantly reduced, we cannot rule out whether decreased binding of FXR or decreased transcription contribute to the observed changes in phenotype. To directly investigate the function of <italic>FincoR</italic> transcripts, downregulation of the transcript with antisense oligonucleotides together with overexpression of <italic>FincoR</italic> in the liver will be required in future experiments.</p>
<p>FXR is increasingly recognized as an important therapeutic target for enterohepatic diseases, but the development of clinically applicable and more targeted FXR-based therapy is still challenging. In this study, we provided the first characterization of an eRNA, <italic>FincoR</italic>, induced by pharmacological activation of FXR and show that <italic>FincoR</italic> has a beneficial role in reducing liver fibrosis and inflammation in dietary NASH mice. Complete understanding of the function and mechanisms of <italic>FincoR</italic> may provide novel insights for the development of desirable therapy for NASH and other chronic liver diseases.</p>

<p>All animal studies were performed according to procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care &amp; Use Committee at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Mice were maintained in 12/12 h light/dark cycles and fed standard rodent chow. FXR-LKO mice were generated by breeding FXR floxed mice with Albumin-Cre mice (The Jackson Lab). <italic>FincoR</italic>-LKD mice were generated as previously reported <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>)</italic>.

<title>Construction of strand-specific RNAseq libraries</title>
<p>Construction of the RNAseq libraries and sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 were performed at the Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. After DNase digestion, purified total RNAs were analyzed on a Fragment Analyzer (Agilent) to evaluate RNA integrity. The total RNAs were converted into individually barcoded polyadenylated mRNAseq libraries with the Kapa HyperPrep mRNA kit (Roche). Libraries were barcoded with Unique Dual Indexes (UDI’s) which have been developed to prevent index switching. The adaptor-ligated double-stranded cDNAs were amplified by PCR for 8 cycles with the Kapa HiFi polymerase (Roche). The final libraries were quantitated with Qubit (Thermo Fisher) and the average cDNA fragment sizes were determined on a Fragment Analyzer. The libraries were diluted to 10 nM and further quantitated by qPCR on a CFX Connect Real-Time qPCR system (Bio-Rad) for accurate pooling of barcoded libraries and maximization of number of clusters in the flowcell.</p>

<title>GRO-seq</title>
<p>To harvest the nuclei from mouse liver cells, the liver was harvested at indicated time and washed with a cold swelling buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 U/ml Superase-In). The nuclei were prepared by Dounce homogenization in cold swelling buffer and filtered using a cell strainer (100 μm, BD Biosciences). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 400 x g for 10 min, then resuspended in the lysis buffer (swelling buffer with 10% glycerol and 1% IGEPAL) and incubated on ice for 5 min. Nuclei were washed twice with the lysis buffer and resuspended at a concentration of 10<sup>8</sup> nuclei/ml in the freezing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EDTA). We then followed our previous method <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Oh et al., 2021</xref>)</italic> to conduct nuclear run-on and GRO-Seq library preparation. Briefly, the nuclei in freezing buffer were subjected to the nuclear run-on reaction by mixing with an equal volume of run-on buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 300 mM KCl, 20 units of Superase-In, 1% sarkosyl, 500 µM ATP, GTP, Br-UTP and 2 µM CTP) for 5 min at 30 °C. The BrU-labeled run-on RNAs were extracted by TRIzol and purified by anti-BrdU agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech, sc-32323 AC). The run-on RNAs were then subjected to end repair by T4 PNK, poly-adenylation, and then to cDNA first strand synthesis by a custom primer (oNTI223) that allows circularization of the cDNA. This cDNA then was re-linearized by Ape1 (NEB), size selected by TBE gel electrophoresis and the products of the desired size were excised (∼320–350 bp) for final library prep and sequencing. GRO-Seq samples were run on a NextSeq 500 sequencer from Illumina with a single-end 80 nt model.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their article, the authors delve into the therapeutic potential of a newly identified liver-specific lncRNA, FincoR, regulated by the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) and induced by the agonist tropifexor, in treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). They demonstrate that FincoR significantly enhances tropifexor's effectiveness in reducing liver fibrosis and inflammation in NASH, presenting it as a promising therapeutic target. The manuscript revisions broaden the study to include both mouse and human data, showing elevated FincoR levels in various mouse models of liver disease and identifying a similar lncRNA in humans, potentially indicating a conserved therapeutic mechanism. This research offers valuable insights into FincoR's role in NASH and suggests further exploration into its functions and mechanisms in liver disease treatment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study enhances our understanding of FincoR, a liver-specific lncRNA, and its therapeutic potential in treating NASH through a multifaceted research approach. The revised manuscript further strengthens this contribution by incorporating additional experiments and human relevance, summarized as follows: 1) The use of GRO-seq and RNA-seq technologies has provided an in-depth and unbiased view of the transcriptional alterations driven by the FXR agonist tropifexor, especially emphasizing FincoR's pivotal role. 2) The research expands on the original findings by including diverse mouse models of NAFLD/NASH and cholestatic liver injury. These models demonstrate significant increases in hepatic FincoR levels across various conditions, such as diets high in fat and fructose, chemical induction of liver cholestasis with ANIT, and surgical induction via bile duct ligation. This broadened scope underscores FincoR's involvement in liver disease mechanisms beyond the initial models of FXR knockout (KO) and FincoR liver-specific knockdown (FincoR-LKD). 3) Incorporation of tropifexor, an FDA-approved FXR agonist, alongside these experimental models bridges experimental findings to potential therapeutic applications for NASH patients. 2) The manuscript revision includes promising data on the sequence similarity between mouse FincoR and a human locus, identifying a partially conserved human lncRNA (XR_007061585.1) with elevated levels in NAFLD and PBC patients. This addition enhances the study's relevance to human health. 3) The study's design, with the inclusion of both negative and positive controls and now enriched with a wider array of mouse models and human data, ensures that the observed therapeutic effects can be confidently attributed to FincoR's modulation by tropifexor.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors acknowledge that certain questions remain unanswered within the scope of this study on FincoR, due to feasibility and technical challenges. While it's important to note that such limitations are rooted in the practical and technical complexities, these unresolved issues might limit the study's immediate impact. The decision to focus on the discovery and initial characterization of FincoR, is strategically but not scientifically justified.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NASH), recently renamed as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a leading cause of liver-related death. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a promising drug target for treating NASH and several drugs targeting FXR is under clinical investigation for its efficacy in treating NASH. The authors intended to address whether FXR mediates its hepatic protective effects through regulation of lncRNAs, which would provide novel insights into the pharmacological targeting of FXR for NASH treatment. The authors went from an unbiased transcriptomics profiling to identify a novel enhancer-derived lncRNA FincoR enriched in the liver and showed that the knockdown of FincoR in a murine NASH model attenuated part of the effect of tropifexor, an FXR agonist, namely inflammation and fibrosis, but not steatosis. This study provides a framework how one can investigate the role of noncoding genes in pharmacological intervention targeting a known protein coding genes. Given that many disease-associated genetic variants are located in the non-coding regions, this study, together with others, may provide useful information for improved and individualized treatment for metabolic disorders.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study leverages both transcriptional profile and epigenetic signatures to identify the top candidate eRNA for further study. The subsequent biochemical characterization of FincoR using FXR-KO mice combined with Gro-seq and Luciferase reporter assays convincingly demonstrates this eRNA as a FXR transcriptional targets sensitive to FXR agonists. The use of in vitro culture cells and the in vivo mouse model of NASH provide multi-level evaluation of the context-dependent importance of the FincoR downstream of FXR in regulation of functions related to liver dysfunction.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Future work to dissect the detailed mechanisms by which FincoR facilitates action of FXR and its agonists is warranted. A more direct approach to alter eRNA levels, e.g., overexpression of FincoR in the liver would provide important data to interpret its functional regulation.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife assessment:</bold></p>
<p>The authors report a novel hepatic lncRNA FincoR regulating FXR with therapeutic implications in the treatment of MASH. The findings are important and use an appropriate methodology in line with the current state-of-the-art, with convincing support for the claims.</p>
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the article titled &quot;Hammerhead-type FXR agonists induce an eRNA FincoR that ameliorates nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in mice,&quot; the authors explore the role of the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) in treating metabolic disorders like NASH. They identify a new liver-specific long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), FincoR, regulated by FXR, notably induced by agonists such as tropifexor. The study shows that FincoR plays a significant role in enhancing the efficacy of tropifexor in mitigating liver fibrosis and inflammation associated with NASH, suggesting its potential as a novel therapeutic target. The study makes a promising contribution to understanding the role of FincoR in alleviating liver fibrosis in NASH, providing initial insights into the mechanisms involved. While it offers a valuable starting point, there is potential for further exploration into the functional roles of FincoR and their specific actions in human NASH cases. Building upon the current findings to elucidate more detailed mechanistic pathways through which FincoR exerts its therapeutic effects in liver disease would elevate the research's significance and potential impact in the field.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study stands out for its comprehensive and unbiased approach to investigating the role of FincoR, a liver-specific lncRNA, in the treatment of NASH. Key strengths include: 1) The application of advanced sequencing methods like GRO-seq and RNA-seq offered a comprehensive and unbiased view of the transcriptional changes induced by tropifexor, particularly highlighting the role of FincoR. 2) Utilizing a genetic mouse model of FXR KO and a FincoR liver-specific knockdown (FincoR-LKD) mouse model provided a controlled and relevant environment for studying NASH, allowing for precise assessment of tropifexor's therapeutic effects. 3) The inclusion of tropifexor, an FDAapproved FXR agonist, adds significant clinical relevance to the study. It bridges the gap between experimental research and potential therapeutic application, providing a direct pathway for translating these findings into real-world clinical benefits for NASH patients. 4) The study's rigorous experimental design, incorporating both negative and positive controls, ensured that the results were specifically attributable to the action of FincoR and tropifexor.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study presents several notable weaknesses that could be addressed to strengthen its findings and conclusions: 1) The authors focus on FincoR, but do not extensively test other lncRNAs identified in Figure 1A. A more comprehensive approach, such as rescue experiments with these lncRNAs, would provide a better understanding of whether similar roles are played by other lncRNAs in mitigating NASH. 2) FincoR was chosen for further study primarily because it is the most upregulated lncRNA induced by GW4064. Including another GW4064-induced lncRNA as a control in functional studies would strengthen the argument for FincoR's unique role in NASH. 3) The study does not conclusively demonstrate whether FincoR is specifically expressed in hepatocytes or other liver cell types. Conducting FincoR RNA-FISH with immunofluorescent experiments or RT-PCR, using markers for different liver cell types, would clarify its expression profile. 4) Understanding the absolute copy number of FincoR is crucial. Determining whether there are sufficient copies of FincoR to function as proposed would lend more credibility to its suggested role. 5) The manuscript, although technically proficient, does not thoroughly address the relevance of these findings to human NASH. Questions like the conservation of FincoR in humans and its potential role in human NASH should be discussed.</p>

Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a promising drug target for treating NASH and several drugs targeting FXR are under clinical investigation for their efficacy in treating NASH. The authors intended to address whether FXR mediates its hepatic protective effects through the regulation of lncRNAs, which would provide novel insights into the pharmacological targeting of FXR for NASH treatment. The authors went from an unbiased transcriptomics profiling to identify a novel enhancer-derived lncRNA FincoR enriched in the liver and showed that the knockdown of FincoR in a murine NASH model attenuated part of the effect of tropifexor, an FXR agonist, namely inflammation and fibrosis, but not steatosis. This study provides a framework for how one can investigate the role of noncoding genes in pharmacological intervention targeting known protein-coding genes. Given that many disease-associated genetic variants are located in the non-coding regions, this study, together with others, may provide useful information for improved and individualized treatment for metabolic disorders.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study leverages both transcriptional profile and epigenetic signatures to identify the top candidate eRNA for further study. The subsequent biochemical characterization of FincoR using FXR-KO mice combined with Gro-seq and Luciferase reporter assays convincingly demonstrates this eRNA as a FXR transcriptional target sensitive to FXR agonists. The use of in vitro culture cells and the in vivo mouse model of NASH provide multi-level evaluation of the context-dependent importance of the FincoR downstream of FXR in the regulation of functions related to liver dysfunction.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As discussed, future work to dissect the mechanisms by which FincoR facilitates the action of FXR and its agonists is warranted. It would be helpful if the authors could base this on the current understanding of eRNA modes of action and the observed biochemical features of FincoR to speculate potential molecular mechanisms explaining the observed functional phenotype. It is unclear if this eRNA is conserved in humans in any way, which will provide relevance to human disease. Additionally, the eRNA knockdown was achieved by deletion of an upstream region of the eRNA transcription. A more direct approach to alter eRNA levels, e.g., overexpression of FincoR in the liver would provide important data to interpret its functional regulation.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p>
<p>The study presents several notable weaknesses that could be addressed to strengthen its findings and conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) The authors focus on FincoR, but do not extensively test other lncRNAs identified in Figure 1A. A more comprehensive approach, such as rescue experiments with these lncRNAs, would provide a better understanding of whether similar roles are played by other lncRNAs in mitigating NASH.</p>
<p>(2) FincoR was chosen for further study primarily because it is the most upregulated lncRNA induced by GW4064. Including another GW4064-induced lncRNA as a control in functional studies would strengthen the argument for FincoR's unique role in NASH.</p>
<p>(3) The study does not conclusively demonstrate whether FincoR is specifically expressed in hepatocytes or other liver cell types. Conducting FincoR RNA-FISH with immunofluorescent experiments or RT-PCR, using markers for different liver cell types, would clarify its expression profile.</p>
<p>(4) Understanding the absolute copy number of FincoR is crucial. Determining whether there are sufficient copies of FincoR to function as proposed would lend more credibility to its suggested role.</p>

<p>Response to 1 - 4): We thank Reviewer 1 for the positive comments on the strength of our work, including the open-ended approach, the novel eRNA FincoR and its strong relevance to liver disease. We also value the constructive feedback provided by the reviewer and agree that additional studies are important to fully understand the mechanisms of FincoR and the functional significance of other FXR-induced lncRNAs. In this manuscript we report the discovery and initial characterization of FincoR, as well as its potential function in FXR action in response to hammerhead agonists, but a number of interesting questions are raised. Future experiments, as suggested by reviewer, will be needed to examine the role of other FXR-induced lncRNAs, the potential role of FincoR induction by other nuclear receptors with binding sites at FincoR, whether FincoR is expressed in liver cell types in addition to hepatocytes, and the expression abundance of FincoR. These are all excellent suggestions for future experimentation which we feel are beyond the scope of the present report. For example, generating a genetic CRISPR/Cas9 of another lncRNA is not trial as it takes a significant amount of work with murine models. Also, we did not mean to exclude if other lncRNAs induced by FXR also bear functions. Technically, rescue experiment is not possible as FincoR RNA can be potentially very long (~10 kb if estimated by RNA-seq pattern in Fig.1C), and it is not feasible now to properly express it by exogenous vectors to ensure the expression levels are similar to endogenous ones. We therefore consider that these important questions are more suitable for future work to fully address. Our belief is that a comprehensive exploration of FXR-regulated lncRNAs holds the potential to unveil novel insights crucial for the development of therapies targeting NASH and other metabolic diseases. The study of FincoR is the beginning of this area of research.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The manuscript, although technically proficient, does not thoroughly address the relevance of these findings to human NASH. Questions like the conservation of FincoR in humans and its potential role in human NASH should be discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: These are important questions. To respond to the reviewer’s comment, new experiments are presented in our final revised manuscript in which we utilized mouse models of NAFLD/NASH and cholestatic liver injury to determine FincoR’s role in these diseases. Hepatic FincoR levels were significantly increased in mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks (Supplementary Figure S1A) and in mice fed a HFD with high fructose (HFHF) in drinking water for 12 weeks (Supplementary Figure S1B). Elevated hepatic FincoR levels were also observed in mice treated with α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT), a chemical inducer of liver cholestasis (Supplementary Figure S1C), and in mice with bile duct ligation (BDL), a surgical method to induce cholestatic liver injury (Supplementary Figure S1D).</p>
<p>In terms of the human relevance, we have provided additional information and figures showing that there is sequence similarity between mouse FincoR and a human loci.  FincoR sequence is moderately conserved between mice and humans as displayed in the UCSC genome browser (Supplementary Figure S1E). Annotation of these      conserved human sequences revealed that they overlap with a functionally      uncharacterized human lncRNA XR_007061585.1 (Supplementary Figure S1F). Further, we conducted qRT-PCR experiment from human patient’s RNA samples, which demonstrated that hepatic lncRNA XR_007061585.1 levels are elevated in patients with NAFLD and PBC, but not in severe NASH-fibrosis patients (Supplementary Figure S1G, H). These results demonstrate that hepatic levels of a potential human analog of FincoR are elevated in NAFLD and PBC patients, which is consistent with FincoR’s upregulation      in mouse models of chronic liver disease with hepatic inflammation and liver injury. Whether human lncRNA XR_007061585.1 is entirely analogous to mouse FincoR in terms of functions and mechanisms, and whether the elevation of this human lncRNA has
a role in liver disease progression or is an adaptive response to liver injury remains to be determined.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) In the introduction Line 96, &quot;..., while the vast majority are transcribed into ncRNAs&quot; may not be accurate. Please refer to Pointing and Haerty Annu Rev 2022 for a related discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out this inaccurate information in the introduction. We have changed the content in the text, “While a significant portion of the genome was initially thought to be &quot;junk DNA&quot;, it has been established that many non-coding regions give rise to functional non-coding RNAs.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure 5: the authors should provide a clear illustration demonstrating the sequence targeted by the sgRNA in relation to the transcriptional and epigenetic profile (i.e., RNAseq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq data).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: The illustration (Figure 5-figure supplement 1A, right panel) demonstrating the sequence targeted by the sgRNA has been updated as suggested by the reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In this model, the upstream of FincoR is deleted, leading to the inhibition of FincoR transcription. Does the deleted region include FXR binding sites? If so, would the phenotype be due to the deletion of these binding sequences, rather than the decreased FincoR transcripts? Accordingly, the limitation or alternative interpretation should be discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: The reviewer made a good point. The deleted region includes FXR binding sites so that we cannot rule out decreased binding of FXR or decreased transcription of the region per se, in addition to the decreased levels of FincoR, to bear a role in the phenotypic changes we observed. In the final revision, we have added discussion of this alternative (6th paragraph in the revised discussion section).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 6C, the images should be accompanied by quantification. It appears the FincoR-KD shows a visible difference as compared to Tropifexor-treated control mice, which does not match entirely what is written in the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: The quantitation of Oil Red O staining has been done as suggested by the reviewer (Figure 6C). The result is consistent with the triglyceride result showing that tropifexor treatment markedly reduced neutral lipids determined by Oil Red O staining of liver sections (Figure 6C) and liver TG levels (Figure 6D) and these beneficial effects on reducing fatty liver were not altered by FincoR.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 7, does AST show the same pattern as ALT? As indicated from Line 335, &quot;tropifexor treatment reduced mRNA levels of several genes that promote fibrosis (Col1a1, Col1a2, ...)&quot;. Fig. 7D does not seem to match the description of Col1a1. Authors may need to modify the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: AST has been measured and has the same pattern as ALT. The new data have been added to Figure 7B. Col1a1 expression has been re-measured and the results have been updated in Figure 7D.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Is FincoR level reduced in NASH conditions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the Reviewer for this question. We now added new data to examine the levels of FincoR in mouse liver disease models and also examined levels of a potential human analog of FincoR in human liver specimens from PBC, NAFLD, and NASH patients. Please see our new data and description above in the response to comment 5 by Reviewer 1 (most data now included in the new Supplementary Figure S1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Please provide information on the conservation of FincoR (DNA and RNA) in humans. This would be important to provide the human disease relevance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: As described above in the response to comment 5 of reviewer 1, a human loci shows sequence similarity to mouse FincoR and this conserved region has an annotated uncharacterized human lncRNA. We also examined the levels of this human homolog in human diseased liver samples. Our new results demonstrate that hepatic levels of a potential human analog of FincoR are elevated in NAFLD and PBC patients, which is consistent with FincoR’s upregulation in mouse models of chronic liver disease with hepatic inflammation and liver injury. Whether human lncRNA XR_007061585.1 is entirely analogous to mouse FincoR in terms of functions and mechanisms, and whether the elevation of this human lncRNA has a role in liver disease progression or is an adaptive response to liver injury remains to be determined.</p>

<p>(7) Several discussion points for the authors' consideration:</p>
<p>(7.1) human-mouse conservation as alluded to in #6;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Potential human-mouse conservation is discussed with new data in the last paragraph of the Results section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7.2) potential molecular mechanism involved in FincoR-regulated hepatocyte function;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank Reviewer for this comment. We have added more discussion as shown below: “RNA inside the cells usually associates with different RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). To predict those potential binding proteins of FincoR. Additional bioinformatic analysis identified proteins that potentially binding FincoR, including KHDRBS1, RBM38, YBX2 and YBX3 (Supplemental Table S5). These findings and potential functions of the binding proteins are discussed in the 5th paragraph of the discussion section in the final revised manuscript. Whether these predicted RBPs interact with FincoR and the underlying mechanisms will need to be investigated in future experimentation to understand the mechanisms involved in FincoR-regulated hepatocyte function.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7.3) any disease-associated SNPs in the FincoR locus.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: No SNPs were noted in the annotation of the human loci with sequence similarity to mouse FincoR in the NCBI genome data viewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7.4) the in vitro induction of FincoR is transient but in vivo this occurs after 12 days of drug treatment. How do the authors reconcile the differential induction patterns?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: To clarify, the induction of FincoR after a single dose of GW4064 in vivo was transient, peaked within 1 h and then declined gradually (Figure 1-figure Supplement 1C). In the tropifexor treatment protocol (also in vivo), the mice were treated daily with tropifexor for 12 days so that the multiple doses maintained FincoR induction. The beneficial effect of tropifexor by inducing FincoR, therefore, accumulated over the 12 days.</p>
<p>It is worthy to note that we failed to see induction of FincoR in isolated primary mouse hepatocytes treated with GW4064 in vitro. We can only detect FincoR in primary hepatocytes isolated from GW4064-treated mice liver. This may be due to the loss of key factors mediating FincoR induction in the cultured primary hepatocytes.</p>
