<title>Abstract</title>
<p>DNA methylation is extensively reprogrammed during early stage of mammalian development and is essential for normal embryogenesis. It is well established that mouse embryos acquire genome-wide DNA methylation during implantation, referred to as <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, from globally hypomethylated blastocysts. However, the fact that the main <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) is initially expressed as early as the 8-cell stage, contradicts the current knowledge about timing of initiation of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation. Here, we reported that a previously overlooked minor wave of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation initially occurs during the transition from the 8-cell to blastocyst stage, before the well-known large-scale <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation during implantation. Functional analyses indicated that minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation regulates proliferation, lineage differentiation and metabolic homeostasis of preimplantation embryos, and is critical for embryonic developmental potential and pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, bioinformatic and functional analyses indicated that minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation preferentially occurs on the X chromosome and co-regulates imprinted X-chromosome inactivation via the interaction between DNMT3B and polycomb repressive complexes 2 core components during blastocyst formation. Thus, our study updates the current knowledge of embryonic <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, thereby providing a novel insight of early embryonic epigenetic reprogramming.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mammalian early embryos are co-regulated by a series of spatiotemporally restricted epigenomic events that are critical for acquiring developmental potential. In mouse, it has been widely accepted that a wave of genome-wide <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation occurs around the time of implantation, thus re-establishing DNA methylation patterns from a globally hypomethylated blastocysts to relatively static DNA methylation patterns in post-implantation embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Borgel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Smith et al., 2012a</xref>). DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) is the main enzyme that catalyzes embryonic <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation. Genetic depletion of <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> results in hypomethylation and dysregulation of pluripotency genes, gastrulation genes, germline-specific genes, <italic>etc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Auclair et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Borgel et al., 2010</xref>), thus causing severe developmental defects and lethality after implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Okano et al., 1999</xref>). However, despite its developmental importance, the exact timing of initiation of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation remains largely elusive.</p>
<p>Although earlier results using high-throughput sequencing methods suggested that <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation occurs during the transition from blastocysts to early post-implantation embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Auclair et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Borgel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Smith et al., 2012a</xref>), our detection assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>) and other previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Guenatri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hirasawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li et al., 2016</xref>) indicated that <italic>Dnmt3b,</italic> the main <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferase, is initially expressed as early as the 4-cell stage, and shows clear nuclear localization at 8-cell stage. This fact challenges current knowledge about timing of initiation of embryonic <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, and therefore raising the possibility that embryonic <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation may precede, but not follows, the blastocyst stage.</p>

<p>To test this possibility, we reanalyzed well-established bisulfite sequencing data that profiles DNA methylation maps from the mouse preimplantation to post-implantation embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Smith et al., 2012a</xref>), and found approximately one-third of genes gained promoter DNA methylation during the transition from the 8-cell to blastocyst stage. It means that despite global DNA demethylation throughout the preimplantation development, a small proportion of regions have initiated <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation prior to the blastocyst stage, which we designated as minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation. We next ask its developmental functions for embryogenesis. The results showed that minor <italic>de novo</italic> methylation also regulates proliferation, lineage differentiation and metabolism of preimplantation embryos, and thus affecting the developmental potential and final pregnancy outcomes. Of interest, minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation is more prone to occur on the X chromosome. We next confirmed that minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation plays an important role in establishing imprinted X chromosome inactivation (iXCI) via the interaction between DNMT3B and the polycomb repressive complexes 2 (PRC2) core components, which are critical for X-linked heterochromatin. Thus, our study provides a novel understanding of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation during early development, which updates the current knowledge of embryonic epigenomic hallmark events and their interactions.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>A small proportion of promoters initiate <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation by the 8-cell stage</title>
<p>To investigate the earliest initiation of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, we first examined the expression patterns of <italic>Dnmt3s</italic> in mouse preimplantation embryos. Results from previously published transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fan et al., 2015</xref>) and our quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) detection showed that expression of <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>, the main enzyme for embryonic <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Borgel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Okano et al., 1999</xref>), as well as its non-catalytic partner <italic>Dnmt3l</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gowher et al., 2005</xref>), initiated by the 8-cell stage, and were further increased upon preimplantation development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). By contrast, the expression of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>, which is mainly required for gametic methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kaneda et al., 2004a</xref>), was maintained at low levels concurrently (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The initial expression of <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> was also confirmed at the protein level. Nuclear location of DNMT3B can be clearly detected from the 8-cell stage onward (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Given the essential role of DNMT3B in catalyzing <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, we postulated that embryonic <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation may initiate as early as the 8-cell stage, which challenges current knowledge that <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation initiates during implantation.</p>
<p>To test the hypothesis, we next reanalyzed a well-established reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data that profiles DNA methylation maps from the mouse preimplantation to post-implantation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Smith et al., 2012a</xref>). Promoter regions are important âs target sites of DNMT3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Choi et al., 2011</xref>). The acquisition of DNA methylation in promoters, especially in intermediate and low CpG promoters, during implantation is largely dependent on DNMT3B, and plays an important role in regulating developmental genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Auclair et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Borgel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dahlet et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, among genomic regions that may undergo <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, we initially focused our analysis on DNA methylation dynamics of promoters from the 8-cell stage onward. Despite the global loss of promoter DNA methylation (<xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), more detailed characterization showed that a considerable proportion of promoters (approximately 30%) gained DNA methylation during the transition from the 8-cell to blastocyst stage, even though most promoters underwent demethylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Similar observation was also obtained by reanalyzing another published whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Smith et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition, a reanalysis based on a publicly available single cell multi-omics sequencing (COOL-seq) data of mouse early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Guo et al., 2017</xref>) showed that both male and female embryos gain DNA methylation during the transition from the 8-cell to blastocyst stage (<xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C, D</xref>).</p>
<p>Many previous analyses using different methodologies have showed the promoter regions are relatively hypomethylated in general compared with other genome elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Auclair et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Borgel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dahlet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Smith et al., 2012b</xref>). Despite this, by tracking DNA methylation dynamics of two subsets of promoters that gained or lost DNA methylation from the 8-cell to blastocyst stage respectively, we found promoters that underwent demethylation showed a relatively higher DNA methylation levels following fertilization, and then were gradually demethylated until reaching their lowest value in inner cell mass (ICM) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, promoters that gained DNA methylation from the 8-cell to blastocyst stage, showed a relatively lower DNA methylation levels, following fertilization, and reached their lowest DNA methylation levels at the 8-cell stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Based on the low basal levels, these promoters gain DNA methylation from the 8-cell to ICM, and then continued to gain DNA methylation during implantation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). To distinguish two waves of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation before and after the blastocyst stage, we designated them as minor and major <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, respectively. By performing gene ontology enrichment analysis of genes with promoter regions that undergo minor or major <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation respectively, we noticed that besides of many important basic processes common to two waves of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, genes subject to minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation have been enriched in processes such as organic substance transport, chromosome organization, and cell fate specification (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Compared with conventionally accepted major <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation showed a smaller increase in promoter DNA methylation that tended to occur in low CpG-containing promoters (<xref rid="figs1_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation participates in embryonic proliferation, differentiation and affects developmental potential</title>
<p>It has been known that <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation during implantation stage plays an essential role in transcriptional regulation of developmental genes that are critical for embryonic differentiation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Auclair et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Borgel et al., 2010</xref>), thus we next attempted to test the short-and long-term developmental consequences of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation. To this end, we performed an integrated analysis using the publicly available bisulfite sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Smith et al., 2012a</xref>) and transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wu et al., 2016</xref>) that profiles DNA methylation and gene expression maps from the 8-cell to ICM, respectively. Putative genes transcriptionally regulated by minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation (<xref rid="figs2_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) were functionally related to many basic processes, such as cell differentiation and metabolic regulation. Phenotype annotations in Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) showed that genes enriched in these basic processes are critical for normal embryonic survival, development and postnatal growth (<xref rid="figs2_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B, C</xref>). It should be noted that genes subject to DNA demethylation also participate in similar processes (<xref rid="figs2_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). In line with our results, previous studies using <italic>Tet1</italic>-deficient or <italic>Tet1</italic>/<italic>3-</italic>deficient embryos, indicated the critical role of TET-mediated DNA demethylation in these processes, as well as embryonic and postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dawlaty et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ito et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kang et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it can be presumed that minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, and TET-mediated demethylation, may synergistically co-regulate DNA methylation homeostasis before blastocyst formation, thus fine-tuning embryonic developmental potential and long-term outcomes, enriching the knowledge of developmental significance of DNA methylation homeostasis in early embryos, as proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Iurlaro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Smith and Meissner, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>We next wanted to examine whether minor <italic>de novo</italic> methylation is functionally associated with these basic biological processes before blastocyst formation and in turn affects developmental potential and pregnancy outcomes. Given identification of long-term developmental consequence of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation requires that only minor, but not major <italic>de novo</italic> methylation, is functionally inactivated before blastocyst formation, we knocked down <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> in preimplantation embryos by microinjecting <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> siRNA into zygotes (<xref rid="figs2_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A-E</xref>). As expected, <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced in morulae, and tended to be lower in blastocysts compared to those of the negative control (NC) group (<xref rid="figs2_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A-C</xref>). The inhibition of <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> resulted in a significant decrease in the global level of 5mC staining before blastocyst formation (<xref rid="figs2_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D, E</xref>). <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> deficiency not only inhibited proliferation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), but also changed lineage differentiation of blastocysts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The decreased EdU-positive signals, as well as the slight lower total cell number, suggested an inhibited proliferation due to <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> knockdown (KD). Since energy metabolism is crucial for supporting embryo differentiation and development, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is activated during the blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>), we next examined the energy metabolism, in particular OXPHOS activity, of <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-KD embryos. Despite the unchanged total ATP production, <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> deficiency led to a significantly disruption in OXPHOS-dependent-ATP production (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). These observations were further confirmed via the transient treatment of 5-aza-dC specifically during the window of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation (<xref rid="figs2_3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3A-D</xref>). 5-aza-dC is a well-established global DNA hypomethylating agent that efficiently inhibit the activity of all DNMTs and thus has been frequently used to study the maintenance of DNA methylation and <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, despite its inhibitory effect common to various DNMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Maslov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Oka et al., 2005</xref>). Transient treatment of embryos with 5-aza-dC specifically during the window of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation allows us to test its function in a temporally specific manner. Thus, it can be presumed that the disrupted proliferation and energy metabolism, appears not to be due to defective major <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation. Finally, we transferred <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-KD embryos into pseudopregnant recipient females. Compared with that in NC group, <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-KD embryos resulted in a significantly reduced implantation rate and live birth rate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-F</xref>), suggesting the important role of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation in influencing embryonic developmental potential.</p>

<title>Minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation preferentially occurs on the X chromosome and plays an important role in iXCI</title>
<p>To obtain a global view of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, we next detected the chromosome-wide distribution of <italic>de novo</italic> methylated promoters from the 8-cell to ICM, and found that they were globally distributed across autosomes, with the percentage ranging from 23% to 33% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>). Of note, approximately half of X-linked promoters (48%) underwent minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation throughout the X chromosome (<xref rid="figs3_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), much higher than those of autosomal promoters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This result was similar with that of major <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation during implantation (<xref rid="figs3_1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Using the single cell COOL-seq data, we also specifically reanalyzed the DNA methylation changes on the X chromosome in female embryos. The X chromosome showed a more notable increase than that on autosomes, and the female X chromosome showed a higher DNA methylation level than that of the male (<xref rid="figs3_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A, B</xref>). The X chromosome-biased prevalence of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation is reminiscent of XCI, a female-specific epigenetic event that occurs during early development for balancing the X-linked gene dosage between males and females. In mice, early embryos undergo two waves of XCI: iXCI initiates and occurs specifically on the paternal X chromosome in preimplantation embryos, and then persists in extraembryonic tissues; while random X chromosome inactivation (rXCI) occurs randomly on either the maternal or paternal X chromosome in the embryonic cells by implantation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Augui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chow and Heard, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lee and Bartolomei, 2013</xref>). Spatiotemporal co-occurrence of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation and iXCI on the X chromosome, led us to ask if these two epigenetic events are functional linked during preimplantation development.</p>

<p>Earlier studies have focused on whether the DNA methylation imprinting established during oogenesis as the imprinting mark responsible for the monoallelic expression of <italic>Xist</italic> (the initiation event of iXCI) in preimplantation embryos and demonstrated that oocyte DNA methylation is dispensable for <italic>Xist</italic> imprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chiba et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kaneda et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sado et al., 2004</xref>). However, the role of DNA methylation in achieving X chromosomal heterochromatinization (the late event of XCI) remains controversial, although it has been well-accepted DNA methylation is tightly associated with maintaining X chromosome-wide transcriptional silence of rXCI during implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blewitt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sado et al., 2000</xref>). Recently, targeted DNA demethylation of genes on the X chromosome, using inactive Cas9 protein (dCas9) fused with the catalytic domain of ten-eleven translocation dioxygenase 1 (TET1), supported the causal role between DNA methylation and XCI status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Halmai et al., 2020</xref>). However, the conclusion is based on rXCI, the role of DNA methylation in the heterochromatinization of iXCI remains unclear, and this issue has been documented as a long-standing open question of epigenetic programming during preimplantation development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Csankovszki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kaneda et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sado et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sado et al., 2004</xref>). Actually, it is even plausibly thought that DNA methylation is not required for achieving heterochromatinization of iXCI because preimplantation embryos is undergoing global and massive DNA demethylation. To identify the biological function of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation in iXCI, we knocked down <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> in preimplantation embryos by microinjecting <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> siRNA into zygotes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Next, we detected the H3K27me3, a classic marker for establishment of XCI achieving X chromosome-wide heterochromatinization of transcriptional depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chow and Heard, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Huynh and Lee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wutz, 2011</xref>). In line with the decreased DNA methylation levels (<xref rid="figs2_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D, E</xref>), we found nearly all detected <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-KD female blastocysts contained trophoblast cells lacking the H3K27me3 domain, with a variable frequency ranging from 10.7% to 42.4%; whereas nearly all NC female blastocysts showed a single H3K27me3 domain in each trophoblast (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-E</xref>). The proportion H3K27me3-positive cells in total trophoblast cells were significantly lower due to <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-KD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> deficiency leads to an impaired iXCI in preimplantation female embryos. This result was confirmed using <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-knockout (KO) embryos (<xref rid="figs3_3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3A-D</xref>). To further validate the function of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation in iXCI, we take advantage of chemical-induced DNMT inhibition using 5-aza-dC (<xref rid="figs3_3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3E-H</xref>). In addition, the involvement of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation in iXCI establishment was also supported by the finding that many representative X-linked non-escaping genes tended to be <italic>de novo</italic> methylated during the transition from the 8-cell to ICM (<xref rid="figs3_3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3I-J</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether DNA methylation loss leads to a prolonged effect on iXCI, we further reanalyzed the RNA-seq and H3K27me3 CHIP-seq data in extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) of E6.5 single embryos that underwent <italic>Dnm3a</italic>/<italic>3b</italic> knockout because preimplantation iXCI status maintains in extraembryonic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Galupa and Heard, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schulz and Heard, 2013</xref>). The results showed that chromosome-wide loss of DNA methylation led to a nearly complete loss of H3K27me3 on paternal X chromosome (specifically inactivated in iXCI), along with a notable transcriptional upregulation cross the chromosome, including the locus of some non-escaping genes. By contrast, these changes cannot be not observed on maternal X chromosome (<xref rid="figs3_4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4A, B</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these data suggest that a wave of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation preceding the blastocyst stage, participate in the establishment of iXCI. Although a recent study reported that <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> has a dominant role on the X chromosome in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yagi et al., 2020</xref>), the detectable DNMT3A/<italic>Dnmt3a</italic> in preimplantation embryos, albeit at low levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Uysal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), led us to speculate that DNMT3B and DNMT3A synergistically act on minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation, similar with that reported in subsequent peri-implantation embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Borgel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

<p>Having confirmed the functional role of minor <italic>de novo</italic> methylation in iXCI, we next explored the underlying mechanism.

<p>In attempt to further understand the mechanism underlying the role of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation in establishing iXCI, we next asked whether the <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> deficiency-induced loss of H3K27me3 domains was related to abnormal expression of histone-modifiers. We detected the expression of H3K27 histone methyltransferases or the partner (<italic>Ezh2</italic>, <italic>Suz12, Eed</italic>) and demethylase (<italic>Kdm6a</italic>, <italic>Kdm6b</italic>). The results showed <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> deficiency has no impact on the expression levels of these chromatin modifiers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>DNA methylation and H3K27me3 have been shown to have complex relationship, possibly in a cell-type and/or genomic region-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">King et al., 2016</xref>). Under certain circumstances, DNA methylation shows antagonistic effect to H3K27me3 at promoters, via excluding the binding of PRC2 components to their targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bartke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jermann et al., 2014</xref>), while other studies have presented alternative evidence that PRC2 and DNMT cooperate to achieve silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vire et al., 2006</xref>), and has a synergistic relationship in the process of global heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hagarman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">King et al., 2016</xref>). A recent work reported that maintenance of noncanonical imprinting requires maternal allele-specific <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation in extraembryonic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). It has been thought that during the late phase of rXCI in fully differentiated cells, gene silencing is initially achieved by PRC2 complex-induced H3K27me3, and further stably maintained by the redundant action of multiple layers of epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, to reach the maximum level of chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chow and Heard, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Heard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pintacuda and Cerase, 2015</xref>). In line with this, a recent multifaceted analysis showed that DNA methylation and H3K27me3 are concurrently enriched in genes subject to XCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Balaton and Brown, 2021</xref>). Thus, we next reanalyzed H3K27me3 dynamics of promoters that underwent minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation during the transition from the 8-cell to ICM, using a well-established H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). As expected, concurrent increase in H3K27me3 enrichment can be clearly observed throughout the X chromosome and many <italic>de novo</italic> methylated X-linked promoters (<xref rid="figs4_2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Next, we used <italic>in situ</italic> proximity ligation assays (PLA), a method that is suitable for visualizing protein interactions by detecting the close proximity of two molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Soderberg et al., 2006</xref>) to test interactions between DNMT3B and PRC2 core components, <italic>i.e.,</italic> EZH2, SUZ12, EED, which are essential for X-linked heterochromatin. It is clearly visible that DNMT3B-EZH2, DNMT3B-SUZ12 and DNMT3B-EED interactions can be detected in the nuclei by the blastocyst stage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). In line with this, the function of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation in XCI, as well as direct interaction between DNMT3B and PRC2 core components, were also confirmed in differentiated female ES cells (<xref rid="figs4_3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3A-H</xref>). Collectively, our results support the idea that minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation plays an important role in iXCI via synergistic interaction with heterochromatic histone modifications, rather than transcriptional regulation of iXCI-regulating genes.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation is definitely distinct from previously reported DNA re-methylation in monkey and human preimplantation embryos, which occurs during the 2- to 8-cell and 4- to 8-cell transition respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). The so-called DNA re-methylation does not occur in naturally conceived mouse embryos. However, an aberrant wave of DNA re-methylation has been identified in cloned mouse preimplantation embryos as an epigenetic barrier that impairs full-term developmental potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gao et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, our study presents an update on the current knowledge of embryonic <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation. We identified that a wave of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation has initially occurred during the transition from the mouse 8-cell to blastocyst stage, but not during the implantation stage. Of interest, we provide the evidence that DNA methylation is important for establishing iXCI in preimplantation female embryos. Our data, together with previous results, also support a model where minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation and demethylation co-orchestrate DNA methylation homeostasis before blastocyst formation, and serve as epigenetic mechanisms affecting embryonic developmental potential by fine-tuning the processes of lineage commitment, proliferation and metabolic homeostasis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, our work provides a novel insight for understanding epigenetic programming and reprogramming during early embryonic development.</p>

<p>The authors present an <bold>valuable</bold> and intriguing observation challenging current views on DNA methylation dynamics, revealing earlier-than-expected de novo methylation with significant implications for gene regulation in early embryonic development. However, the study's significance is difficult to ascertain due to <bold>incomplete</bold> evidence supporting the conclusions. Moreover, the observed changes in DNA methylation across promoter regions is modest, leaving its relevance open to alternative interpretations.</p>

<p>Based on the reviewers' comments, the authors conducted additional analyses to enhance their study. By utilizing publicly available datasets (Guo et al., 2017) capable of distinguishing the sex of embryos, they examined DNA methylation in male embryos and identified minor de novo DNA methylation events initiating at the 8-cell stage, predominantly on the X chromosome. However, this finding introduces confusion, as the authors had previously suggested that such minor de novo DNA methylation regulates imprinted X chromosome inactivation, a process specific to female embryos.</p>
<p>The key unresolved issue is whether minor de novo DNA methylation in female embryos occurs exclusively on the &quot;inactive&quot; X chromosome or on both the active and inactive X chromosomes. The authors did not provide direct evidence supporting de novo DNA methylation specifically at the inactive X chromosome. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether this methylation influences embryonic development independent of sex or is specific to female embryos undergoing imprinted X chromosome inactivation. While the authors present data on decreased live birth rates in Figure 2F, they did not address whether there is a sex bias among the live pups, such as male-biased survival. Clarifying this point would strengthen their conclusions.</p>
<p>
In summary, the critical issue with the revised manuscript is that it does not adequately resolve whether minor de novo DNA methylation regulates embryonic development irrespective of sex or specifically impacts female embryos where imprinted X chromosome inactivation occurs. This distinction is essential for understanding the broader implications of their findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Yue et al. set out to determine if the low but measurable level of DNMT3B expression that is observed prior to the major wave of de novo DNA methylation has a function (ie before the epiblast stage) . Re-analyzing existing DNA methylation data from Smith et al. (2012) they find a very modest DNA methylation gain over a subset of promoters, on the order of 1%, occurring between the 8-cell and blastocyst stages, and refer to this as &quot;minor de novo DNA methylation&quot;. They attempt to assess the relevance/functionality of this minor DNA methylation gain, and intriguingly report reduced H3K27me3 in Dnmt3b knockdown (KD) trophoblast cells that normally undergo imprinted X-chromosome inactivation (iXCI) before the blastocyst stage. In addition, they assess proliferation, differentiation, metabolic function, implantation rate and live birth rate of Dnmt3b KD blastocysts, and assign specific phenotypes to the loss of DNA methylation at this early stage..</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Working with early embryos is technically demanding and as such the relevance of disrupting epigenetic factors specifically at this stage in development is less well studied. The detailed analyses of published data as well as DNMT3B depletion experiments presented in this manuscript provides food for thought for the epigenetics community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Throughout the manuscript, please represent DNA methylation changes as delta DNA methylation instead of fold change. In many figures, it is not clear what the unit of DNA methylation presented actually is. Readers should be made aware that the changes in DNA methylation observed are very modest and the threshold applied to the delta in DNA methylation is just 1% &quot;( Î DNA methylation &gt; 0.01)&quot;).</p>
<p>
- The minimum coverage threshold and threshold applied For DNA methylation should be presented in each relevant figure. Currently for example, the latter is only mentioned not in the methods section but rather once in &quot;Figure 2, figure supplement 1&quot;</p>
<p>
- Indirect effects of disrupting DNMT3B at the earlier stages in development, when de novo DNAme levels are very low in the promoter regions of interest, should be considered. For example, de novo DNA methylation in repetitive regions/pericentric heterochromatin at this stage (not studied here) could be much higher than 1%. Disruption of such methylation, could result in a &quot;sink effect&quot;, with loss of H3K27me3 at promoter regions (including on the inactive X-chromosome), due to aberrant repositioning of Polycomb complexes/PRC2 to such ectopic sites from which they are normally excluded, rather than a direct positive effect of the very low DNA methylation gain observed on Polycomb recruitment.</p>
<p>
The impact of depletion of DNMT3B on the major wave of de novo DNA methylation that takes place at the peri-implantion stage of embryonic development may also play a role in some of the later phenotypes observed. In other words when the failure of de novo methylation is more profound as levels of DNA methylation are much higher at these later stages as a consequence of DNMT3B activity.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Yue et al. re-processed publicly available DNA methylation data (published in 2012 and 2017 from the Meissner lab) from pre- and post-implantation mouse embryos. Against the global wave of genome-wide reduction of DNA methylation occurring during pre-implantation development, they detected a slight increase (~1% on average) of DNA methylation at gene promoter regions during the transition from 8-cell to blastocyst stage. They claim that many such promoters are located in the X chromosome. Subsequently, they knocked down Dnmt3b (presumably because of its upregulation during the transition from the 8-cell to blastocyst stage) and detected the aberrant patterning of H3K27me3 in the mutant female embryos. Based on this observation, they claim that imprinted X-chromosome inactivation is impaired in the Dnmt3b-Kd pre-implantation embryos. Finally, they propose a model where such an increase of DNA methylation together with H3K27me3 regulates imprinted X-chromosome inactivation in the pre-implantation embryos. While their observation is of potential interest, the current version of the work fails to provide enough evidence to support their conclusions. Below are suggestions and comments on the manuscript.</p>
<p>Major issues:</p>
<p>(1) Sex of the embryos of the genome-wide bisulfite-sequencing data</p>
<p>The authors re-analyzed publicly available genome-wide DNA methylation data from the Meissner lab published in 2012 and 2017. The former used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and the latter used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). Based mainly on the RRBS data, Yue et al. detected de novo DNA methylated promoters during the transition from 8-cell to blastocyst against the global wave of genome-wide DNA demethylation. They claim that such promoter regions are enriched at the &quot;inactive&quot; X chromosome. However, it would be difficult to discuss DNA methylation at inactive X-chromosomes as the RRBS data were derived from a mixture of male and female embryos. It would also be notable that the increase of DNA methylation at these promoter regions is ~1% on average. Such a slight increase in DNA methylation during pre-implantation development could also be due to the developmental variations between the embryos or between the sexes of embryos.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for your insightful comments. Whether <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation occurs in a sex-dimorphic manner would be of significance for our study. Based on your comments, we have added a reanalysis based on a publicly available single cell multi-omics sequencing (COOL-seq) data of mouse early embryos (Guo et al., 2017). The results showed that both male and female embryonic cells gain DNA methylation during the transition from the 8-cell to ICM (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C-D; Lines 112-115 in the revised manuscript).</p>
<p>With regards to the increase in the promoter region, many previous studies have revealed that promoter and overlapping CGI regions, especially high CpG promoters, always showed low levels of DNA methylation (Auclair et al., 2014; Borgel et al., 2010; Dahlet et al., 2020). The relatively lower basal levels make the increase seem relatively slight. Thus, we added relevant statements to clarify this information and rewritten the sentences in the revised manuscript (Lines 116-118, 125-127 in the revised manuscript).</p>
<p>In addition, using the single cell COOL-seq data, we also specifically reanalyzed the DNA methylation changes on the X chromosome in female embryos. The X chromosome showed a more notable increase than that on autosomes, and the female X chromosome showed a higher DNA methylation level than that of the male (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A-B; Lines 203-206 in the revised manuscript).</p>
<p>Thanks again for your insightful and constructive comments that significantly strengthen our evidence. We have added these results in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Imprinted X-chromosome inactivation and evaluation of H3K27me3 (related to Figures 2C, D; 3F; Figure2-supplement 2 F, G; Figure3-supplement 3G)</p>
<p>Based on the slight change in the H3K27me3 signals in the Dnmt3b-Kd blastocysts, the authors claim that imprinted X-chromosome inactivation is impaired in the mutant embryo. It would be not easy to reach this conclusion from such a rough analysis of H3K27me3 presented in Figure 2C, D. Rigorous quantification/evaluation of the H3K27me3 signals in the Dnmt3b-Kd embryos should be considered. Additional evidence for the impairment of H3K27me3 in the mutant embryos should also be provided (expression of a subset of X-linked genes by RNA-FISH or RT-PCR etc.). Though technically challenging, high-resolution genome-wide approach such as ChIP-seq of H3K27me3 in the Dnmt3b-kd female embryos (with traceable SNPs between maternal and paternal X chromosome to distinguish inactive and active X-chromosome) could more precisely evaluate regions that lose H3K27me3 in the X-chromosome (de novo DNA methylated promoters from 8-cell to blastocyst, for example).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for your insightful comments that make our results more convincing. The H3K27me3 domain is a classic marker for establishment of XCI by achieving X chromosome wide heterochromatinization of transcriptional depression (Chow and Heard, 2009; Heard et al., 2004; Huynh and Lee, 2005). Thus, in the present study, we have performed immunostaining for H3K27me3 domains to evaluate the iXCI status in the blastocysts, as previously reported (Fukuda et al., 2014; Gontan et al., 2018; Inoue et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2016). Base on your comments, we have added another statistical method to quantify the establishment of iXCI, i.e. the percentage of H3K27me3-positive and -negative cells to total trophoblast cells in female blastocysts subject to <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> knockdown or not. The result also indicated that <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> knockdown led to a significant loss of H3K27me3 domains from total trophoblast cells. Similarly, new data based on statistical analyses of total trophoblast cells, has also been added in the results of <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> knockout and 5-aza-dC (Figure 3F; Figure 3âfigure supplement 3D, H in the revised manuscript).</p>
<p>To clarify the significance and reliability of detecting H3K27me3 domains, we have added a schematic diagram depicting the process of iXCI initiation and establishment, as well as the experimental design and work flows, to make our results easier to be understood (Figure 3C in the revised manuscript).</p>
<p>In addition, we agree with your comments that additional evidence will benefit the conclusion. Thus, we have reanalyzed the RNA-seq and H3K27me3 CHIP-seq data in extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) of E6.5 single embryos that underwent <italic>Dnm3a</italic>/<italic>3b</italic> knockout because preimplantation iXCI status maintains extraembryonic cells (Chen et al., 2019; Galupa and Heard, 2015; Schulz and Heard, 2013). The results showed that <italic>Dnmt</italic> knockout-induced chromosome-wide loss of DNA methylation led to a nearly complete loss of H3k27me3 on paternal X chromosome (specifically inactivated in iXCI), along with a notable transcriptional upregulation cross the chromosome. By contrast, these changes cannot be not observed on maternal X chromosome.</p>
<p>We have added this result in the revised manuscript (Lines 253-261; Figure 3âfigure supplement 4A in the revised manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Analysis of the developmental potential of Dnmt3b-kd embryos</p>
<p>While the authors claim that Dnmt3b-mediated de novo DNA methylation plays an important role in imprinted X-chromosome inactivation, it remains unclear whether the analysis presented in Figure 4 is derived from &quot;female&quot; embryos. This analysis seemed confusing as the authors claim that de novo DNA methylation in the promoter regions during the transition from 8-cell to blastocyst regulates imprinted X-chromosome inactivation, but this should not happen in the male embryos. Was the impairment of embryonic proliferation and differentiation observed in both male and female embryos? Or is this specific to the female embryos? We think that the sex of the embryos would be critical for the analysis presented in Figure 4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for your constructive comments to make our results smoother and clearer. The Figure 4 mainly presents the developmental role of minor <italic>de novo</italic> methylation based on the integrated analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression dynamics from the 8-cell to ICM. Because our data indicated that both male and female embryos undergo minor <italic>de novo</italic> methylation (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C-D in the revised manuscript). This section mainly focused on genome wide and general changes, but not on sex dimorphic consequence.</p>
<p>To avoid the possible confusion, we have reorganized the RESULTS AND DISCUSSION section and presented this section as Figure 2 in the revised manuscript, before the chromosomal distribution analysis and subsequent detection relevant to iXCI.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Here, Yue et al. set out to determine if the low DNMT3B expression that is observed prior to de novo DNA methylation (before the blastocyst stage) has a function. Re-analyzing existing DNA methylation data from Smith et al. (2012) they find a small DNA methylation gain over a subset of promoters and gene bodies, occurring between the 8-cell and blastocyst stages, and refer to this as &quot;minor de novo DNA methylation&quot;. They attempt to assess the relevance/functionality of this minor DNA methylation gain, and report reduced H3K27me3 in Dnmt3b knockdown (KD) trophoblast cells that normally undergo imprinted X-chromosome inactivation (iXCI) before the blastocyst stage. In addition, they assess the proliferation, differentiation, metabolic function, implantation rate, and live birth rate of Dnmt3b KD blastocysts.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Working with early embryos is technically demanding, making the well-designed experiments from this manuscript useful to the epigenetics community. Particularly, the DNMT3B expression and 5-mC staining at different embryonic stages.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your positive evaluation, we have revised manuscript based on your comments, and the items need to be addressed in detail are explained in the point-by-point response to each comment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Throughout the manuscript, please represent DNA methylation changes as delta DNA methylation instead of fold change.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for your constructive comments. We have represented DNA methylation changes as âÎDNA methylationâ (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A; Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A; Figure 3âfigure supplement 3I in the revised manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Detailed methods on the re-analysis of the DNA methylation data from Smith et al. 2012 are missing from the materials and methods section. Was a minimum coverage threshold used?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for your reminder. We have added relevant statements and provided the detail of the coverage criteria in the subsection of Bioinformatics analysis in the Materials and methods section as follows: RRBS data of mouse embryos (2-cell embryos, 4-cell embryos, 8-cell embryos, ICM, and E6.5 embryos) were downloaded from the published article by Smith et al (Smith et al., 2012) (accession number: GSE34864). The methylation level was calculated as the number of âmethylatedâ reads (reporting as C), divided by the total number of âmethylatedâ and âunmethylatedâ read, which reporting as C or T. The genomic region information was downloaded from the mm9 Repeat Masker. As described in the published article, promoters were defined as 1 kb up- and downstream of the TSS and classified into high-density CpG promoter (HCP), intermediate-density CpG promoter (ICP) and low-density CpG promoter (LCP). Only CpG sites with at least fivefold coverage were included in the methylation analysis. We have added relevant information in the revised manuscript (Lines 462-470 in the revised manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Detailed methods on the establishment and validation of Dnmt3b KO blastocysts and 5-aza-dC treated blastocysts are missing (related to Figure 2).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for your detailed reminder. In the present study, we used a well-established <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-deficient mouse model (Okano et al., 1999) to validate the role of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation in iXCI establishment. Heterozygous <italic>Dnmt3b</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice that carry one mutant locus of <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>, were obtained from the Mutant Mouse Resource &amp; Research Centers (MMRRC, NIH). Homozygous embryos were obtained by intercrossing <italic>Dnmt3b</italic><sup>+/-</sup> male and female mice. Genotyping assays of collected embryos was performed by PCR using primers that were designed based on the gene targeting strategy following the MMRRC genotyping protocol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.med.unc.edu/mmrrc/genotyping-protocols/mmrrc-center-protocol-29886/">https://www.med.unc.edu/mmrrc/genotyping-protocols/mmrrc-center-protocol-29886/</ext-link>). We have provided the detailed methods in the revised manuscript (Lines 350-354; 391-393 in the revised manuscript). In addition, we added a schematic diagram depicting the processes of embryo collection and detection (Figure 3âfigure supplement 3A in the revised manuscript).</p>
<p>Similarly, we have provided relevant details of 5-aza-dC supplementation in the revised manuscript (Lines 412-415 in the revised manuscript) and added a schematic diagram depicting the details of experimental design and processes (Figure 3âfigure supplement 3E in the revised manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Detailed methods on the re-analysis of the ChIPseq data from Liu et al. 2016 are missing from the materials and methods section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. The bigwig files of H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data were downloaded from the published article by Liu et al (Liu et al., 2016)(accession number: GSE73952). These signal tracks were generated using the MACS2 (v2.0.10.20131216) pileup function and normalized to 1 million reads for visualization, as described in the original publication. We have added relevant information to the MATERIALS AND METHODS section in the revised manuscript (Lines 474-479 in the revised manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Some of the data represented in bar graphs does not look convincing/significant. Maybe this data can be better represented differently, such as in box plots or violin plots, which would better represent the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for your comments that improve our result presentation, relevant results have been changed into box plots in the revised manuscript (Figure 3E; Figure 3âfigure supplement 3C; Figure 3âfigure supplement 3G in the revised manuscript). In addition, to strengthen our evidence, we have added alternative statistical method to quantify the establishment of iXCI, i.e. the percentage of H3K27me3-positive and -negative cells to total trophoblast cells in female blastocysts subject to <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> knockdown or not. (Figure 3F; Figure 3âfigure supplement 3D, H in the revised manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The relevance and rationale for experiments using 5-aza-dC treatment is unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for reminding us to make our results more informative and convincing. 5-aza-dC is a well-established global DNA hypomethylating agent that efficiently inhibit the activity of all DNMTs, and thus has been frequently used to study the maintenance of DNA methylation and <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation (Maslov et al., 2012; Oka et al., 2005).</p>
<p>In our study, to validate the function of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation in iXCI, we take advantage of 5-aza-dC-induced DNMT inhibition, which allows us, despite its inhibitory effect common to various DNMTs, to transiently treat embryos specifically during the window of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation (from the 8-cell to blastocyst stage). We have added these statements, as well as a schematic diagram depicting the experimental design, in the revised manuscript to make our experiments more rational and easier to be understood (Lines 183-188; Figure 3âfigure supplement 3E in the revised manuscript).</p>

<p>(8) Lines 145-149: The role of DNA methylation for imprinted X-inactivation has already been reported (Chiba et al., 2008). The relevant sentences should be reworded.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for reminding us the important earlier literature that explores the relationship between DNA methylation and XCI. However, the primary aim and hypothesis of the study by Chiba et al. are different from those of our study. Chiba et al focused on whether DNA methylation is the imprinting mark responsible for monoallelic expression of <italic>Xist</italic> (the initiation event of iXCI), while our study focused on the role of DNA methylation in achieving X chromosomal heterochromatinization (the late event of iXCI).</p>
<p>In detail, the study by Chiba <italic>et al.</italic> mainly focused on exploring why <italic>Xist</italic> is specifically expressed from paternal allele and iXCI occurs specifically on the paternal X chromosome in mouse preimplantation embryos. Because Previous studies have suggested that genomic imprinting of <italic>Xist</italic> is established during oogenesis (Oikawa et al., 2014; Tada et al., 2000), Chiba <italic>et al.</italic> wanted to test whether the DNA methylation imprinting established during oogenesis is responsible for the monoallelic expression of <italic>Xist</italic> in preimpantaiton embryos. Analyses of DNA methyltransferase maternal knockout embryos revealed that oocyte DNA methylation is dispensable for <italic>Xist</italic> imprinting (Chiba et al., 2008). Follow-up study by Inoue <italic>et al.</italic> identified a broad H3K27me3 enrichment within the <italic>Xist</italic> 5âregion established during oocyte growth and persists through preimplantation development, as the imprinting mark of Xist (Inoue et al., 2017). These series of studies are very important and allows us to understand the mechanism underlying paternal allele-specific iXCI in mouse preimplantation embryos and extraembryonic tissues.</p>
<p>However, the hypothesis is different in our study. Based on the finding of minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation and its preferential distribution on the X chromosome, we have speculated that the minor <italic>de novo</italic> methylation, which occurs from the 8-cell to blastocyst stage, may participate in achieving X chromosomal heterochromatinization. Although DNA methylation is essential for maintaining X chromosome-wide transcriptional silence of rXCI, its role in iXCI remains controversial and it is even plausibly thought that DNA methylation is not required for achieving iXCI because preimplantation embryos undergo global and massive DNA demethylation.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for your comment to improve our discussion. It has been thought that during the late phase of rXCI in fully differentiated cells, gene silencing is achieved by PRC2 complex-induced H3K27me3, and then is further stably maintained by the redundant action of multiple layers of epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, to reach the maximum level of chromatin compaction (Chow and Heard, 2009; Heard et al., 2004; Pintacuda and Cerase, 2015). In line with this, a recent multifaceted analysis showed that DNA methylation and H3K27me3 are concurrently enriched in genes subject to XCI (Balaton and Brown, 2021).

</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for your insightful comments. Despite the global enrichment of H3K27me3, the H3K27me3 domain detected by immunostaining is a classic marker for establishment of XCI by achieving X chromosome wide heterochromatinization of transcriptional depression (Chow and Heard, 2009; Heard et al., 2004; Huynh and Lee, 2005). Thus, we have used immunostaining for H3K27me3 domains to evaluate the iXCI establishment in the blastocysts, as previously reported (Fukuda et al., 2014; Gontan et al., 2018; Inoue et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2016). To make our results more convincing, we have added another statistical method to quantify the establishment of iXCI, <italic>i.e.,</italic> the percentage of H3K27me3-positive and -negative trophoblast cells to total trophoblast cells in female blastocysts subject to <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> knockdown or not.</p>
<p>In addition, we have added a schematic diagram depicting the process of iXCI initiation and establishment, as well as the experimental design and work flows, to make the result easier to be understood.</p>
<p>In addition, we agree with your comments that additional evidence will benefit the conclusion. To strengthen the evidence, and test whether DNA methylation loss leads to a prolonged effect on iXCI, we have reanalyzed the RNA-seq and H3K27me3 CHIP-seq data in extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) of E6.5 single embryos that underwent <italic>Dnm3a</italic>/<italic>3b</italic> knockout because preimplantation iXCI status maintains extraembryonic cells (Chen et al., 2019; Galupa and Heard, 2015; Schulz and Heard, 2013). The results showed that chromosome-wide loss of DNA methylation led to a nearly complete loss of H3k27me3 on paternal (specifically inactivated in iXCI), along with a notable transcriptional upregulation cross the chromosome. By contrast, these changes cannot be not observed on maternal X chromosome. (Lines 253-261; Figure 3âfigure supplement 4A in the revised manuscript)</p>

<p>Thanks so much for you careful reviewing. As you have pointed out, the relationship of DNA methylation and H3K27me3 are divergent and largely controversial among studies. Under certain circumstances, DNA methylation shows antagonistic effect to H3K27me3 at promoters, via excluding the binding of PRC2 (the main complex responsible for H3K27me3 deposition) components to their targets (Bartke et al., 2010; Jermann et al., 2014), while other studies have presented alternative evidence that PRC2 (the main complex responsible for H3K27me3 deposition) and DNA methylation cooperate to achieve silencing (Hagarman et al., 2013; Vire et al., 2006). Thus, it has been thought that the relationship between DNA and methylation and histone modifications is complex, possibly in a cell-type and/or genomic region-specific manner. Both antagonism and coordination can be observed in different regulatory elements in mouse ES cells (King et al., 2016).</p>

<p>Figure 1:</p>
<p>- Of all genic promoters, how many were included in the analysis (contained sufficient coverage)? What cut-off/thresholds were used to consider DNA methylation gain at a promoter?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your comments. In total, 11662 promoters were analyzed. Given that promoter methylation is generally at low level, particularly at the 8-cell stage at which minor <italic>de novo</italic> methylation is just initiated. The relatively lower basal levels make the increase before the blastocyst, seem considerably slight. To capture the slight changes, we have used the relaxed threshold based on ÎDNA methylation. Only CpG sites with at least fivefold coverage were included in the methylation analysis based on data from Smith et al. (Smith et al., 2012)., ÎDNA methylation greater or less than 0 was defined as gain or loss of DNA methylation. We have added this information in the revised manuscript (Lines 462-470 in the revised manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Does an average methylation level of 0.02 represent 2% DNA methylation? Presuming yes, is the average 1.5% DNA methylation gain at promoters real? And meaningful? Especially compared to the gain in DNA methylation that takes place between ICM and E6.5 (Figure 1 Figure Supplement 1 D)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As you have pointed out, an average methylation level of 0.02 represent 2% DNA methylation. As aforementioned, promoters exhibited an average of 1.5% DNA methylation gain during the transition from 8-cell stage to ICM. The slight increase may be mainly due to the relatively lower basal levels. As you expected, compared with the comprehensive <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation during implantation, preimplantation <italic>de novo</italic> methylation occurs more slightly, at a small proportion of promoter regions, so designated it as minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation. It should be also mentioned that a proportion of these promoters continue to gain massive DNA methylation during implantation. We have refined the relevant sentences to provide more detailed information of our results (Lines 125-127 in the revised manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Why is there a focus on promoters (which are not the preferential target of DNMT3B)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for your detailed reminder. As you have pointed out, âpreferential targetâ seems to be an inaccurate statement. besides of promoters, gene bodies and other elements also undergo <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation (Auclair et al., 2014; Dahlet et al., 2020; Duymich et al., 2016). We have focused on the promoter regions based on the following considerations: (1) Promoter regions are important target sites of DNMT3B (Choi et al., 2011); (2) The acquisition of DNA methylation in promoters, especially in intermediate and low CpG promoters, during implantation is largely dependent on DNMT3B and plays an important role in regulating developmental genes (Auclair et al., 2014; Borgel et al., 2010; Dahlet et al., 2020). We have rewritten the relevant sentence in the revised manuscript (Lines 100-106 in the revised manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Figure 1H shows that promoters that gain DNA methylation during the &quot;minor de novo DNA methylation&quot; continue to gain DNA methylation during &quot;de novo DNA methylation&quot;. Is the ~1.5% DNA methylation gain just the slow start of the main de novo DNA methylation wave?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Your comments is very helpful to improve the description of our results. In the present study, our analysis indicated that a small proportion of promoters initially gain methylation during the transition from the 8-cell to ICM. The finding challenges current knowledge: (1) <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation occurs during implantation, by which globally hypomethylated blastocysts acquire genome-wide DNA methylation (Borgel et al., 2010; Dahlet et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2012); (2) during preimplantation development, embryos undergo massive and global DNA demethylation.</p>
<p>To distinguish the current knowledge of the timing and dynamics of DNA methylation during the early development, we have designated our finding during the transition from the 8-cell to blastocyst stage, as minor <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation.</p>
<p>We agree with your notion that among the promoters undergoing minor <italic>de novo</italic> methylation, most of them continue to gain DNA methylation during implantation, as revealed in Fig. 1F.

For the GO analysis shown in Figure 1H, we used genes with promoter regions that gained or lost DNA methylation during the transition from the 8-cell to ICM respectively (identified in Figure 1C, as input), respectively. This information has been clarified in the revised manuscript to ensure accuracy (Lines 129-134 in the revised manuscript).</p>

<p>Thanks for your valuable comments. Considering the relatively low DNA methylation levels at promoter regions, and the slightly changes occurring during the preimplantation embryo development, we used the relaxed threshold based on ÎDNA methylation. Only CpG sites with at least fivefold coverage were included in the methylation analysis based on data from Smith et al. (Smith et al., 2012), ÎDNA methylation greater or less than 0 was defined as gain or loss of DNA methylation.

<p>We agree with your comments that additional evidence will benefit the conclusion. To strengthen the evidence, we have reanalyzed the RNA-seq and H3K27me3 CHIP-seq data in extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) of E6.5 single embryos that underwent <italic>Dnm3a</italic>/<italic>3b</italic> knockout because preimplantation iXCI status maintains extraembryonic cells (Chen et al., 2019; Galupa and Heard, 2015; Schulz and Heard, 2013). The results showed that chromosome-wide loss of DNA methylation led to a nearly complete loss of H3k27me3 on paternal (specifically inactivated in iXCI), which showed a notable transcriptional upregulation cross the chromosome. By contrast, these changes cannot be not observed on maternal X chromosome. We have added this result in the revised manuscript (Lines 253-261; Figure 3âfigure supplement 4A in the revised manuscript).</p>

<p>Thanks so much for your reminder. To provide more convincing evidence. We have reanalyzed a single cell COOL-seq data, we also specifically reanalyzed the DNA methylation changes on the X chromosomal promoter in female embryos. The X chromosome showed a more notable increase in the <italic>de novo</italic> methylated promoters than that on autosomes, and the female X chromosome showed higher DNA methylation levels than that of the male (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A-B; Lines 203-206 in the revised manuscript).</p>

<p>- Figure 2C: Does the H3K27me3 signal overlap with the location of the inactive X-chromosome (is there maybe denser DAPI or do IF combined with Xist RNA-FISH)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for your insightful comments. Despite the global enrichment of H3K27me3, the H3K27me3 domain detected by immunostaining is a classic marker for establishment of XCI by achieving X chromosome wide heterochromatinization of transcriptional depression (Chow and Heard, 2009; Heard et al., 2004; Huynh and Lee, 2005). Thus, we have used immunostaining for H3K27me3 domains to evaluate the iXCI establishment in the blastocysts, as previously reported (Fukuda et al., 2014; Gontan et al., 2018; Inoue et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2016). We have taken effort to perform co-staining of H3K27me3 IF and <italic>Xist</italic> FISH, but was hindered by the technical challenge, we wish to get your understanding. However, as we aforementioned, H3K27me3 is a well-accepted maker to clarify the XCI status.</p>
<p>In addition, to make our results more convincing, we have added an alternative statistical method to quantify the establishment of iXCI, <italic>i.e.,</italic> the percentage of H3K27me3-positive and -negative trophoblast cells to total trophoblast cells in female blastocysts subject to <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> knockdown or not (Figure 3F; Lines 243-244 in the revised manuscript)</p>

Based on your comments, we have added the gene name in the label of the Y-axis.

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Figure 2 figure supplement 2B/C: in the text, line 153, it is stated that &quot;Dnmt3b mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced in morulae, but not in blastocysts compared to those of negative control (NC) group&quot;. These figures do not support that statement. The IF images show a loss of DNMT3B in the Dnmt3b KD blastocysts. The IF quantification seems to have fewer datapoints for the blastocyst, and looking at the bar graphs, there seems to be a trend towards reduced DNMT3B in both the morula and blastocyst, which would also explain the reduction in DNA methylation in both stages as shown in Figure 2 figure supplement 2D/E.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks so much for your careful reviewing that makes our statements more accurate. We have rewritten the sentence in the revised manuscript as follows: <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced in morulae, and tended to be lower in blastocysts compared to those of the negative control (NC) group.

What happens to the expression of these genes in the Dnmt3b KD?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your suggestions. We have represented DNA methylation changes as âÎDNA methylationâ. During mouse preimplantation development, iXCI is initiated in earlier cleavage female embryos dependent on <italic>Xist</italic> upregulation around 4-8-cell stage, and then <italic>Xist</italic> specifically coats paternal X chromosome and finally leads to chromosome-wide silencing via heterochromatinization in early blastocysts. Thus, these non-escaping genes, which are subject to XCI, would not be inactivated at 8-cell stage</p>

<p>As you expected, most of these representative non-escaping is downregulated upon the transition of 8-cell to blastocyst stage, consistent with their gain of DNA methylation. Additionally, since preimplantation iXCI status maintains extraembryonic cells (Galupa and Heard, 2015; Schulz and Heard, 2013), we further reanalyzed the published RNA-seq data in extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) of E6.5 single embryos that underwent DNA methyltransferase knockout (Chen et al., 2019). The results showed that chromosome-wide loss of DNA methylation led to a chromosome-wide transcriptional upregulation, including the locus of these non-escaping genes, on paternal X chromosome.

<p>Thanks for your detailed reminder. We apologize for the missing of scale bars in the H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data. The 8-cell and ICM tracks were set to the same scale, and we have now added scales to the figure in the revised manuscript to improve the result presentation.

<p>These results are based on the reanalysis of publicly available data of pooled embryos, which just provided suggestive but not direct evidence to support the role of DNA methylation in promoting X-linked H3K27me3 enrichment in iXCI.</p>

<p>- Figure 3E: Given all tested proteins give a positive signal, it would have been good to include a negative control chromatin protein that is known to not interact with DNMT3B. Given both PRC2 and DNMT3B are chromatin-binding proteins, can the signal be a result of close proximity instead of a direct interaction?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the present study, to test the interaction between DNMT3B and PRC2 core components, we have used <italic>in situ</italic> proximity ligation assay (PLA), an increasingly popular technique for detecting the close proximity of two proteins in fixed samples using two primary antibodies (Alsemarz et al., 2018).</p>

<p>Compared with classical co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) method, <italic>in situ</italic> PLA has advantages in (1) detecting low input samples or proteins expressed at low levels, which is extremely difficult using Co-IP; (2) providing in situ or subcellular information of protein-protein interaction. However, it should be noted that the maximal distance allowing this reaction is 40 nm, which is not quite small enough to demonstrate a physical interaction between the two antigens, but sufficient to support a very close âproximityâ.</p>
<p>In our study, <italic>in situ</italic> PLA, including the experimental design of negative control, was performed in the accordance with the manufacturerâs instruction of DuolinkÂ® In Situ Red Starter Kit (MilliporeSigma): âTechnical negative controls included incubation with each primary antibody separately and no primary antibodyâ. We have refined the relevant sentence in the revised manuscript (Lines 308-310 in the revised manuscript)</p>

<p>The Co-IP analysis of DNMT3B and PRC2 core components in differentiated female ES cells was presented as additional supportive evidence. Because the Co-IP analysis is extremely difficult for preimplantation embryos, we have used <italic>in situ</italic> PLA to detect their interaction. However, the maximal distance allowing <italic>in situ</italic> PLA reaction is 40 nm, which is not quite small enough to demonstrate a physical interaction (Alsemarz et al., 2018).

<p>Thank you for your insightful comments. The EdU cell proliferation assays labels cells during the S phase of cell cycle, as the 5-ethynyl 2Â´-deoxyuridine (EdU) is incorporated into newly synthesized DNA. This labeling identifies cells undergoing DNA synthesis, but these cells may not have completed mitosis at the time of detection. As a result, the total cell number may not immediately reflect the decrease in proliferation observed in the treated group.
