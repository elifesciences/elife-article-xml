<title>Abstract</title><p>Tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters are secondary-active transporters that receive their substrates via a soluble binding protein to move bioorganic acids across bacterial or archaeal cell membranes. Recent cryo-EM structures of TRAP transporters provide a broad framework to understand how they work, but the mechanistic details of transport are not yet defined. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the <italic>Haemophilus influenzae N</italic>-acetylneuraminate TRAP transporter (<italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM) at 2.99 Å resolution (extending to 2.2 Å at the core), revealing new features. The improved resolution (the previous <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM structure is 4.7 Å resolution) permits accurate assignment of two Na<sup>+</sup> sites and the architecture of the substrate binding site, consistent with mutagenic and functional data. Moreover, rather than a monomer, the <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM structure is a homodimer. We observe lipids at the dimer interface, as well as a lipid trapped within the fusion that links the SiaQ and SiaM subunits. We show that the affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) for the complex between the soluble <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP protein and <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM is in the micromolar range and that a related SiaP can bind <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM, highlighting features of the complex interface. This work provides key data that enhances our understanding of the ‘elevator-with-an-operator’ mechanism of TRAP transporters.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Secondary-active transporters are found in all domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). They catalyse the movement of molecules across membranes, exploiting the free energy associated with electrochemical ion gradients to drive transport [see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) for recent reviews on the topic]. In bacteria, secondary-active transporters are used for both the export of toxic compounds and for the import of nutrients needed for cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>).</p>
<p>The import of carbohydrates across the plasma membrane is a key process for bacteria, particularly those pathogenic bacteria that adopt a scavenging lifestyle within their host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). For <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, the ability to uptake host-derived sialic acids is important for pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Sialic acids are a diverse family of nine-carbon carbohydrates, and in humans, sialic acids are highly abundant in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts where they coat glycoconjugates as terminal sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). The most common sialic acid found in humans is <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminate (Neu5Ac) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). To gain a growth advantage in these environments, bacteria such as <italic>H. influenzae</italic> evolved the ability to utilise host-derived sialic acid as a nutrient source (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>). The sialic acid catabolic pathway provides an alternative source of carbon, nitrogen and energy, and has been identified in 452 bacterial species, most of which are mammalian pathogens or commensals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Alongside degradation, and perhaps more importantly, <italic>H. influenzae</italic> uses sialic acids to coat its lipopolysaccharide surface, and this sialylation in turn provides camouflage and protection from the human immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). <italic>H. influenzae</italic> lacks the <italic>de novo</italic> sialic acid biosynthetic pathway, so sialic acids must be scavenged and transported into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Engineered <italic>H. influenzae</italic> strains that are unable to transport sialic acids into the cell have decreased virulence in animal models—evidence that the sialic acid transport pathway is a viable therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) and others have already developed inhibitors to sialic acid transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The sole sialic acid transporter in <italic>H. influenzae</italic> belongs to the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter family.</p>

<p>1) <italic>H. influenzae</italic> is sialidase negative and relies on environmental sialidases to hydrolyse and release terminal Neu5Ac from human glycoconjugates. 2) Outer membrane porins facilitate diffusion of Neu5Ac into the periplasm. 3) A mutarotase, NanM, catalyses the formation of β-Neu5Ac from α-Neu5Ac to prepare for active transport across the inner membrane. 4) Neu5Ac is captured by the high-affinity substrate-binding protein, SiaP. SiaP delivers Neu5Ac to the SiaQM TRAP transporter, which uses a Na<sup>+</sup> electrochemical gradient to drive transport. <italic>H. influenzae</italic> cannot synthesise Neu5Ac and relies solely on SiaPQM for obtaining environmental Neu5Ac. 5) Cytoplasmic processing of Neu5Ac by an anomerase, YhcH, generates the unfavourable open chain form in preparation for use by the first enzyme of the Neu5Ac degradation pathway, NanA. 6) Neu5Ac is sequentially degraded into cell wall constituents or fructose-6-phosphate, which can enter glycolysis. Five conserved enzymes (an aldolase, NanA; kinase, NanK; epimerase, NanE; deacetylase, NagA; and deaminase, NagB) are involved in this pathway which provides <italic>H. influenzae</italic> with carbon, nitrogen, and energy. 7) Alternatively, Neu5Ac can be activated by cytidine monophosphate and a sialic acid synthetase and added to lipooligosaccharides by a sialyltransferase.

<p>Tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters are a major class of secondary-active transporters found only in bacteria and archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). They use energetically favourable cation gradients to drive the import of specific carboxylate-containing nutrients against their concentration-gradient, including C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylates, α-keto acids, aromatic substrates, amino acids and sialic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). A functional TRAP system is made up of a soluble substrate-binding ‘P-subunit’, and a membrane-bound complex comprising a small ‘Q-subunit’ and a large ‘M-subunit’. For most TRAP transporters the Q- and M-subunits are separate polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), but in ∼25% of sequences [InterPro analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>)] the Q- and M-subunit polypeptides are fused into a single polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). TRAP transporters are different from almost all other secondary-active transporters in that they can only accept substrates from the P-subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Analogous to ABC importers, the P-subunit is secreted into the periplasm to capture host-derived substrates with high affinity and specificity. The substrate-loaded P-subunit subsequently delivers the substrate to the membrane transporter (Q- and M-subunits) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>
<p>The SiaPQM system from <italic>H. influenzae</italic> has fused Q- and M-subunits and is one of the best characterised TRAP systems to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), with key functional and biophysical studies informing a putative transport mechanism driven by a Na<sup>+</sup> gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Before transport into the cell by SiaPQM, sialidases release sialic acids from the terminal position of host glycoconjugates (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>). <italic>H. influenzae</italic> is, however, sialidase negative and relies on the sialidases of other bacteria to generate free sialic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). In Gram-negative bacteria, sialic acids diffuse into the periplasm through an outer membrane porin, such as the general porins OmpF or OmpC in many bacteria, Omp P2 in <italic>H. influenzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), or by using a Neu5Ac specific porin such as NanC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). The substrate-binding protein SiaP (P-subunit) binds Neu5Ac in the periplasm with high-affinity, undergoing a ligand-induced conformational change to a closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). It is this closed form that then delivers Neu5Ac to the membrane bound Q- and M-subunits. This protein-protein interaction and the subsequent transport of Neu5Ac through the transmembrane subunits are not yet characterised. In particular, the conformational changes that take place for both SiaP and SiaQM to allow alternating access of the transporter have not been fully elucidated, though we have suggested previously that the binding of the closed P-subunit must induce either a global elevator-type motion or a local gating rearrangement as a part of an elevator mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). These changes allow the transporter to bind Neu5Ac and Na<sup>+</sup> at the periplasmic side and transport them into the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>Here, we report the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM in amphipol and demonstrate that in detergent, amphipol and a nanodisc environment the fused <italic>H. influenzae</italic> SiaQM membrane subunits can stably exist as both monomeric (QM) and homodimeric (2QM) states. We determined the homodimeric (2QM) structure of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM using single particle cryo-electron microscopy, the first structure of a fused TRAP transporter at near atomic resolution (2.99 Å, with local resolution extending to ∼2.2 Å), which reveals new details of the transport mechanism. The structure, combined with functional and biophysical data, supports the hypothesis that <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM operates using the ‘elevator-with-an-operator’ mechanism that we proposed for TRAP transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>

<title>The cryo-EM structure of HiSiaQM reveals a dimeric configuration</title>
<p>We assessed the stability of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM in several detergents that solubilise <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> membranes. Lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (L-MNG) led to more stable protein preparations compared to dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) (<bold>Supplementary Figure 1a</bold>), which has been used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Curiously, <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM purified with a high L-MNG concentration elutes as a major peak at 65 mL with a significant shoulder at 58 mL and this elution profile is reversed at a low L-MNG concentration (<bold>Supplementary Figure 1a</bold>)—a signature of a self-association, suggesting <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM forms higher order oligomers. By comparison, the non-fused monomeric <italic>Photobacterium profundum</italic> SiaQM (<italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM) does not show this behaviour when expressed with the same purification tag and purified in the same low concentration of L-MNG, eluting at 67 mL, which we have previously shown to correspond to a monomeric species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) (<bold>Supplementary Figure 1a</bold>).</p>
<p>We decided to purify <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM using L-MNG under conditions that favour the larger species for the following reasons: 1) we were previously unsuccessful at determining the cryo-EM structure of the monomer, because of the small size of the protein (72 kDa) and lack of features outside of the micelle or nanodisc that makes particle alignment difficult; 2) even with a megabody bound to increase the size and provide asymmetric features, other structural investigation on monomeric <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM led to only moderate resolution data, which may reflect some instability or heterogeneity in the sample; and 3) we reasoned that avoiding fiducial markers such as nanobodies and megabodies would also allow exploration of the conformational dynamics of the transporter without any binder-associated bias. Thus, the larger <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM species was isolated by exchanging purified protein out of L-MNG detergent and into amphipol A8-35, an amphipathic polymer used to solubilise and stabilise membrane proteins.</p>
<p><italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM comprises two distinct dimeric configurations in approximately equal quantities (36%) in the 14,281-image dataset (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, Supplementary Figure 2, Supplementary Table 1</bold>). Dimeric <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM exists either as a side-by-side parallel dimer where both monomers face the same way, or an antiparallel dimer where one monomer is rotated around the dimer interface 180° relative to the other (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, Supplementary Figure 2</bold>). Dimerisation is mediated by the same interface in both of these structures but given that <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP is found in the periplasm and SiaQM requires SiaP to function, the parallel dimer is most likely the physiologically relevant conformation. The maps are of high resolution (overall 2.9 Å for the antiparallel dimer and 3.2 Å for the parallel dimer, FSC = 0.143 criterion) with both extending to 2.2 Å at the core, allowing for accurate fitting of helices and (almost) all side chains (<bold>Supplementary Figure 3</bold>). The dimeric particles allowed for structure determination without a protein fiducial marker bound (<italic>e.g.</italic>, nanobody or antigen-binding fragment), which was required to solve the structure of the monomeric <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) and the low resolution monomeric <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In all four <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM protomers the transport domain is in the inward-open conformation (‘elevator down’), which is the substrate release state (r.m.s.d. for alignment = ∼0.2 Å, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a,b</xref></bold>). This is the same conformation as the previous megabody-bound <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM structures in amphipol and a nanodisc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) and also the same as the recently reported low resolution (4.7 Å) megabody-bound <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM structure in a nanodisc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Three-dimensional variability analysis (3DVA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) of our <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM reconstructions shows only very subtle motion at the dimer interface, and does not show any global elevator motions in the final reconstruction (<bold>Supplementary Movie 1</bold>). That we observe the inward-open conformation without either a bound P-subunit or fiducial marker, suggests that this is the resting state of the transporter.</p>
<p>Both dimers form through an interface between the Q-subunits of the monomers. The relatively flat sides of the Q-subunits are positioned adjacent to each other in an interface that is not intimately connected by side chain interactions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref></bold>). When refined using dimeric masks, the parallel dimer has slightly lower resolution at the dimer interface (scaffold region), compared to the antiparallel dimer. Local refinement of each monomer within the parallel dimer improved the resolution at the scaffold region, suggesting this is perhaps a relatively dynamic interface. The buried interface area is small (∼200 Å<sup>2</sup>) for the antiparallel configuration, and even smaller (∼100 Å<sup>2</sup>) for the parallel configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Further still, the parallel interface area is formed by a small number of residues at the N-termini, which have modest resolution. The majority of the interface for these dimers must therefore be mediated by lipid molecules that bridge between the monomers, some of which we observe directly in the cryo-EM maps (discussed later). Small interfaces have been observed in the elevator-type Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter NhaA from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) and throughout the SLC26 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) (also elevator-type), but the <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM interfaces are much smaller than other dimeric ion transporter superfamily members, such as the TRAP related symporter VcINDY, a divalent anion/Na<sup>+</sup> symporter (DASS) from <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), and the antimicrobial efflux pumps MtrF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) and YdaH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), which are all elevator-type homodimers with buried interface areas of ∼1800–2100 Å<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The topology of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM is similar to the non-fused <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM, aside from the additional fusion helix that links the Q- and M-subunits across the membrane (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref></bold>). The helix starts on the cytoplasmic side, packing against the Q-subunit and crossing the membrane vertically, then turns 90° and runs laterally (perpendicular to the membrane) before forming a loop and connecting to the M-subunit on the periplasmic side (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a-c</xref></bold>). An overlay with the recently determined SiaQM structures shows that the main chains are similar (<italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM to high resolution <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM r.m.s.d. = 1.2 Å across 520 C<sub>α</sub>-atoms and low resolution <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM to high resolution <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM r.m.s.d. = 1.0 Å across 571 C<sub>α</sub>-atoms, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref></bold>). All three structures are in the ‘elevator down’ conformation with close alignment between the 16-17 helices (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref></bold>). Differences in the loops of the proteins exist, including the positioning of the ‘clamshell’ loops of the Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites (discussed later).</p>

<title>HiSiaQM exists in a stable monomer-dimer self-association</title>
<p>The oligomeric assembly of TRAP transporters within the membrane has implications for the transport cycle, as well as the interaction between SiaP and SiaQM. Secondary-active transporters can exist as monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), or as larger multimeric complexes of oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). For example, VcINDY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), MtrF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) and YdaH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) all share the same fold and have a dimeric structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). These elevator-type transporters form oligomers at the scaffold domains, which is thought to provide the stability needed for elevator movements of the transport domain. Recently, a TRAP related fused transporter belonging to the TAXI (TRAP-Associated eXtracytoplasmic Immunogenic proteins) TRAP subfamily from <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> also eluted as two peaks during size exclusion chromatography, signalling a likely self-association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). In contrast, the non-fused TRAP transporter <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM uniquely functions as a monomer (1QM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), where instead of homodimerisation, the scaffold is formed by heterodimerisation of the Q- and M-subunits. Recent work on <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM also proposes a monomeric (1QM) functional transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). However, our high resolution dimeric cryo-electron microscopy structures and the self-association behaviour observed from size exclusion chromatography (<bold>Supplementary Figure 1a</bold>) infer a stable dimeric architecture for <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM is probable.</p>
<p>To further support this result, <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM purified in L-MNG and DDM was characterised by sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC), resulting in two distinct species in each of the samples (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, Supplementary Figure 4-6</bold>). As there were no contaminants following purification (<bold>Supplementary Figure 1b</bold>), the two species represent a protein self-association, consistent with that observed during purification. The oligomeric state of the two species was verified using SV-AUC analysis that compares the measured masses with theoretical masses. This suggests that <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM is present as a monomer and a dimer in both L-MNG (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref></bold>) and DDM (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4</bold>). The two species have sedimentation coefficients (all are corrected for water and 20 °C unless otherwise specified) of 7.3 S and 9.9 S in L-MNG, and 7.6 S and 10.3 S in DDM. The calculated frictional ratios for the monomeric species are 1.2 in L-MNG and 1.1 in DDM. These are consistent with a globular particle, as we would expect for a protein in a detergent micelle. The calculated frictional ratios for the dimeric species are 1.2 in L-MNG and 1.0 in DDM, which are also consistent with a globular particle.</p>

The species at 7.3 S (Peak 1, blue shading) is most consistent with <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM as a monomer with ∼98 molecules of L-MNG bound (middle panel; green = measured mass, black = theoretical mass); Peak 1 existing as a dimer is unlikely, as the dimeric protein would only have ∼14 molecules of L-MNG bound.

<p>We then solubilised <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM in amphipol (A8-35) and nanodiscs (cNW11, ∼11 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>)) to ascertain whether these systems might afford better stability and again found two species consistent with a monomer and a dimer. SV-AUC analysis of amphipol solubilised protein (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref></bold>) is consistent with a monomer at 5.9 S and a dimer at 8.3 S, when considering the oligomeric information obtained from SV-AUC in L-MNG (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref></bold>). In nanodiscs, a reconstitution ratio of 1:4:80 of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM:MSP:lipid (MSP = membrane scaffold protein) resulted in multiple peaks during size exclusion chromatography (<bold>Supplementary Figure 7a</bold>). Three fractions across the elution profile were analysed with SV-AUC and the main species in each had sedimentation coefficients of 4.0 S, 6.8 S, and 9.0 S (<bold>Supplementary Figure 7b</bold>). The species at 4.0 S is most consistent with empty nanodiscs and the species at 6.8 S and 9.0 S are most consistent with nanodiscs containing monomeric and dimeric <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM, respectively (<bold>Supplementary Figure 7b</bold>).</p>
<p>To summarise, we have demonstrated that <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM can exist in a monomer-dimer state in two detergents, amphipol and nanodiscs, which mimic the native environment. The proposal that <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM forms dimers within the plasma membrane is supported by the observation that a stable dimer with low aggregation propensity forms when solubilised in L-MNG (<bold>Supplementary Figure 1a</bold>, blue trace). Stable species also exist when solubilised in amphipol (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref></bold>), particularly evidenced by the collection of cryo-EM data to &lt;3 Å resolution. Under the same L-MNG detergent conditions, similar concentrations, and with an identical Ni<sup>2+</sup> affinity tag, non-fused <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM does not show this behaviour (<bold>Supplementary Figure 1a</bold>)—evidence that dimerisation is a result of a self-association and not the Ni<sup>2+</sup> affinity tag or cohabitation, where the number of available micelles is low enough that two proteins cohabitate the same micelle for stable solubilisation. The dimeric assembly of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM is consistent with other examples of transporters that use the elevator-type mechanism (<italic>e.g.</italic>, VcINDY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>)), but clearly different from that reported recently for <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM and <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM TRAP transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>

<title>Lipid binding sites</title>
<p>As a transporter, <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM has evolved alongside lipids, which are increasingly shown to be important for general transporter function and oligomerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Evident in our cryo-EM maps are well-defined phospholipid densities associated with areas of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM that appear to be important for the function of an elevator-type mechanism (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). The two most compelling areas are the dimer interface and a lipid binding pocket formed by the fusion helix.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="549404v1_fig4.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>There is a void region at the dimer interface in both structures that likely contains amphipol polymers and lipids. Indeed, we observe density for lipids in this region (best seen in the slightly higher resolution antiparallel dimer) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref></bold>). Notably, these densities are adjacent to tryptophan residues (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8</bold>), known for their role in anchoring membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), and one of the positions is where we also observe clear lipid density in the <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM structure in a nanodisc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). The discovery of these annular lipids is surprising given that the protein was first extracted and extensively purified in L-MNG detergent, followed by exchange into A8-35 amphipol for cryo-EM studies. There are some weaker densities around the periphery of the protein that likely correspond to amphipol, but we can confidently identify densities for phospholipids given their distinctive hairpin shape (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). That lipids have remained bound in this area through the isolation and purification supports that these are specific and strong interactions, which thereby anchor the scaffold domain in the membrane. The lipids at this interface may also have a role in strengthening dimerisation, as seen in other secondary-active transporters such as NhaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>).</p>
<p>The architecture of the fusion helix leaves a pocket between the lateral part of the helix and the main bundle of the transporter. A closer inspection of the map density shows that a distinct hairpin-shaped phospholipid density is positioned in this pocket (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref></bold>). This enclosed pocket appears to tightly fit only one phospholipid, which is presumably trapped here during protein folding. Several residues from the scaffold portion are well-poised to interact with a lipid headgroup, including H100, R104, K178 and W227 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref></bold>). Analysis of the electrostatic surface of the pocket shows a significant amount of positive charge. We suggest that this site likely binds a negatively charged phospholipid and have modelled phosphatidylglycerol into the density. The predicted interacting residues are not well conserved amongst fused TRAP transporters (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8</bold>), which is possibly a reflection of varying bacterial membrane compositions.</p>
<p>This site and the presence of a lipid were not identified in the recent structure of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM in a nanodisc (containing only the zwitterionic lipid DMPC)—instead, amino acids are modelled to fill the hydrophobic pocket. This is notable, as Peter et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) hypothesised that W227 is important for the SiaP:SiaQM interaction, and show that mutation of this residue to an arginine significantly affects bacterial growth in an <italic>in vivo</italic> growth assay. The resolution of our structures allows us to unambiguously model this residue facing away from the surface and engaged in an interaction with the trapped phospholipid, further supporting our identification of tryptophan residues in anchoring roles in the scaffold of TRAP transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). This finding is important in the context of the transport mechanism used by <italic>Hi</italic>SiaPQM. As the identified phospholipid is intercalated between scaffolding helices and is very close to the putative SiaP:SiaQM interface, it is feasible that this site is physiologically significant and may influence the stability of the transporter or even the conformational dynamics of the entire system. We emphasise that this phospholipid binding pocket is not present in <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM, which may point to differences in the dynamics of the scaffolds and how the scaffold interacts with SiaP in non-fused systems.</p>

<p>Transport by <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM was dependent on a Na<sup>+</sup> gradient (ΔµNa<sup>+</sup>) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref></bold>, green and orange circles) and was stimulated 3-fold in the presence of a membrane potential (Ψ) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref></bold>, green circles). <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP is required for transport since without external <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP transport was negligible. These results agree with previous work on <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM purified in decyl-β-D-maltoside (DM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) and show that our tagged construct is active and not inactivated by L-MNG. Net transport by <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM is electrogenic, as activity is enhanced when an inside negative membrane potential (Ψ) is imposed (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref></bold>). Since Neu5Ac has a single negative charge at neutral pH, electrogenic transport means two or more Na<sup>+</sup> ions are transported for every Neu5Ac imported. Varying external [Na<sup>+</sup>] at a fixed substrate concentration resulted in a Hill coefficient of 2.9 (95% confidence interval = 2.2–3.9), implying that at least two Na<sup>+</sup> ions are co-transported during each transport cycle (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref></bold>). These data are consistent with the previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), as well as the stoichiometry we recently determined for <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>
<p>The fused <italic>Hi</italic>SiaPQM system has higher transport activity than the non-fused <italic>Pp</italic>SiaPQM system. With the same experimental setup used for <italic>Pp</italic>SiaPQM (5 μM Neu5Ac, 50 μM SiaP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), the accumulation of [<sup>3</sup>H]-Neu5Ac is ∼10-fold greater. This difference may reflect the origins of each transporter system—<italic>P. profundum</italic> is a deep-sea bacterium and as such the transporter is required to be functional at low temperatures and high pressures. In contrast, <italic>H. influenzae</italic> is mesophilic, found in the human respiratory tract and therefore more likely to show native-like rates in ambient experimental conditions. A similar pattern has been reported for the elevator transporter Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, where transporters from hyperthermophilic species are slow, and mesophilic versions are faster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). These organisms also vary substantially in membrane lipid composition, which is currently too difficult to test in this experimental setup.</p>
<p>Next, we examined the <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites in our cryo-EM structure (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref></bold>). The higher resolution antiparallel dimer structure shows density for Na<sup>+</sup> ions at both Na1 and Na2 sites (<bold>Supplementary Figure 9a</bold>), confirming the sites we identified and tested in <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), and also the aforementioned stoichiometry of Na<sup>+</sup> ions transported determined in the <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM proteoliposome assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). The Na1 and Na2 sites across all four monomers are highly similar, although subtly different to those reported previously (<bold>Supplementary Figure 9b</bold>). The resolution of the structures allows for the unambiguous assignment of side chain positions at these binding sites and enables mechanistically important residues to be distinguished.</p>
<p>At the Na1 site, coordination is achieved by the backbone carbonyls of S298, G337, V340 and P342 in a tetrahedral pattern, with a valence = 1, as determined by CheckMyMetal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). The backbone carbonyl of S295 is also positioned for coordination but is slightly further away at 2.9/3.0 Å. In contrast, the equivalent carbonyl in <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM (S103) is closely associated with the Na<sup>+</sup> ion to form a trigonal bipyramidal coordination pattern. Na2 coordination is achieved by the backbone carbonyls of G517, G558 and M564, and the side chain hydroxyl of T561, which together coordinate the Na<sup>+</sup> ion in a tetrahedral pattern with a valence = 1.2/1.3. In contrast to the Na2 site of <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM, the backbone carbonyl of T561 is positioned further away at 4.2 Å distance and does not directly coordinate the Na<sup>+</sup> ion in our structure. In the <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM structure, the equivalent residue (T369) coordinates the Na<sup>+</sup> ion with both the side chain and main chain of T561 to form a square planar coordination pattern. S298, P342, G517 and G558 are highly conserved in TRAP transporters; S295, G337 and T561 sometimes vary as other small residues and V340 and M564 often vary as other hydrophobic side chains (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8</bold>). S298A did not show an effect on growth when mutated to alanine previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) and therefore may not be considered mechanistically important, but our structure shows that it coordinates Na1 through the backbone carbonyl, masking the effect of the side chain mutation.</p>
<p>Our structures have a large cytoplasm-facing solvent-accessible cavity housing the putative binding site for Neu5Ac that is flanked by the Na1 and Na2 Na<sup>+</sup> ion sites (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref></bold>), similar to <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM. The dataset was collected without Neu5Ac and not surprisingly, there is no ligand density in the binding sites. The putative Neu5Ac binding site is lined with residues S300, A301, L302, P338, S343, I344, A345, I348, D521, A522, L523, Q526, T552, M555, M556, I559 and M566 of the transport domain which form a largely hydrophobic binding site (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref></bold>). This site is large enough to bind Neu5Ac and is more defined than previously reported (<bold>Supplementary Figure 9c</bold>). Residues D304 and D521 each have a significant effect on bacterial growth when mutated to alanine and were thought to be involved in Na<sup>+</sup> ion or substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Our structure shows that neither are involved in Na<sup>+</sup> binding and although D521 does line the substrate binding pocket and introduces some charge to the site, D304 faces away from the substrate binding site and instead coordinates the residues that bind the Na<sup>+</sup> ion at the Na1 site.</p>

<title>On the formation of the tripartite complex</title>
<p>The observation that <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM can form a dimer has implications for the mechanism of transport, and as yet the affinity for the SiaP:SiaQM complex has not been directly established. To address this, we used analytical ultracentrifugation with fluorescence detection to determine the affinity between <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP and <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM in the presence of Neu5Ac. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was used to fluorescently label <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP, with the labelling conditions adjusted to provide just one FITC label per <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP protein. This allowed for a usable signal to be obtained at 10 nM <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP and minimised any inhibitory effects on complex formation, as 22 of the 31 lysine residues of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP are spatially distant from the putative interacting surface. Titrating <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM in L-MNG to 40 µM (a 4000-fold excess over <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP, 10 nM) in the presence of 5 mM Neu5Ac resulted in the development of two peaks at ∼7.5 S and ∼10.5 S (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref></bold>). Integration of the signal that shifted to a larger species resulted in ∼40% of the <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP bound at the highest concentration of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM (40 µM). This experiment allowed us to estimate a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> for the complex of 65 µM (95% confidence interval = 62–69 µM, <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref></bold>). Avoiding non-ideality meant that we could only use concentrations of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM approaching the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>, but the binding model fit was very good (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99). This is in agreement with previous work that used surface plasmon resonance with biotin immobilised <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM in DDM, where a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of ∼1 µM was estimated, but it was stressed that the true <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> is very likely weaker due to the inability to fit a 1:1 binding model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), which may have been complicated by the presence of dimeric <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM or aggregation.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the fluorescent signal shifted to two larger species. Based on the data for <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM in L-MNG (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref></bold>), the two species at ∼7.5 S and ∼10.5 S likely correspond to monomeric <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM with one <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP monomer bound and dimeric <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM with either one or two <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP monomers bound (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref></bold>). To support this stoichiometry, we checked the in-solution oligomeric state of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP, as there are examples of unusual TRAP substrate-binding proteins that form dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Both analytical ultracentrifugation (0.85 mg/mL, 25 µM) and small angle X-ray scattering experiments (injected at 12.3 mg/mL, 360 µM) suggest that <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP is monomeric in solution (<bold>Supplementary Figure 10</bold>).</p>
<p>To understand the observed complex formation, the interaction between <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP (PDB: 3B50) and <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM (PDB: 8THI) was modelled using AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). The predicted binding mode does allow two <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP proteins to bind the parallel <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM dimer without significant steric clashes (<bold>Supplementary Figure 11</bold>) and each monomer has the same binding mode as the <italic>Pp</italic>SiaPQM model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>
<p>The resolution of our structure enabled us to model the side chains and rationalise previous mutagenic experiments designed to define the SiaP:SiaQM interaction. We demonstrated that the periplasmic-facing residue R292 in <italic>Pp</italic>SiaM is important for TRAP transporter activity and hypothesised that this residue is important for both the interaction with SiaP and rigidifying the scaffold-lateral arm helix junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). This residue is strictly conserved in sialic acid TRAP transporters but is not conserved across the TRAP transporter family (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8</bold>). Our structure shows that the equivalent residue in <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM (R484) adopts a similar solvent-accessible conformation and participates in an ionic interaction with D480, which in turn is interacting with K236 (<bold>Supplementary Figure 12</bold>). Together these residues form a salt bridge network between two helices of the scaffold of the transporter. Consistent with this, mutation to R484E resulted in decreased bacterial growth, and reduced the binding of SiaP to SiaQM <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Furthermore, mutations of residues on SiaP predicted to interact with this region reduce activity in both the <italic>Hi</italic>SiaPQM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) and <italic>Pp</italic>SiaPQM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) systems, highlighting the importance of this area for the transporter. It is clear that this region is important for SiaP recognition (also shown by the adjacent positioning of SiaP to this region in the complex model, <bold>Supplementary Figure 11</bold>) and may be further involved in modulating the conformational changes in SiaQM. Similarly, mutations R30E, S356Y and E429R all significantly reduced bacterial growth and SiaP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). These mutations are consistent with disrupting the SiaP:SiaQM interaction as the residues are all solvent-accessible at the periplasmic surface of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM in our structure and are close to <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP in the complex model. All three residues are strictly conserved across the TRAP transporter family (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8</bold>) and our structure shows that R30 (SiaQ) and E429 (SiaM) form a salt bridge (∼2.5 Å) between two helices of the scaffold to connect SiaQ and SiaM, highlighting their structural significance (<bold>Supplementary Figure 12</bold>). Overall, the <italic>Hi</italic>SiaPQM complex model is consistent with the mutagenesis of the <italic>Hi</italic>SiaPQM and <italic>Pp</italic>SiaPQM systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), but requires an experimental tripartite complex (SiaPQM) structure for validation.</p>
<p>Finally, the ability of related SiaPQM systems to substitute subunits was assessed using the transport assay (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref></bold>). Two fused SiaPQM systems from the Pasteurellaceae family (<italic>H. influenzae</italic> and <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic>) were able to substitute the QM- and P-subunits and retain activity. With <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM in the proteoliposome, there was no transport when <italic>Pp</italic>SiaP from the non-fused system was used (pink) but was fully functional when <italic>Aa</italic>SiaP was used (blue). We also substituted the QM-subunits: with <italic>Aa</italic>SiaQM in the proteoliposome, the transport was the same with <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP and <italic>Aa</italic>SiaP but slower in the <italic>Aa</italic>SiaPQM system than <italic>Hi</italic>SiaPQM, suggesting that differences in the mechanisms (<italic>e.g.</italic>, the affinity of subunits or Na<sup>+</sup>) may exist even in systems similar enough to exchange subunits. That there was no transport with <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM and <italic>Pp</italic>SiaP follows previous work demonstrating that SiaP from <italic>V. cholerae</italic> did not function with <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Structural analysis of the SiaP proteins from the fused and non-fused systems shows subtle differences in surface charge (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref></bold>), yet the activity results suggest the interacting surfaces have diverged enough to make them incompatible. It may also be that each system uses slightly different methods to engage the allosteric opening of SiaP.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using the well-studied <italic>Hi</italic>SiaPQM TRAP as a model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), we: 1) determined a considerably higher resolution structure of the transmembrane subunits of this fused TRAP transporter, allowing us to now resolve side chains, lipids, the Na<sup>+</sup> ion binding sites, and the substrate binding site; 2) demonstrate that <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM can form a dimeric configuration in maltoside detergents, amphipol and nanodiscs; and 3) determined the nature of the interaction between <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP and <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM using biophysical methods. These experiments lead to many new conclusions that shape our understanding of how TRAP transporters function.</p>
<p><italic>The ‘elevator down’ (inward-facing) conformation is preferred.</italic> The two previous SiaQM structures have relied on the presence of a megabody for structure determination, which made contacts with the periplasmic surface of the transport domain. This interaction may stabilise the protein in the observed ‘elevator down’ conformation. However, the dimeric structures we have presented have no other proteins bound, yet exist stably in the elevator down state, suggesting this is the most stable conformation.</p>
<p><italic>Lipids associated with</italic> Hi<italic>SiaQM are structurally and mechanistically important.</italic> The structure of the fused <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM confirms the presence of an extra transmembrane helix in the Q-subunit, compared to the non-fused TRAP systems that lack this helix. The extra transmembrane helix connects the small subunit to the large subunit via a short horizontal arm helix that runs parallel to the membrane. This horizontal helix is comprised of several positively charged residues that face the periplasm, contributing to an extra positive area on the surface of the transporter that is not seen in the non-fused <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM. The horizontal helix may act similarly to the two arm helices and improve transport by increasing the steadiness of the scaffold of the transporter. The high-resolution structure of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM has identified well-defined lipids associated with tryptophan residues of the Q-subunits that form the dimer interface and a newly described single lipid in the binding pocket formed by the fusion helix. Both of these areas are likely important for anchoring the scaffold domain and allowing transport. As the single phospholipid is bound within the protein, it may also have a physiological role in P-subunit binding dynamics, as a mechanism of regulation depending on lipid type.</p>
<p>Hi<italic>SiaQM can exist as a monomer or a dimer.</italic> We demonstrate that <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM can adopt both a monomeric and a dimeric configuration depending on the relative concentration of L-MNG detergent, with high concentrations favouring the monomer. This behaviour is characteristic of a self-association (<bold>Supplementary Figure 1a</bold>, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref></bold>). The formation of a stable dimeric species is also found in our amphipol structure, in other detergents, and in nanodiscs.</p>
<p>The parallel dimer is consistent with other elevator transporters, although the interface between the monomers is reduced. Notably, a related TAXI-TRAP transporter also appears to form a self-association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>) and the dicarboxylate transporter, VcINDY from <italic>V. cholerae,</italic> adopts a stable homodimeric configuration in crystal and in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). VcINDY uses an elevator mechanism and cross-linking the dimer interface does not perturb transport, implying a lack of coupling between the monomers and an absence of large conformational changes at the interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). The dimerisation of VcINDY is used to stabilise the transport domains and allow the elevators to move up and down against the bound interface. Even with a small interface, a dimeric <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM assembly may further stabilise the scaffold of the two monomeric units.</p>
<p>The antiparallel dimer is hard to rationalise from a physiological standpoint. Although not unprecedented <italic>in vivo</italic> with small bacterial multidrug transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>), an antiparallel structure makes little biological sense in the case of the TRAP transporter. In the antiparallel structure, the inverted monomer displays the cytoplasmic face towards the periplasm and will not bind SiaP, which is required for transport. This structure could result from removing the protein from its native environment, where it is constrained by the cell membrane, and in the absence of the constraints of the membrane can rotate around the interface when solubilised by detergents.</p>
<p><italic>The affinity of SiaP for SiaQM is weak.</italic> For the SiaPQM TRAP transporter, the role of SiaP is to capture Neu5Ac with high affinity and deliver it to SiaQM before leaving to bind more Neu5Ac. As a result, a high-affinity SiaPQM complex that has a slow SiaP off-rate is likely not desired. Neither is a low-affinity SiaPQM complex that has a slow SiaP on-rate, as SiaQM relies on binding SiaP for transport (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref></bold>). The <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> observed in our experiments may be representative of a system with a fast off-rate (and potentially a fast on-rate) for SiaP. The resulting <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> is not of high affinity, but the transport cycle is optimised as SiaP quickly binds SiaQM, delivers Neu5Ac, and then leaves without getting ‘stuck’ to the transporter. The fast off-rate would reflect the conformational coupling of SiaP to SiaQM as the open state of SiaP that occurs after delivering Neu5Ac has been shown to bind SiaQM less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>).</p>
<p>The determined <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> may also reflect the experimental conditions. If the transporter is often in the conformation we observe to be stabilised in the structures, then the residues on the periplasmic surface of SiaQM may not be accessible or correctly positioned for binding with the partner residues on SiaP. In addition to the effects of detergent, the experimental conditions do not provide a Na<sup>+</sup> gradient, which may have significant consequences on the positioning of SiaQM for interaction with SiaP. Under similar conditions, Peter et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) estimated a comparable <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of ˃1 µM, further indicating that the interaction affinity is low.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have determined the oligomeric state of detergent solubilised <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM and the structure of amphipol solubilised <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM to near atomic resolution. In both membrane mimetics, we have observed a monomer-dimer self-association. The cryo-EM structure reveals the position of the extra transmembrane helix and shows that it is made of two sections with a positively charged periplasmic surface. This suggests that the extra helix may be involved in the interaction with SiaP, which has a predominantly negatively charged surface where it would likely bind the transporter. Furthermore, this work yields novel insights for drug design, as our structure can guide the design of inhibitors that block the SiaPQM interaction or use the system as a Trojan horse. In bacteria that rely solely on SiaPQM for obtaining Neu5Ac, such as <italic>H. influenzae</italic>, these inhibitors may have utility as antibacterial agents.</p>

Bio-Beads SM-2 were added at 100 mg per mL of the mixture before incubating overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Following reconstitution, the amphipol bound protein was subjected to another size exclusion chromatography step, to remove unincorporated amphipol and any aggregated protein. Protein that eluted at a volume consistent with <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM was pooled, concentrated, and used in experiments.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>A western blot was used to verify the bands containing <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM on SDS-PAGE. <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose using NuPAGE transfer buffer + 20% methanol. The transfer was performed for 15 min at 15 volts. Membranes were blocked with Tris buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at 4 °C. Mouse Xpress IgG monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) was diluted to 1/2500 in TBST + 2% BSA and incubated with the membranes overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed with water before incubating with rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) with conjugated alkaline phosphatase at 1/15000 in TBST + 2% BSA for 1 h at RT. Membranes were washed with TBST for five min, three times. Detection was performed by incubating the membranes with NBT/BCIP substrate solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by rinsing the membranes in water.</p>

<title>Analytical ultracentrifugation</title>
<p>Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed in a Beckman Coulter XL-I AUC instrument unless otherwise stated. Samples were loaded into 12 mm double sector cells with sapphire windows, then mounted in an An-60 Ti rotor. Sedimentation data were analysed with UltraScan 4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). Optimisation was performed by two-dimensional spectrum analysis (2DSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>) with simultaneous removal of time-and radially invariant noise contributions and fitting of boundary conditions. Where appropriate, 2DSA solutions were subjected to parsimonious regularisation by genetic algorithm analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>).</p>
<p>For determining the oligomeric state of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM, the samples (0.40 mg/mL in L-MNG, 0.55 mg/mL in DDM) were in buffer G with either 20 times the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of L-MNG (0.02%, 200 µM) or 4 times the CMC of DDM (0.0348%, 0.68 mM). Buffer density and viscosity values were measured with a density meter and microviscometer (Anton Paar). Radial absorbance data were collected at 280 nm, 42,000 rpm and 20 °C (L-MNG) or 4 °C (DDM). Oligomeric state and bound detergent calculations were performed using a method similar to Henrickson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>), utilising sedimentation and diffusion coefficients obtained from UltraScan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>).</p>
<p>For determining the <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM species in the nanodisc and amphipol samples, the methods used were similar to that above. The nanodisc samples were in buffer I. The data were collected at 280 nm, 46,000 rpm and 10 °C. The amphipol sample was in buffer G. The data were collected at 0.27 mg/mL, 280 nm (intensity data), 40,000 rpm and 20 °C in a Beckman Coulter Optima AUC instrument at the Canadian Center for Hydrodynamics at the University of Lethbridge.</p>
<p>For determining the oligomeric state of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP, the samples were in buffer G and buffer G + 5 mM Neu5Ac. Buffer density and viscosity values were estimated with UltraScan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>) or measured with a density meter and microviscometer (Anton Paar). The data were collected at 280 nm, 42,000 or 50,000 rpm and 20 °C.</p>

<title>Fluorescence detection analytical ultracentrifugation</title>
<p>Experiments were performed with FITC labelled <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP and a concentration series of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM. The FITC labelling was optimised to produce a ratio of 0.93 (∼1) moles of FITC per mole of protein. A Beckman Coulter XL-A AUC instrument with a fluorescence detection system (AVIV Biomedical) was used with an An-50 Ti rotor at the University of Melbourne, Australia. To generate an artificial bottom, 50 µL of FC43 fluorinert oil was loaded into the bottom of each cell. The samples (350 µL) in buffer G + 0.002% L-MNG and 5 mM Neu5Ac were loaded into 12 mm double sector cells. <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP was kept constant at 10 nM and <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM was varied across 14 concentrations (2-fold dilutions from 40 µM to 4.9 nM). The samples were incubated for an hour at room temperature, then run at 50,000 rpm and 20 °C in fluorescence mode.</p>

<title>Proteoliposome assays</title>
<p>Purified <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM was reconstituted using a batch-wise detergent removal procedure as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). In brief, 50 μg of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM was mixed with 120 μL of 10% C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub> and 100 μL of 10% egg yolk phospholipids (w/v) in the form of sonicated liposomes as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>), 50 mM of K<sup>+</sup>-gluconate and 20 mM HEPES/Tris pH 7.0 in a final volume of 700 μL. The reconstitution mixture was incubated with 0.5 g Amberlite XAD-4 resin under rotatory stirring (1,200 rev/min) at 25 °C for 40 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>).</p>
<p>After reconstitution, 600 μL of proteoliposomes were loaded onto a Sephadex G-75 column (0.7 cm diameter × 15 cm height) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES/Tris pH 7.0 with 100 mM sucrose to balance the internal osmolarity. Then, valinomycin (0.75 μg/mg phospholipid) prepared in ethanol was added to the eluted proteoliposomes to generate a K<sup>+</sup> diffusion potential, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). For a standard measurement, after 10 s of incubation with valinomycin transport was started by adding 5 μM [<sup>3</sup>H]-Neu5Ac to 100 μL proteoliposomes in the presence of 50 mM Na<sup>+</sup>-gluconate and 0.5 μM of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaP. Experiments were also performed varying the [Na<sup>+</sup>-gluconate] and SiaP species to determine their effect on transport. The transport assay was terminated by loading each proteoliposome sample (100 μL) on a Sephadex G-75 column (0.6 cm diameter × 8 cm height) to remove the external radioactivity. Proteoliposomes were eluted with 1 mL 50 mM NaCl and collected in 4 mL of scintillation mixture, vortexed and counted. The radioactivity taken up in controls performed with empty liposomes, <italic>i.e.</italic>, liposomes without incorporated protein, was negligible with respect to the data obtained with proteoliposomes, <italic>i.e.</italic>, liposomes with incorporated proteins. All measurements are presented as means ± SEM from independent experiments as specified in the figure legends. Data analysis and graphs of data and fit were produced using GraphPad Prism (version 9).</p>

<title>Single particle cryogenic electron microscopy data collection, processing and map refinement</title>
<p><italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM was purified as before but with buffers containing a low concentration of L-MNG detergent (0.002%, 20 µM) to produce a population favouring dimeric particles (see <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, blue trace</bold>). The protein was exchanged into amphipol A8-35, concentrated, and frozen at -80 °C until use. The protein was thawed, centrifuged to remove any aggregates, concentrated to 4.1 mg/mL, applied to a glow-discharged (Gatan Solarus) Cu 2/1 carbon Quantifoil grid (Electron-microscopy Sciences), and blotted using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 3.5 s, at 4 °C, and with 100% humidity before vitrification in liquid ethane. The grid was screened for ice quality and particle distribution on a Talos Arctica microscope. A 14,281-image dataset was collected. The data collection parameters are provided in <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>.</p>
<p>All cryo-EM data processing was performed using CryoSPARC v.3.2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>) (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2</bold>). In brief, movie frames were aligned using patch motion correction with a B-factor of 500, and then contrast transfer function (CTF) estimations were made using the patch CTF estimation tool. Initially, 84,871 particles were picked from 295 micrographs using the Blob Picker tool and extracted. These particles were 2D classified into 50 classes, and 10 of these 2D classes were selected and used as a template for automated particle picking using the Template Picker tool, where 3,957,461 particles were picked from 14,281 micrographs. Particles were inspected with the Inspect Picks tool using an NCC Score Threshold of 0.1, and a Local Power range of 29,159 to 62,161. A total of 2,950,415 particles were extracted with a box size of 400 pixels and Fourier cropped to 200 pixels. The extracted particles were then sorted using iterative rounds of 2D classification, where the best 39 classes showing some structural details were selected, retaining 618,442 particles. The particles were subjected to <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction separated into four classes. The two best 3D reconstructions represent dimers that oligomerised in two different ways––an antiparallel dimer and a parallel dimer, for which we had 225,044 and 220,810 particles, respectively. At this point, the datasets were separated for further processing. For each set of data, the reconstructions were used as a reference model for iterative rounds of non-uniform refinement, allowing a 2.99 Å map to be reconstructed for the antiparallel dimer and a 3.36 Å map to be reconstructed for the parallel dimer. For refinement of the antiparallel dimer, C2 symmetry was imposed. The final rounds of refinement were conducted using unbinned particles. The model was built using an initial model from AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), which was fit to the maps using Namdinator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>), ISOLDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>) and Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>) were both used for further model building. A summary of the statistics for data processing, refinement, and validation is shown in <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
TRAP transporters are an unusual class of secondary active transporters that utilize periplasmic binding proteins to deliver their substrates. This paper contributes a new 3 Å structure of the Haemophilus influenzae TRAP transporter. The structure joins two other recent cryo-EM structures of TRAP transporters, including a lower-resolution structure of the same H. influenzae protein (overall 4.7 Å), and a ~3 Å structure of a homologue from P. profundum. In addition to reporting a higher resolution cryo-EM structure, the authors also recapitulate protein activity in a reconstituted system, investigate protein oligomerization using analytic ultracentrifugation, and evaluate interactions and function in &quot;mix and match&quot; configurations with periplasmic subunits from other homologues.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The strength of the paper is that the better resolution cryo-EM data permits sidechain assignment, the identification of bound lipids, and the identification of sodium ions. It is important to get this structure out there since the resolution passes an important threshold for model-building accuracy. The current structure nicely explains a lot of prior mutagenesis data on the H. influenzae TRAP. This is also the first structure of a TRAP protein to be solved without a fiducial, although the overall structure is not very different from those solved with fiducials.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The experiments examining the monomer/dimer equilibrium appear somewhat preliminary. The biological or mechanistic importance of oligomerization is not established, so these experiments are inherently of limited scope. Moreover, cryo-EM datasets exhibit both parallel and antiparallel dimers, the latter of which are clearly not biologically relevant. It is probably impossible to distinguish these in the AUC experiments, which makes interpretation of these experiments more difficult.</p>
<p>Similarly, the importance of the lipid binding sites observed in cryo-EM isn't experimentally established (for example by mutating the binding site) and it thus seems too preliminary to infer that they are important for function.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, the membrane component of the sialic acid-specific TRAP transporter, SiaQM (HiSiaQM), from H. influenzae, is structurally characterized. TRAP transporters are substrate binding protein (SBP)-dependent secondary-active transporters, and HiSiaQM is the most comprehensively studied member of this family. While all previous work on fused TRAP transporter membrane proteins suggests that they are monomeric (including the previous structural characterization of HiSiaQM by a different group), a surprising finding from this work is the observation that HiSiaQM can form higher oligomers, consistent with it being a dimer. These higher oligomeric states were initially observed after extraction of the protein with LMNG detergent but were also observed in DDM detergent, amphipol and nanodiscs using analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). Structural characterization of dimeric HiSiaQM revealed 2 arrangements, parallel and antiparallel arrangements, the latter of which is unlikely to be physiologically relevant.</p>
<p>The higher resolution of this new structure of HiSiaQM (2.2-2.7 Å compared to 4.7 Å for the previous structure) facilitated the assignment of bound lipids at the dimer interface and a lipid molecule embedded in each of the protomers; allowed for a clearer refinement of the Na+ and putative substrate binding sites, which differ slightly from the previous structure; and produced better-modelled side chains for the residues involved in the SBP:HiSiaQM interaction. The authors developed a useful AUC-based assay to determine the affinity for this interaction revealing an affinity of 65 µM. Finally, the authors make the very interesting observation that a sialic acid-specific SBP from a different TRAP transporter can utilize HiSiaQM for transport, contrary to previous observations, revealing for the first time that TRAP membrane components can recognize multiple SBPs.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a well-written and presented manuscript detailing some interesting new observations about this interesting protein family. One of the main findings, that the protein can form a dimer, is supported by data, but the physiological relevance of this is questionable, and the possibility that this is artefactual has not been ruled out. Conclusions regarding the mechanistic importance of the lipid-binding sites are not currently supported by the data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The main strength of this work is the increased resolution of HiSiaQM, which allows for a much more precise assignment of side chains and their orientation. This will be of importance for subsequent mechanistic studies on the contributions of these residues to Na+ and sialic acid binding and conformational changes.</p>
<p>The observation of the lipids, especially the lipid embedded near the fusion helix, is an intriguing observation, which lays the groundwork for future work to understand the lipid-dependence of these transporters. The development of the AUC-based approach to measure SBP affinity for the membrane component will likely prove useful to future studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
One of the main results from this work is the observation that HiSiaQM can form a dimer. Two arrangements were observed, parallel and antiparallel, the latter of which is almost certainly physiologically irrelevant as it would preclude essential interactions with the extracytoplasmic substrate-binding protein. As acknowledged by the author, this non-physiological arrangement is likely a consequence of protein preparation (overexpression, extraction, purification, etc.). However, if one dismisses the antiparallel arrangement as non-relevant and an artefact of protein preparation, it is difficult for the parallel arrangement to maintain its credibility, as it was also processed in the same way. This is especially true when one considers that there is only 100 Å2 buried surface area in the parallel arrangement that does not involve any sidechains; it is difficult to envisage this as a specific interaction, e.g. compared to related proteins that have ~2000 Å2 buried surface area. Unless this dimerization is observed in a bacterial membrane at physiological protein concentrations, it is difficult to rule out the possibility that the observed dimerization is merely an artefact caused by the expression, purification and concentration of the protein.</p>
<p>The manuscript contains some excellent structural analysis of this protein, whose higher resolution reveals some new and interesting insights. However, a weakness of the current work is a lack of validation of these observations using other approaches. For example, lipid interactions are observed in the structure that the authors claim is mechanistically important. However, without disrupting these interactions to look at the effect on transport, this conclusion is not supported. Similarly, the authors use their structure to predict residues that are important for the SBP:membrane protein interaction, and they develop an AUC-based binding assay to study this interaction, but they do not test their predictions using this approach.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript reports new molecular characterization of the Haemophilus influenza tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter of N-acetylneuraminate (Neu5Ac). This membrane transporter is important for the virulence of the pathogen. H. influenza lacks Neu5Ac biosynthetic pathway and utilizes the TRAP transporter to import it. Neu5Ac is used as a nutrient source but also as a protection from the human immune response. The transporter is composed of two fused membrane subunits, HiSiaQM, and one soluble, periplasmic subunit HiSiaP. HiSiaP, by binding to the substrate Neu5Ac, changes its conformation, allowing its binding to HiSiaQM, followed by Neu5Ac and Na+ transport to the cytoplasm. The combination of structural, biophysical and biochemical approaches provides a solid basis for describing the functioning of the Haemophilus influenza Neu5Ac TRAP transporter, which is essential for the pathogen virulence.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The paper describes the electron microscopy structure of HiSiaQM, thanks to its solubilization in L-MNG followed by the exchange to amphipol or nanodisc. In these conditions, HiSiaQM consists of a mixture of monomers and dimers, as characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation. The cryo-EM analysis shows two types of dimers: one in an antiparallel configuration, which is artifactual, and a parallel one, which may be physiologically relevant. Cryo-EM on the dimers allows high-resolution (≈ 3 Å) structure determination. The structure is the first one of a fused SiaQM, and is the first obtained without megabody. The work highlights structural elements (fusion helix, lipids) that could modulate transport. The authors checked the functionality of the purified HiSiaQM, which, after reconstitution in liposome, displays a significantly larger Neu5Ac transport activity compared to the non-fused PpSiaQM homolog. The work identifies Na+ binding sites, and the putative Neu5Ac binding site. From analytical ultracentrifugation using fluorescently labelled HiSiaP, the authors show that HiSiaP is able to interact with HiSiaQM monomer and dimer, with a low but physiologically relevant affinity. HiSiaP interaction with HiSiaQM was modelled using AlphaFold2, and discussed in view of published activity on mutants, and new transport activity assays using SiaQM and SiaP from different organisms. In conclusion, the combination of structural, biophysical and biochemical approaches provides a solid basis for describing the functioning of this TRAP fused transporter.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>
This work evidences in vitro a HiSiaQM dimer, whose in vivo relevance is not ascertained. However, the authors are very careful, not to over-interpret their data, and their conclusions regarding the transporter structure and function are valid irrespective of its state of association.</p>
