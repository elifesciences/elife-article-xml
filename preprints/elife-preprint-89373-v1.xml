<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Spermatogenesis in the Drosophila male germline proceeds through a unique transcriptional program controlled both by germline-specific transcription factors and by testis-specific versions of core transcriptional machinery. This program includes the activation of genes on the heterochromatic <italic>Y</italic> chromosome, and reduced transcription from the <italic>X</italic> chromosome, but how expression from these sex chromosomes is regulated has not been defined. To resolve this, we profiled active chromatin features in the testes from wildtype and meiotic arrest mutants and integrate this with single-cell gene expression data from the Fly Cell Atlas. These data assign the timing of promoter activation for genes with germline-enriched expression throughout spermatogenesis, and general alterations of promoter regulation in germline cells. By profiling both active RNA polymerase II and histone modifications in isolated spermatocytes, we detail widespread patterns associated with regulation of the sex chromosomes. Our results demonstrate that the <italic>X</italic> chromosome is not enriched for silencing histone modifications, implying that sex chromosome inactivation does not occur in Drosophila. Instead, a lack of dosage compensation in spermatocytes accounts for the reduced expression from this chromosome. Finally, profiling uncovers dramatic ubiquitinylation of histone H2A and lysine-16 acetylation of histone H4 across the <italic>Y</italic> chromosome in spermatocytes that may contribute to the activation of this heterochromatic chromosome.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The germline in animals is responsible for producing the specialized gametes that transmit genetic information to the next generation, and gene expression in these cells is tightly controlled to ensure proper cell differentiation and genome stability. In many cases gene regulation is distinctive from that in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Freiman, 2009</xref>). A dramatic example of this is the deployment of testis-specific variants of core transcriptional machinery in the Drosophila male germline that are used to activate and regulate gene promoters during sperm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hiller <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). These variants enable the activation of testis-specific promoters, but the effects they have on transcription and chromatin are less characterized.</p>
<p>Gene regulation in Drosophila spermatogenesis also involves widespread changes on entire chromosomes. The sex chromosomes each have distinct chromosomal features which uniquely impact their expression in the germline: the single <italic>X</italic> chromosome of males is thought to be upregulated in early germline cells, but then suffers a broad reduction in expression during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Witt <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mahadevaraju <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>Y</italic> chromosome is largely heterochromatic and silenced in somatic cells but becomes highly active in spermatocytes, extruding long, diffuse loops of actively transcribing genes within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fingerhut <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). How these chromosome-wide changes are orchestrated remains unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we apply CUT&amp;Tag chromatin profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kaya-Okur <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>) on the adult testis of Drosophila to characterize the chromatin features of the spermatogenic transcription program. By integrating chromatin profiles with published single-cell transcriptional data for the Drosophila testis, we track active chromatin features of germline-specific gene promoters, detailing their timing of activation. Further, we describe the enrichment of RNA polymerase II and select histone modifications across the sex chromosomes in isolated spermatocytes. These profiles show that the <italic>X</italic> chromosome does not accumulate repressive chromatin marks, supporting a model where reduced expression of this chromosome is due to a lack of chromosomal dosage compensation in this cell type. Surprisingly, we find that high levels of mono-ubiquitinylated histone H2A accumulate across the <italic>Y</italic> chromosome in spermatocytes, implicating this otherwise repressive histone modification in the activation of heterochromatic regions in the male germline.</p>

<title>Profiling active promoters in the Drosophila testes</title>
<p>To profile chromatin features of gene activity during spermatogenesis, we performed CUT&amp;Tag profiling for histone H3 lysine-4 dimethylation (H3K4me2), which marks active promoters and enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bernstein <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). The adult testis contains all developmental stages of spermatogenesis, as cells in the germline continually proliferate and differentiate (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">White-Cooper &amp; Bausek, 2010</xref>). Germline stem cells at the apical tip of the testis asymmetrically divide to birth spermatogonia; these undergo four rapid mitotic divisions and then complete one final S phase before entering an extended G2 phase as primary spermatocytes before meiosis and differentiation into sperm. The transcriptional program of premeiotic and post-meiotic stages has been detailed most extensively by single-cell RNA-seq profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Witt <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Witt <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mahadevaraju <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Raz <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shi <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). To assess the developmental timing of active chromatin features, we profiled the H3K4me2 modification in wildtype adult testes and in two stage-arrest mutants. The germline of <italic>bag-of-marbles</italic> (<italic>bam</italic>) mutant males arrests in the spermatogonial stage, so their testes are full of early germline cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). The germline of <italic>always early</italic> (<italic>aly</italic>) mutants arrests in the early primary spermatocyte stage, thus enriching for this cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Laktionov <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Between these three genotypes, only wildtype testes contain late spermatocytes and post-meiotic stages. Thus, profiling testes from these flies distinguishes when in development active chromatin features appear. We dissected testes from one-day-old adult wildtype, <italic>bam</italic>, and <italic>aly</italic> males, sequenced three replicate libraries for each genotype, and mapped reads to a repeat-masked version of the Drosophila dm6 genome assembly (see Methods). To aid distinguishing germline from somatic cell type chromatin features, we also profiled wing imaginal discs from larvae. Sequencing from replicates was pooled, providing 4.4M-19.2M reads/genotype, and publicly available coverage tracks are posted (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/jamesanderson12358/analysis230508UCSC_session_germline_MS">https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/jamesanderson12358/analysis230508UCSC_session_germline_MS</ext-link>).</p>

<p>Inspection of these tracks reveals active chromatin features that track with gene expression timing during spermatogenesis. For example, the promoter for the germline stem cell marker <italic>nanos</italic> (<italic>nos</italic>) is marked with the H3K4me2 modification in <italic>bam</italic> testes, with less signal in <italic>aly</italic> or in wildtype testes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). In contrast, the promoter of the spermatocyte-expressed gene <italic>loopin-1</italic> lacks the H3K4me2 modification in <italic>bam</italic> testes but is heavily marked in <italic>aly</italic> and in wildtype testes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). Similarly, the promoter of the meiotically-expressed genes <italic>Mst36Fa</italic> and <italic>Mst36Fb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Di Cara <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) are marked with the H3K4me2 modification in wildtype testes where the later stages of spermatogenesis are present (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). In contrast, no signal is present at the <italic>nos, loopin-1, Mst36Fa</italic> or <italic>Mst36Fb</italic> genes in wing discs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref></bold>). Finally, profiles for all three testes samples show the H3K4me2 mark at the promoters of the homeotic genes <italic>abdominal-A</italic> and <italic>Abdominal-B</italic> that are expressed in the somatic cells of the testis (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>), since somatic cells are present in all three samples.</p>
<p>To visualize chromatin features across active promoters during spermatogenesis, we categorized genes by their timing and level of mRNA expression in the male germline in single-nucleus RNA-seq profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Raz <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). We focused on five categories of genes with germline-enriched expression in germline stages (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, Supplementary Table 2, 3</bold>), including 845 genes that are predominantly expressed in spermatogonia, 1,510 expressed in early spermatocytes, 1,524 expressed in mid-spermatocytes, 2,052 expressed in late spermatocytes, and 475 genes expressed in spermatids. We then displayed the summed H3K4me2 signal spanning -200 â +500 bp around each of the promoters for these genes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). In the whole testis, germline stages compose a small proportion of all cells, and so genes specifically expressed in these stages have low signal for both mRNA and the H3K4me2 modification (<bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold>). Nevertheless, the overall tendency is that promoters of genes expressed in spermatogonia are marked with the H3K4me2 modification in <italic>bam</italic> mutant testes, which are enriched for early stages compared to <italic>aly</italic> mutant and wildtype testes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). For example, the promoters of early germline markers <italic>nos, vasa</italic> (<italic>vas</italic>), and <italic>zero population growth</italic> (<italic>zpg</italic>) are each heavily marked with H3K4me2 in <italic>bam</italic> mutant samples, reflecting their activity (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,B</xref></bold>). Similarly, the promoters for many genes primarily expressed in early spermatocytes and mid-stage spermatocytes are often most heavily marked with H3K4me2 in bam mutant testes, implying that these genes first become active in spermatogonia and accumulate mRNA in spermatocyte stages. Finally, gene promoters for mRNA that accumulate in late spermatocytes and in differentiating spermatids are predominantly marked with the H3K4me2 modification in wildtype testes, as this is the only sample that contains these stages of spermatogenesis (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). This includes the activation of promoters for the <italic>Y</italic> chromosome-linked fertility factor genes (<italic>kl-2, kl-3</italic>, and <italic>kl-5</italic>) which are primarily expressed in late spermatocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,B</xref></bold>). However, the activation timing of these genes appear to differ, as the promoters of <italic>kl-2</italic> and <italic>kl-3</italic> accumulate the H3K4me2 modification earlier than does the <italic>kl-5</italic> promoter (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). The most dramatic instance of precocious activation of a <italic>Y</italic>-linked promoter is the <italic>FDY</italic> gene which becomes active in early spermatocytes, matching its early production of mRNA (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,B</xref></bold>).</p>

</fig>
<p>There are three exceptions to the overall trend of correspondence between promoter activation and mRNA accumulation. First, active promoters with very low levels of H3K4me2 are most heavily marked in wildtype testes, regardless of when the genes are expressed. These might be active genes where the histone modification accumulates during the extended growth phase of spermatocytes. Additional examples are the <italic>kumgang</italic> (<italic>kmg</italic>) and <italic>cookie monster</italic> (<italic>comr</italic>) gene promoters which produce mRNA in mid-stage spermatocytes, but are most heavily marked with the H3K4me2 modification in wildtype testes. Second, some promoters acquire the H3K4me2 modification well before mRNA accumulates. A small number of genes are expressed in the post-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis, including the âcupâ genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Barreau <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Many of these promoters are most heavily marked with the H3K4me2 modification in wildtype testes, but the promoter for <italic>ryder cup</italic> (<italic>r-cup</italic>) is already marked in <italic>aly</italic> mutant testes, implying that it is already active in pre-meiotic stages (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). Third, we cannot measure H3K4me2 modification at the <italic>bam</italic> promoter in <italic>bam</italic> mutant testes or at the <italic>aly</italic> promoter in <italic>aly</italic> mutant testes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). As these stage-arrest mutations have pleiotropic effects on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Barreau <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) some discrepancies between promoter marking in mutants and transcript accumulation in wildtype testes may be due to aberrant transcriptional regulation.</p>
<p>Notably, the importance of the H3K4me2 modification appears to diminish as spermatogenesis proceeds, as the average signal of this mark around promoters for germline-enriched genes in wildtype testes drops in the later stages of spermatogenesis (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). While the promoters of early germline-expressed genes and somatically-expressed genes have comparable levels of the H3K4me2 modification centered around their TSS, the promoters of late spermatocyte and spermatid genes display very little marking, and this low level extends into gene bodies. This suggests that the activities of H3K4-modifying enzymes are reduced in these later stages.</p>

<title>Profiling FACS-isolated primary spermatocyte</title>
<p>Germline cells undergo massive nuclear expansion and extensive transcriptional activation between mitotic spermatogonia and meiotic division, in part directed by germline-specific variants of general transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lim <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). To specifically profile chromatin features in spermatocytes, we used a spermatocyte-enriched GFP marker to isolate these cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The <italic>hephaestus</italic> (<italic>heph</italic>) gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that is broadly expressed, but in spermatocytes Heph binds the abundant nuclear transcripts from the <italic>Y</italic> chromosome fertility genes (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fingerhut <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). We performed FACS on 40 dissociated testes from males carrying a <italic>heph-GFP</italic> transgene, recording the forward scatter (FSC) and GFP signal of each event (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). FACS profiles from <italic>heph-GFP</italic> samples display a large proportion of events with high GFP signal, which are absent in profiles of wild-type testes. These GFP-labeled spermatocytes have distinct sizes, consistent with the progressive growth of spermatocytes as they approach meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">White-Cooper <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>): in a typical FACS experiment, â¼5-10% of GFP-positive events have moderate GFP signal and moderate size (Gate 1), â¼50% of events have very high GFP signal and moderate size (Gate 2), and â¼5-10% have high GFP signal and large size (Gate 3). The cells of Gate 3 may represent the latest stage of spermatocytes when heph-GFP signal decreases just before meiosis. Because Gate 2 contained the most GFP-positive events, we focused further analysis on these spermatocytes. We used â¼3,000 isolated spermatocytes for each profiling experiment, and since the resulting libraries were comparatively small with high duplication rates, we pooled unique reads from multiple replicates to provide 200,000 â 900,000 unique reads for each profile (<bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>).</p>

<p>We first profiled the distribution of the elongating form of RNA Polymerase II, marked with phosphorylation at Serine-2 (RNAPIIS2p) of the C-terminal tail of the largest subunit of the complex.

For example, the meiotic beta-tubulin variant gene <italic>betaTub85D</italic> is broadly coated with RNAPIS2p in isolated spermatocytes, while signal is absent across this gene in somatic cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Elongating RNAPII is also detectable at many genes that accumulate transcripts in late spermatocytes. For example, 14 genes encoding protamines that package the genome in sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chang <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>) are heavily coated with RNAPII in isolated spermatocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></bold>). Similarly, elongating RNAPII is detectable at genes normally thought to be expressed in post-meiotic cells, such as <italic>heineken-cup</italic> (<italic>h-cup</italic>), implying that RNAPII is engaged at some genes well before their transcripts are detected.</p>
<p>While these results confirm the cell-type identity of the FACS-isolated cells, we noted that the distribution of RNAPIIS2p across genes such as <italic>betaTub85D</italic> differs from the typical pattern across active genes in somatic cells. Serine-2-phosphorylation of RNAPII is associated with transcriptional elongation, but in Drosophila and in mammalian somatic cells it shows a prominent peak at the 5â end of active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kaya-Okur <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahmad &amp; Henikoff, 2021</xref>). The broad distribution of elongating RNAPII across active genes is typical in spermatocytes. Genes with germline-enriched expression show a broad distribution of elongating RNAPII downstream of their promoters, while somatically expressed genes show a prominent 5â peak (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To clearly compare RNAPII distributions between cell-types, we examined long genes that are commonly expressed in both spermatocytes and in wing imaginal discs. One example is the <italic>shuttle craft</italic> (<italic>stc</italic>) gene, which is almost 5 kb and is highly expressed. Strikingly, RNAPIIS2p signal at <italic>stc</italic> shows a prominent peak near the promoter in somatic wing imaginal disc cells but is broadly distributed across the gene in spermatocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). More generally, distribution of RNAPIIS2p is broadly distributed across all active genes in spermatocytes, in contrast to the proximally peaked distribution in somatic cells (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref></bold>)</p>
<p>The change from peaked to broad distributions of RNAPIIS2p is mirrored in the distributions of the H3K4me2 modification, as this histone modification shows an atypical broad and low distribution across the active <italic>betaTub85D</italic> and <italic>stc</italic> genes in spermatocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C,D</xref></bold>). As this histone modification occurs co-transcriptionally, its change in distribution is likely the result of the altered distribution of RNAPII across these genes.</p>

<title>The X chromosome is not dosage compensated in spermatocytes</title>
<p>In somatic cells of Drosophila males, the expression of genes on the single <italic>X</italic> chromosome is approximately doubled to equalize expression to autosomal genes. Canonical dosage compensation is accomplished by the Male Specific-Lethal (MSL) RNA-protein complex, which coats the <italic>X</italic> chromosome, catalyzes acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16, and increases RNAPII density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Akhtar &amp; Becker, 2000</xref>). However, in germline cells in the testis cytology detects no enrichment of the H4K16Ac modification, suggesting that <italic>X</italic> chromosome dosage compensation does not occur in this cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rastelli &amp; Kuroda, 1998</xref>). Transcriptomic profiling showed that multiple components of the dosage compensation machinery are not expressed in the male germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Witt <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). In spite of this, single-cell RNA-seq studies have shown that a perhaps non-canonical form of <italic>X</italic> chromosome dosage compensation occurs in early spermatogonial stages, but disappears by spermatocyte stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mahadevaraju <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Witt <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Raz <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>The distribution of RNAPII in isolated spermatocytes is consistent with the lack of dosage compensation by this stage of spermatogenesis. Plotting the distribution of RNAPIIS2p across Drosophila chromosomes in wing imaginal discs shows a substantial enrichment across the <italic>X</italic> chromosome, resulting from dosage compensation in these somatic cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). This enrichment of RNAPIIS2p across the <italic>X</italic> chromosome is lost in spermatocytes. To quantify chromosomal changes, we summarized RNAPIIS2p signal for the autosomal <italic>2nd</italic> and <italic>3rd</italic> chromosomes, the quasi-heterochromatic <italic>4th</italic> chromosome, and the sex chromosomes (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). As the sex chromosomes are hemizygous, we doubled counts for genes on these chromosomes to calculate polymerase densities per gene copy, and then scaled gene scores to the median value of gene scores on the <italic>2nd</italic> and <italic>3rd</italic> autosomal chromosomes. As expected, the median expression of <italic>X</italic>-linked genes in wing imaginal disc cells is close to twice that of the major autosomes, showing they are dosage compensated. In contrast, median expression from <italic>X</italic>-linked genes is equal to that of the major autosomes in spermatocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To assess the chromosomal distribution of the H4K-16Ac modification, we profiled it in wing imaginal discs and in isolated spermatocytes. This acetylation is widespread across the genome, consistent with its association with transcriptional activity, and in wing imaginal disc cells it is noticeably enriched across the dosage-compensated <italic>X</italic> chromosome (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). In stark contrast, the <italic>X</italic> chromosome is depleted for H4K-16ac in spermatocytes. Thus, chromatin profiling for both elongating RNAPII and the H4K16ac modification demonstrate there is no dosage compensation of the <italic>X</italic> chromosome in spermatocytes.</p>
<p>RNAPII density on the quasi-heterochromatic <italic>4th</italic> chromosome is reduced in spermatocytes, consistent with decreased transcript production from this chromosome in RNA-seq studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mahadevaraju <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Witt <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Raz <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). The <italic>4th</italic> chromosome is an evolutionary derivative of the <italic>X</italic> chromosome and it has been speculated that it may be subject to similar chromosomal regulation as the <italic>X</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Larsson &amp; Meller, 2006</xref>); however, only 10 genes are expressed from this small chromosome in spermatocytes, and this limits any inference about down-regulation of this chromosome. In contrast, the specific activation and accumulation of RNAPIIS2p on <italic>Y</italic> chromosome genes in spermatocytes is dramatic (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,B</xref></bold>). Likewise, the <italic>Y</italic> chromosome becomes conspicuously enriched for the H4K16ac modification in spermatocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>), suggesting this modification is involved in gene activation from this chromosome.</p>

<title>Profiling silencing chromatin marks in spermatocytes</title>
<p>The sex chromosomes of male therian mammals form a cytological sex body in pre-meiotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Solari, 1974</xref>). This body is a manifestation of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), where repressive histone modifications silence unpaired chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Turner, 2015</xref>). MSCI has been suggested to occur in the Drosophila male germline to explain the mysterious dominant male sterility of many <italic>X</italic>-to-autosome translocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lifschytz &amp; Lindsley, 1972</xref>). However, transcriptional profiling of the Drosophila testis has not observed silencing of the <italic>X</italic> chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mahadevaraju <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Witt <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Raz <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shi <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). We therefore profiled silencing histone modifications in isolated spermatocytes to determine if molecular marks of MSCI are enriched on the Drosophila <italic>X</italic> chromosome. Methylation of histone H3 at lysine-9 (H3K9me) is generally associated with heterochromatic silencing and marks the precociously silenced <italic>X</italic> chromosome in male mouse spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Khalil <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ernst <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). In wing imaginal disc cells dimethylation of H3K9 (H3K9me2) is enriched in silenced pericentromeric regions of all chromosomes, as well as throughout the heterochromatic <italic>Y</italic> chromosome and the quasi-heterochromatic <italic>4th</italic> chromosome (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>), consistent with the silencing of repetitive sequence regions in somatic cells. However, the genome in spermatocytes gains the H3K9me2 modification throughout chromosome arms, including those of the major autosomes and the <italic>X</italic> chromosome. In contrast the H3K9me2 modification is reduced across the <italic>Y</italic> chromosome, consistent with the activation of <italic>Y</italic>-linked genes in this cell type (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). Although the H3K9me2 mark is reduced across this chromosome and across pericentromeric regions, substantial chromosomal methylation remains in spermatocytes.</p>

<p>A major system of chromatin repression uses trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine-27 (H3K27me3) to direct developmental gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Grossniklaus &amp; Paro, 2014</xref>). Although this mark is not associated with MSCI in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mu <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>), we profiled it in Drosophila spermatocytes. There is little change in the chromosomal distribution of the H3K27me3 modification between wing imaginal disc cells and spermatocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). There is a slight apparent reduction of this modification across the <italic>X</italic> chromosome and a slight gain across the <italic>Y</italic> chromosome, but these differences may be due to the developmental lineages of these two samples. Overall, the constancy of chromosomal patterns of the H3K27me3 modification is consistent with the inactivation of the histone methyltransferase <italic>Enhancer of zeste</italic> (<italic>E(z)</italic>) in spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Mono-ubiquitinylation of histone H2A marks the active Y chromosome</title>
<p>An additional histone modification associated with precocious silencing of the <italic>X</italic> chromosome in male mammals is the mono-ubiquitinylation of histone H2A at lysine-119 (uH2A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Baarends <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). This modification is conserved at the homologous lysine-118 position of Drosophila histone H2A, and is linked to Poly-comb-mediated silencing across eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Barbour <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). We therefore profiled the distribution of the uH2A modification in wing imaginal discs and in isolated spermatocytes to determine if this modification marked the <italic>X</italic> chromosome. The uH2A mark is broadly enriched throughout the arms of autosomes in both cell types, but shows no enrichment across the <italic>X</italic> chromosome in spermatocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold>). Thus, this chromatin marker of mammalian MSCI is also absent from the Drosophila <italic>X</italic> chromosome. However, the active <italic>Y</italic> chromosome is strikingly enriched for the uH2A modification in spermatocytes, with additional moderate enrichment in the repetitive pericentromeric regions of all chromosomes (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We confirmed the chromosomal enrichment of the uH2A modification by immunostaining spermatocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>). The subnuclear pattern of a Polycomb-GFP (PcGFP) fusion protein distinguishes early from late spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">El-Sharnouby <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Using this marker, we see that uH2A is largely absent from the nucleus of early spermatocytes. In mid-stage spermatocytes a stringy wedge of uH2A staining appears in the interchromosomal space between the chromatin bodies and expands to one or two wedges in late spermatocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>). The timing of appearance and position of these stained bodies resemble that of the chromosome loops that unfold from <italic>Y</italic>-linked genes as they are expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bonaccorsi <italic>et al</italic>, 1988</xref>). We therefore engineered <italic>XO</italic> male flies lacking a <italic>Y</italic> chromosome and immunostained their spermatocytes. The uH2A modification is present in these cells, but with a distinctly different focal appearance, suggesting that the ubiquitinylated histone aggregates in spermatocytes without a <italic>Y</italic> chromosome (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>). To confirm the timing of the appearance of the uH2A body, we immunostained germline nuclei from <italic>bam</italic> and <italic>aly</italic> stage-arrest mutants. The spermatogonial nuclei from <italic>bam</italic> mutant testes lack uH2A staining, while early spermatocyte nuclei from <italic>aly</italic> mutant testes have only a small uH2A body that always abuts against the nucleolus (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>). Thus, the uH2A body accumulates during the early spermatocyte stage and expands as spermatocytes develop. The timing and position of the uH2A body is consistent with the idea that it contains the <italic>Y</italic> chromosome, which is transcriptionally active in these stages.</p>
<p>To further characterize the relationship between transcriptional activity of the <italic>Y</italic> chromosome and the uH2A modification, we plotted signal for the uH2A modification and for RNAPIIS2p at <italic>Y</italic>-linked gene promoters (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold>). In wing imaginal discs these promoters have little RNAPIIS2p or uH2A modification, but there is strong enrichment for both features at these promoters in spermatocytes, consistent with transcriptional activity of the <italic>Y</italic> chromosome. Since the uH2A modification also becomes enriched in pericentromeric regions, we compared the enrichment of the uH2A modification and RNAPIIS2p at repetitive transposons that constitute a large fraction of these regions. A number of transposons gain RNAPIIS2p signal specifically in spermatocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref></bold>; <bold>Supplementary Table 4</bold>; <bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref></bold>), consistent with their transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lawlor <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). These activated transposons also gain the uH2A modification. These correspondences suggest that the uH2A modification contributes to transcriptional activation of heter-ochromatic regions in spermatocytes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Germline cells use distinctive variations on transcriptional gene regulation, and studies of Drosophila spermatogenesis have detailed many specialized alterations of core general transcription factors that direct expression programs as differentiation proceeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hiller <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). However, the chromatin features of gene regulation in spermatogenesis have been less thoroughly characterized, in part because of the complexity of the tissue and limiting numbers of germline cells. We have addressed this by performing efficient CUT&amp;Tag chromatin profiling for both active and repressive chromatin marks in the Drosophila testis and in isolated spermatocytes. These profiles reveal several notable features of the epigenome in the differentiating germline. First, integration of chromatin marks with published gene expression data details a general correspondence between gene promoter activation and mRNA production as expected, but for a fraction of genes their promoters activate earlier than expected. Second, genes that are activated late in spermatogenesis tend to have very reduced active chromatin marks at their promoters. Third, while many active genes in somatic cells accumulate RNA polymerase II near their gene starts, such accumulation is absent in spermatocytes. Fourth, integration of chromatin profiling for multiple chromatin marks and profiling of RNA polymerase II demonstrate that the single <italic>X</italic> chromosome is neither dosage compensated nor globally inactivated in spermatocytes. Finally, histone H2A mono-ubiquitinylation appears to have a specialized role in activation of the heterochromatic <italic>Y</italic> chromosome.</p>

<title>Quirks of gene expression in the male germline</title>
<p>The uniform distribution of RNAPII throughout active genes in male germline cells is strikingly different from the typical accumulation of RNAPII near promoters in somatic cells. Promoter-proximal accumulation results from dynamic pausing of RNAPII before conversion into the productive elongating isoform, and is a major control point for transcriptional regulation in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Muniz <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Thus, the uniformity of RNAPII across expressed genes in spermatocytes suggests that pausing does not occur, necessitating gene regulation solely by transcription factor and RNAPII recruitment. This may allow for a simpler promoter architecture, and indeed spermatogenic gene promoters are distinctively small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">White-Cooper <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Further, a lack of pausing likely affects chromatin features of promoters. Paused RNAPII binds enzymes that progressively methylate the lysine-4 residue of histone H3, and so active promoters in somatic cells are typically marked with both H3K4-dimethylation and -trimethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bernstein <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). A consequence of no pausing in spermatocytes would be reduced methylation of active promoters (which we observe is most severe in late spermatocyte and post-meiotic stages), and there-by reduced reliance of these marks for promoting transcription.</p>

<title>The X chromosome is neither dosage-compensated nor inactivated in spermatocytes</title>
<p>While protein and lncRNA components of the somatic dosage compensation machinery are not produced in the male germline, transcriptional profiling described up-regulation of the single <italic>X</italic> chromosome in early germline stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mahadevaraju <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Witt <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). The mechanism for this non-canonical dosage compensation remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Witt <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>), but by the spermatocyte stage <italic>X</italic>-linked genes are no longer up-regulated. Our profiling of RNAPII confirms that there is no up-regulation of this chromosome in spermatocytes. There has been substantial investigation into whether the <italic>X</italic> is inactivated in spermatocytes, inspired by the regulation of sex chromosomes in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Vibranovski, 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Turner, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Turner, 2015</xref>). In mammalian male germlines the <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> chromosomes undergo Meiotic Sex Chromosome Inactivation (MSCI), where these chromosomes are precociously silenced just before meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Turner, 2015</xref>). A variety of chromatin features accumulate across the sex chromosomes at this time, including the enrichment of both H3K9me2 and uH2A histone modifications. However, we find that neither of these histone modifications is enriched on the <italic>X</italic> chromosome in the Drosophila male germline. This, combined with the equivalent amounts of RNA polymerase II on <italic>X</italic>-linked genes and autosomal ones implies that there is no <italic>X</italic> chromosome inactivation in Drosophila.</p>
<p>Why do flies differ from mammals? Mammalian MSCI is considered to be an elaborated response of germline cells to the detection of the unpaired sex chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Huynh &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>). However, meiosis in Drosophila males is unusual in that all the chromosomes do not synapse nor recombine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">McKee &amp; Handel, 1993</xref>). Logically, the evolutionary loss of synapsis must have required the concomitant loss of an unpaired chromosome response in Drosophila males. Indeed, many of the proteins recruited to the mammalian sex body are normally involved in meiotic recombination but have been repurposed for unpaired chromosome inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abe <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>), supporting the idea that MSCI is mechanistically linked to synapsis. Alternatively, mammalian MSCI may be a variant of the X-inactivation system that operates in females for dosage compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Huynh &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>) but since Drosophila solved the dosage compensation problem without inactivation, this precluded the evolution of MSCI. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive.</p>

<title>Activation of the Y chromosome</title>
<p>The <italic>Y</italic> chromosome in Drosophila is unique in that it is almost entirely composed of repetitive sequence, but also carries some unique genes required for male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chang &amp; Larracuente, 2019</xref>). Thus, in somatic cell types this a heterochromatic chromosome, but is heavily transcribed in spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bonaccorsi <italic>et al</italic>, 1988</xref>). This activated chromosome accumulates multiple histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hennig &amp; Weyrich, 2013</xref>), some of which we have profiled here. Surprisingly, one of the histone modifications that coats the activated <italic>Y</italic> chromosome is mono-ubiquitinylation of histone H2A modification. This modification is typically associated with Polycomb-mediated gene silencing in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aloia <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>), where it is catalyzed by the Sce/RING1B enzyme subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gorfinkiel <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). However, the Polycomb subunit of PRC1 does not co-localize with the uH2A-coated <italic>Y</italic> chromosome in spermatocytes, suggesting that it is not catalyzed by Sce here. Indeed, uH2A also coats the <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> chromosomes in mammalian spermatocytes, where this modification is catalyzed by a distinct enzyme, the UBR2 E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">An <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). The Drosophila genome encodes a homolog of this protein family, as well as many other ubiquitin ligases, some of which target the H2A histone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tasaki <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). We do not know which enzyme is responsible for the uH2A modification in the Drosophila male germline, although some candidates have male sterile phenotypes when mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rathke <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). While it is surprising to find a histone modification conventionally associated with silencing enriched on an activated chromosome (and indeed the reason we profiled it was as a putative MSCI marker), the roles of uH2A in gene regulation are diverse even in somatic cells. The uH2A modification is associated with both silenced and some active genes in developing eye tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Loubiere <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>), and counters chromatin compaction in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bonnet <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). In addition to the <italic>Y</italic> chromosome, a number of heterochromatic transposons in the Drosophila male germline are also activated and accumulate the uH2A modification. Thus, it is conceivable that this modification â perhaps in combination with other marks â works generally to activate extremely heterochromatic regions in spermatocytes.</p>

<title>Whole-mount CUT&amp;Tag</title>
<p>To perform CUT&amp;Tag [Kaya-Oku <italic>et al</italic>, 2019] for whole tissues (âwhole-mount CUT&amp;Tagâ), we dissected 10 testes from one-day-old adults or 10 imaginal wing discs from 3rd instar larvae in PBS buffer supplemented with cOmplete protease inhibitor (Roche 11697498001). Dissected tissues were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton/PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature, and then manually transferred into the following CUT&amp;Tag solutions sequentially between wells of a glass dissection plate: primary antibody solution (diluted in Wash+ buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 2 mM EDTA, 1% BSA, with cOmplete protease inhibitor)) overnight at 4Â°, secondary antibody solution (in Wash+ buffer) for 1 hour at room temperature, and then incubated with loaded protein-A-Tn5 (in 300Wash+ buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine with cOmplete protease inhibitor) for 1 hour. After one wash with 300Wash+ buffer, samples were incubated in 300Wash+ buffer supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2 for 1 hour at 37Â° to tagment chromatin.

<title>Promoter and gene scoring tables</title>
<p>We compiled a list of genes with male-germline-enriched expression as follows. We compiled a list of unique protein-coding mRNAs and lncRNA genes from the Drosophila dmel_r6.31 genome assembly (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ftp.flybase.net/releases/FB2019_06/dmel_r6.31/gtf/">http://ftp.flybase.net/releases/FB2019_06/dmel_r6.31/gtf/</ext-link>), and matched FCA expression data for 40 testis cell types [Raz 2023] to each gene with a lookup table. There were 1,062 genes that are not represented in the expression dataset; these genes are listed with #N/A values for gene expression.</p>
<p>For each gene, we calculated its average expression in the 18 germline groups (gexp) and its average expression in 21 somatic groups (sexp). The 40<sup>th</sup> âunannotatedâ group was not considered for gexp or sexp values. We then used k-means clustering (k=10) to group genes by cell-type expression within the testis (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref></bold>). The k-means groups 1-5 were associated with gene expression in germline clusters 1-18. The remaining groups 6-10 were associated with gene expression in somatic clusters 19-40, and we collapsed these into one somatic group called âall somatic categoriesâ (k-cluster group 11). We added these k-cluster annotations to each gene.</p>
<p>We then selected 6,419 genes with log<sub>2</sub>Fold-change&gt;1 average expression in germline groups than in testis somatic groups (termed genes with germline-enriched expression). This table is included as <bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>. To assign alternative promoters to each gene, for each transcript in the .gtf file with orientation â+â we assigned the minimum coordinate as its TSS position, and for each transcript with orientation â-â we assigned the maximum coordinate as its TSS position. We retained only one instance of duplicate TSSs for genes with TSS coordinates represented multiple times. In 144 instances two gene names share the same TSS coordinate, and we retained a TSS for each gene in the table. This table of 21,982 promoters is included as <bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold>.</p>
<p>For each gene, we determined the identity and distance to the nearest promoter of the next upstream gene using the bedtools/closest with parameters: -D a -fu, and for the next downstream gene with parameters: -D a -fd.</p>
<p>To summarize the enrichment of chromatin marks at promoters, we counted mapped reads in an interval from -200 â +500 bp around each TSS in merged profiling data by summing reads using deeptools/multi-BamSummary with parameters: BED-file âBED and scaled counts by the number of reads in each library (counts * 1,000,000) / (number of reads in library) to give Counts per Million (CPM). Profiling counts were transformed into z-scores for each promoter between <italic>bam, aly</italic>, and wildtype testis samples, and these values are appended to <bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold>.</p>
<p>To summarize the enrichment of chromatin marks across genes, we counted mapped reads from the start to the end of each gene in merged profiling data by summing reads using deeptools/multiBamSummary with parameters: BED-file âBED and scaled counts by the number of reads in each library and the length of the gene (counts * 1,000,000) / (number of reads in library * gene length in kb) to give Counts per Kilobase per Million (CPKM), and these values are appended to <bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>.</p>
<p>To summarize enrichment of chromatin marks across transposons, we counted mapped reads across consensus transposon sequences using deeptools/multi-BamSummary with parameters: BED-file âBED and scaled counts as CPKM. These values are provided in <bold>Supplementary Table 4</bold>.</p>

<p>For average plots of H3K4me2 signal around promoters, profiling coverage was summarized with deep-Tools/bamCoverage +1 kb around annotated TSSs excluding regions with a second gene promoter in the display window with 10 bp binning, and plotted using plotHeatmap.</p>
<p>For heatmapping of RNAPIIS2p signal at gene starts, we used deepTools/computeMatrix with parameters: -b 2000 -a 2000 -R and then we used deepTools/plotHe-atmap with parameters: --colorMap viridis.</p>
<p>For visualizing the chromosomal distribution of CUT&amp;Tag data as CIRCOS plots, we used the circlize package in R with default settings (circlize version 0.4.15). Genome coverage files for plotting were generated by deepTools/bamCoverage command, using parameters:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="529909v2_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>And plotted in consecutive 20 kb bins. The innermost 3 rings of each plot display genomic coverage, with color-coding set independently per ring.The color of bins in the outer ring correspond to the fold-change of signal in spermatocytes compared to wing imaginal discs calculated using deepTools/multiBigwigSummary command, with parameters:
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="529909v2_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>For boxplots, the enrichment score for each gene was scaled by dividing its read count by the median count in the âchromosome <italic>2 &amp; 3</italic>â category and plotted, discarding genes with enrichment score = 0 in either dissociated testes, in spermatocytes, or in wing imaginal discs.</p>

<p>Anderson, Henikoff, Ahmad et al. performed a series of genomics assays to study Drosophila spermatogenesis. Their main approaches include (1) Using two different genetic mutants that arrest male germ cell differentiation at distinct stages, bam and aly mutant, they performed CUT&amp;TAG using H3K4me2, a histone modification for active promoters and enhancers; (2) Using FACS sorted pure spermatocytes, they performed CUT&amp;TAG using antibodies against RNA PolII phosphorylated Ser 2, H4K16ac, H3K9me2, H3K27me3, and ubH2AK118. They also compare these chromatin profiling results with the published single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq data. Their analyses are across the genome but the major conclusions are about the chromatin features of the sex chromosomes. For example, the X chromosome is lack of dosage compensation as well as inactivation in spermatocytes, while Y chromosome is activated but enriched with ubH2A in spermatocytes. Overall, this work provides high-quality epigenome data in testes and in purified germ cells. The analyses are very informative to understand and appreciate the dramatic chromatin structure change during spermatogenesis in Drosophila. Some new analyses and a few new experiments are suggested here, which hopefully further take advantage of these data sets and make some results more conclusive.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>1). The step-wise accumulation of H3K4me2 in bam, aly and wt testes are interesting. Is it possible to analyse the cis-acting sequences of different groups of genes with distinct H3K4me2 features, in order to examine whether there is any shared motif(s), suggesting common trans-factors that potentially set up the chromatin state for activating gene expression in a sequential manner?</p>
<p>2). Pg. 4, line 141-142: &quot;we cannot measure H3K4me2 modification at the bam promoter in bam mutant testes or at the aly promoter in aly mutant testes&quot;, what are the allelic features of the bam mutant and aly mutant? Are the molecular features of these mutations preventing the detection of H3K4me2 at the endogenous genes' promoters? Also, the references cited (Chen et al., 2011) and (Laktionov et al., 2018) are not the original research papers where these two mutants were characterized.</p>
<p>3). The original paper that reported the Pc-GFP line and its localization is: Chromosoma 108, 83 (1999). The Pc-GFP is ubiquitously expressed and almost present in all cell types. In Figure 6B, there is no Pc-GFP signals in bam and aly mutant cells. According to the Method &quot;one testis was dissected&quot;, does it mean that only one testis was prepared for immunostaining and imaging? If so, definitely more samples should be used for a more confident conclusion. Also, why use 3rd instar larval testes instead of adult testes? Finally, it is better to compare fixed tissue and live tissue, as the Pc-GFP signal could be lost during fixation and washing steps. Please refer to the above paper [Chromosoma 108, 83 (1999)] for Pc-GFP in spermatogonial cells and Development 138, 2441-2450 (2011) for Pc-GFP localization in aly mutant.</p>
<p>4). Ubiquitinylation of histone H2A is typically associated with gene silencing, here it has been hypothesized that ubH2A contributes to the activation of Y chromosome. This conclusion is strenuous, as it entirely depends on correlative results. For example, the lack of co-localization of ubH2A immunostaining and Pc-GFP are not convincing evidence that ubH2A is not resulting from PRC1 dRing activity. It would be a lot stronger conclusion by using genetic tools to show this. For example, if dRing is knocked down (using RNAi driven by a late-stage germline driver such as bam-Gal4) or mutated in spermatocytes (using mitotic clonal analysis), would they detect changes of ubH2A levels?</p>
<p>5). Regarding &quot;X chromosome of males is thought to be upregulated in early germline cells&quot;, it has been shown that male-biased genes are deprived on the X chromosome [Science 299:697-700 (2003); Genome Biol 5:R40 (2004); Nature 450:238-241 (2007)], so are the differentiation genes of spermatogenesis [Cell Research 20:763-783 (2010)]. It would be informative to discuss the X chromatin features identified in this work with these previous findings. For example, the lack of RNAPII on X chromosome in spermatocytes could be due to a few differentiation genes expressed in spermatocytes located on the X chromosome.</p>

<p>Anderson et al profiled chromatin features, including active chromatin marks, RNA polymerase II distribution, and histone modifications in the sex chromosomes of spermatogenic cells in Drosophila. The results are new and the experiments and analyses look well done, including with appropriate numbers of replicates. Results were parsed by comparing them among two arrest mutants and wildtype, as well as in FACS-sorted spermatocytes. The authors also profiled larval wing discs to serve as reference-somatic cells, which allowed them to focus only on features in their testis data that were associated with germ cells. Their results were further refined by categorizing the genes of interest based on available single nucleus RNA seq expression profiles. The authors document interesting phenomena, such as differences in the distribution of RNAPIIS2p on some genes in germ cells vs somatic cells, the presence of a uH2A body beginning in early spermatocytes, and high levels of uH2A on the Y chromosome and little or none on the X. The former is intriguing because this modification is usually associated with silencing, yet the Y chromosome is active in spermatogenic cells. The authors interpret some of their data as implying a lack of dosage compensation of the X chromosome in spermatocytes.</p>
<p>The data are believable and new, but it is not fully clear how to interpret them. The paper's interpretations rely on subtractive logic to parse results from mixtures of cells down to cell type, extracting spermatogonia, spermatocyte, etc. features by comparing bam mutants (only spermatogonia) to aly mutants (spermatogonia and early spermatocytes but no later stages) to wildtype (all spermatogenic stages), and extracting testis germline data by comparison to wing disc soma; their FACS sorted spermatocytes also have heterogeneity. I recognize that the present paper was a lot of work and am not suggesting that the authors redo their study using methods that give more purity and precision of stage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aal3096">https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aal3096</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.335331.119">https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.335331.119</ext-link>), but they should be aware of them and of their results.</p>
<p>The conclusions about dosage compensation are indirect, but are consistent with the current model documented in the studies cited by the authors, as well as earlier studies (doi: 10.1186/jbiol30).</p>
