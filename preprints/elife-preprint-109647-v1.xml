<abstract>
<p>Calreticulin (CRT) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone with low affinity calcium binding sites in its C-terminal domain. This region is altered by somatic mutations in the CRT gene (<italic>CALR</italic>), which drive a subset of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Perturbations in ER calcium storage and signaling are reported for the MPN type I mutant, CRT<sub>Del52</sub>, and are linked to disease pathogenesis. Using recombinant CRT proteins, we found similar low affinity calcium binding characteristics for wild-type CRT and CRT<sub>Del52</sub>, as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Residues 340–349, conserved in both wild-type CRT and CRT<sub>Del52</sub>, contribute to binding. Furthermore, ER and cytosolic calcium levels and store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) were comparable in CRT knockout (CRT-KO) cells reconstituted with wild-type CRT or CRT<sub>Del52</sub>. Notably, the CRT-KO induces expression of multiple ER proteins known to contain low affinity calcium binding sites or regulate ER calcium levels. Overall, these findings indicate that CRT<sub>Del52</sub> retains at least some low affinity calcium binding capacity and that CRT-deficiency induces compensatory cellular changes that maintain ER calcium homeostasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Calreticulin (CRT) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal protein that plays key roles in the assembly and folding of N-linked glycoproteins. CRT has a highly acidic C-terminal domain that contains multiple low affinity calcium binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baksh and Michalak, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wijeyesakere et al., 2011</xref>). As an ER chaperone, CRT is thought to play a critical role in maintaining cellular calcium homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Venkatesan et al., 2021b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Michalak, 2024</xref>). The ER has a relatively high free calcium concentration of 0.5-1 μM through the presence of various low affinity calcium-binding proteins that buffer calcium, whereas cytosolic calcium levels are maintained within a narrow range of around 100 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Michalak, 2024</xref>). The maintenance of calcium homeostasis within cellular compartments is essential for cell function and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bagur and Hajnoczky, 2017</xref>). Early studies have shown that the C-domain of CRT contributes to ER calcium storage, although free ER luminal concentrations are unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Nakamura et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Somatic mutations of exon 9 of the <italic>CALR</italic> gene including a 52-base pair deletion (Del52; type 1 mutation) and a 5-base pair insertion (Ins5; type 2 mutation), are driver mutations in some myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), specifically in essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary and secondary myelofibrosis (PMF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Klampfl et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nangalia et al., 2013</xref>). The MPN mutations change the CRT C-domain residues from being predominantly acidic to a high prevalence of basic amino acids and result in a loss of the ER-retention KDEL sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Klampfl et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nangalia et al., 2013</xref>). Although all MPN CRT mutants change the sequence and charge of the C-domain, a greater number of acidic residues are retained in MPN type 2 mutant (CRT<sub>Ins5</sub>), compared to the type I mutant (CRT<sub>Del52</sub>). The loss of more acidic residues from the C-terminal domain of CRT<sub>Del52</sub> has been reported to impair its calcium binding and reduce ER calcium levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ibarra et al., 2022</xref>). Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is a physiological process that allows for the entry of extracellular calcium and ER calcium restoration following ER calcium depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Putney, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Altered calcium release from the ER and SOCE was reported for MPN type I but not type 2 mutants in cultured megakaryocytes from MPN patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pietra et al., 2016</xref>). In another study, spontaneous calcium spikes and increased SOCE activation were observed in cultured megakaryocytes from MPN type I and type 2 patients when compared to healthy donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Di Buduo et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Although global calcium binding defects were predicted or qualitatively measured for CRT<sub>Del52</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Shivarov et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ibarra et al., 2022</xref>) and altered cellular calcium signaling is also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pietra et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Di Buduo et al., 2020</xref>), it remains unclear whether MPN-linked CRT<sub>Del52</sub> has any low affinity calcium binding capacity, given that a few conserved acidic residues are retained in its C-domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In fact, our previous studies showed that a truncated version of murine wild-type CRT (mCRT) containing the non-mutated part of CRT<sub>Del52</sub> and two additional C-terminal residues (mCRT<sub>1-351</sub>) showed similar low affinity calcium binding characteristics as the wild-type mCRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wijeyesakere et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, further truncation of mCRT (mCRT<sub>1-339</sub>) was needed to disrupt calcium binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wijeyesakere et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wijeyesakere et al., 2016</xref>). The goal of the current study was to quantitatively measure low affinity calcium binding by CRT<sub>Del52</sub> compared with wild-type human CRT and also quantify ER and cytosolic calcium levels and calcium responsiveness in cells expressing wild-type CRT or CRT<sub>Del52</sub>.</p>

<title>Protein expression and purification</title>
<p>B1 domain of streptococcal protein G (GB1) and his-tagged versions of wild-type CRT, CRT<sub>(1-</sub> <sub>351)</sub>, CRT<sub>(1-339)</sub> and CRT<sub>Del52</sub> were purified following expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells using a nickel resin and gel filtration chromatography as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">DelProposto et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Del Cid et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wijeyesakere et al., 2011</xref>) (also see supplemental methods). The monomer fractions were pooled, dialyzed and concentrated to 4 mg/mL in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM NaCl 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> pH 7.5 using Amicon ultra concentrators with a molecular weight cut-off of 30,000 Dalton (Millipore) and frozen in 10% glycerol for further use.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Isothermal titration calorimetry</title>
<p>Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements were done using the Nano-ITC SV (TA Instruments). Purified CRT monomers were dialyzed into 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM NaCl pH 7.5, brought to a concentration of 100 µM, and then pre-incubated with 50-100 µM CaCl<sub>2</sub> in 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM NaCl pH 7.5 for 30 minutes to block the high affinity calcium binding sites. This was followed by 25 sequential 10µL injections of 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> pH 7.5 into the protein solutions maintained at 37°C. The heat changes measured for the sequential injections were curve-fitted to calculate the enthalpies, stoichiometries, and the dissociation constants using NanoAnalyze software.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Cytosolic calcium measurement and store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) induction</title>
<p>MEG-01 cells and their <italic>CALR</italic>-modified versions (see supplemental methods) were plated on glass coverslips pretreated with 0.01% poly-L-lysine to facilitate cell attachment. Cells were loaded with 2.5 µM Fura-2/AM dye (Ion Biosciences) supplemented with 0.1% pluronic acid in a physiological salt solution (PSS) containing 140 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES and 11 mM glucose, and incubated for 60 minutes at 37°C. Live single-cell imaging was done at 20X magnification using an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope equipped with a TILL Polychrome V monochromator light source, a Dual-View emission beam splitter, and a cooled Photometrics Quant-EM camera. Cells were transferred to a perfusion chamber that was mounted on the microscope stage, and PSS with or without 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> was flowed over cells using a gravity-fed perfusion system. Cytosolic calcium measurements were performed by perfusing Fura-2 loaded cells in the chamber with 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, followed by the addition of 25 µM cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) (Cayman) into the imaging buffer. To determine cytosolic calcium levels after activating SOCE, cells were initially perfused with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free PSS containing 0.1 mM EGTA, followed by the addition of 25 µM CPA in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free PSS and subsequent addition of 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 25 µM CPA in PSS (without EGTA) to reestablish calcium influx. The emission signals corresponding to the 340 and 380 nm excitation were recorded, and the signals resulting from 340/380 nm excitation were calculated using the Meta Fluor software. The basal cytosolic calcium was defined as the 340/380 nm signal ratio before CPA treatment (measured over a 4-or 5-minute interval immediately before CPA addition). The fractional increase in cytosolic calcium levels after ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion with CPA was calculated as the difference between peak signal (single time point) and baseline (averaged over a 4-or 5-minute interval before CPA addition), as a ratio relative to the baseline. The fractional increase in cytosolic calcium after addition of 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and CPA was calculated as the difference between the peak signal following Ca<sup>2+</sup> and CPA addition (averaged over a 1-minute time interval following the peak signal) and the baseline (the signal averaged over a 0.8-1-minute interval immediately before the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and CPA addition) relative to the baseline. Total calcium release after ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion was reported as the total area under the curve (AUC). Fractional increases were calculated as (Peak-Baseline)/Baseline x 100. This was calculated as peak signals after CPA addition relative to the baseline before CPA (measured over a 4-or 5-minute interval immediately before CPA addition).</p>

<title>ER calcium measurements in HEK293T cells</title>
<p><italic>CALR</italic>-modified HEK cells were prepared as described in supplemental methods. Cells were transiently transfected with pCIS-GEM-CEPIA1er (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>); Addgene plasmid # 58217) using Fugene HD reagent (Promega). The transfected cells were harvested after 72 hours. Cells were washed twice with FACS buffer (PBS + 2% FBS) supplemented with 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and resuspended in the same FACS buffer. The live-dead stain 7-AAD (BD) was added at 1:200 dilution and the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using the BD LSRFortessa cell analyzer. The signal for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound GEM-CEPIA1er probe was recorded in the Pacific Blue channel (excitation at 405 nm and emission at 452-455 nm) and the signal for the unbound probe was recorded in the AmCyan channel (excitation at 405 and emission at 498 nm). The analysis of flow cytometry data was done in the FlowJo software (v10.10.00). The cells were gated based on the forward (FSC-A) and side scatter (SSC-A), followed by gating on the 7AAD-negative (live) cells, and subsequent gating on the cells positive for the expression of GEM-CEPIA1er probe measured in the Pacific Blue and AmCyan channels. Basal signals were initially recorded, followed by the addition of 5 µM thapsigargin (Tg) and subsequent recording of signals for the treated and untreated cells at four different time points between 2 – 10 minutes. The ratio of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the bound to the unbound signal was used for calculations.</p>

<title>RNA-sequencing</title>
<p>The parental and CRT-KO MEG-01 cells were grown in complete media for 12-18 hours before harvesting. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen). This was followed by poly-A selection and enrichment of mRNA using NEB Next Ultra Express RNA kit and a NEB Poly A kit (New England Biolabs). Sequencing was done on the NovaSeq at PE150, targeting 30-40 million reads/sample after cDNA library preparation. Data were pre-filtered to remove genes with 0 counts in all samples. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2. The differentially expressed genes were selected as those with a log2 fold-change of &lt;-0.49 or &gt;0.49 and p values &lt;0.05. The results from RNA sequencing were further analyzed in the iPathwayGuide to identify significantly altered proteins related to calcium signaling. The volcano plot was plotted in GraphPad Prism as Log2 fold-change (x-axis) <italic>vs.</italic> –Log10 adjusted p-value.</p>

<title>Real-time polymerase chain reaction</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) followed by synthesis of complementary DNA using the Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on the ABI 7500 FAST Real Time PCR machine (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) using the SYBR Green PCR Master mix (Applied Biosystems, UK) and gene-specific primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Measurement was done in technical duplicates. The expression of target genes was quantified using the 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method and normalized to the expression of either one or multiple endogenous control genes including beta-actin (ACTB), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1). The expression of the target gene in MEG-01 CRT-KO and wild type and CRT<sub>Del52</sub> reconstitution cells was further normalized to the mean expression of parental MEG-01 or CRT-KO-vec. The calculated relative mRNA transcript expression values (RQ) were plotted using GraphPad Prism.</p>

<title>MPN-linked CRT<sub>Del52</sub> retained at least some low affinity calcium binding sites</title>
<p>Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wijeyesakere et al., 2011</xref>) have implicated residues 340 to 351 of murine CRT, which are identical in wild-type human CRT and fully conserved with the 340 to 349 residues of CRT<sub>Del52</sub>, to be involved in low affinity calcium binding. Further truncation of the C-domain to the residue 339 (mCRT<sub>1-339</sub>) led to the loss of calcium binding measured by ITC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wijeyesakere et al., 2011</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows a sequence alignment of murine CRT, human CRT, CRT<sub>Ins5,</sub> and CRT<sub>Del52</sub> proteins and indicates that the residues previously implicated in low affinity calcium binding are also shared between wild-type CRT and CRT<sub>Del52</sub>.

<p>For the ITC measurements, calcium titrations were performed after pre-blocking the high affinity calcium binding sites with 50-100 µM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Similar binding profiles and properties were observed with wild-type CRT, CRT<sub>Del52,</sub> and the CRT<sub>(1-351)</sub> mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref>, C and D and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, consistent with previous studies with mCRT<sub>(1–339)</sub>, endothermic calcium binding by human CRT<sub>(1–339)</sub> was of lower magnitude compared to other constructs, with a K<sub>D</sub> value that was too low to be reliably fit, suggesting the loss of low affinity calcium binding sites in this mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). There are exothermic peaks observed with human CRT<sub>(1–339)</sub> at the beginning of the calcium titration, which may be attributed to altered low affinity sites retained within the mutant or reduced affinity of the high affinity sites. We concluded that CRT<sub>Del52</sub> retains low affinity calcium binding that is measurable by ITC.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Calreticulin is a ubiquitously expressed ER luminal calcium-binding chaperone, with a role in ER calcium storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Venkatesan et al., 2021b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Michalak, 2024</xref>). Previous studies using dye-based assays reported impaired calcium binding by the MPN-associated CRT<sub>Del52</sub> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ibarra et al., 2022</xref>). Yet direct and quantitative analyses of its calcium-binding properties have been lacking. In this study, we investigated low affinity calcium binding by wild-type human CRT, CRT<sub>Del52</sub>, and the truncation mutants CRT<sub>(1-351)</sub> and CRT<sub>(1-339)</sub> using ITC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Our studies show that wild-type CRT, CRT<sub>Del52,</sub> and CRT<sub>(1-351)</sub> retain low affinity calcium binding sites, exhibiting average K<sub>D</sub> values of 574.24, 938.82, and 444.34 µM, respectively. On the other hand, low affinity calcium binding by CRT<sub>(1-339)</sub> could not be reliably fit. This is the first quantitative characterization of the low affinity calcium binding profiles of wild-type human CRT, CRT<sub>Del52</sub>, and functionally informative truncation mutants.</p>
<p>Although CRT<sub>Del52</sub> retains at least partial low affinity calcium binding capability, loss of its KDEL retention sequence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) could still disrupt ER calcium storage and signaling. Interestingly, the cellular assays reveal that ER and cytosolic calcium levels, as well as SOCE, are similar between CRT-KO cells and those reconstituted with either wild-type CRT or CRT<sub>Del52</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4-6</xref>). One study has reported decreased ER calcium levels in a human osteosarcoma cell line expressing CRT<sub>Del52</sub> compared to those expressing wild-type CRT, following transient transfections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ibarra et al., 2022</xref>). The same study suggested the contributions of the P and C-domain of wild-type in restoring ER calcium levels in cells expressing CRT<sub>Del52</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ibarra et al., 2022</xref>). While the conditions of those experiments differ from the studies described here which use a CRT-KO background, our findings are consistent with the prediction that any excess free ER calcium generated in cells lacking CRT or sufficient ER calcium binding sites would rapidly diffuse out of the ER and be pumped out of the cell.</p>
<p>Related to cytosolic calcium levels and SOCE activation, consistent with our findings (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>), a previous study found no differences in cytosolic calcium levels or SOCE induction in myeloid progenitor 32D cells expressing wild-type CRT and CRT<sub>Del52</sub> both under conditions of cytokine deprivation and thrombopoietin (TPO) stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhuria et al., 2024</xref>). While cultured megakaryocytes from MPN patients with <italic>CALR</italic> mutations have SOCE abnormalities compared to healthy control cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pietra et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Di Buduo et al., 2020</xref>) sample to sample heterogeneities in primary cells make it difficult to attribute measured differences solely to calcium binding by CRT or its mutants.</p>
<p>We found that CRT-KO HEK cells displayed lower ER calcium compared with the parental HEK cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, left panel) and also that CRT-KO Meg-01 cells displayed increased cytosolic calcium in the absence of extracellular calcium (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). However, reconstitutions with wild-type CRT did not reverse these effects (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, right panel and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Transcriptomic analysis identified significant alterations in the expression of genes related to calcium storage and signaling between parental and CRT-KO Meg-01 cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). These changes highlight adaptive or compensatory pathways induced by CRT-KO and emphasize that, when comparing wild-type and CRT-KO cell lines for subcellular calcium levels or responses to SERCA inhibitors, the measured effects might not be based solely on the abilities of CRT to maintain ER and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels via its calcium binding, storage and buffering capacity. Rather, many other compensatory cellular changes could affect subcellular calcium levels and signaling. In this study, various ER proteins with known calcium binding activities were found to be upregulated in CRT-KO cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). GRP94 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Macer and Koch, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Biswas et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Marzec et al., 2012</xref>), BiP ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lievremont et al., 1997</xref>) and our unpublished findings), and PDIA6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Okumura et al., 2021</xref>) are each known to contain low affinity calcium binding sites. CRT-KO cells have significantly induced expression of the genes encoding these proteins. Wild type CRT reconstitution into the CRT-KO cells significantly reduced the expression of these ER proteins, whereas CRT<sub>Del52</sub> reconstitution only partly and non-significantly reduced expression of <italic>HSP90B1</italic> and <italic>PDIA6</italic> and did not reduce the expression of <italic>HSPA5</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7D-F</xref>). GRP94, BiP and PDIA6 have functions in ER protein folding and quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hendershot et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Okumura et al., 2021</xref>). It is known that CRT<sub>Del52</sub> has impaired chaperone activity towards its substrates compared with wild type CRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arshad and Cresswell, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Schurch et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kaur et al., 2025</xref>). This could account for some of these measured differences between wild type CRT and CRT<sub>Del52</sub> in altering the expression of the ER chaperones and folding factors. However, their induction in knock-in cells with heterozygous expression of wild type CRT and CRT<sub>Del52</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fosselteder et al., 2023</xref>), in which the expressed wild type CRT appears sufficient for multiple protein folding activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kaur et al., 2025</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Schurch et al., 2022</xref>) could point to compensatory effects relevant to calcium signaling. Regardless of the precise mechanisms relevant to induction of the calcium binding proteins, their combined expression, despite protein compositional differences between the KO and reconstituted cells, appears sufficient to maintain ER calcium levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, right panel), calcium release from the ER (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, right panel, and 5F) and cytosolic calcium levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>PDIA3 (ERp57) forms a complex with CRT and interacts with and regulates the activities of the ubiquitously expressed SERCA2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Li and Camacho, 2004</xref>). Its expression is also induced by the CRT-KO and suppressed by wild type CRT expression but non-significantly by CRT<sub>Del52</sub> expression. Altered SERCA2b activity could also affect basal ER calcium levels, contributing to similarities between CRT-KO, and wild type CRT or CRT<sub>Del52</sub> reconstituted cells.</p>
<p>Collectively, our findings reveal that CRT<sub>Del52</sub> retains some ability to bind calcium at low affinity sites. CRT-KO cells reconstituted with wild-type or CRT<sub>Del52</sub> have comparable ER and cytosolic calcium levels and store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). CRT-KO induces broad changes in ER calcium binding protein expression as well as in the expression of ERp57. Overall, we can conclude that a number of factors that contribute to the maintenance of ER calcium levels and regulation of calcium transport into the ER are altered in CRT-KO cells. Thus, any disease-related changes in calcium signaling and homeostasis are likely multifactorial, encompassing transcriptional regulation and altered expression of critical mediators of calcium storage, transport and signaling pathways. These studies provide a more nuanced understanding of CRT’s role in cellular calcium signaling and may inform future therapeutic strategies targeting calcium signaling pathways in hematological malignancies.</p>

<p>This study investigates low-affinity Ca2+ binding by WT calreticulin and mutant calreticulin associated with type I myeloproliferative neoplasms, as well as the impact on Ca2+ fluxes in suspension cultures of megakaryocyte-like cells in vitro in response to ER Ca2+ ATPase inhibitors that deplete endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ store and open plasma membrane Ca2+ channels through STIM1-Orai interactions. The results are <bold>important</bold> in that they show that Ca2+ binding by calreticulin and store-operated Ca2+ entry are not fundamentally impacted by the type I deletion mutation in calreticulin, which rules out a direct effect of the calreticulin mutation on its own low-affinity Ca2+ binding and any broad impact on ER Ca2+ regulation. The strength of the data and methods used ranges from <bold>solid</bold> to <bold>convincing</bold>, although the use of suspension-based flow cytometric assays to investigate ER Ca2+ levels and Ca2+ entry can be challenged. High-affinity Ca2+ binding sites could be further considered, and possible confounding effects of Abl kinase activity in the megakaryocyte-like cell lines could be offset.</p>

<p>The authors attempted to compare calcium calcium-binding properties of wildtype calreticulin with calreticulin deletion mutant (CRTDel52) associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms.</p>
<p>The researchers conducted their study using advanced techniques. They found almost no difference in calcium binding between the two proteins and observed no impact on calcium signaling, specifically store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). The study also noted an increase in ER luminal calcium-binding chaperone proteins. Surprisingly, the authors selected flow cytometry as a technique for measurements of ER luminal calcium. Considering the limitations of this approach, it would be better to use alternative approaches. This is particularly important as previous reports, using cells from MPN patients, indicate reduced ER luminal calcium and effects on SOCE (Blood, 2020). This issue matters because earlier research with MPN patient cells reported reduced ER luminal calcium levels and altered SOCE (Blood, 2020). How do the authors explain the difference between their results and previous findings about lower ER luminal calcium and changed SOCE in MPN patient cells expressing CRTDel52? Other studies have found that unfolded protein responses are activated in MPN cells with CRTDel52 calreticulin (see Blood, 2021), and increased UPR could account for higher levels of some ER-resident calcium-binding proteins observed here. Overall, it remains unclear how this work improves our understanding of MPN or clarifies calreticulin's role in MPN pathophysiology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Tagoe and colleagues present a thorough analysis of the calcium (Ca2+) binding capacity of calreticulin (CRT), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+-buffer protein, using a mutant version (CRT del52) found in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The authors use purified human CRT protein variants, CRT-KO cell lines, and an MPN cell line to elucidate the differing Ca2+ dynamics, both on the level of the protein and on cell-wide Ca2+-governed processes. In sum, the authors provide new insights into CRT that can be applied to both normal and malignant cell biology.</p>
<p>First, the authors purify CRT protein and perform isothermal titration calorimetry to quantify the Ca2+ binding capacity of CRT. They use full-length human CRT, CRT del52, and two truncations of CRT (1-339 and 1-351, the former of which should lead to the entire loss of low-affinity Ca2+ binding). While CRT del52 has previously been shown to lead to a decrease in Ca2+ binding affinity in other models, the ITC data show that this is retained in CRT del52.</p>
<p>Next, the authors utilize a CRT-KO cell line with subsequent addition of CRT protein variants to validate these findings with flow cytometric analysis. Cells were transfected with a ratiometric ER Ca2+ probe, and fluorescence indicates that CRT del52 is unable to restore basal ER Ca2+ levels to the same extent as CRT wild-type. To translate these findings to MPNs, the authors perform CRT-KO in a megakaryocytic cell line, where reconstitution with either CRT variant did not cause a difference in cytosolic calcium levels. The authors further test store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), an important process for maintaining ER Ca2+ levels, in these cells, and find that CRT-KO cells have lower SOCE activity, and that this can be slightly recovered with CRT addition.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors ask whether other effects of CRT-KO/reconstitution can affect the cellular Ca2+ signaling pathway and levels. RNASeq analysis revealed that CRT-KO leads to an increase in various chaperone protein expressions, and that reconstitution with CRT del52 is unable to reduce expression to the same extent as reconstitution with CRT wildtype.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provide new insights into CRT that can be applied to both normal and malignant cell biology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors should consider discussing the high-affinity Ca2+ binding site more in the introduction. Can they show a proof-of-concept experiment that validates that incubation of recombinant CRT reduces the function of that high-affinity Ca2+ binding site?</p>
<p>(2) For Figure 2B, do you have an explanation for why the purified proteins run higher than predicted (48-52kDa) - are these proteins still tagged with pGB1?</p>
<p>(3) The MEG-01 cell line has the BCR::ABL1 translocation, while CRT mutations are strictly found in BCR::ABL1 negative MPNs. Could these experiments be repeated in these cells treated with imatinib to decrease these effects, or see if basal MEG-01 Ca2+ levels/activity are changed with or without imatinib?</p>

<p>The flow cytometric assay shows good responsiveness to conditions expected to alter ER calcium levels (Figure 4C), is high throughput compared to microscopy, and allows for averaging of signals across a large number of cells. This was thus our original method of choice.</p>

How do the authors explain the difference between their results and previous findings about lower ER luminal calcium and changed SOCE in MPN patient cells expressing CRTDel52?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for asking for these clarifications. The referenced study (Di Buduo et al. Blood, 135(2):133-143, 2020) first showed that thrombopoietin induces spontaneous cytosolic calcium spikes in cultured megakaryocytes, which is dependent on store operated calcium entry (SOCE). In parallel, STIM1-ORAI interactions were induced by thrombopoietin. On the other hand, the addition of thrombopoietin caused the dissociation of STIM1-calreticulin interactions, based on proximity ligation assays. The implication is that signaling via the thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR/MPL) activation induces the dissociation of calreticulin-STIM1 complexes, and the formation of STIM1-ORAI complexes, which contribute to the measured spontaneous cytosolic calcium spikes. Different MPN mutations induced spontaneous calcium spikes in a thrombopoietin-independent manner, including the JAK2V617F mutations and the CALR type I and type II mutations. The study found that the number of megakaryocytes exhibiting spontaneous calcium spikes was enhanced in the context of both type I and type II CALR mutations compared to the JAK2V617F mutant. Correspondingly, the calreticulin-STIM1 interactions/cell were more significantly reduced for type I and type II CALR mutations compared to the JAK2V617F mutant. It was suggested that defective interactions between mutant calreticulin, ERp57, and STIM1 activated SOCE and generated spontaneous cytosolic calcium spikes. However, based on the findings with thrombopoietin, the spontaneous calcium spikes could simply result from thrombopoietin-independent MPL activation by the mutant calreticulin and JAK2V617F and downstream signaling. Importantly, the referenced studies did not directly measure ER luminal calcium. A number of undefined factors could account for the measured differences between the megakaryocytes from patients with calreticulin mutations vs. JAK2V617F. These include the relative mutant allele burdens, the extent of MPL activation, as well as genetic differences unrelated to calreticulin. Different from these experiments, through the use of purified proteins, our studies show that the Del52 mutant has calcium binding characteristics resembling that of the wild type protein. Additionally, through genetic manipulations in cell lines, our studies directly address the effects of calreticulin KO and its Del52 mutation upon ER luminal and cytosolic calcium levels, and cellular SOCE signals. We did not measure significant differences in any of these parameters between the KO cells and those reconstituted with wild type calreticulin or the Del52 mutant. As noted by the editors, these results show that Ca2+ binding by calreticulin and store-operated Ca2+ entry in a cell are not fundamentally impacted by the type I deletion mutation. On the other hand, in primary megakaryocytes, when co-expressed with MPL, the Del52 mutant, through its known ability to bind and activate TPOR/MPL, is expected to induce SOCE and calcium fluxes similar to those induced by thrombopoietin. These points will be clarified in the revised discussion.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Multiple studies have suggested the induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cells expressing MPN mutants of calreticulin.  We don’t know the specific signals that cause the upregulation of various calcium binding proteins in calreticulin-KO cells and cells expressing the Del52 mutant. Indeed, these could result from increased protein misfolding in cells with wild type calreticulin deficiency. Alternatively, the sensing of cellular calcium perturbations could induce their expression. Regardless of the precise mechanisms underlying the expression changes in calcium binding proteins, the upregulated factors are predicted to compensate for calreticulin deficiency and contribute to the maintenance of the overall cellular calcium homeostasis. These points will be clarified in the revised discussion.</p>

The authors use purified human CRT protein variants, CRT-KO cell lines, and an MPN cell line to elucidate the differing Ca2+ dynamics, both on the level of the protein and on cell-wide Ca2+-governed processes. In sum, the authors provide new insights into CRT that can be applied to both normal and malignant cell biology.</p>
<p>First, the authors purify CRT protein and perform isothermal titration calorimetry to quantify the Ca2+ binding capacity of CRT. They use full-length human CRT, CRT del52, and two truncations of CRT (1-339 and 1-351, the former of which should lead to the entire loss of low-affinity Ca2+ binding). While CRT del52 has previously been shown to lead to a decrease in Ca2+ binding affinity in other models, the ITC data show that this is retained in CRT del52.</p>
<p>Next, the authors utilize a CRT-KO cell line with subsequent addition of CRT protein variants to validate these findings with flow cytometric analysis. Cells were transfected with a ratiometric ER Ca2+ probe, and fluorescence indicates that CRT del52 is unable to restore basal ER Ca2+ levels to the same extent as CRT wild-type. To translate these findings to MPNs, the authors perform CRT-KO in a megakaryocytic cell line, where reconstitution with either CRT variant did not cause a difference in cytosolic calcium levels. The authors further test store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), an important process for maintaining ER Ca2+ levels, in these cells, and find that CRT-KO cells have lower SOCE activity, and that this can be slightly recovered with CRT addition.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors ask whether other effects of CRT-KO/reconstitution can affect the cellular Ca2+ signaling pathway and levels. RNASeq analysis revealed that CRT-KO leads to an increase in various chaperone protein expressions, and that reconstitution with CRT del52 is unable to reduce expression to the same extent as reconstitution with CRT wildtype.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors should consider discussing the high-affinity Ca2+ binding site more in the introduction. Can they show a proof-of-concept experiment that validates that incubation of recombinant CRT reduces the function of that high-affinity Ca2+ binding site?</p>

<p>In a previous study (Wijeyesakere et al. 2011 J. Biol Chem, 286 8771-8785), we showed that at a starting calcium concentration of 0 mM and with 3.3 mM injections of CaCl<sub>2</sub>, the measured K<sub>D</sub> value was 16.6 mM for calcium binding to wild type murine calreticulin, (which has  ~95% % sequence identity with human calreticulin), corresponding to the high affinity site. On the other hand, at a starting calcium concentration of 50 mM and with 33 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>  injections, the measured K<sub>D</sub> value for calcium binding to wild type murine calreticulin was 590 mM (corresponding to the low affinity sites). Thus, we did not measure the high affinity sites when the starting calcium concentration was 50 mM. This point will be clarified in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(2) For Figure 2B, do you have an explanation for why the purified proteins run higher than predicted (48-52kDa) - are these proteins still tagged with pGB1?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, the purified proteins shown in Figure 2B retained a GB1 tag. This point will be clarified in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(3) The MEG-01 cell line has the BCR:ABL1 translocation, while CRT mutations are strictly found in BCR:ABL1 negative MPNs. Could these experiments be repeated in these cells treated with imatinib to decrease these effects, or see if basal MEG-01 Ca2+ levels/activity are changed with or without imatinib?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the important point. We will assess cytosolic calcium levels in MEG-01 cells with or without imatinib.</p>
