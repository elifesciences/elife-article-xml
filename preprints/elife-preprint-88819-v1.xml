<title>Abstract</title><p>The functional complementarity of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and optokinetic reflex (OKR) allows for optimal combined gaze stabilization responses (CGR) in light. While sensory substitution has been reported following complete vestibular loss, the capacity of the central vestibular system to compensate for partial peripheral vestibular loss remains to be determined. Here, we first demonstrate the efficacy of a 6-week subchronic ototoxic protocol in inducing transient and partial vestibular loss which equally affects the canal- and otolith-dependent VORs. Immunostaining of hair cells in the vestibular sensory epithelia revealed that organ-specific alteration of type I, but not type II, hair cells correlates with functional impairments. The decrease in VOR performance is paralleled with an increase in the gain of the OKR occurring in a specific range of frequencies where VOR normally dominates gaze stabilization, compatible with a sensory substitution process. Comparison of unimodal OKR or VOR versus bimodal CGR revealed that visuo-vestibular interactions remain reduced despite a significant recovery in the VOR. Modeling and sweep-based analysis revealed that the differential capacity to optimally combine OKR and VOR correlates with the reproducibility of the VOR responses. Overall, these results shed light on the multisensory reweighting occurring in pathologies with fluctuating peripheral vestibular malfunction.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The vestibular system is well-preserved amongst vertebrates, participating in essential functions such as balance, postural control and, together with the optokinetic system, gaze stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Straka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wibble et al., 2022</xref>). Beyond these recognized roles, vestibular signals also contribute to cognitive processes e.g spatial orientation and navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cullen, 2019</xref>), or body representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lopez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Facchini et al., 2021</xref>). Because of its involvement in many basic functions important in our daily life, vestibular pathologies affecting the inner ear are associated with a significant deterioration of the well-being of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Möhwald et al., 2020</xref>) and represent an important public health concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agrawal et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on post-lesion plasticity following permanent vestibular loss has shed light on the neural plastic mechanisms that follow a chronic unilateral or bilateral vestibular lesion, a process referred as “vestibular compensation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brandt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Cullen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beraneck and Idoux, 2012</xref>). The compensation taking place after the lesion is known to involve dynamical multisensory reweighting of proprioceptive and visual inputs and of internal efferent copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Cullen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sadeghi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sadeghi and Beraneck, 2020</xref>). While total and permanent lesions offer the experimental opportunity to characterize drastic cellular and molecular changes triggered by the total silencing of the vestibular endorgans, they imperfectly mimic clinical situations where peripheral vestibular function loss is only partial and/or transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bisdorff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lopez-Escamez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brandt and Dieterich, 2017</xref>). To better model fluctuating inner ear function, protocols based on subchronic exposure to an ototoxic substance, 3,3ʹ-iminodiproprionitrile (IDPN) were first introduced in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Seoane et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sedó-Cabezón et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Martins-Lopes et al., 2019a</xref>) and more recently in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Greguske et al., 2019</xref>). Subchronic exposure to IDPN in drinking water at low doses allowed for progressive ototoxicity, leading to a partial and reversible loss of function. Although the subchronic IDPN protocol was shown to cause postural and locomotor deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Martins-Lopes et al., 2019a</xref>), its effects on the gaze stabilizing reflexes, namely the vestibulo-ocular and optokinetic reflexes, have not yet been described. The primary objective of the present study is first to assess how subchronic exposure to IDPN may affect the function of the different vestibular endorgans. To that end, we took advantage of our recently described methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Simon et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">2021</xref>) using canal-specific and otolith-specific tests. Quantification of the vestibulo-ocular reflexes is a sensitive and specific method to assess the functionality of the sensory-motor vestibular pathway; it is the most used test in clinics, and highly correlates to quality-of-life reports in patients suffering from acute peripheral diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Möhwald et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The secondary objective is to determine whether visual substitution occurs following transient and partial vestibular loss. Optogenetic stimulation of the vestibular pathway demonstrated the recruitment of circuits involved in visual processing at the midbrain, thalamic and cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Leong et al., 2019</xref>). Recent imaging studies in rodents have shown that acute vestibular loss triggers brain-wide adaptive plasticity in circuits known to be involved in visual processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zwergal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Grosch et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, it was previously shown that OKR plasticity is triggered during vestibular compensation following a permanent vestibular lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Faulstich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Nelson et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>We report that 6 weeks of IDPN subchronic treatment affects both the canal- and otolith-dependent vestibulo-ocular reflexes and that organ-specific loss of type I HC correlates with individual mice’s impairments. We show that optokinetic adaptive compensation is frequency-specific and delayed with respect to the VOR changes. OKR changes occur at the frequencies where physiologically the vestibular inputs dominate visuo-vestibular gaze stabilization. We demonstrate that despite the functional recovery of their vestibulo-ocular reflexes, the visuo-vestibular integration remains impaired in some IDPN-treated mice. We suggest that the “noisiness” of the recovered vestibular signal affects their capacity to optimally combine visual and vestibular responses. Overall, these results shed light on the dynamic of multisensory reweighting in patients suffering from fluctuating peripheral vestibular malfunction.</p>

<title>Effects of the subchronic treatment of IDPN on the canal- and otolith-dependent VOR</title>
<p>To investigate the effects of the IDPN on vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VOR), animals were exposed to the ototoxic compound in the drinking water for six weeks (Treatment period), followed by 6 weeks of standard drinking water without IDPN (Washout period). The vestibulo-ocular reflexes were quantified every two weeks using canal-specific and otolith-specific tests. Horizontal sinusoidal rotations in the dark were performed and oculomotor responses were recorded using video-oculography (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) to study the impact of IDPN treatment on the canal-dependent angular VOR (aVOR). Typical raw aVOR traces are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>. At W6 the amplitude of the eye movements was distinctly reduced compared to W0, while at W12 the amplitude of the response appeared partially restored. The dynamics of decrease and recovery of the mean aVOR gain over the course of the protocol are reported in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> for both IDPN (n=21) and SHAM (n=22) groups. The evolution over time of the aVOR gain is significantly different for the two groups of mice (ANOVA Weeks x Group interaction, F(6,246)=29,949, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>). Before treatment, both groups responded similarly to the sinusoidal stimulations and their aVOR gain remained unchanged until 2 weeks of treatment (W2). However, starting W4 the aVOR gain of IDPN group significantly decreased with respect to W0 (Newman-Keuls post hoc test: IDPN W0 vs W4 p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>) and was significantly lower compared with the SHAM group (W4, IDPN vs SHAM p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>). The aVOR gain of the IDPN group remained lower compared to SHAM through the rest of the protocol (W6 IDPN vs SHAM p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>., W8 IDPN vs SHAM p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>, W10 IDPN vs SHAM p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>, W12 IDPN vs SHAM p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>) with a minimum reached at W6 corresponding to ~2/3 of aVOR loss (IDPN W4 vs W6 p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>, IDPN W6 vs W8 p=0,043762). At the end of the six weeks of washout, the mean aVOR significantly improved (IDPN W6 vs W12 p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>) to levels observed at W4 (IDPN W4 vs W12 p=0.561969).</p>

<p>VOR gain decrease was paralleled with significant phase leads that affected all tested frequencies at week 6 (Supplementary Figure 1B, ANOVA repeated measures Weeks x Group Interactions F(6, 246)=14.528, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>). Overall, canalar responses remained unaffected until week 2, but the amplitude and/or timing of the aVOR was abnormal from week 4 until the end of the protocol, despite a significant recovery of angular VOR responses observed during the washout period.</p>
<p>To determine whether otolith-dependent VOR was also affected by IDPN treatment, ocular-counter roll responses were tested during static lateral inclination in the range ±40° (OCR; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Examples of raw traces and quantification of the response are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, and mean gain of the OCR of each group is plotted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> (n=13 IDPN, n=14 SHAM). The modulations of responses amplitude were significantly different between IDPN and SHAM groups (ANOVA repeated measures Weeks x Group Interaction F(6, 150)= 7.7411 p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>). We note that there was a significant difference between SHAM and IDPN during the initial measurements at W0, before any treatment. However, at this timepoint mice were not yet separated into different groups. This incidental difference completely disappeared on the measurement performed at W2 (W2 IDPN vs SHAM p=0.8135). While the gain of the SHAM group stays in a 0.5-0.6 range over the whole duration of the protocol, the responses of the IDPN group significantly decreased at W4 compared to the SHAM group (W4 IDPN vs SHAM p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>). This decrease was larger at W6 (IDPN W4 vs W6 p=0.023) and stayed significantly different from the SHAM group until W8. At W10 and W12, the OCR of IDPN group recovered to a level comparable to the SHAM group (W10 IDPN vs SHAM p=0.1262, W12 IPDN vs SHAM p=0.3385).</p>
<p>Sub-chronic treatment of IDPN was also investigated through the dynamic Off Vertical Axis Rotation (OVAR) test (Supplementary Figure 1C), which primarily reflects maculo-ocular (dominantly otolithic) responses integrated by central vestibular pathways. The maculo-ocular reflex (MOR) bias decreased significantly compared to the SHAM group (ANOVA Weeks x Group, F(6, 132)= 10.076, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>) starting W2 of treatment (W2 IDPN vs SHAM p=0.0018), demonstrating that ototoxicity already affected the vestibular system at this early time point. The maximal decrease was reached at W6 (W6 IDPN vs SHAM p=0.00012) and recovery led to normal responses at W12 (W12 IDPN vs SHAM p=0.4709).</p>

<title>Comparison of otolith- and canal-dependent plasticity in individuals</title>
<p>To compare the dynamic of canal- and otolith-dependent VOR alterations, the paired VOR and OCR gains measured in individuals from the IDPN group (n=13) are plotted together (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Alteration in canal- and otolith-dependent responses followed a very similar time course (OCR vs aVOR at 1HZ on <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>; similar patterns were obtained with the other tested frequencies (not shown)).</p>

</fig>
<p>To investigate further the organ-specific responses, the individual values of VOR gain at 1Hz (left panel) and OCR slope (right panel) are plotted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>. These plots show the variability of the responses observed in different individuals. 2/3 of the mice had aVOR responses lowered by more than 50%, while 1/3 had milder aVOR impairments. In most cases, however, the aVOR gain decreased notably between W4 and W6 and started to recover from W8 (compare individual slopes in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Similarly, OCR gains were variable between individuals. However, the dynamic of the variations in otolith-dependent responses followed a pattern comparable to that of the canal-dependent changes.</p>
<p>To determine whether the changes in canal- and otolith-dependent responses were proportional, individual variations in gain since pre-treatment of the aVOR and OCR were compared at W6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) and W12 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). At W6, there was a significant correlation between the amplitude of the changes observed in aVOR and OCR, such that canalar and otolithic loss of function was proportional (slope of regression line: 0.5586). Despite the general recovery, this significant correlation was preserved at W12: the recovery in canal-dependent responses was proportional to the recovery in otolith-dependent responses (slope of regression line: 0.5566). Overall, these results suggest that the subchronic IDPN treatment similarly affects the vestibulo-ocular reflexes that depend on semi-circular canals and on the otolithic organs, respectively.</p>

<title>Effects of the IDPN exposure on the number of hair cells in the vestibular epithelia</title>
<p>To correlate the vestibular loss of function to the structural changes induced by the ototoxic compound, vestibular epithelia were dissected and labelled to assess the number of hair cells (HC) in the organs. One horizontal semi-circular canal and one utricule were harvested at W6 for n=7 IDPN and n=4 SHAM, and at W12 for n=8 IDPN and n=4 SHAM, and each organ epithelium was divided into the central and peripheral region to differentiate the possible participation of zone- and organ-specific HC to the vestibular function. Vestibular HC were labelled with type-specific immunomarkers in both endorgans (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Confocal Immunostaining data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A1</xref> for the horizontal semi-circular canals and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B1</xref> for the utricule. 6-week long treatment of IDPN exposure led to a significant reduction in the labelling of type I HC in the canal crista (quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A2</xref>, Non parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, SHAM vs IDPN Spp1, p=0.0322; SHAM vs IDPN Caspr1, p=0.0268; Supplementary Figure 2A1 and B1 for the peripheral zones) and in the otolith macula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B2</xref>, Non parametric Kruskal Wallis test SHAM vs IDPN Spp1, p=0.0279; SHAM vs IDPN Caspr1, p=0.0343). However, the treatment did not alter type II HC-specific labelling as the number of Calre+ cells in the IDPN group was similar to the SHAM in all regions of either vestibular endorgans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A2</xref>, canal crista, Calre: Non parametric Kruskal-Wallis test IDPN vs SHAM, p&gt;0.9999; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B2</xref>, otolith macula, Calre: SHAM vs IDPN, p&gt;0.9999). Importantly, the total number of HC marked with Myo7a (labelling both type I and type II HC) was not significantly different between the IDPN-treated mice and the SHAM, suggesting that the alteration of type I HC is not associated with cell loss. Moreover, at W12 the number of type I HC labelled in the IDPN-treated mice was no longer significantly different from the SHAM group in either endorgans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A3</xref> for crista; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B3</xref> for macula). The count of type II-specific markers and of non-specific HC markers was not statistically different between SHAM and IDPN either, so that overall no difference persisted at W12, indicating a structural recovery at the end of the washout period.</p>

<p>To determine how the loss of HC correlates with organ-specific functional tests, the numbers of type I and II HC in the central region of the horizontal semi-circular canals are plotted as a function of the mean aVOR gain for mice at W6 and W12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C1</xref>). Both markers of type I HC (Caspr1 and Spp1, left panels) were significantly correlated with the aVOR gain (linear regression, Spp1: r<sup>2</sup>=0.5128, p=0.0001; Caspr1: r<sup>2</sup>=0.4948, p=0.0002) whereas the rather constant number of type II HC in the ampulla did not correlate with the variation observed in aVOR function. Finally, to determine if the correlation was due to the recovery occurring between W6 and W12, the number of CASPR+ cells of IDPN mice counted at W12 are plotted as a function either of the individual aVOR gain at W12 (pink squares) or aVOR gain at W6 (black circles), paired by an arrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C2</xref>). The recovery of the vestibular function between W6 and W12 induces a shift toward the W12 linear regression, reinforcing the notion that the recovery of function was related to the increase in the number of hair cells with normal expression of biochemical markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B3 &amp; 3C2</xref>).</p>
<p>The numbers of type I HC and II HC found in the striolar region of the utricule are similarly plotted in relation to the OCR gain (linear regression, Spp1: r<sup>2</sup>=0.6011, p&lt;0.0001; Caspr1: r<sup>2</sup>=0.6342, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C3</xref>). Again, the otolithic function correlated with the number of type I HC, and not type II HC in the central region. Furthermore, the correlation found between the otolithic function and the number of type I HC related to the increase in the number of hair cells after the recovery period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C4</xref>). A similar correlation between organ-specific function and the number of type I HC was also found in the peripheral regions of these organs (see Supplementary Figure 2C1, C2 for the SCC, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D1, D2</xref> for the utricule).</p>
<p>Taken together, comparison at W6 and W12 of non-specific HC and type I-specific HC markers suggest that the ototoxic effect induces a transient biochemical alteration of type I HC rather than a definitive hair cell degeneration. Overall, IDPN-induced alteration of canal and otolith functions are correlated with the ototoxic effect on type I, and not type II, HC in the central and peripheral zones of vestibular endorgans.</p>

<p>To determine whether this OKR modulation was frequency-specific, the gain of the 5 tested frequencies was compared for W0, W6, W8 and W12 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). There was at W0 no difference between SHAM and IDPN mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, left panel, W0). At W6, there was a significant difference between the IDPN and SHAM groups limited to 0.5 and 1Hz (W6 IDPN vs. SHAM, 0.5Hz, p=0.013117; W6 IDPN vs. SHAM, 1Hz, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>). At W8, all frequencies above 0.2Hz were significantly increased compared to the SHAM group (W8 IDPN vs. SHAM, 0.33Hz, p=0.027687; 0.5Hz, p=0.0025; 1Hz, p=0.00015). At W12, the gain remained high for both 0.5 and 1Hz whereas the gain at 0.33Hz was no longer significantly larger than the SHAM group (W12 IDPN vs. SHAM, 0.33Hz, ns; 0.5Hz, p=0.0069; 1Hz, p=0.00078). Globally, responses at higher frequencies (0.33, 0.5 and 1 Hz) were significantly increased (ANOVA Weeks x Group x Frequencies interaction, F(24, 528)=6.5870, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>) whereas responses at the lowest frequencies (0.1 and 0.2Hz) were not significantly modulated. Additionally, these changes in gain for frequencies &gt;0.2Hz were not accompanied by changes in the timing (phase) of the OKR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) (ANOVA, Weeks x Group x Frequencies interaction, p=0.3802).</p>

<title>Relation between VOR decrease and optokinetic increase</title>
<p>To correlate the changes in vestibular pathway with the frequency-specific changes observed in the optokinetic pathway, we compared the responses in aVOR and OKR obtained at the frequencies that were common between the 2 tests (i.e 0.2 Hz, 0.5 Hz and 1Hz) for n=12 SHAM and n=12 IDPN treated mice by comparing the increase in the OKR and decrease in VOR relative to W0 (Δmean gain, see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). To determine whether the changes in VOR and OKR were proportional, we compared the paired decrease and increase in the mean ΔaVOR and ΔOKR gain after 8 weeks of treatment, when the difference between the 2 reflexes peaked (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The vast majority (n=11/12) of IDPN-treated mice showed a decrease in aVOR and an increase in OKR (top left quadrant corner, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), which was not the case for SHAM mice (blue squares). However, there was no correlation between the amplitude of the VOR decrease and the amplitude of the OKR increase, i.e mice that had the greatest VOR loss did not show the largest OKR increase (slope in the regression line: 0.27, p=0.0834).</p>

<p>To determine whether the parallel changes in OKR and VOR are frequency-specific, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> compares the gains measured at W0 and W8 for each frequency. At 0.2Hz, there was a significant decrease in aVOR (IDPN W0 vs. W8 0.2Hz p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>), however the OKR was not modified. On the other hand, at 0.5 and 1 Hz significant VOR decreases (IDPN W0 vs. W8, 0.5Hz, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>; 1Hz, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>) were accompanied by a significant OKR increase (IDPN W0 vs. W8, 0.5Hz, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>; 1Hz, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>). To examine this frequency-selective increase, the percentage of change in the OKR gain is plotted as a function of the <italic>vestibular weight</italic>, determined as the ratio between the aVOR and aVOR+OKR values at week 0. The <italic>vestibular weight</italic> therefore represents the frequency-dependent relative influence of the vestibular signal on gaze stabilization. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> shows that at week 8, the change in the OKR occurred at the frequencies for which the <italic>vestibular weight</italic> is dominant (&gt;50%), and that the increase in OKR was positively correlated with the <italic>vestibular weight</italic> among frequencies (slope of the regression line: 1.235, r²=0.6299, p&lt;0.0001). Overall, these results suggest that the increase in OKR gain observed at high frequencies could correspond to a “visual substitution” occurring primarily in the range where the vestibular inputs are normally dominating gaze stabilization.</p>

<title>Visuo-vestibular interactions following alteration of vestibular inputs</title>
<p>To investigate whether OKR increase did constitute a “visual substitution” that maintained optimal gaze stabilization at light despite vestibular loss, we investigated how IDPN-treated mice integrated vestibular and visual inputs. To this end, a session of combined visual and vestibular stimulation (aVOR in light, here referred as <italic>Combined Gaze Response</italic> or CGR condition) was performed at W6 and at W12 (n=19 IDPN; n=12 SHAM). A model (see methods) was implemented to predict the theoretical CGR (visuo-vestibular) gain and phase from aVOR and OKR (unimodal) measured values. The model was first optimized to correctly predict the average SHAM CGR gains and phases (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) from their individual aVOR and OKR responses, and then applied to the individual IDPN. The predicted and observed CGR gain (Model factor) were compared for each treatment group (ANOVA Group x Model, F(1,29)= 12.236, p=0.0013): as expected, model predictions for SHAM well-matched experimental data (Post-hoc Newman-keuls, SHAM MODEL vs SHAM CGR, p=0.41). When applied to IDPN mice the model predicted that their CGR gain should be lower compared to SHAM (shaded blue and red areas on <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>, Post-hoc Newman-keuls, SHAM MODEL vs IDPN MODEL, p=0.00176), suggesting that even an optimal combination of unimodal responses could not restore completely normal CGR in IDPN-treated mice. The CGR gains observed for IDPN-treated mice actually revealed how their visuo-vestibular responses were not only reduced compared to SHAM (compare solid blue and red lines in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref>, Post-hoc Newman-keuls, SHAM CGR vs IDPN CGR, p=0.00055), but were even inferior to the prediction of the model (compare solid red line and shaded red area in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, Post-hoc Newman-keuls, IDPN MODEL vs IDPN CGR, p=0.00041). This suggests that the IDPN-treated mice sub-optimally combined their residual/compensated vestibular and visual reflexes to stabilize gaze. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> illustrates the relationship between the measured CGR gain and the prediction of the model for all tested frequencies. For SHAM animals, CGR gain values were positioned along the unity line that represents a close match between predicted and measured CGR (mean±SEM: SHAM MODEL 0.8255±0.053; SHAM CGR 0.8375±0.042). For IDPN-treated mice, the responses formed 2 subgroups that did not correspond to different frequencies (all frequencies found in either subgroup). The first subgroup was intermingled with the SHAM responses, with measured CGR values slightly lower than predicted values (MODEL 0.7457±0.028; CGR 0.6644±0.052). The second subgroup represented mice for which the measured CGR significantly underperformed the predicted CGR (MODEL 0.4685±0.022; CGR 0.2005±0.01). To investigate the difference between the two subgroups, the VOR, OKR and CGR values were plotted for the n=19 IDPN mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). A hierarchical cluster analysis (see methods) suggested the presence of two main clusters (see dendrogram in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). The first cluster (Δ+, n=12; in green in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D, E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">F</xref>) comprised individuals with CGR values higher than OKR (positive values on Δ=CGR-OKR), i.e with gaze stabilization at light better in the presence of vestibular stimulation. The second cluster (Δ-, n=7; depicted in orange) is composed of individuals with low CGR (&lt;0.4). IDPN mice from the Δ-cluster have degraded responses during bimodal visuo-vestibular stimulation compared to unimodal OKR stimulation (negative value of Δ indicates CGR responses lower than OKR responses). Notably, this degraded CGR is not solely a consequence of a low VOR gain, as some Δ+ mice identified by the second differentiation of the clustering analyses (depicted with grey diamond symbols in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, and indicated as Δ+<sub>(-)</sub>) also showed low unimodal VOR gain responses.</p>

<p>We reasoned that the worsening of the gaze responses in the bimodal condition compared to the OKR-only condition could be a consequence of a poorly reliable, noisy vestibular signal. Based on a cycle-to-cycle sweep analysis, two additional features of the VOR responses were quantified (see methods): the mean amplitude of the raw sweep during VOR stimulation and the VOR response reproducibility between sweeps. The mean VOR raw sweep amplitude could not statistically differentiate Δ- and Δ+<sub>(-)</sub> mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>, orange triangle vs green diamonds p=0.0857), suggesting that vestibular signal of comparable amplitude improved or deteriorated the CGR response in the Δ+<sub>(-)</sub> and Δ-mice, respectively. On the other hand, the VOR reproducibility clearly discriminated Δ- and Δ+<sub>(-)</sub> mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>, orange triangle vs green diamonds, p=0.0001). There was a strong correlation between the inter-sweep reproducibility and the capacity of the mice to stabilize gaze in presence of vestibular inputs at light. This result suggests that the incapacity of the Δ-group to compute optokinetic signals in the presence of vestibular stimulation could relate to the poor reliability of the vestibular signal. Overall, these data suggest that in some situations the presence of a degraded vestibular signal of significant amplitude (panel 6E) but poorly reliable (panel 6F) can be detrimental to properly stabilize gaze in presence of visual and vestibular inputs.</p>

<title>IDPN as a model of partial and transitory loss of vestibular function</title>
<p>IDPN has long been established as an ototoxic compound targeting vestibular HC in the different vestibular endorgans of rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Llorens et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Llorens and Demêmes, 1994</xref>) and later in guinea-pig, frogs and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Soler-Martin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Greguske et al., 2019</xref>). Its ototoxic vestibular effects were used as a tool to study extraocular muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Brueckner et al., 1999</xref>) or more recently to induce permanent vestibular loss in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zeng et al., 2020</xref>) and study hair cell regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sayyid et al., 2019</xref>). The sub-chronic, reversible protocol used in our study was validated previously in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sedó-Cabezón et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Martins-Lopes et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Maroto et al., 2021</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boadas-Vaello et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Greguske et al., 2019</xref>) with postural/locomotor quantification of vestibular loss. We for the first time demonstrate that the subchronic protocol leads to a progressive and reversible loss of vestibulo-ocular reflexes. These previous studies further demonstrated some of the cellular mechanisms associated with the progressive loss of postural control: ototoxic effects lead to the early dismantlement of calyceal junction, followed by synaptic uncoupling, both of which were shown to be reversible, while continuation of the IDPN treatment would lead to hair cell extrusion and long-term, permanent lesion. Hair cell loss was also demonstrated to occur in a central to peripheral order within vestibular epithelia, and in crista to utricule to saccule order (see Sedó-Cabezon et al. 2015). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Greguske et al. (2019)</xref> convincingly demonstrated that type I HC show greater sensitivity than type II HC to IDPN subchronic exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Maroto et al. 2021</xref>). Given these data, a primary goal of the present study was to try to correlate the loss of VOR functions to organ-specific, zone-specific, and cell-type-specific effects.</p>
<p>Loss and substantial recovery of the vestibular function quantified by VOR measures were found to be correlated with the number of type I HC in both canals and otoliths. A parallel was previously established between hair cell integrity and VOR following ototoxic protocols in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cassel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zeng et al., 2020</xref>), but these were established at the population level. Here, we for the first time specifically correlated the loss of hair cells and loss of VOR function both at the individual level and in an organ-specific way. aVOR and OCR tests demonstrated a parallel decrease in canal- and otolith-dependent functions, respectively. The 6 week-long treatment was followed by a 6 week-washout period, allowing a significant but partial recovery of the aVOR, and complete recovery of the OCR. The individual correlations between these functional tests and the number of hair cells counted in the ampullae and maculae of the mice were found to be particularly significant, both during the trough (W6) of VOR function and after the recovery period (W12) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>,). We, however, did not find any difference between the hair cell loss in the central vs. peripheral zones of the organs, and can therefore not conclude on any putatively differential implication of these areas in the VORs. Overall, these organ-specific structure-function correlations confirm that the vestibulo-ocular reflex can serve as a proxy indicating the status of the vestibular endorgans. It further validates the use of the aVOR and OCR as relevant tests reflecting hair cell integrity at the level of the ampullae and maculae, respectively.</p>

<title>Differential alteration of type I versus type II hair cells</title>
<p>The subchronic treatment affected type I HC more than type II HC, in accordance with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Llorens et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Maroto et al. 2021</xref>). Susceptibility to IDPN was also reported to vary between different mouse strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boadas-Vaello et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wilkerson et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, we used a different strain of mice than the one used in a previous subchronic experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Greguske et al. 2019</xref>) and have not observed any type II hair cell loss either, nor differences between males and females (data not shown).</p>
<p>Hence, IDPN treatment induces a loss of cell markers specific to type I HC, with no effects on type II markers. Two types of markers were used to identify type I HC. Spp1 targeted a protein located on the neck of the hair cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">McInturff et al., 2018</xref>), while Caspr1 is located at the calyceal junction of the afferent terminal, and has been proven to be necessary for the functionality of the synapse between the hair cell and its connected afferent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Sousa et al., 2009</xref>). Though it is not possible to compare for one individual the number of cells before and after treatment, the number of cells labelled for either of these proteins decreased significantly compared to SHAM group, whose numbers are consistent between W6 and W12. The loss of Caspr1 marker induced by IDPN sub-chronic treatment has been linked to hair cell detachment from the calyx terminal and loss of vestibulo-spinal reflexes, and both Caspr1 expression and vestibular function recover during washout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sedó-Cabezón et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Greguske et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Maroto et al., 2021</xref>). Only after a longer IDPN exposure does hair cell extrusion occur, associated with persistent functional deficits. In theory, the loss of vestibular function observed in both canal- and otolith-dependent VOR at W6 could be linked to loss of type I HC. In adult rodents, however, the regeneration of hair cells leads to the formation of cells with type II HC features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">González-Calvo et al., 2021</xref>), so the recovery of type I cellular markers at W12 is likely not a result of cell regeneration. Also, the apparent dramatic loss of Caspr1 and Spp1 HC (90%) at W6 was in contrast with the much smaller and not significant loss in Myo7a cells (29%), supporting the conclusion that the sensory cells persisted in the epithelium despite Caspr1 loss, and that the recovery in the number of type I HC observed at W12 was more likely the result of molecular repair, not cell regeneration. In addition, we observed a similar loss of Spp1 marker at W6, normally located in the neck of the hair cell. As such the loss of vestibular function could rather be attributed to a global disorganization of the synapse and defective hair cell function, associated with a transitory large decrease of the Spp1 and CASPR1 proteins and a smaller decrease in Myo7a. In accordance with this hypothesis, the number of Spp1 and Caspr1 positive cells after the washout period at W12 was not significantly different from the SHAM group and correlated to the recovery of the vestibular function observed at W12 for the IDPN mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C2</xref>). The altered expression of proteins in type I HC induced by the sub-chronic treatment of IDPN seems to be reversible in most individuals. One possibility is that definitive extrusion of type I HC occurred in the most susceptible individuals that did not show recovery after the end of treatment. This in fact was the case in the 2 individuals tested at W12 with immuno-histochemistry: CASPR mean value (±S.E.M) of 18.5±5.5 compared to 34.5±4.359 for IDPN with recovery and 41.75±1.215 for SHAM). It was previously reported in the pigeon that type I HC and calyx afferents take longer (12 weeks) to regenerate following aminoglycoside toxicity, while type II and boutons endings regenerated in a week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zakir and Dickman, 2006</xref>). Similarly, recovered innervation for type I HC was delayed compared to type II HC in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). A longer recovery period could be investigated in the case of the severely-affected mice to confirm the absence of recovery in the longer term.</p>

<title>Evidence for the role of type I hair cells in the vestibulo-ocular pathways</title>
<p>To our knowledge, the direct implication of type I and type II HC in the VOR was never directly tested. Type I and type II HC differ by many features, including their anatomical location within the epithelium, electrophysiological properties, morphology and innervation by afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Eatock and Songer, 2011</xref>). Seemingly, irregular afferents have been described as predominantly innervating the central area and striolar zones of the ampullae and maculae with calyx and dimorphic synaptic contacts, while regular afferents make dimorphic and buttons contacts predominantly within the peripheral zones of cristae and extrastriolar zones of maculae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Goldberg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Eatock and Songer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Contini et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Functionally, regular afferents recorded in the monkey show a lower detection threshold than irregular afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sadeghi et al., 2007</xref>), while irregular afferents show higher gains and phase leads (mouse: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lasker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cullen, 2019</xref>), and would be better optimized for encoding high dynamic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cullen, 2019</xref>). Seminal studies have suggested that irregular afferents would constitute ~1/3 of the excitatory drive received by central neurons responsible for the VOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Highstein et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Boyle et al., 1991</xref>), and functional ablation targeting irregular afferents that VOR might function normally with only regular afferent inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Minor and Goldberg, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on these data, it would be tempting to infer that only the most regular and tonic elements of the vestibular periphery are responsible for the VOR. However, the correspondence between hair cell properties and afferents properties is only partial, such that the two phasic/irregular and tonic/regular channels for head motion signals are constituted of both types of hair cells and afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Eatock and Songer 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beraneck and Straka, 2011</xref>). It has also been recently shown that both types of hair cells contribute to vestibular evoked potential responses, previously described as mostly type I-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sayyid et al, 2019</xref>). Our data further contradict such a simplified scheme as the VOR is severely affected by the specific loss of type I HC in both central and peripheral parts of the vestibular endorgans. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Carey and colleagues (1996)</xref> previously reported a better correlation of VOR recovery with type I than with type II HC following ototoxic lesions in the chick. Overall, the result of ototoxic studies, including the present one, demonstrate a fundamental role of type I HC in the encoding of vestibular signals that drive the vestibulo-ocular reflexes, even in the relatively low range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Carriot et al., 2017</xref>) of head movements tested. Our results are compatible with the hypothesis of a convergence of heterogeneous peripheral neural elements at the level of central vestibular nuclei, where intrinsic properties of central vestibular neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Straka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beraneck and Idoux, 2012</xref>) supplemented by network properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Beraneck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Pfanzelt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beraneck and Straka, 2011</xref>) would differentially integrate vestibular signals further processed in the different vestibular pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sadeghi and Beraneck, 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Visuo-vestibular interactions after IDPN treatment</title>
<p>OKR plasticity following vestibular loss concerned gain, and not phase, modifications for frequencies &gt;0.33Hz. Previous studies have reported an increase in OKR gain following a permanent vestibular lesion for a non-specific range of frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Shinder et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Faulstich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Nelson et al., 2017</xref>). One key to understand the frequency-specific OKR plasticity could be the physiological dominance of vestibular inputs in the gaze stabilization process at high frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Faulstich et al., 2004</xref>). The visual inputs could be reweighted and potentiated specifically in the range where the vestibular loss has the most impact on gaze stabilization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>The VOR and OKR work synergistically to stabilize gaze by compensating for head and visual surround movements, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">França de Barros et al., 2020</xref>). If the reflexive eye movements are not perfectly compensatory, an error signal (e.g retinal slip) is produced that drives adaptation of the VOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Boyden et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dean and Porrill, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Shin et al., 2014</xref>) and OKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Glasauer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kodama and du Lac, 2016</xref>). In an effort to understand the integration of VOR and OKR, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Holland and colleagues (2020)</xref> recently proposed that OKR would account for the retinal slip not compensated by VOR. Within that framework, the changes in the OKR could happen preferentially as a function of the vestibular weight, i.e in the range of movements where the loss of vestibular inputs generates the largest retinal slip. While present data are evidence for frequency-specific adaptation, how this relates to alteration in vestibular inputs and/or visual feedback signals remains to be determined.</p>
<p>The increase in OKR gain could be seen as a substitution for the decrease in the VOR. However, even after VOR recovery, the optimal integration of OKR and VOR (as predicted by our MODEL) led to a degraded combined gaze response (CGR) with respect to SHAM mice. Even worse, the measured CGR was inferior to the predicted CGR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). This observation suggests that the integration of visual and vestibular signals during CGR is more than a mere summation of the gain and phase of the 2 unimodal reflexes, but is also affected by other factors. In fact, a subset of the IDPN individuals showed severely degraded bimodal responses, so that their combination of VOR and OKR is not only sub-optimal but also less effective than the unimodal (OKR) reflex. A sweep-based analysis suggested that in these individuals, the VOR unimodal responses were not reliable, i.e the low reproducibility indicates that the same stimuli are unfaithfully encoded into eye movements. We interpret this low reproducibility as a sign of noisiness within the VOR pathway that would not only preclude the optimal integration of both sensory signals, but also disturb the use of retinal information to stabilize the gaze. According to statistical optimality theories, as the Maximum Likelihood principle, the decrease in VOR reliability should lead to a reduction in its relative sensory weight. This filtering-out of a degraded signal has been shown during visuo-vestibular integration for monkey heading perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Fetsch et al., 2010</xref>), or for human object discrimination using visual and haptic senses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ernst and Banks, 2002</xref>).Our results suggest that the gaze stabilizing system is not able to optimally adapt to the degradation by filtering-out vestibular signals during combined visuo-vestibular combination.</p>
<p>The integration of visual and vestibular inputs occurs in several structures, including in the cerebellar flocculi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Jang et al., 2020</xref>) and brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Carcaud et al., 2017</xref>) (see review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">De Zeeuw et al., 2021</xref>). In the case of vestibular loss, most of the defects are expected to concern the central vestibular neurons involved in the VOR, which also integrate visual inputs (ES, or eye-sensitive neurons; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Beraneck and Cullen, 2007</xref>). After unilateral neurectomy, vestibular neurons in the Deiters nuclei responded to higher frequencies during visual stimulation (Cat: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zennou-Azogui et al., 1994</xref>), a change compatible with the hypothesis that OKR gain increase partly takes place in the vestibular nuclei. It was shown that inhibitory floccular inputs (part of the OKR indirect pathway) and excitatory vestibular inputs often colocalized on the dendrites of central vestibular neurons. One possibility is therefore that the massive disorganization of vestibular periphery inputs led in the long term to synaptic and intrinsic changes at the level of central vestibular neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beraneck and Idoux 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Carcaud et al. 2017</xref>), thus impairing their capacity to optimally integrate both signals.</p>

<title>Headpost implantation surgery and animal care</title>
<p>Surgical procedures, postoperative care, device fixation and animal surveillance during the protocol were performed as described previously in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">França de Barros et al., 2019</xref>, 2020. Briefly, mice anaesthetized with isoflurane gas had their heads shaved with small clippers. Then, lidocaine hydrochloride (2%; 2mg/Kg) was injected locally before a longitudinal incision of 1.5 cm was made to expose the skull. Just anterior to the lambda landmark, a small custom-built headpost (3×3×5mm; poly lactic acid) was cemented (C&amp;B Metabond; Parkell Inc., Edgewood, NY) and laterally covered with resin (Heraeus) for protection. Animals were fully recovered 30 min after the end of the surgery, yet buprenorphine (0.05mg/kg) was provided for postoperative analgesia and they were closely monitored for the following 48 hours.</p>

<p>28 mice were treated with 3,3ʹ-iminodiproprionitrile (IDPN, Sigma Aldrich, 317306, 90%) for 6 weeks (IDPN group) at 30mM concentration of IDPN in their drinking water. After 6 weeks of treatment, a washout period of 6 weeks followed. Previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Greguske et al., 2021</xref>) had demonstrated that at these concentrations, ototoxic lesions produced by IDPN are reversible. The SHAM group was tested the exact same way but was not exposed to IDPN in their drinking water.

<p>3 different batches of mice were used, each composed of both IDPN-treated mice and SHAM. The mice of the first one (n=19) were subjected only to vestibular stimulations, to test the effect of IDPN on the canal-related or otolith-related VOR responses during the 12 weeks of protocol. The second group (n=24), designed to compare the dynamic of VOR and OKR changes was tested with angular VOR stimulations, otolithic test, optokinetic (visual) stimulations, and combined vestibular and visual stimulation (VOR in light; referred to as Combined Gaze Response or CGR). The third group (n=11) designed to correlate ototoxic effects of IDPN on vestibular hair cells (HC) and VOR function was tested for canal-related or otolith-related VOR responses, before treatment and after 6 weeks of treatment and immediately used for immunohistochemical assessment of the vestibular sensory epithelia (see below).

Eye, head, and virtual drum (OKR stimulation) position signals were digitally recorded (CED mk3 power 1401, acquisition rate 1kHz) with Spike 2 software. Signals were analysed offline in Matlab (Matlab, the MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA; RRID, SCR:001622) programming environment.

<title>Vestibular stimulations and analysis</title>
<p>All vestibular-specific tests were performed in a temperature-controlled room with all sources of light turned off except for computer screens. The turntable was further surrounded with a closed box to isolate the animal from remaining light, with a final luminance inside the box &lt;0.02 lux. Myosis was induced with topical 2% pilocarpine applied 10 minutes before experimentation.</p>
<p><italic>Vestibulo ocular reflex in dark (VORd) tests</italic> were performed in the dark with the mouse surrounded by an opaque black dome (Fig1.A). Sinusoidal angular rotations around the vertical axis were used to record the horizontal angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR), at different frequencies: 0.2, 0.5, 0.8; 1 and 2Hz at a peak velocity of 30°/s.</p>
<p><italic>Angular vestibulo-ocular reflex</italic> analysis was similar to the one described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Carcaud et al. 2017</xref>. Segments of data with saccades were excluded from VOR slow-phase analysis. For horizontal sinusoidal rotations, at least 10 cycles were analyzed for each frequency. VOR gain and phase were determined by the least-squares optimization of the equation:

where EHv(t) is eye horizontal velocity, g (gain) is a constant value, HHv (t) is head horizontal velocity, td is the dynamic lag time (in msec) of the eye movement with respect to the head movement, and C<sup>te</sup> is an offset. The td was used to calculate the corresponding phase (φ°) of eye velocity relative to head velocity. The Variance-Accounted-For (VAF) of each fit was computed as

where <italic>var</italic> represents variance, <italic>est</italic> represents the modeled eye velocity, and <italic>EHv</italic> represents the actual eye horizontal velocity. VAF values for VOR measures were typically between 0.70 – 1 (&gt;95% of recordings), where a VAF of 1 indicates a perfect fit to the data. For IDPN-treated mice, abnormally low (&lt;0.15) values of gain associated with VAF&lt;0.5 were nevertheless included in the analysis but specifically reported in grey (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> &amp; Supplementary Figure 1).</p>
<p><italic>Static Ocular Counter-roll reflex tests</italic> were performed as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Simon et al., 2021</xref>) by measuring the vertical eye movement generated in response to different roll angles. The table was moved from left to right in incremental steps of 10° (from 0 to 40°), with static periods of at least 10s between oscillations (Fig1.D) to record the stabilized eye elevation and declination. The OCR gain corresponds to the slope of the linear regression of the vertical eye angle <italic>vs.</italic> the head tilt angles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Oommen and Stahl, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Off vertical axis rotation (OVAR) tests</italic> were performed with the vestibular turntable tilted with a 17° off-axis angle following the methodology described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beraneck et al., 2012</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Idoux et al., 2018</xref>. 50°/s continuous stimulations were performed in a counter-clockwise and then clockwise direction. OVAR generates a continuous change in the head tilt angle, compensated through a maculo-ocular reflex (MOR) by the generation of a horizontal nystagmus compensating for the table constant rotation. This oculomotor response was quantified following the methodology described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Idoux et al 2018</xref>. First, quick-phases were identified and removed. During rotations, the velocity of horizontal slow phases is modulated (modulation, μ) around a constant bias (β).

<title>Combined visual and vestibular stimulations</title>
<p>Combined visual and vestibular stimulations measuring the combined gaze reflex (CGR) consisted of horizontal vestibular stimulations while projecting the fixed dotted pattern used for OKR on the surrounding dome. Horizontal angular sinusoidal rotations were performed at frequencies of 0.2, 0.5 and 1Hz with a peak velocity of 30°/s. The CGR gain and phase quantifications were performed following the same methodology as for aVOR. To avoid interference, these were performed on n=8 SHAM and n=12 IDPN after the end of the VOR and OKR test sessions on W12. To test the effects at W6, a specific group of mice (n= 4 SHAM and n=7 IDPN) was tested at W0 and W6.</p>
<p>A simple model has been developed to predict for each individual and for three stimulation frequencies (0.2, 0.5 and 1Hz) the theoretical CGR response gain and phase were given the same two parameters observed for their unimodal VOR and OKR responses. The experimental VOR and OKR gain and phase are used to compute the sinusoid representing the two unimodal responses. The gain and phase of the CGR sinusoid resulting from adding the VOR and OKR sinusoids are quantified by measuring its peak-to-peak amplitude and by identifying the time-lag that maximizes its cross-correlation with the sinusoidal stimulus (note that the sum of two sinusoids with the same period, even if with different phases, is always a sinusoid). Independently of the mouse, the unimodal VOR and OKR sinusoids are shifted in time before their summation, in order to improve, on average, the fit between predicted and observed CGR responses for SHAM mice. The two optimal shift parameters, one for VOR and one for OKR, obtained for each frequency, are then used also for all IDPN-treated mice.</p>
<p>To identify subpopulations of IDPN-treated mice, we computed an agglomerative hierarchical cluster tree on a dataset composed of individual aVOR gain and Δ (calculated as CGR-OKR gain). The classification method used unweighted average Euclidean distance between clusters.</p>
<p>To describe the mice VOR responses without any assumption about their sinusoidal nature the two following characteristics have been quantified: the reproducibility of the ocular response to the vestibular stimulation and the amplitude of the raw eye movements generated by the vestibular stimulation.

<p>Two groups of mice (n=11 at W6 and n=12 at W12) were used to perform immunofluorescence analysis on hair cells in the vestibular endorgans.

The histology was done following the protocol described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Maroto et al., 2021</xref>. The vestibular epithelia (one horizontal canal and one utricule) were dissected and fixed for 1h in a 4% solution of paraformaldehyde (PFA). PFA was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the samples were then embedded in a cryoprotective solution (34.5% glycerol, 30% ethylene glycol, 20% PBS, 15.5% distilled water) to be stored at −20°. Before the immunochemistry, samples were put at room temperature and rinsed twice in PBS. While under slow agitation, the samples were incubated twice, first for 1h with a 4% Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich) in PBS to permeabilise and a second time for 1h in 0.5% Triton X-100 1% fish gelatin (CAS #9000-70-8, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS to block. The incubation with the primary antibodies was then performed in 0.1M Triton X-100, 1% fish gelatin in PBS at 4° for 24h. After rinsing, the second antibodies were incubated in the same conditions. The 2<sup>nd</sup> antibodies were rinsed and the vestibular epithelia were mounted on slides with fluoromount (F4680, Sigma-Aldrich) and were visualised with a confocal microscope Zeiss LSM880 (with an objective of 63x NA:1.4).

<p>For both OKR and VOR stimulations, the effect of the protocol on the gain and phase were statistically tested by performing repeated measures ANOVA. The <italic>treatment</italic> (SHAM or IDPN) was considered as between individual independent factor with the <italic>Weeks</italic> (W0, W2, W4, W6, W8, W10, W12) and the <italic>Frequencies</italic> (0.1, 0.2, 0.33, 0.5 and 1Hz for the OKR; 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1 and 2Hz for the VOR) were considered as within individual independent factors. The main effects of those factors and their interactions were tested and reported. In the case of the OCR and OVAR, mix-model ANOVA was used with only <italic>Weeks</italic> considered as within factors. For the CGR, measured at W6 and W12, mix-model ANOVA was used with the <italic>Frequencies</italic> and <italic>Model</italic> (Measured or Model CGR) used as within factors. For the comparison between the OKR and VOR Δ gain, a repeated measures ANOVA was applied on the Δ gain (Wx-W0) with the <italic>stimulation modality</italic> (OKR or VOR) as between individual independent factor and the <italic>Weeks</italic> as within individual independent factor. For the correlation between OCR and VOR, as well as the measured and theoretical CGR gain a linear regression model was fitted.</p>
<p>The effect of IDPN exposure on the hair cell count was reported with a Kruskal Wallis test. For all analyses the significance threshold was set at p&lt;0.05 and Newman Keuls post hoc test was performed if the main effect or an interaction was found significant.</p>

<p>This paper provides a <bold>fundamental</bold> expansion of our understanding of vestibular compensation into transient and partial dysfunction, as well as insights into the adaptation of visual reflexes in this process. The conclusions are <bold>convincingly</bold> supported with paired histological and behavioral measurements, which are additionally modeled for further interpretation. This work would be of interest to neuroscientists working in multisensory integration and recovery mechanisms.</p>

<p>To further understand the plasticity of vestibular compensation, Schenberg et al. sought to characterize the response of the vestibular system to short-term and partial impairment using gaze stabilization behaviors. A transient ototoxic protocol affected type I hair cells and produced gain changes in the vestibulo-ocular reflex and optokinetic response. Interestingly, decreases in vestibular function occurred in coordination with an increase in ocular reflex gain at frequencies where vestibular information is more highly weighted over visual. Moreover, computational approaches revealed unexpected detriment from low reproducibility on combined gaze responses. These results inform the current understanding of visual-vestibular integration especially in the face of dysfunction.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>
The manuscript takes advantage of VOR measurements which can be activated by targeted organs, are used in many species including clinically, and indicate additional adverse effects of vestibular dysfunction.</p>
<p>The authors use a variety of experimental procedures and analysis methods to verify results and consider individual performance effects on the population data.</p>
<p>The conclusions are well-justified by current data and supported by previous research and theories of visuo-vestibular function and plasticity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>
The manuscript describes the methodology as inducing reversible changes (lines 44, 67,) but the data shows a reversible effect only in hair cell histology (Fig 3A-B) not in function as demonstrated by the persistent aVOR gain reduction in week 12 (Fig 1C) and increase of OKR gain in weeks 6-12 (Fig 4C/D).</p>
<p>The manuscript begins with the mention of fluctuating vestibular function clinically, but does not connect this to any specific pathologies nor does it relate its conclusions back to this motivation.</p>
<p>The conclusions of frequency-specific changes in OKR would be stronger if frequency-specific aVOR effects were demonstrated similar to Figure 4D.</p>

<p>This is a very nice study showing how partial loss of vestibular function leads to long term alterations in behavioural responses of mice. Specifically, the authors show that VOR involving both canal and otolith afferents are strongly attenuated following treatment and partially recover. The main result is that loss of VOR is partially &quot;compensated&quot; by increased OKR in treated animals. Finally, the authors show that treatment primarily affects type I hair cells as opposed to type II. Overall, these results have potentially important implications for our understanding of how the VOR Is generated using input from both type I and type II hair cells. As detailed below however, more controls as well as analyses are needed.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>The authors analyze both canal and otolith contributions to the VOR which is great. There is however an asymmetry in the way that the results are presented in Figure 1. Please correct this and show time series of fixations for control and at W6 and W12. Moreover, the authors are plotting table and eye position traces in Fig. 1B but, based on the methods, gains are computed based on velocity. So please show eye velocity traces instead. Also, what was the goodness of fit of the model to the trace at W6? If lower than 0.5 then I think that it is misleading to show such a trace since there does not seem to be a significant VOR. This is important to show that the loss is partial as opposed to total. It seems to me that the treatment was not effective at all for aVOR for at least some animals. What happens if these are not included in the analysis?</p>
<p>Figure 2A shows a parallel time course for gains of aVOR and OCR at the population level. Is this also seen at the individual level?</p>
<p>Figure 3: please show individual datapoints in all conditions.</p>
<p>Figure 4: The authors show both gain and phase for OKR. Why not show gain and phase for aVOR and OCR in Figure 1. I realize that phase is shown in sup Figures but it is important to show in main figures. The authors show a significant increase in phase lead for aVOR but no further mention is made of this in the discussion. Moreover, how are the authors dealing with the fact that, as gain gets smaller, the error on the phase will increase. Specifically, what happens when the grey datapoints are not included?</p>
<p>Discussion: As mentioned above, the authors should discuss the mechanisms and implications of the observed phase lead following treatment. Moreover, recent literature showing that VN neurons that make the primary contribution to the VOR (i.e., PVP neurons) tend to show more regular resting discharges than other classes (i.e., EH cells), and that such regularity is needed for the VOR should be discussed (Mackrous et al. 2020 eLife). Specifically, how are type I and type II hair cells related to discharge regularity by central neurons in VN?</p>
