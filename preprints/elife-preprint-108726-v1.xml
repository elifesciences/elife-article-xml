<abstract>
<p>Enhancers serve as the major genomic elements regulating mammalian signal-dependent transcriptional programs, characterized by alternating periods of target gene “bursting” and “non-busting” that require investigation of induced enhancer condensates and locus motility in real time to provide dynamic insights into signal/ligand-dependent regulatory events. Here, endogenous live cell imaging has revealed the altered chromosomal dynamics/condensate formation occurring during estrogen receptor α (ERα)-dependent target gene bursting/post-bursting and chronic activation events. Simultaneous DNA/RNA endogenous live imaging reveals that an increased mobility of acutely ERα-stimulated loci observed during the bursting phase is, unexpectedly, further increased in the subsequent non-burst phase. Single molecule tracking (SMT) of ERα shows that the relatively high-burst, lower-mobility acute state was indeed enriched for high-viscosity, 1,6-hexanediol-sensative ERα molecules in a low sub-diffusive confined state with enhanced condensate formation during burst activation. Consistent with this, blocking transcription with flavopiridol shifts DNA tracks into a non-confined state. Differential DNA kinetics during burst vs non-burst has provided a strategy to assess altered condensate formation during gene activation events. (165)</p>

<title>Main</title>
<p>Forty years removed from their initial discovery, gene regulation by transcriptional enhancers has been revealed to be one of the dominant molecular mechanisms underlying cell-type and signal-specific transcriptional diversity in metazoans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In addition to their well-documented critical functions in cell type determination and differentiation, transcriptional enhancers have proved to serve as the predominant regulators of the precise, rapidly altered patterns of gene regulation in response to diverse acute signaling pathways, reflecting the preferential binding of the majority of these signal-dependent transcription factors to enhancers, rather than to promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Indeed, signal-dependent enhancers themselves are active transcription units producing noncoding enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) with concomitant condensation of RNA-dependent ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes upon acute stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, with their activation generally temporally preceding activation of its cognate promoter.</p>
<p>The cell nucleus has long been recognized to harbor sub-nuclear architectural structures, including the nucleolus, nuclear speckles, paraspeckles, and Cajal bodies, several of which are assembled as biomolecular condensates proposed to involve liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In addition to the complex recruitment events occurring at activated enhancers, it has been recognized that the potential interactions of enhancers with subnuclear architectural structures mediate transcriptional activation. Actively transcribed, enhancer-rich genomic regions are segregated near interchromatin granules while the majority of the transcriptionally inactive regions are associated with nucleoli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. A poorly characterized nuclear assembly built around matrin-3 protein, a DNA– RNA binding protein with diverse biological function, is another such non-membrane-bound nuclear compartment implicated to contribute to transcription regulation upon colocalization with target enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. A key insight into the regulation of transcription has been the understanding that transcription occurs in bursts of high transcriptional activity followed by non-burst periods of low transcription, although the relative intensity, duration, and frequency of bursts have been shown to vary between genes and signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Therefore, it now becomes critical to integrate the spatial and temporal aspects of signal-induced enhancer activation and alterations in the putative enhancer condensates, motility of the chromosomal loci and their relationship to subnuclear architectural structures. A particularly instructive model has been provided by the regulation of a large program of acute ligand-dependent enhancer activation in breast cancer cells (MCF7), causing the rapid assembly of RNP complexes, referred to as the MegaTrans complex, at the ∼1-2000 most robustly activated ERα-bound enhancers with RNP condensate-like properties controlling E<sub>2</sub>-regulated transcriptional programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. In breast cancer cells, estradiol-17β stimulation results in the activation of hundreds of non-clustered enhancers with very high levels of eRNA transcription and higher recruitment of chromatin regulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. The MegaTrans complex is mainly composed of other TFs such as GATA3, AP2γ, RARα, YAP/TEAD, and non-classical cofactors that are recruited to the chromatin indirectly, bringing together a large ribonucleoprotein complex as a result of high-affinity chromatin binding of a single TF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In light of our labs’ previous findings of distinct expression patterns in acute and chronic stimulation of breast cancers cells by ERα signaling, we sought to explore whether these two states of ERα signaling operated under different modes of nuclear architectural dynamics, perhaps reflecting differential MegaTrans enhancer condensate properties. Live-imaging approaches that combined endogenous spatiotemporal visualization of ERα target-gene and transcript identified distinct DNA and RNA signatures for both the acute and chronic stimulation phases and allowed us to identify a novel chromatin kinetic signature associated with transcriptional bursting. These data revealed a multi-state model of chromatin kinetics in transcriptional activation: a low mobility, pre-stimulation state; a high-mobility, non-burst stimulated state; and an intermediate-mobility, burst-stimulated state. Interestingly, we observed a high-viscosity, 1,6-hexanediol sensitive subset of ERα molecules that is enriched in the intermediate-mobility, burst-stimulated state. In the absence of transcriptional bursting, that ERα fraction along with chromatin are particularly unrestricted and increases in motility, suggesting confinement via condensate formation during transcriptional bursting events.</p>

<title>Acute vs chronic E<sub>2</sub> enhancer activation-dependent bursting</title>
<p>To investigate the dynamic acute vs. chronic regulation of estradiol-17β-dependent enhancer-activated gene bursting, we selected the <italic>NRIP1</italic> locus for tagging, based upon its well-established ERα enhancer responsivity, its high level of transcription, and its diploid status in MCF7 facilitates DNA-labeling of the same allele as the RNA tagged transcription unit. We incorporated a 24x MS2 cassette into the 3’ UTR of the <italic>NRIP1</italic> target gene, which forms a series of MS2-hairpin loops upon transcription that can rapidly bind MS2-coat-protein (MCP) fluorescent-protein fusions with high specificity and affinity, resulting in punctate fluorescent signal coincident with <italic>NRIP1</italic> gene transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. MS2 insertion into the endogenous loci was facilitated by CRISPR-Cas9, and selection was improved through the addition of either a fluorescent or puromycin selection marker to the homologous recombination (HR) donor cassette just upstream of the stop codon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). MCP-YFP fusion proteins were then stably integrated into these lines via lentiviral infection, and individual clones were screened for the ability to show transient punctate foci in response to E<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>; <xref rid="vid1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Movie 1</xref>).

<p>To quantify burst kinetics under both acute and chronic E<sub>2</sub>-activated conditions, we treated cells with E<sub>2</sub> and imaged at 2-minute intervals for 9 hours (minus E<sub>2</sub> condition showed negligible bursting). Interestingly, we observe 3 clear phases of bursting in response to E<sub>2</sub> treatment: a period of high bursting activity from 24 to 132 minutes post-initial E<sub>2</sub> treatment, referred to as the acute activation period; a period immediately following the acute with bursting activity approximately half that of the acute rate, referred to as the chronic activation period; and a period between 0 and 24 minutes post-E<sub>2</sub> treatment, referred to as the basal/pre-acute activation period (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). We observed that acute and chronic bursts differed significantly in both their duration and frequency (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e, 1f</xref>), consistent with ∼40% diminished target gene transcriptional activation in the chronic phase observed by PRO-seq for both <italic>NRIP1</italic> specifically as well as MegaTrans and ER-bound regulatory enhancers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g-1i</xref>). qPCR further validated that like most genes, <italic>NRIP1</italic> E<sub>2</sub>-dependent enhancer activation precedes activation of cognate promoter, suggesting a fundamental alteration of enhancer-regulated transcriptional mechanisms between acute and chronic E<sub>2</sub> signaling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>).</p>

<title>Mobility of the NRIP1 locus increases with chronic vs acute E<sub>2</sub>-dependent activation</title>
<p>We next established a system for the live imaging of the NRIP1 loci to determine a locus’s relative mobility in the acute versus chronic states, based on tagging the locus by integration of a 144xCuO cassette 2.5Kb upstream of the <italic>NRIP1</italic> promoter. Given the inefficiencies of homologous recombination in insertions of long repeat cassettes, which include low integration efficiency and reduction of repeat number, we first introduced a 65bp integrase site into the loci via Cas9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. The 144xCuO array was then integrated into the site via introduction of an Bxb1 integrase expression plasmid along with a repeat donor cassette containing a Bxb1 attB integrase target site (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). The CymR protein, which binds to the CuO repeats with high affinity and specificity, was fused to either mTurquoise2, mKate2, or Halo and stably expressed in the CuO repeat-containing cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 1</xref>; <xref rid="vid2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Movie 2</xref>).

</fig>
<p>We then assessed the mobility of the <italic>NRIP1</italic> locus by comparing the change in its average displacement per frame between acute, chronic, or no E<sub>2</sub> stimulation conditions. Consistent with a previous report that loci in more transcriptionally active states showed higher mobility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, we noted that the E<sub>2</sub>-minus condition showed significantly lower mobility than either the acute or chronic stimulation states (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). However, rather surprisingly, we detected a significant further <underline>increase</underline> in mobility with chronic (versus acute) E<sub>2</sub> stimulation, in contrast with higher transcriptional activation of the <italic>NRIP1</italic> enhancer and target in the acutely-activated state (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, 2e</xref>). DNA contrails of <italic>NRIP1</italic> loci further demonstrated an increased displacement in chronic state compared to acute (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Thus, while our mobility data confirms the association of transcriptional activation with increased chromosomal mobility in certain activation contexts, in line with published literature, these results suggest a necessary distinction between the initial E<sub>2</sub>-induced enhancer condensate, imposing reduced motility, compared to the subsequent altered condensates following chronic E<sub>2</sub> treatment, licensing increased motility.</p>

<title>Dynamics of ligand-dependent alterations in interactions with estrogen receptor</title>
<p>To better understand the mechanisms underlying the differential mobility observed for ERα stimulated loci, we further investigated the dynamic interactions of ERα in minus, acute, and chronic states. Stimulation with E<sub>2</sub> results in the formation of clear ERα foci, and we observe that these foci are distinct from, but in close proximity to, both the SC35 and the Matrin3-rech nuclear network (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). We also detect a substantial increase in ERα and MegaTrans binding genome wide upon E<sub>2</sub> induction via ChIP-seq, where binding is twice as robust during the acute stimulated phase relative to the chronic (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, 3c</xref>). Therefore, we sought to assess whether the biophysical properties or distribution of ERα itself are altered in acute versus chronic ERα stimulation.</p>

<p>We performed high temporal resolution (5ms) SMT on ERα to determine the acute and/or chronic sensitivity of any ERα populations, and whether the acute and/or chronic differential mobility of these fractions corresponds with the differential chromosomal mobility observed in chronic ERα stimulation. To permit execution of SMT of ERα at high temporal resolutions, we integrated a Halo-tag into the 3’ end of the endogenous <italic>ESR1</italic> gene in MCF7 cells to permit stable Halo-tagging of ERα expressed at endogenous levels. Halo-tagged ERα molecules were then fluorescently labeled the Janelia Fluor 549 and imaged cells at basal conditions or after acute or chronic E<sub>2</sub>-induced ERα stimulation at 5ms resolution using HILO microscopy (<xref rid="vid3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Movie 3</xref>-<xref rid="vid5" ref-type="supplementary-material">5</xref>).</p>
<p>For each ERα SMT track, six properties were calculated: 1) diffusion coefficient, 2) sub-diffusivity (alpha), 3) radial diffusion coefficient, 4) radius of confinement, 5) average 5ms displacement, and 6) duration of binding in a 250nm radius. Tracks were then clustered based upon these six parameters using either Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) or Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering. Our clusters show the expected differences between the no-stimulation and the acute or chronic E<sub>2</sub>-induced stimulation. In low-diffusive states, no stimulation shows enrichment of ER in the high alpha unbound fraction, while the stimulation results in clear enrichment in the low alpha sub-diffusive restricted fractions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d, 3e</xref>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 2a, 2b</xref>). However, we see a highly significant enrichment of the lowest diffusion-coefficient, low sub-diffusivity fraction in the acute stimulation, whereas the higher diffusion coefficient, low sub-diffusivity fractions were unchanged or enriched in the chronic stimulation condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). These results suggest the acute stimulation is enriched for a very low diffusion-coefficient, restricted and potentially higher density population, which makes up roughly 8% of all ERα single molecules. That fraction dissipates into higher diffusion-coefficient populations with extended, chronic stimulation. Further insight is provided by the observation that treatment of cells with 1,6-hexanediol results in the disruption of that low diffusion-coefficient and potentially higher density population of ERα in acutely, but not in chronically treated, cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g, 3h</xref>), which is consistent with previous observations that activation of MegaTrans enhancers is disrupted by 1,6-hexanediol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Taken together, our ERα SMT data suggests the presence of a relatively highly viscous and potentially phase-separated condensate upon E<sub>2</sub> stimulation and implicates these, and possibly additional, condensates in the low-mobility dynamics of the acutely-stimulated condition.</p>

<title>Distinct motility states of E<sub>2</sub>-activated loci during bursting and non-bursting periods</title>
<p>Given the unexpected relationship between burst frequency and DNA mobility in the acute and chronic states as well as the identification of an acute-specific, low sub-diffusion high density ERα fraction, it was important to directly compare RNA bursting with DNA mobility at the regulated locus during the transition from bursting to non-bursting intervals. Because analyses that lack measurement of direct transcriptional output preclude determination of whether any increased DNA mobility is associated with the burst or the non-burst phases at a stimulated locus, it was important to determine whether these two phases exhibit distinct, and previously undetermined, kinetic properties that could account for the acute versus chronic dynamics, such as those observed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. To permit resolution of this question, we engineered a cell line that permitted a combination of RNA-burst visualization and DNA-visualization methodologies in the same cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). We first confirmed via imaging that both the DNA and RNA tags were on the same allele (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). With this validation, we were able to observe a significant and dramatic reduction in mobility that temporally corresponds to the period of gene bursting (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c, 4d</xref>). These results highly suggest that the burst and non-burst phases of stimulated loci exist in two distinct mobility states, consistent with models of transcription that involve formation of a co-factor rich, high-valency condensate, as previously documented for several acutely-induced enhancer activation programs.</p>

<title>Burst events in proximity to subnuclear architectural structures</title>
<p>The potential functional importance of increased proximity of a regulated gene locus to specific subnuclear architectural structures that may facilitate condensate formation during burst activation has been of particular interest. The nucleoli, PML bodies, Matrin3 network, and the polycomb complex have also been reported to have functional impacts on nuclear organization and dynamics, with interchromatin granules and Matrin3 network both implicated in ERα-regulated transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Therefore, to better understand the mechanisms underlying these associations, we investigated the dynamics of <italic>NRIP1</italic> relative to interchromatin granules and the Matrin3 network. We found a clear E<sub>2</sub>-induced increase in proximity of the <italic>NRIP1</italic> loci with both the Matrin3-rich network and the SC35 (representative of interchromatin granules) via immuno-DNA FISH, with the interchromatin granule’s proximity to <italic>NRIP1</italic> peaking in the acutely-stimulated condition while the Matrin3-rich network’s proximity being enriched in the chronic E<sub>2</sub> condition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a, 5b</xref>).

<p>To further characterize the association of transcription activation to subnuclear structures during E<sub>2</sub> stimulation, we employed our previously established <italic>NRIP1</italic> 24xMS2 RNA visualization cell line and virally transduced SC35 and Matrin3 fused to a florescent tag (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). In line with DNA FISH data, RNA timelapse of <italic>NRIP1</italic> showed peak induced proximity to the periphery of interchromatin granules during acute E<sub>2</sub> induction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). This same phenomenon was observed for <italic>TFF1</italic> via immuno-RNA FISH (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>
<p>We propose that induced association between activated ERα loci and subnuclear bodies may directly impact DNA mobility and target gene bursting. To examine this hypothesis, we performed three-color living imaging, combining RNA and DNA visualization platforms with an endogenous fluorescent tag of SC35 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>; <xref rid="vid6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Movie 6</xref>). Surprisingly, we found no correlation between <italic>NRIP1</italic> DNA mobility and proximity to SC35, nor did we see any correlation between SC35 proximity and <italic>NRIP1</italic> gene bursting (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). Thus, while acutely activated ERα loci do change their sub-nuclear body associations with increased proximity in response to ligand stimulation, in line with previous finding, these associations appear to not have a direct impact upon either target gene bursting itself or DNA mobility of the regulated locus, suggesting functional importance on a higher order, macro level of architectural association.</p>

<title>ERα and DNA kinetics during burst events as a surrogate for detecting condensate formation</title>
<p>To investigate whether the decreased DNA kinetics during bursting might reflect condensate formation in the signal-activated transcription unit, we elected to visualize ERα and DNA kinetics under conditions where bursting was removed from the equation by use of flavopiridol. We first confirmed that treatment with flavopiridol pauses transcription by &gt;90% in our E<sub>2</sub>-induced WT MCF7 and <italic>NRIP1</italic> DNA cell lines (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). In the absence of burst events, we hypothesized that DNA mobility would be increased, similar to the phenomenon seen in the chronic stimulated state, where burst frequency was half that of the acute state. In line with our prediction, visualization data revealed that <italic>NRIP1</italic> DNA motility was indeed faster with flavopiridol treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>).</p>

<p>We next wanted to determine whether there were changes to ERα kinetics in the absence of burst activation. To our surprise, we observed significant depletion of ERα molecules in the same 1,6-hexandiol sensitive fraction that we had identified (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). The low diffusion, high confinement ERα population became less restricted as it gains in alpha and diffusion upon flavopiridol treatment, suggesting a similar disruption to condensate formation as had occurred with 1,6-hexandiol treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that alpha is a measure of confinement and a better proxy for condensate formation while diffusion coefficient is a speed parameter, we wanted to gain specific insight into alpha with our <italic>NRIP1</italic> DNA kinetics plus and minus flavopiridol. In support of a low sub-diffusive confined state during burst activation, we observed a decrease in alpha upon E<sub>2</sub> stimulation. Consistently, upon transcriptional pausing with flavopiridol, there was a particular gain in alpha (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e, 6f</xref>). This data indicate that DNA kinetics become unrestricted in the absence of bursting, in support of condensate formation during gene activation events. Because the literature has reported heterogeneity of burst events across cells, we used GMM clustering on visualized DNA tracks to further validate the role of alpha and thus condensates during E<sub>2</sub>-induced transcription activation. Two clusters were of particular note, with a high fraction of unrestricted DNA tracks becoming heavily confined upon ligand stimulation, while flavopiridol loosened that restriction and shifted DNA tracks back into a non-confined state (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>). Therefore, differential DNA kinetics during burst vs non-burst vs no burst has emerged as a surrogate for detecting condensate formation during gene activation events, providing particular insight into regions of confinement on a micro level.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings add important clarifications of the basis for increased mobility of regulated loci during gene activation. Here, we observe that activation, as defined by stimulation of a loci through either a developmental or environmental signal, not only results in increased displacement but consists of two distinct mobility phases: a high mobility, non-burst phase, and a lower-mobility burst phase. Previous studies were blind to bursting dynamics and therefore were constrained to identify a single high-mobility phase that was a mixture of the burst and non-burst phases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. We now can visualize that the highest-mobility state is constricted to the non-burst phase of a stimulated loci. While the full scope of the alterations in the enhancer condensates underlying and the functional consequences of this high mobility phase remain incompletely known, the increased mobility could conceivably facilitate increased frequency of interaction between activating elements such as enhancers and thus serve as a kinetic enhancer of stochastic transcriptional processes. Thus, against our initial expectations, active transcription is not required for the highest mobility state of the regulated genomic locus. Similar kinetic facilitation has been observed in B-cell recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. In contrast, we propose that the reduction in mobility observed during the burst-phase indicates that bursting places an activated loci into a fundamentally different kinetic state, governed by fundamentally different interactions between co-regulators and chromatin, and state of the MegaTrans condensate, and potentially interactions with subnuclear architectural machinery, presumably imparting a functional effect on enhancer:promoter interaction-mediated transcription.</p>
<p>In our exploration of what may be mechanistically responsible for the reduced mobility during bursting, we were surprised to see that association with both the nuclear matrix and the interchromatin granule seemed to have no kinetic impact upon <italic>NRIP1</italic> chromatin mobility, nor did association with the interchromatin granule significantly correlate with gene bursting. Thus, while the body of literature associating these organelles with gene transcription clearly supports their general functional importance in transcription REFS, our results suggest these organelles may play a more indirect role in the facilitation of bursting. The single molecule tracking (SMT) of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) has been recently used to show that acute versus chronic GR stimulation causes alterations in the bound fraction and binding duration of GR molecule, though the low temporal resolution of the SMT permits a somewhat limited insight into the detailed biophysical changes that occur to GR in chronic stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Furthermore, higher temporal resolution SMT of GR indicated the existence of a non-chromatin bound but low-mobility fraction of GR, with reliance of this fraction upon the GR intrinsically disordered domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Conversely, we observe that the single molecule dynamics of ERα, which is both a MegaTrans-condensate component as well as the key transcription factor responsible for <italic>NRIP1</italic> activation, do in fact change in a distinct manner associated with <underline>reduced</underline> mobility in a state correlated with higher bursting rates. Given the observation in previous studies that ERα and other nuclear receptors bind to regulated gene loci and their enhancers, and that such nuclear receptor binding corresponds to bursts of gene transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, we speculate that the increased fraction of low-mobility ERα observed in the high-burst acute condition may facilitate both higher bursting rates and reduced chromatin mobility. Furthermore, our data showing the particular sensitivity of the low-mobility ERα fraction to 1,6-hexanediol suggests that this population of ERα molecules may exhibit condensates with potentially LLPS-like properties.</p>
<p>This model of a highly-concentrated, localized condensate of transcription factors facilitating transcription would fit current models of transcription being governed by the transient formation of co-factor-rich transcription hubs. In this model, enhancers and regulatory elements of varying degrees of genomic distribution come together in 4-dimensional space to form a critical concentration of valency that is sufficient to support bursts of gene transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. This model first provides a functional purpose to the increased “search-phase” mobility seen during the non-burst phase, as this increased chromatin kinetics will probabilistically increase the frequency at which a critical number of enhancers come into sufficient proximity so as to facilitate condensate formation and transcriptional bursting. This model of condensate-associated bursting both explains the viscosity-based reduction in mobility observed during gene bursting, and the ability of a single condensate to activate multiple genes simultaneously, and without direct interaction, two properties beyond the classic “enhancer-promoter looping” models of transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Our paper provides striking evidence of a novel chromatin mobility state associated with gene bursting, which supports the model of condensate driven, enhancer-regulated gene expression. Our results indicate a multi-state model of DNA mobility during enhancer regulated transcription: 1) a low-mobility and transcriptionally inactive state; 2) a poised, high-mobility, pre- and post-burst state; and 3) an intermediate mobility state that occurs during bursting and is associated with a low-mobility, 1,6-hexanediol-sensitive condensate. Given the dynamic nature of condensate formation and its role in regulated transcription, it evokes the challenge of further delineating the differential components and kinetics constituting a condensate during burst and non-burst states.</p>

<title>Segmentation of RNA bursts</title>
<p>Maximum projection of RNA bursting images was performed in Zen Black. Subsequent analysis was performed in ImageJ. Nuclei were using the non-focal signal from the RNA, and was detected per frame via Gaussian blurring (sigma=10), background subtraction (rolling ball, rolling=500), autothresholding (Method=mean), default watersheding, and size selection (size=40-200).</p>
<p>Individual bursts were calculated per nucleus per frame in order to avoid edge artefact and spurious burst detection around the nuclear periphery. Individual nuclei were assessed by clearing each frame outside of the periphery of the nuclei being assessed, and then setting the value of the external area to 90% of the median value of the cell. Bursts were then detected per nucleus by DoG (radius 12 and radius 6), and signal was counted as a burst if the DoG levels were above 5+0.55*(cell median intensity). These burst signals were copied into and used to populate an otherwise blank image with values corresponding to the nuclei median, and the process was continued across all nuclei and frames.</p>

<sec id="s5i">
<title>Quantitation of RNA bursts</title>
<p>Segmented bursts were assessed form compilation in a frame-by-frame manner using ImageJ. For each frame, all bursts were compiled using Analyze Particles, and the following values were measured and compiled for each spot: Median nuclei intensity (taken from the value of the spot in the threshold compiled image), Burst intensity (taken from the intensity of the burst area of the original image), frame, and area of burst. These values were compiled, and this process was repeated across all frames. Via the Trackmate plugin for ImageJ, these compiled signals were linked into bursts based on xyzt position, and then quantified to detect the number, frame, and duration of bursts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5j">
<title>Segmentation of DNA and RNA in DNA-tracking movies</title>
<p>Similarly to how segmentation was done in burst quantitation segmentation, nuclei were first segmented using nuclear signal from background signal in the DNA channel, and segmentation of RNA foci, DNA foci, and organelles were segmented per nuclei and per frame. To reduce memory usage for subsequent processing steps, cells were first manually cropped via ImageJ to into individual cells. Again, per-nucleus analysis allowed for setting on non-nuclear signal to a proportion of the nuclear signal intensity to remove edge artefact, which was applied as before to DNA, RNA, and organelle channels and combined with DoG analysis for segmentation. Organelle segmentation was completed by performing autothresholding of the DoG, DNA thresholding was performed by setting an empirically derived threshold based upon a proportion of the standard deviation of signal in the DNA channel, and RNA thresholding was set to a fixed value throughout images and adjusted upwards or downwards if spurious or insufficient signal was detected.</p>

<title>Drift correction of segmented DNA-tracking movies</title>
<p>Drift correction was performed on all DNA tracking movies to ensure quantitation of DNA movement within the nucleus free of the motion or rotation of the cell. The Airyscan processed DNA channel was used as the template channel for drift correction, but was first pre-processed to both remove spurious or real focal signal inside the nucleus, as well as to increase the contrast of the nucleus to the extranuclear regions of the image. This was done by first segmenting the target cell nucleus via Gaussian blurring, auto-thresholding (method=Huang2), and an adjustable watershed. The segmented bounds of the cell were dilated and both the nuclear and non-nuclear regions had outlier signal moderated based on median measured values so as to not artefactually skew drift correction. This nuclear-thresholding channel was added to the image being drift correct, and was used via the HyperStackReg for rigid body drift correction. The output was then saved and used for quantitation of DNA motion via Trackmate.</p>

<sec id="s5l">
<title>Quantitation of segmented DNA-tracking movies</title>
<p>Segmented and drift corrected DNA-visualization movies (which may also include segmented RNA and organelle channels) had punctate signal (both RNA and DNA) quantified via the Trackmate plugin for ImageJ. As with RNA burst quantitation, these compiled signals were linked into bursts based on xyzt position, and then quantified to detect the number, frame, and duration of bursts. Distance of DNA signal relative to organelle periphery was determined by subtracting the intensity of the the value of the DNA spot in the internal organelle distance transformed channel from the external value, causing the value for each spot in each track to represent the distance of that spot from the edge of the organelle (positive meaning further outside, negative meaning further inside). RNA burst tracks were used to segment DNA tracks into burst associated or non-burst associated. DNA tracks were thus segmented based on burst or non-burst, or pre-E2, acute (0-120 minutes post E2 treatment), or chronic (post 160 minutes) depending on the experiment and attribute being assessed.</p>
<p>The kinetic properties of DNA tracks were assessed both for the single frame displacement in the segment (e.g. burst vs non burst, or acute versus chronic), as well as mean-squared displacement, diffusion coefficient, and subdiffusivity of segmented tracks. Single frame displacement was calculated by determining the coordinate-based displacement from each frame versus the following frame. Mean squared displacement, diffusion coefficient, and sub diffusivity were calculated in the same mathematical manner as were done in the single molecule tracking experiments above.</p>

<title>Segmentation of FISH</title>
<p>All FISH image segmentation was performed in ImageJ. Individual nuclei were first identified in the Dapi channel, and were processed first by z-projection, rolling ball background subtraction (rolling=200, sliding window), Gaussian blurring (sigma=4), auto-thresholding using the Huang2 method, removal of small particles (size&lt;20), filling of holes, and a watershed was applied to separate touching nuclei (Adjustable watershed, tolerance =6). Extranuclear signal was cleared for all other channels.</p>
<p>Organelle channel segmentation was performed through Difference of Gaussian (DoG) and autothresholding. The segmented organelle channels and their inversions were then distance transformed using 3D Distance map to generate internal and external distance transformations relative to the edges of these organelles.</p>
<p>Both DNA and RNA FISH channel segmentations were also performed via DoG and autothresholding.</p>

<title>Quantitation of FISH</title>
<p>Using ImageJ and the 3D Manager plugin, the centroids of segmented FISH dots (both DNA and RNA) were added to the 3D manager. For each, the values of the location of these centroids were assessed in the organelle distance transformed channels (both internal and external) for all organelles assessed. For each FISH dot, the internal distance transformation centroid value was subtracted from the external, providing the distance of each dot from the organelle edge (negative values being inside the structure, positive values being external). These values were then combined over all dots, and compared between conditions and organelles.</p>

<p>Single molecule movies were preprocessed in ImageJ. .Nd2 files of the Red-546 channel and the blue 405 channel were loaded. Auto-thresholding (method=Default) of the single-molecule red channel was performed to determine the area of the nucleus. The average intensity of the red and blue channels were determined over the nucleus area, and these values were recorded in the file names of the image, which was made by saving the red channel as a 32-bit .tif file. The red and blue channel average values were used to confirm similar ERα-Halo expression levels across conditions, while the blue channel levels were used to confirm similar shRNA-expression across conditions.</p>

<p>Tracking of .tif files was performed using the Trackmate plugin in ImageJ. Spot detection was performed using a DoG detector, with a radius of 0.4um and threshold of 10, with no median filtering. Spots before frame 500 were filtered out to select for frames where Halo photobleaching reduces Halo signal to levels where individual molecules are discernable. Tracks were generated by using the Sparse LAP Tracker, with a maximum frame gap of 3, a maximum linking distance of 0.4um, and a maximum closing distance of 0.6um, and a minimum number of spots per track set to 5. All spot statistics were then exported and saved.</p>

<title>Calculation of biophysical parameters from tracks</title>
<p>Biophysical properties for tracks were calculated in R. Spots before frame 1000 were filtered out to select for frames where Halo photobleaching reduces Halo signal to levels where individual molecules are discernable. Mean squared displacement was calculated for each track across all dTs that had at least 3 calculable displacements to average. Alpha and diffusion coefficients were calculated using the lm function (linear modeling function, with mean squared displacement ∼ dT) for each track using log-converted mean squared displacement and dT values for all calculated dTs. Radial diffusion coefficient and radium of confinement were similarly calculated from log converted mean squared displacement and dT values using the nls function (MSD ∼ (RADIUSCONF^2) * (1-exp((−4*RADDIFCO*DT)/(RADIUSCONF^2))). The duration of each track remaining within 0.25 and 0.5 um of the starting point of the track were also determined for each track.</p>

<title>Clustering</title>
<p>Tracks were clustered using both Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) and Ward hierarchal clustering in R.

For each track, aforementioned Diffusion Coefficient, Alpha, Radius of Confinement, Radial Diffusion Coefficient, MSD for dT=1, and the duration with a radium of 0.25um were used as dimensions for clustering below.</p>
<p>GMM clustering was performed using the GMM function from the ClusterR library (dist_mode = &quot;maha_dist&quot;, seed_mode = &quot;random_subset&quot;, km_iter = 20, em_iter = 20, verbose = F) pr = predict_GMM(testdf, gmm$centroids, gmm$covariance_matrices, gmm$weights). The number of clusters used was 6, as this number of clusters resulted in clusters with maximal differences between 1h and 17h E<sub>2</sub> conditions. This GMM was applied to subsequent SMT experiments to classify tracks as belonging to specific clusters.</p>
<p>Ward clustering was performed using the agnes function from the cluster library, with the “ward” method. The number of clusters used was 6, as this number of clusters resulted in clusters with maximal differences between 1h and 17h E<sub>2</sub> conditions, which was consistent between this method and the GMM method. A subset of these clustered tracks were then used to train a set of kernalized support vectors using the ksvm function from the kernlab library (scaled = TRUE, type = ‘spoc-svc’, kernel =&quot;laplacedot&quot;, kpar = &quot;automatic&quot;, C = 8, nu = 0.2, epsilon = 0.1, prob.model = FALSE, class.weights = NULL, cross = 0, fit = TRUE, cache = 40, tol = 0.001, shrinking = TRUE, subset, na.action = na.omi).

Briefly, for nuclei isolation, ∼10 million MCF-7 cells were incubated with swelling buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) for 5 minutes on ice and then incubated with lysis buffer (swelling buffer with 0.5% NP-40 and 10% glycerol) for 5 minutes on ice, before being re-suspended in 100μl of freezing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 40% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EDTA). For Run-on assay, an equal volume of reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 300 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 20 units of SuperaseIn, 1% sarkosyl, 500 μM ATP, GTP, bio-UTP, and bio-CTP) was added into each sample before incubation at 30°C for 5 min. The nuclear run-on RNA was then extracted with TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen) and subjected to hydrolysis, buffer exchange and purification by streptavidin beads (Thermo Fisher). Purified RNA was treated with PNK before being used for cDNA synthesis by using NEBNext® Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina® Kit (NEB). Obtained cDNA templates were amplified by PCR using the LongAmp® Taq 2X Master Mix (NEB) for deep sequencing.</p>
<p>For PRO-seq experiments, sequencing reads were inspected for quality control using FASTQC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>) and sequencing adaptors were trimmed, if necessary, using TRIMMOMATIC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic">http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic</ext-link>). Reads were aligned to hg19 with Bowtie2 (1) (version 2.26) using --very-sensitive setting. Tag directories were then generated using HOMER (2) (version 4.10.3), keeping only unique aligned reads per genome position, but allowing up to 3 unique reads per position (-tbp 3). For read counting, the HOMER script analyzeRepeats.pl was used to estimate the raw counts per gene. The aligned reads were counted over the RefSeq gene bodies. Bedgraph files were generated using HOMER scripts makeUCSCfile and makeMultiWigHub.pl for visualization in the UCSC genome browser. Heatmaps were generated using deeptools2(3) (version 3.4.3).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates the effects of transcriptional activation on chromatin dynamics and mobility. Using a breast cancer model, the authors examine the effects of estrogen receptor-a (ERa) stimulation and the resulting transcriptional activation on chromatin behavior at ERa-dependent loci during three distinct phases: unstimulated, acute stimulation, and chronic stimulation. Through live DNA and RNA imaging, the authors claim that ERa-dependent target genes display distinct bursting dynamics during periods of acute versus chronic simulation, accompanied by an overall increase in chromatin mobility. Notably, they claim that ERa-dependent loci display increased mobility during the non-bursting phase compared to the bursting phase. The study also attempts to explore the role of condensates in mediating these transcriptional and chromatin mobility changes using a single-molecule tracking assay to identify a unique population of low diffusion-coefficient molecules that appears upon E2 stimulation and is sensitive to 1,6-hexanediol.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>While the study develops interesting tools that have the potential to provide useful insights into the relationship between transcriptional state, genomic locus mobility, and condensate formation, several major claims lack key supportive evidence, and the methods are inadequately established and described.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The use of 1,6 hexanediol experiments is not suitable for drawing conclusions in live cell experiments, as this assay is now widely recognized to be plagued with artifacts and inadequate as a test for condensate formation. 1,6 hexanediol perturbs all hydrophobic interactions and has effects ranging from perturbing kinase and phosphatase activities (Düster et al, J. Biol. Chem., 2021), immobilizing and condensing chromatin in living cells (Itoh et al., Life Sci. Alliance 2021), disrupting nuclear pore complexes (Ribbeck et al., EMBO 2002), nuclear transport (Barrientos et al., Nucleus, 2023), and does not disrupt charge-mediated phase separation (Zheng et al., EMBO, 2025). There is also a discussion on these effects in a recent article: Current practices in the study of biomolecular condensates: a community comment, Alberti, Nat. Comm., 2025.</p>
<p>(2) The chromatin mobility is analyzed using displacement, and the differences are typically less than 50 nm. There is no discussion on the precision of this measurement and what these small differences may mean. No control loci are assessed to see if this effect is specific to the genes of interest or global.</p>
<p>(3) The SMT analysis is performed using Mean Square Displacement fitting of short single trajectories, which is error-prone, and no analysis is performed on the localization precision or error in estimation of the key parameters. Potential artifacts from this analysis are reflected in the distribution of alpha and diffusion coefficients that are presented in this paper, which include physically impossible values on which major claims rest.</p>
<p>(4) No experiment is performed to directly connect foci/cluster/condensation formation of ER at the genes of interest. Given these points alone, it is impossible to assess whether any of the claims made in the current manuscript are correct.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors use a combination of state-of-the-art live-cell imaging techniques to track transcriptional bursting, DNA mobility, and single-molecule tracking to discern biophysical behaviours of chromatin and condensate formation in response to ER𝛼 activation. Surprisingly, the authors find that loci in estradiol-stimulated cells display enhanced mobility during the non-bursting phase. The authors attribute the reduced mobility of the loci during transcriptional bursts to condensate formation of ER𝛼 on enhancers regulating the bursting gene. Inhibition of transcription with flavopiridol shifts the loci and ER𝛼 to a non-confined state. These findings open the door to performing more complex multi-color live-cell imaging assays to fully interrogate the role of transcription factor condensates, DNA mobility, and subnuclear localization in the regulation of transcriptional bursting kinetics, and should be of great benefit to researchers studying mechanisms of gene regulation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors presented a series of advanced multi-color live cell imaging assays used to correlate changes in DNA mobility with transcriptional bursting of a gene. By using such a defined temporal trigger associated with the addition of estroldiol to cells, the authors were also able to elegantly characterize changes in the diffusive properties of different classes of ER𝛼 during the acute (early, &lt;2 hours) and chronic (late, &gt;2 hours) phases of estrogen-responsive gene activation. Interestingly, one particular class of ER𝛼 that changed between acute and chronic phases was also responsive to 1,6-hexanediol treatment, suggesting that the authors are assaying ER𝛼 behaviours related to condensate formation. The authors also examined how the proximity of the NRIP1 gene to interchromatin granules impacted transcriptional bursting kinetics. There was no correlation of DNA mobility nor transcription bursting associated with localization to interchromatin granules, suggesting that other higher-order, architectural associations are regulating these processes. The imaging data were also supported by genomic GRO-seq and ChIP-seq assays showing changes in genomic occupancy of a number of transcription factors, including ER𝛼, during the pre-acute, acute, and chronic phases.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although there are a number of compelling strengths to support the author's interpretation of the data, the paper is written in a way that lacks clarity and detail on a number of technical components. This lack of details, in particular related to how endogenous tagging of DNA, ER𝛼, and interchromatin granules (e.g. SC35) potentially impacts transcriptional bursting, makes it difficult for the reader to sufficiently judge any potential limitations of these complex engineered cell lines. Another potential weakness is the lack of any experiments directly measuring ER𝛼 diffusive properties in close proximity to the bursting gene. It is noted that this type of experiment examining transcription factor binding on a bursting gene is very technically challenging, given the different timescales of measurement of bursting (seconds-minutes) versus ER𝛼 diffusion (sub-seconds). However, these types of experiments would go a long way to supporting the authors' conclusions regarding how changes in DNA mobility and transcription bursting may be directly related to ER𝛼 condensate formation on enhancers.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors explore dynamic chromosomal mobility and transcriptional bursting events in mammalian cells, particularly focusing on ERα-dependent gene activation. The authors investigate how the physical movement of DNA loci changes during different phases of gene transcription (bursting vs. non-bursting, acute vs. chronic stimulation). Using advanced live-cell imaging techniques, including SMT of ERα and dual DNA/RNA visualization, the study reveals a multi-state model of DNA mobility linked to the formation of transcription factor condensates. The authors conclude that differential DNA kinetics serve as a reliable indicator for detecting condensate formation during gene activation, offering new insights into the mechanisms regulating gene expression within the nucleus.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have done substantial work, and a major strength of the manuscript is being able to image both DNA and RNA from the same gene, as well as the TF that acts on that gene. This multi-pronged approach leads to complementary insights into transcription bursting mechanisms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A major weakness of the manuscript is the lack of appropriate controls that support the specificity of the effects observed. The exclusive focus on condensates as the underlying mechanism to explain their data is also a bit limiting.</p>
