<title>Abstract</title><p>Microfossils from the Paleoarchean Eon are the oldest known evidence of life. Despite their significance in understanding the history of life on Earth, any interpretation of the nature of these microfossils has been a point of contention among researchers. Decades of back-and-forth arguments led to the consensus that reconstructing the lifecycles of Archaean Eon organisms is the most promising way of understanding the nature of these microfossils. Here, we transformed a Gram-positive bacterium into a primitive lipid vesicle-like state and studied it under environmental conditions prevalent on early Earth. Using this approach, we successfully reconstructed morphologies and life cycles of Archaean microfossils. In addition to reproducing microfossil morphologies, we conducted experiments that spanned years to understand the process of cell degradation and how Archaean cells could have undergone encrustation minerals (in this case, salt), leading to their preservation as fossilized organic carbon in the rock record. These degradation products strongly resemble fossiliferous features from Archaean rock formations. Our observations suggest that microfossils aged between 3.8 to 2.5Ga most likely were liposome-like protocells that have evolved physiological pathways of energy conservation but not the mechanisms to regulate their morphology. Based on these observations, we propose that morphology is not a reliable indicator of taxonomy in these microfossils.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Pilbara Greenstone Belt (PGB), Western Australia, and Barberton Greenstone Belt (BGB), South Africa, are the oldest known sedimentary rock successions that have not undergone significant metamorphic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Hence, these rock formations have been the subject of numerous scientific investigations focused on understanding the biology and biogeochemistry of Archaean Earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Over a span of 50 years, these studies have documented various organic structures within these rock formations that resemble fossilized cells and their degradation products, with δ<sup>13</sup>C composition consistent with biologically derived organic carbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Although these observations suggest that these organic structures were fossil remnants of Archaean microorganisms, any such interpretation, together with the biological origin of these structures, has been a point of contention among researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Two factors currently limit wider acceptance of their biological origin – the absence of truly analogous microfossil morphologies among extant prokaryotes and an indication of an ongoing biological process, like cell division, among most microfossils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Moreover, most of the described microfossils are larger than present-day prokaryotes and often exhibit considerable cytoplasmic complexity with intracellular alveolar structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). These complex morphologies and relatively larger cell sizes of supposedly primitive Archaean Eon cells is not in accordance with our current understanding of how biological complexity evolved through Darwinian evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>).</p>
<p>Apart from the chemical and δ<sup>13</sup>C-biomass composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), one key emphasis of the studies arguing for and against the biological origin of Archaean Eon organic structures involves an extensive morphological comparison with extant prokaryotes or abiotically formed minerals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Cell morphology among extant organisms is maintained by a plethora of intracellular processes and is determined by the information encoded in their genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). In our opinion, drawing parallels between the present-day prokaryotes and Archaean Eon organisms inherently involves subscribing to the notion that paleo-Archaean life forms possess all the complex molecular biological mechanisms to regulate their morphology as present-day cells. Any such presumptions are not in tune with the current scientific consensus of how life could have originated on early Earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). It is now widely believed that life evolved in the form of protocells devoid of most molecular biological complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). These primitive cells are thought to have undergone slow Darwinian evolution, resulting in present-day cells with intricate intracellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Given the unlikelihood of Archaean cells possessing complex molecular biological processes, we test the possibility that complex morphologies of Archaean microfossils result from the complete absence of intracellular mechanisms regulating their morphology. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>).</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we used a top-down approach of transforming a Gram-positive bacterium (<italic>Exiguobacterium Strain-Molly</italic>) into a primitive lipid vesicle-like state (<italic>EM-P</italic>). Cells in this state can be described as a simple sack of cytoplasm devoid of all mechanisms to regulate their morphology and reproduction. Although it has not been empirically demonstrated, some studies have suggested that cells in this lipid vesicle-like state may resemble primitive protocells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Given that the reproduction of such cells is shown to be influenced by environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), we studied the life cycle of these cells under experimental conditions resembling the native environment of the Archaean microfossils.</p>
<p>While the precise environmental conditions of early Earth remain uncertain, a growing consensus within the scientific community suggests that surface temperatures on Archaean Earth ranged between 26° and 35°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Moreover, most, if not all, of the known microfossils from the Archaean Eon are restricted to coastal marine environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Coastal marine environments often exhibit higher salinity due to the constant evaporation of seawater. To replicate the high salinities of the coastal marine environments, <italic>EM-P</italic> was cultivated in half-strength tryptic soy broth supplemented with 7% (w/v) Dead Sea Salt (TSB-DSS) at 30°C. We chose Dead Sea Salt over pure NaCl to better emulate complex salt compositions of natural environments.</p>
<p>Given that <italic>EM-P</italic>’s life cycle and the biophysical basis of such a reproduction process is extensively discussed in the previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), the primary focus of this manuscript will be restricted to the morphological comparison of <italic>EM-P</italic> cells and Archaean Eon microfossils. Below, we present the morphological comparison between <italic>EM-P</italic> cells and Archaean Eon microfossils. In addition to this morphological comparison, we also conducted experiments that spanned years (18 to 28 months) to understand the process of protocell degradation, how they become encrusted in salt, and how they are preserved as fossilized organic carbon in the rock record.</p>

<title>Morphological comparison of top-down modified cells with fossilized Archaean cells</title>
<p>When cultured under experimental conditions likely resembling coastal marine environments of Paleoarchean Eon, <italic>EM-P</italic> exhibited cell sizes that were an order of magnitude larger than their original size. They also exhibited complex morphologies and reproduced by a relatively less understood process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). The life cycle of these cells involves reproduction by two methods – via forming internal or a string of external daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). <italic>EM-P</italic> reproducing by both these processes bears close morphological resemblance to microfossils reported from the Archaean Eon.</p>
<p>The first step in reproduction by intracellular daughter cells is the formation of hollow intracellular vesicles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). These vesicles were formed by a process that resembles endocytosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). A similar process of vesicle formation was previously reported in protoplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Over time, the number of intracellular vesicles (ICVs) within <italic>EM-P</italic> gradually increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-F</xref>). No uniformity was observed in the size of ICVs within a cell or the number of ICVs among different cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>, S1 &amp; S2). <italic>EM-P</italic> cells with such intracellular vesicles resemble spherical microfossils reported from 3.46 billion-year-old (Ga) Apex chert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Like the Apex-chert microfossils, ICVs of <italic>EM-P</italic> were hollow, and organic carbon (cytoplasm) in these cells is restricted to spaces between the vesicles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F-K</xref> &amp; S3).</p>

<p>Images A-D are TEM images of <italic>EM-P</italic> cells forming intracellular vesicles (ICVs) and intracellular daughter cells. The numbered arrows in these images point to different stages of ICV formation (see Fig. S1). Images E, F, K &amp; L show TEM, SEM, and STED microscope images of <italic>EM-P</italic> cells with ICVs and surface depressions (black arrows). Cells in image F were stained with universal membrane stain, FM<sup>TM</sup>5-95 (red), and DNA stain, PicoGreen (green). Images G-J &amp; M are spherical microfossils reported from the Apex Chert and the Strelley Pool Formation, respectively (originally published by Schopf et al., 1987 &amp; Delarue <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Cyan arrows in images E-H point to cytoplasm sandwiched between large hollow vesicles. The arrow in the image I point to the dual membrane enclosing the microfossil. Morphologically similar images of <italic>EM-P</italic> cells are shown in Fig. S3. Black arrows in images K-M point to surface depressions in both <italic>EM-P</italic> and the Strelley Pool Formation microfossils, possibly formed by the rupture of ICV’s as shown in D &amp; E (arrows) (also see Fig. S4-S6). Scale bars: A-D (0.5µm) E, K &amp; L (2 µm), and 5 µm (F).</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>The three-dimensional STED and SEM images of <italic>EM-P</italic> show numerous surface depressions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>, arrow &amp; S1E). Such depressions are formed either during vesicle formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, arrow) or by the rupture of intracellular vesicles attached to the cell membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>, S1G-K &amp; S4-S6). <italic>EM-P</italic> cells with such surface depressions and intracellular vesicles strongly resemble morphological resemblance to microfossils reported from 3.4 Ga Strelley Pool Formation (SPF) microfossils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1M</xref> &amp; Fig. S4-S6). Microfossils reported from other sites, such as the Farrel Quarzite (Fig. S7)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), Turee Creek (Fig. S8)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), and the Fig Tree Formations (Fig. S9)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), likely are morphological variants of Archaean <italic>EM-P</italic>-like cells and the Apex Chert microfossils. For instance, <italic>EM-P</italic> with many but relatively smaller intracellular vesicles resemble the Fig Tree microfossils, both in cell size and shape (Fig. S9). On the other hand, <italic>EM-P,</italic> with a relatively larger number of intracellular vesicles squeezed into polygonal shapes, resemble microfossils reported from the SPF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G-I</xref> &amp; S4-S6), the Farrel Quartzite microfossils with polygonal alveolar structures (Fig. S7) and the Turee creek microfossils (Fig. S8)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>).</p>
<p>The second step in this method of reproduction involves the formation of daughter cells into the ICVs (Fig. S10)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Daughter cells were formed in the intracellular vesicles by a process resembling budding (Fig S10). Over time, these bud-like daughter cells detached from the vesicle wall and were released into the ICV (Movie 1). Due to a gradual loss of cytoplasm to the daughter cells, we observed a gradual reduction of the cytoplasmic volume of the parent <italic>EM-P</italic> cells and a corresponding increase in the number of daughter cells within the ICVs (Fig. S11, Movie 2-4). Over time, <italic>EM-P</italic> cells transformed into hollow vesicles with multiple tiny daughter cells (Fig. S11e-h, Movie 3&amp;4). These intracellular daughter cells were released into the surroundings by a two-step process. In the first step, cells underwent lysis to release the ICVs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, S12 A &amp; B and Movies. 5-9). In the second step, the vesicle membrane underwent lysis (Fig. S12C-E) to release the daughter cells (Fig. S12F-H). <italic>EM-P</italic> cells undergoing this method of reproduction closely resemble fossilized microbial cells discovered from several Archaean Eon rock formations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> &amp; S13-S23)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). For instance, microfossils reported from Mt. Goldsworthy Formation exhibit cells with ICVs containing daughter cells, cells that underwent lysis to release these ICVs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> &amp; S13-S17), and the subsequent rupture of the vesicle membrane and release of the daughter cells (Fig. S14D-F)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>).</p>

<p>The microfossils reported from sites like the Farrel Quartzite (Fig. S7)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), the Strelley Pool Formation (Fig. S18-S20), the Waterfall locality (Fig. S21-S22)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), the Turee Creek (Fig. S23)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), and Dresser Formation (Fig. S24-S28)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), bear close morphological resemblance with morphologies of <italic>EM-P</italic> cells reproducing by this process. <italic>EM-P</italic> cells exhibited all the distinctive features of the Dresser formation microfossils, like the presence of hollow regions within the cell (Fig.S25) and discontinuous or thick-porous cell walls (Fig. S24 &amp; S27). The step-by-step transformation of <italic>EM-P</italic> cells into these morphologies is shown in Fig. S27. Due to the lysis and release of daughter cells, most late stationary growth phase <italic>EM-P</italic> cells were deflated with numerous surface depressions. The morphology and surface texture of such deflated <italic>EM-P</italic> cells resemble the morphologies of microfossils reported from the Kromberg Formations (Fig. S29)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>).</p>
<p>Reproduction by external daughter cells happens by two different processes. Tiny daughter cells initially appeared as buds attached to the cell membrane (Fig. S30, S31 &amp; Movie 10). These buds subsequently grew in size and detached from the parent cell. Depending on the size of the daughter cells (buds)<italic>, EM-P</italic> cells appear to have been reproducing either by budding or binary fission. <italic>EM-P</italic> cells that appear to have been reproducing by budding resemble microfossils reported from the North-pole formations (Fig. S31). As observed in our incubations, microfossils from this site are a mix of individual spherical cells, spherical cells with pustular protuberances, cells with bud-like structures, and cells undergoing binary fission (Fig. S31). Other <italic>EM-P</italic> morphotypes, like individual spherical cells, hourglass-shaped cells undergoing fission, and cells in dyads, bear close morphological resemblance to microfossils reported from both the Swartkopie (Fig. S32) and the Sheba formations (Fig. S33 &amp; S34)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Like the Sheba Formation microfossils, the cells undergoing binary fission were observed to be in close contact with extracellular organic carbon (clasts of organic carbon in the Sheba Formation). This extracellular organic carbon likely represents the intracellular constituents released during the lysis of cells, as described above (Movies 5-8 &amp; Fig. S34).</p>
<p>In some cases, the above-described buds did not detach from the cell surface but transformed into long tentacles (Movies 11&amp;12). These initially hollow tentacles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) gradually received cytoplasm from the parent cells and gradually transformed into “string-of-spherical daughter cells” (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, S31A-C &amp; S33)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Subsequently, these filaments detached from the parent cell, and due to the constant motion of daughter cells within these filaments, the “string-of-spherical daughter cells” fragmented into smaller and smaller strings and ultimately into multiple individual daughter cells (Movies 13-15). Apart from the cells that received cytoplasm (daughter cells), we also observed hollow spherical structures within these tentacles that did not receive cytoplasm from the parent cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>, black arrows).</p>

<p>All <italic>EM-P</italic> morphotypes observed undergoing this reproduction process bear close morphological resemblance to microfossils reported from the Cleaverville Formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). All distinctive features of the Cleaverville microfossils, like the arrangement of cells as pairs within a string (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>), microfossils with a discontinuous layer of organic carbon at the cell periphery (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3I-K</xref>), were also observed in <italic>EM-P</italic>. Several hollow spherical structures devoid of organic carbon were reported from the Cleaverville formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). As in <italic>EM-P</italic>, these structures could have been the hollow membranous structures that didn’t receive the cytoplasm from the parent cells. Similar structures were also reported from other microfossil sites, such as the organic structures reported from the Onverwacht Group (Fig. S35)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the Cleaverville microfossils, <italic>EM-P</italic> cells in our incubations also resemble filamentous structures with spherical inclusions reported from the Sulphur Spring Formations (Fig. S36-S38)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Based on the morphological similarities, we propose that these structures could have been the filamentous extensions with spherical daughter cells observed in <italic>EM-P</italic>. Similar but smaller filamentous structures were reported from the Mt. Grant Formation (Fig. S39)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) and could have been the shorter fragments of similar “strings-of-daughter cells” (Movie 14). The spherical structures with sparsely distributed organic carbon reported from the Sheba Formations could also have been such cells undergoing fragmentation into smaller and smaller filaments (Fig. S33). In tune with this proposition, the Sheba Formation microfossils, like the <italic>EM-P</italic> cells, exhibited an un-uniform distribution of organic carbon within the cells and filamentous overhangs (Fig. S33, Movie 16).</p>
<p>Five to seven days after the start of the experiment, most cells in the incubations were the daughter cells. We observed three distinct types of daughter cells – a string of daughter cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, S39 &amp; Movie 14), daughter cells that were still attached to the membrane debris of the parent cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, S40-S48 &amp; Movie 17) and individual daughter cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref> &amp; Movie 15).

<title>The gradual transformation of <italic>EM-P</italic> cells into lamination-like structures and their comparison with Archaean organic structures</title>
<p>Fossilization and preservation of individual cells is considered unlikely due to the absence of rigid structures. However, recent studies indicate such a process could happen under favorable environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). However, the prevailing observations suggest that a significant portion of cell biomass undergoes taphonomic alteration and is preserved as degraded organic matter. To understand the possibility of <italic>EM-P</italic>-like cells forming structures similar to those observed in Archaean rocks, we studied the morphological transformation of individual <italic>EM-P</italic> cells and biofilms over 12 to 30 months. Below, we present the step-by-step transformation of individual cells into organic structures and their morphological resemblance to Archaean organic structures.</p>
<p><italic>EM-P</italic> grew in our incubations as a biofilm at the bottom of the culture flask (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> &amp; Fig. S49). The rapid biofilm formation by <italic>EM-P</italic> can be attributed to the presence of extracellular DNA released during the lysis of <italic>EM-P</italic> cells (Fig. S50)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). DNA released by such processes is known to promote biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Over time, increased cell numbers resulted in biofilms comprising multiple layers of closely packed individual spherical cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> &amp; S50). A subsequent increase in the number of cells led to lateral compression and transformation of spherical cells into a polygonal shape (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). By the late stationary growth phase, most cells underwent such a transformation, resulting in a honeycomb-like biofilm. The step-by-step transformation of individual spherical cells into these structures is shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>. Morphologically similar organic structures were reported from several paleo-Archaean sites, like the North Pole Formation (Fig. S51-S62)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). A similar taphonomic degradation of organic matter associated with a biofilm was demonstrated by previous studies (Westall et al., 2006, Figure 10B)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>).</p>

<p>Large aggregations of spherical cells devoid of internal organic carbon were reported from the North-Pole Formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) (Fig S52). These structures closely resemble the aggregations of hollow ICVs released after the lysis of <italic>EM-P</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref> &amp; S22). As observed in <italic>EM-P</italic>, the distribution of organic carbon in the North-Pole Formation microfossils is restricted to the periphery of the spherical cells (Fig. S52). Along with the morphological and organizational similarities, <italic>EM-P</italic> also exhibited all the accessory structures associated with the North Pole formation microfossils, such as the large clots of organic carbon (Fig. S51 arrows), filamentous structures originating from the spherical cells, and spherical clots of organic carbon within these filamentous (Fig. S52-S55)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Based on the similarities, we propose that the large clots of organic carbon would have been the membrane debris formed during the lysis and the release of intracellular vesicles (Fig. S51, Movie 5-9). As observed in <italic>EM-P</italic>, the filamentous structures associated with the microfossils could also have formed during the release of intracellular vesicles (Movie 5-9). The organic carbon clots within the filamentous structures could have been fossilized daughter cells (Fig. S53 &amp; S54, arrows).</p>
<p>Apart from the aggregations of hollow spherical cells, honeycomb-like structures were also reported from several microfossil sites, like the SPF, the Nuga Formation, the Buck Reef Chert, the Moodies Group, and the Turee Creek formations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, S57-S62)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). As observed in <italic>EM-P</italic>, these structures could have been formed by the lateral compression of cells or hollow vesicles within the biofilm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). In tune with our proposition, Archaean honeycomb-like structures are often closely associated with spherical <italic>EM-P</italic>-like cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Spherical microfossils from the Pilbara and Barberton Greenstone Belts were often discovered within layers of organic carbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Over a period of 2-6 months, we observed cells in our incubations gradually being enclosed by membrane debris. These structures were formed by a multi-step process (Fig S63). First, <italic>EM-P</italic> grew as multiple layers of cells within a biofilm (Fig. S63A). Second, the lysis of these cells led to the formation of a considerable amount of membrane debris (Fig. S63B, S64 &amp; Movie 17&amp;18). Subsequently, this membrane debris coalesced to form large fabric-like structures (Fig. S65). These membrane fabrics were then expelled from the biofilm (Fig. S63D, S63E &amp; Movie 18). Over time, these expelled membrane fabrics grew in surface area to form a continuous layer of membrane enclosing a large population of cells (Fig. S65-S69 &amp; Movie 19). This fabric-like membrane debris enclosing biofilms observed in <italic>EM-P</italic> incubations bear close morphological resemblance to microfossils reported from Chinaman Creek in the Pilbara (Fig. S69), and Mt. Goldsworthy Formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>).</p>
<p>Parallel layers of organic carbon termed laminations were reported from several Archaean microfossil sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). Structures similar to these laminations were observed in our incubations. As described above, the reproduction in <italic>EM-P</italic> involves the lysis of cells to facilitate the release of the intracellular daughter cells, resulting in a considerable amount of cell debris (Movie 9 &amp; 17). The parallel layers of organic carbon in our incubations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) are formed by lysis and collapse within individual biofilm layers (Fig. S49). Another way the organic carbon layers could have formed is by the lateral compression of honeycomb-like biofilms (Fig. S71-S74). Sequential steps resulting in the formation of such structures are shown in Fig. S72. Such layers of cell debris closely resemble different types of laminated structures reported from the Barberton Greenstone Belt and Pilbara Iron Formations, like the α, and β laminations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> &amp; S69-S75)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Also similar to the Archaean laminations, we observed layers of cell debris in our incubations have lenticular gaps (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>, S69, S70-S71 &amp; S76-S79). Within these lenticular gaps, we observed intact <italic>EM-P</italic> cells or honeycomb patterns, suggesting that lenticular gaps within otherwise uniformly parallel laminations were formed due to non-uniform lysis or incomplete deflation of cells within individual layers of <italic>EM-P</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, S75-S79 &amp; Movies 20 &amp; 21). Although in the case of Archaean laminations, these lenticular gaps were thought to have been formed by the entrapment of air bubbles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>), based on our results, we argue that there could have been more than one way such structures could have formed. Other distinctive features of the lamination, like raised mounds or swirls (Fig. S81 - S83)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>), were also observed in batch cultures of <italic>EM-P</italic>. Given these morphological similarities, we propose that some of the laminated and other diaphanous filamentous structures could have been formed by the cell debris of the <italic>EM-P</italic>-like cells that inhabited these sites during the Archaean Eon. We will discuss these possibilities in more detail below.</p>
<p>Over a period of 3-12 months, we observed the biofilms solidifying into a solid crust (Fig. S84 &amp; S85). The SEM-EDX characterization of these solidified biofilms showed the presence of potassium and magnesium minerals on the surface, suggesting that these structures were formed by the gradual adsorption of positively charged cations on the negatively charged biofilms (Fig. S84). Most Archaean microfossils are restricted to coastal marine environments. Compared to open oceans, these coastal marine environments harbor higher concentrations of salt due to higher evaporation rates. Hence, these microfossils could have undergone a similar encrustation process as observed in our incubations. Moreover, solidified <italic>EM-P</italic> biofilms resemble the mineral-encrusted structures reported from the Kromberg Formation (Fig. S85)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). Like the Kromberg Formations structures, solidified <italic>EM-P</italic> biofilms are composed of desiccation cracks and spherical cells beneath the surface (Fig. S85).</p>
<p>When these salt-encrusted cells were transferred into fresh media, we observed a gradual increase in cell numbers (results not shown). However, given that these cells are encrusted in a layer of salts, we observed early growth-phase cells breaking out of the thick salt crust, resulting in stellar morphologies (Fig. S86 &amp; S87). The observed morphologies of these cells closely resemble the morphologies of microfossils reported from the Strelley Pool and other North Pole cherts (Fig. S86 &amp; S87)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). All distinctive features of these microfossils, like the stellar-shaped cells undergoing binary fission and a string of daughter cells extending out of such stellar cells (Movie 22), were also observed in our incubations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Advances in microscopic (FIB-SEM) and analytical (NanoSIMS) techniques over the past few decades have facilitated better imaging and precise determination of chemical and isotopic compositions of microfossils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). Nevertheless, there is considerable disagreement among researchers regarding the interpretation of this information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Given the importance of morphology in determining the biogenicity and taxonomic affiliation of the microfossils, reconstructing the lifecycles of Archaean Eon organisms is considered crucial to understanding the nature of these microfossils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Our study is the first to reconstruct all known spherical microfossil morphologies and their lifecycles from extant bacteria. Furthermore, we have shown that many of the taphonomic structures observed in our study closely resemble the controversial structures observed in rocks of the Palaeo-Mesoarchaean age (3.6-3.0 Ga) and even in the Neoarchaean (3.0-2.4 Ga). These similarities help us answer long-standing questions regarding the origin and the nature of Archaean microfossils.</p>
<p>The nature of Archaean organic structures is currently being debated among researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). While some studies suggest that these structures could be remnants of Archaean microorganisms, others suggest that they may have been abiotic minerals that formed due to volcanic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The argument for this proposition is based on the fact that these organic structures share more similarities with inorganic mineral structures than with extant prokaryotes. To establish the biogenicity of a microfossil, it is essential to either find a convincing morphological analog among extant bacteria or establish a biogenic process through which they are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The biogenicity of microfossils reported from several sites like the Swartkoppoie Formation, Kitty’s Gap Chert, and the Josephdal Formation is widely accepted among the scientific community due to the discovery of spherical microfossils in different stages of their lifecycle (Fig. S32)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). However, such a step-by-step biological process through which Archean Eon organic structures could have formed has never been demonstrated empirically.</p>
<p>The biological origin of microfossils reported from several sites, like the Dresser Formation, to date, remains a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Several morphological features of these organic structures, like the presence of organic carbon only at the periphery, the absence of internal cell constituents, the presence of pyrite and silicate minerals inside the cells, and the presence of a thick porous or discontinuous cell wall, were all argued as claims for their abiotic origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Justifiably, these morphological features have never been observed in any living organism. Nevertheless, all spherical microfossils reported from the Dresser Formation resemble <italic>EM-P</italic> cells, especially those with a single large ICV (Fig. S24-S27). What was thought to have been a thick, porous cell wall in the microfossils could have been the cytoplasm with tiny ICVs sandwiched between the cell and vesicle membrane (Fig. S24 &amp; S27). Similarly, the hollow cells with a discontinuous cell wall could either have been the ICVs released by cell lysis or the late-growth stage cells with little cytoplasm (Fig. S26). In such cells, the presence of cytoplasm is restricted to discontinuous patches around the periphery of the cells (Fig. S26). The sequence of steps leading to these cell morphologies that resemble the Dresser Formation microfossils is shown in Fig. S27. A closer inspection of the Dresser Formation microfossils shows the ICVs membrane rupture and the daughter cell release (Fig. S28). Morphologies indicating this method of reproduction among microfossils is not unique to the Dresser Formation. Microfossils with similar morphological features were reported from sites like the Strelley Pool, the Waterfall region, and Mt. Goldsworthy Formation (Fig. S3-S14)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). These similarities suggest that microfossil morphologies observed in the Dresser Formation are in tune with other microfossils of similar geological time periods, suggesting their biological origin.</p>
<p>Spherical structures half-coated with pyrite are reported from the Dresser Formation (Fig.S25)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). These structures could have been the iron-reducing <italic>EM-P</italic>-like cells with hollow ICV constituting half their volume. The selective co-localization of pyrite and carbon could be explained by the Fe(III) reduction happening at the cell surface. The Fe(II) produced from this metabolic reaction could have reacted with environmental sulfide, converted to insoluble pyrite, and precipitated onto the cell surface. Given the absence of this metabolic process within the hollow ICV, these structures remained pyrite-free (Fig.S25). In addition to the Dresser Formation, organic structures coated with pyrite have also been reported from other microfossil sites like the Sulphur Spring Formations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). The selective presence of pyrite on these microfossils could also be explained by a similar mechanism (Fig. S36-S38). Apart from pyrite, minerals like anatase were reported to have been present within the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The presence of anatase within these cells could be explained by the transport of these minerals into the cells during the ICV formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B&amp;D</xref>). ICVs are formed by a process similar to endocytosis, which involves the intake of salt-rich media and minerals into the cells (Fig. S88). Like the Dresser Formation microfossils, we often observed the presence of salts and minerals within <italic>EM-P</italic>s vesicles (Fig. S88). Moreover, the presence of minerals within cells is not unique to the Dresser Formation microfossils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) and was reported previously from several bonafide microfossils from Gunflint Iron Formations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Additionally, we observed remarkable similarities between the <italic>EM-P</italic> cell debris and all the organic structures closely associated with the microfossil, such as the wavy lamellar and pumice-like structures (Fig. S59, S61 &amp; S89). The step-by-step transformation of cell debris into pumice-like structures is shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>. Based on these morphological similarities between the Dresser Formation organic structures and <italic>EM-P</italic>, we hypothesize that these organic structures are the fossil remnants of <italic>EM-P</italic>-like bacteria rather than mineral aggregates.</p>
<p>Morphological similarity between microfossils from far-flung sites like Western Australia and Southern Africa could be explained by the similarity in the environmental conditions in both sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). This relationship between cell morphology, reproductive processes, and environmental conditions was discussed extensively in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). The experimental conditions that we employed in our study are likely similar to the environmental conditions faced by Archaean organisms from both these sites at the time of their fossilization. All sites from which microfossils were reported are shallow intertidal regions. Evidence for periodic evaporation and flooding with sea water was presented from the Barberton and Pilbara Greenstone Belts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>), suggesting that the original microorganisms experienced high salinities. The salinities of our experiments are broadly similar to those of Archaean oceans (5-10% w/v)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). To our knowledge, the exact salt composition of the Archaean Ocean has not been elucidated. Hence, we used a complex mixture of salts (DSS) as a proxy to reproduce these salinities in our experiments. Salts like Mg<sup>+2</sup>, Ca<sup>+2</sup>, Na<sup>+,</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> or their oxides were also reported to be present and constitute 1-5% by weight in both Pilbara and Barberton greenstone belt microfossil sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). Moreover, these salts were shown to be closely associated with microfossils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). The spatial distribution of these salts resembles the spatial distribution pattern of organic carbon, possibly indicating the chelation of these salts to the cell membrane, which is also in agreement with our observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). The presence of potassium phyllosilicates and NaCl crystals within the microfossils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>) is also in agreement with our hypothesis that internal structures of the microfossils should have formed by invagination of cell-membrane taking in salt-rich water (Fig. S86). As observed in the microfossils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>), salt crystals on the cell surface, within the membrane invaginations, or cell debris were often observed in <italic>EM-P</italic> (Fig. S89).</p>
<p>The above-presented results suggest that Archaean Eon cells are likely primitive lipid-vesicle-like protocells that lack a cell wall. From a physiological perspective, it would have been unlikely for primitive cells to possess a cell wall given the substantial number of genes required to synthesize individual building blocks, to mediate its assembly, and its constant modification to facilitate cell growth and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Furthermore, a cell wall could impede the transport of physiologically relevant compounds in and out of the cells. To overcome this limitation, present-day microorganisms (with a cell wall) had to develop extensive molecular biological processes for transporting nutrients and metabolic end products across the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>). This could not have been the case for primitive Archaean life forms. Hence, rather than drawing parallels between the microfossils and life as we know it today, we propose that these microfossils could have been liposome-like protocells, as proposed by the theory of chemical evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Indeed, it has been recently shown that liposome-like molecules could be produced in some of the hydrothermal settings proposed for the emergence of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide a link between theoretical propositions and geological evidence for the existence of protocells on early Earth.</p>
<p>According to the theory of chemical evolution, biological organic compounds are formed by abiotic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>). These compounds then self-assembled to form lipid vesicles, which grew in complexity and eventually evolved into self-replicating protocells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>). These protocells are believed to have undergone Darwinian evolution, resulting in the emergence of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>). It was previously thought that the fragility of protocells made it unlikely for them to be preserved in rock formations. However, later studies showed the preservation of cellular features by a rapid encrustation of cells with cationic minerals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). The rapid encrustation and preservation of cells observed in our study (Fig. S84-S85) is in accordance with the proposition that environmental conditions influence the extent of cellular preservation. Our study aligns with the interpretations from these studies that environmental conditions play a pivotal role in determining the extent of cellular preservation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>For the first time, our investigations have been able to reproduce morphologies of most Archaean microfossils from wall-less, extant cells. Apart from reproducing the morphologies, we also presented a step-by-step biological process by which Archaean organic structures could have formed. Based on these results, we propose that Archaean microfossils were likely liposome-like cells, which had evolved mechanisms for energy conservation but not for regulating cell morphology and replication. In an earlier study, we have shown that the morphologies of such primitive cells are determined by environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>) rather than the information encoded in their genome. Given this lack of intrinsic ability to regulate their morphology, we argue that morphological features such as cell size, shape, or cytological complexity are reliable factors in interpreting either the phylogeny or the physiology of microfossils (at least from Archaean Eon). Rather than attempting to assign present-day taxonomies to these microfossils, we suggest that these microfossils represent primitive protocells proposed by the theory of chemical evolution. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to provide paleontological evidence of the possible existence of protocells on the Palaeoarchaean Earth.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Microfossils from the Paleoarchean Eon represent the oldest evidence of life, but their nature has been strongly debated among scientists. To resolve this, the authors reconstructed the lifecycles of Archaean organisms by transforming a Gram-positive bacterium into a primitive lipid vesicle-like state and simulating early Earth conditions. They successfully replicated all morphologies and life cycles of Archaean microfossils and studied cell degradation processes over several years, finding that encrustation with minerals like salt preserved these cells as fossilized organic carbon. Their findings suggest that microfossils from 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago were likely liposome-like protocells with energy conservation pathways but without regulated morphology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have crafted a compelling narrative about the morphological similarities between microfossils from various sites and proliferating wall-deficient bacterial cells, providing detailed comparisons that have never been demonstrated in this detail before. The extensive number of supporting figures is impressive, highlighting numerous similarities. While conclusively proving that these microfossils are proliferating protocells morphologically akin to those studied here is challenging, we applaud this effort as the first detailed comparison between microfossils and morphologically primitive cells.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>This provocative manuscript from presents valuable comparisons of the morphologies of Archaean bacterial microfossils to those of microbes transformed under environmental conditions that mimic those present on Earth during the same Eon, although the evidence in support of the conclusions is currently incomplete. The reasons include that taphonomy is not presently considered, and a greater diversity of experimental environmental conditions is not evaluated -- which is important because we ultimately do not know much about Earth's early environments. The authors may want to reframe their conclusions to reflect this work as a first step towards an interpretation of some microfossils as 'proto-cells,' and less so as providing strong support for this hypothesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding the taphonomic alterations: The editor and reviewers are correct in pointing out this issue. Taphonomic alteration of the microfossils attains special significance in the case of microorganisms, as they lack rigid structures and are prone to morphological alterations during or after their fossilization. We are acutely aware of this issue and have conducted long-term experiments (lasting two years) to observe how cells die, decay, and get preserved. A large section of the manuscript (pages 11 to 20) and a substantial portion of the supplementary information is dedicated to understanding the taphonomic alterations. To the best of our knowledge, these are among the longest experiments done to understand the taphonomic alterations of the cells within laboratory conditions.</p>
<p>Recent reports by Orange et al. (1,2)  showed that under favorable environmental conditions, cells could be fossilized rather rapidly with little morphological modifications. We observed a similar phenomenon in this work. Cells in our study underwent rapid encrustation with cations from the growth media. We have analyzed the morphological changes over a period of 18 months. After 18 months, the softer biofilms got encrusted entirely in salt and turned solid (Fig. ). Despite this transformation, morphologically intact cells could still be observed within these structures. This suggests that the cells inhabiting Archaean coastal marine environments could undergo rather rapid encrustation, and their morphological features could be preserved in the geological record with little taphonomic alteration.</p>
<p>Regarding the environmental conditions: We are in total agreement with the reviewers that much is unknown about Archaean geology and its environmental conditions. Like the present-day Earth, Archaean Earth certainly had regions that greatly differed in their environmental conditions—volcanic freshwater ponds, brines, mildly halophilic coastal marine environments, and geothermal and hydrothermal vents, to name a few. Our experimental design focuses on one environment we have a relatively good understanding of rather than the rest of the planet, of which we know little. Below, we list our reasons for restricting to coastal marine environments and studying cells under mildly halophilic experimental conditions.</p>
<p>(1) Very little continental crust from Haden and early Archaean Eon exists on the presentday Earth. Much of our geochemical understanding of this time period was a result of studying the Pilbara Iron Formations and the Barberton Greenstone Belt. Geological investigations suggest that these sites were coastal marine environments. The salinity of coastal marine environments is higher than that of open oceans due to the greater water evaporation within these environments. Moreover, brines were discovered within pillow basalts within the Barberton greenstone belt, suggesting that the salinity within these sites is higher or similar to marine environments.</p>
<p>(2) We are not certain about the environmental conditions that could have supported the origin of life. However, all currently known Archaean microfossils were reported from coastal marine environments (3.8-2.4Ga). This suggests that proto-life likely flourished in mildly halophilic environments, similar to the experimental conditions employed in our study.</p>
<p>(3) The chemical analysis of Archaean microfossils also suggests that they lived in saltrich environments, as most, if not all, microfossils are closely associated, often encrusted in a thin layer of salt.</p>
<p>However, we concur with the reviewers that our interpretations should be reassessed if Archaean microfossils that greatly differ from the currently known microfossils are to be discovered or if new microfossils are to be reported from environments other than coastal marine sites.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Microfossils from the Paleoarchean Eon represent the oldest evidence of life, but their nature has been strongly debated among scientists. To resolve this, the authors reconstructed the lifecycles of Archaean organisms by transforming a Gram-positive bacterium into a primitive lipid vesicle-like state and simulating early Earth conditions. They successfully replicated all morphologies and life cycles of Archaean microfossils and studied cell degradation processes over several years, finding that encrustation with minerals like salt preserved these cells as fossilized organic carbon. Their findings suggest that microfossils from 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago were likely liposome-like protocells with energy conservation pathways but without regulated morphology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have crafted a compelling narrative about the morphological similarities between microfossils from various sites and proliferating wall-deficient bacterial cells, providing detailed comparisons that have never been demonstrated in this detail before. The extensive number of supporting figures is impressive, highlighting numerous similarities. While conclusively proving that these microfossils are proliferating protocells morphologically akin to those studied here is challenging, we applaud this effort as the first detailed comparison between microfossils and morphologically primitive cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the species used in this study closely resembles the fossils morphologically, it would be beneficial to provide a clearer explanation for its selection. The literature indicates that many bacteria, if not all, can be rendered cell wall-deficient, making the rationale for choosing this specific species somewhat unclear. While this manuscript includes clear morphological comparisons, we believe the authors do not adequately address the limitations of using modern bacterial species in their study. All contemporary bacteria have undergone extensive evolutionary changes, developing complex and intertwined genetic pathways unlike those of early life forms. Consequently, comparing existing bacteria with fossilized life forms is largely hypothetical, a point that should be more thoroughly emphasized in the discussion.</p>
<p>Another weak aspect of the study is the absence of any quantitative data. While we understand that obtaining such data for microfossils may be challenging, it would be helpful to present the frequencies of different proliferative events observed in the bacterium used. Additionally, reflecting on the chemical factors in early life that might cause these distinct proliferation modes would provide valuable context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding our choice of using modern organisms or this particular bacterial species:</p>
<p>Based on current scientific knowledge, it is logical to infer that cellular life originated as protocells; nevertheless, there has been no direct geological evidence for the existence of such cells on early Earth. Hence, protocells remain an entirely theoretical concept. Moreover, protocells are considered to have been far more primitive than present-day cells. Surprisingly, this lack of sophistication was the biggest challenge in understanding protocells. Designing experiments in which cells are primitive (but not as primitive as non-living lipid vesicles) and still retain a functional resemblance to a living cell does pose some practical challenges. Laboratory experiments with substitute (proxy) protocells almost always come with some limitations. Although not a perfect proxy, we believe protocells and protoplasts share certain characteristics. Having said that, we would like to reemphasize that protoplasts are not protocells. Our reasons for using protoplasts as model organisms and working with this bacterial species (Exiguobacterium Strain-Molly) are based on several scientific and practical criteria listed below.</p>
<p>(1) Irrespective of cell physiology and intracellular complexity, we believe that protoplasts and protocells share certain similarities in the biophysical properties of their cytoplasm. We explained our reasoning in the manuscript introduction and in our previous manuscripts (Kanaparthi et al., 2024 &amp; Kanaparthi et al., 2023). In short, to be classified as a cell, even a protocell should possess minimal biosynthetic pathways, a physiological mechanism of harvesting free energy from the surrounding (energy-yielding pathways), and a means of replicating its genetic material and transferring it to the daughter cells. These minimal physiological processes could incorporate considerable cytoplasmic complexity. Hence, the biophysical properties of the protocell cytoplasm could have resembled those of the cytoplasm of protoplasts, irrespective of the genomic complexity.</p>
<p>(2) Irrespective of their physiology, protoplasts exhibit several key similarities to protocells, such as their inherent inability to regulate their morphology or reproduction. This similarity was pointed out in previous studies (3). Despite possessing all the necessary genetic information, protoplasts undergo reproduction through simple physiochemical processes independent of canonical molecular biological processes. This method of reproduction is considered to have been erratic and rather primitive, akin to the theoretical propositions on protocells. Although protoplasts are fully evolved cells with considerable physiological complexity, the above-mentioned biophysical similarities suggest that the protoplast life cycle could morphologically resemble that of protocells (in no other aspect except for their morphology and reproduction).</p>
<p>(3) Physiologically or genomically different species of Gram-positive protoplasts are shown to exhibit similar morphologies. This suggests that when Gram-positive bacteria lose their cell wall and turn into a protoplast,  they reproduce in a similar manner independent of physiological or genome-based differences. As morphology and only morphology is key to our study, at least from the scope of this study, intracellular complexity is not a key consideration.</p>
<p>(4) This specific strain was isolated from submerged freshwater springs in the Dead Sea. This isolate and members of this bacterial genus are known to have been well acclimatized to growing in a wide range of salt concentrations and in different salt species. This is important for our study (this and previous manuscript), in which cells must be grown not only at high salt concentrations (1-15%) but in different salts like NaCl, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and KCl.</p>
<p>(5) Our initial interest in this isolate was due to its ability to reduce iron at high salt concentrations. Given that most spherical microfossils are found in Archaean-banded iron formations covered in pyrite, this suggests that these microfossils could have been reducing oxidized iron species like Fe(III). Nevertheless, over the course of our study, we realized the complexities of live cell staining and imaging under anoxic conditions. Given that the scope of the manuscript is restricted only to comparing the morphologies, not the physiology, we abandoned the idea of growing cells under anoxic conditions.</p>
<p>Based on these observations, cell physiology may not be a key consideration, at least within the scope of studying microfossil morphology. However, we want to emphasize again that “We do not claim present-day protoplasts are protocells.”</p>
<p>Regarding the absence of quantitative data:</p>
<p>We are unsure what the reviewer meant by the absence of quantitative data. Is it from the cell size/reproductive pathways perspective or from a microfossil/ecological perspective? At the risk of being portrayed in a bad light, we admit that we did not present quantitative data from either of these perspectives. In our defense, this was not due to our lack of effort but due to the practical limitations imposed by our model organism.</p>
<p>If the reviewer means the quantitative data regarding cell sizes and morphology: In our previous work, we studied the relationship between protoplast morphology, growth rate, and environmental conditions. In that study, we proposed that the growth rate is one factor that regulates protoplast morphology. Nevertheless, we did not observe uniformity in the sizes of the cells. This lack of uniformity was not just between the replicates but even among the cells grown within the same culture flask or the cells within the same microscopic field. Moreover, cells are often observed to be reproducing either by forming internal or external or by both these processes at the same time. The size and morphological differences among cells within a growth stage could be explained by the physiological and growth rate heterogenicity among cells.</p>
<p>Bacterial growth curves and their partition into different stages (lag, log &amp; stationary), in general, represent the growth dynamics of an entire bacterial population. Nevertheless, averaging the data obscures the behavior of individual cells (4,5). It is known that genetically identical cells within a single bacterial population could exhibit considerable cell-to-cell variation in gene expression (6,7) and growth rates (8). The reason for such stochastic behavior among monoclonal cells has not been well understood. In the case of normal cells, morphological manifestation of these variations is restricted by a rigid cell wall. Given the absence of a cell wall in protoplasts, we assume such cell-to-cell variations in growth rate is manifested in cell morphology. This makes it challenging to quantitatively determine variations in cell sizes or the size increase in a statically robust manner, even in monoclonal cells.</p>
<p>Although this lack of uniformity in cell sizes should not be perceived as a limitation, this behavior is consistently observed among microfossils. Spherical microfossils of similar morphology but different sizes were reported from different microfossil sites (9,10). In this regard, both protoplasts and microfossils are very similar.</p>
<p>If the reviewer means the quantitative data from an ecological perspective:</p>
<p>Based on the elemental composition and the isotopic signatures of the organic carbon, we can deduce if these structures are of biological origin or not. However, any further interpretation of this data to annotate these microfossils to a particular physiology group is fraught with errors. Hence, we refrain from making any inferences about the physiology and ecological function of these microfossils. This lack of clarity on the physiology of microfossils reduces the chance of quantitative studies on their ecological functions. Moreover, we would like to re-emphasize that the scope of this work is restricted to morphological comparison and is not targeted at understanding the ecological function of these microfossils. This narrow objective also limits the nature of the quantitative data we could present.</p>
<p>Moreover, developing a quantitative understanding of some phenomena could be technically challenging. Many theories on the origin of life, like chemical evolution, started with the qualitative observation that lightning could mediate the synthesis of biologically relevant organic carbon. Our quantitative understanding of this process is still being explored and debated even to this day.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In summary, the manuscript describes life-cycle-related morphologies of primitive vesiclelike states (Em-P) produced in the laboratory from the Gram-positive bacterium Exiguobacterium Strain-Molly) under assumed Archean environmental conditions. Em-P morphologies (life cycles) are controlled by the &quot;native environment&quot;. In order to mimic Archean environmental conditions, soy broth supplemented with Dead Sea salt was used to cultivate Em-Ps. The manuscript compares Archean microfossils and biofilms from selected photos with those laboratory morphologies. The photos derive from publications on various stratigraphic sections of Paleo- to Neoarchean ages. Based on the similarity of morphologies of microfossils and Em-Ps, the manuscript concludes that all Archean microfossils are in fact not prokaryotes, but merely &quot;sacks of cytoplasm&quot;.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The approach of the authors to recognize the possibility that &quot;real&quot; cells were not around in the Archean time is appealing. The manuscript reflects the very hard work by the authors composing the Em-Ps used for comparison and selecting the appropriate photo material of fossils.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the basic idea is very interesting, the manuscript includes flaws and falls short in presenting supportive data. The manuscript makes too simplistic assumptions on the &quot;Archean paleoenvironment&quot;. First, like in our modern world, the environmental conditions during the Archean time were not globally the same. Second, we do not know much about the Archean paleoenvironment due to the immense lack of rock records. More so, the Archean stratigraphic sections from where the fossil material derived record different paleoenvironments: shelf to tidal flat and lacustrine settings, so differences must have been significant. Finally, the Archean spanned 2.500 billion years and it is unlikely that environmental conditions remained the same. Diurnal or seasonal variations are not considered. Sediment types are not considered. Due to these reasons, the laboratory model of an Archean paleoenvironment and the life therein is too simplistic. Another aspect is that eucaryote cells are described from Archean rocks, so it seems unlikely that prokaryotes were not around at the same time. Considering other fossil evidence preserved in Archean rocks except for microfossils, the many early Archean microbialites that show baffling and trapping cannot be explained without the presence of &quot;real cells&quot;. With respect to lithology: chert is a rock predominantly composed of silica, not salt. The formation of Em-Ps in the &quot;salty&quot; laboratory set-up seems therefore not a good fit to evaluate chert fossils. Formation of structures in sediment is one step. The second step is their preservation. However, the second aspect of taphonomy is largely excluded in the manuscript, and the role of fossilization (lithification) of Em-Ps is not discussed. This is important because Archean rock successions are known for their tectonic and hydrothermal overprint, as well as recrystallization over time. Some of the comparisons of laboratory morphologies with fossil microfossils and biofilms are incorrect because scales differ by magnitudes. In general, one has to recognize that prokaryote cell morphologies do not offer many variations. It is possible to arrive at the morphologies described in various ways including abiotic ones.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding the simplistic presumptions on the Archaean Eon environmental conditions, we provided a detailed explanation of this issue in our response to the eLife evaluation. In short, we agree with the reviewer that little is known about the Archaean Eon environmental conditions at a planetary scale. Hence, we restricted our study to one particular environment of which we had a comparatively good understanding. The Archaean Eon spanned 2.5 billion years. However, most of the microfossil sites we discussed in the manuscript are older than 3 billion years, with one exception (2.4 billion years old Turee Creek microfossils). We presume that conditions within this niche (coastal marine) environment could not have changed greatly until 2Ga, after which there have been major changes in the ocean salt composition and salinities.</p>
<p>In the manuscript, we discussed extensively the reasons for restricting our study to these particular environmental conditions. Further explanations of these choices are presented in our response to the eLife evaluation (also see our previous manuscript). In short, the fact that all known microfossils are restricted to coastal marine environments justifies the experimental conditions employed in our study. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that all lab-based studies involve some extent of simplification. This gap/mismatch is even wider when it comes to studies involving origin or early life on Earth.</p>
<p>We are not arguing that prokaryotes are not around at this time. The key message of the manuscript is that they are present, but they have not developed intracellular mechanisms to regulate their morphology and remained primitive in this aspect.</p>
<p>The sizes of the microfossils and cells from our study were similar in most cases. However, we agree with the reviewer that they deviated considerably in some cases, for example, S70, S73, and S83. These size variations are limited to sedimentary structures like laminations rather than cells. These differences should be expected as we try to replicate the real-life morphologies of biofilms that could have extended over large swats of natural environments in a 2ml volume chamber slide. More specifically, in Fig. S70, there is a considerable size mismatch. But, in Fig. S73, the sizes were comparable between A &amp; C (of course, the size of our reproduction did not match B). In the case of Fig. S83, we do not see a huge size mismatch.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>We would like to provide several suggestions for changes in text and additions to data analysis.</p>
<p>39-41: It has been stated that reconstructing the lifecycle is the only way of understanding the nature of these microfossils. First of all, I would rephrase this to 'the most promising way', as there are always multiple approaches to comparing phenomena.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer's suggestion. The suggested changes have been made (line 41).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>125: Please rephrase &quot;under the environmental condition of early Earth&quot; to &quot;under experimental conditions possibly resembling the conditions of the Paleoarchean Eon&quot;. Now it sounds like the exact environmental conditions have been produced, which has already been debated in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer's suggestion. The suggested changes have been made (line 127).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>125: Please mention the fold change in size, the original size in numbers, and whether this change is statistically significant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the above sections of this document, we explained our reservations about presenting the exact number.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>128: Have you found a difference in the relative percentages of modes of reproduction? In other words, is there a difference in percentage between forming internal daughter cells or a string of external daughter cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We explained our reservations about presenting the exact number above. But this has been extensively discussed in our accompaining manuscript. We want to reemphasize that the scope of this manuscript is restricted to comparing morphologies rather than providing a mechanistic explanation of the reproduction process.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>151: A similar model for endocytosis has already been described in proliferating wall-less cells (Kapteijn et al., 2023). In the discussion, please compare your results with the observations made in that paper.</p>

<p>This is an oversight on our part. The manuscript suggested by the reviewer has now been added (line 154 &amp; 155).</p>

<p>We changed this according to the reviewers' suggestion (line 168).</p>

<p>433: Please elaborate on why the results are not shown. This sounds like a statement that should be substantiated further.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To observe growth and simultaneously image the cells, we conducted these experiments in chamber slides (2ml volume). Over time, we observed cells growing and breaking out of the salt crust (Fig. S86, S87 &amp; Movie 22) and a gradual increase in the turbidity of the media. Although not quantitative, this is a qualitative indication of growth. We did not take precise measurements for several reasons. This sample is precious; it took us almost two years to solidify the biofilm completely, as shown in Fig. S84A. Hence, it was in limited supply, which prevented us from inoculating these salt crusts into large volumes of fresh media. Given a long period of starvation, these cells often exhibited a long lag phase (several days), and there wasn't enough volume to do OD measurements over time.</p>
<p>We also crushed the solidified biofilm with a sterile spatula before transferring it into the chamber slide with growth media. This resulted in debris in the form of small solid particles, which interfered with our OD measurements. These practical considerations made it challenging to determine the growth precisely. Despite these challenges, we measured an OD of 4 in some chamber slides after two weeks of incubation. Given that these measurements were done haphazardly, we chose not to present this data.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer #2  for carefully reading the manuscript and such an elaborate list of questions. The revisions suggested have definitely improved the quality of the manuscript. Here, we would like to address some of the questions that came up repeatedly below. One frequently asked question is regarding the letters denoting the individual figures within the images. For comparison purposes, we often reproduced previously published images. To maintain a consistent figure style, we often have to block the previous denotations with an opaque square and give a new letter.</p>
<p>The second question that appeared repeatedly below is the missing scale bars in some of the images within a figure. We often did not include a scale bar in the images when this image is an enlarged section of another image within the same figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Title: Please consider being more precise in the title. Microfossils are only one fossil group of &quot;oldest life&quot;. Perhaps better: &quot;On the nature of some microfossils in Archean rocks&quot;. (see also Line 37).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Authors’ response: The title conveys a broader message without quantitative insinuations. If our manuscript had been titled &quot;On the nature of all known Archaean microfossils,” we should have agreed with the reviewer's suggestion and changed it to &quot;On the nature of some microfossils in Archean rocks&quot;. As it is not, we respectfully decline to make this modification.</p>

<p>Line 84ff: This is a somewhat sweeping statement. Please remember that there are microbialites in such rocks that require already a high level of biofilm organization. The existence of cyanobacteria-type microbes in the Archean is also increasingly considered.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are aware of literature that labeled the clusters of Archaean microfossils as biofilms and layered structures as microbialites or stromatolite-like structures. However, the use of these terms is increasingly being discouraged. A more recent consensus among researchers suggests annotating these structures simply as sedimentary structures, as microbially induced sedimentary structures (MISS).</p>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer’s comment that Archaean microfossils exhibit a high level of biofilm organization. We are not aware of any studies that have conducted such comprehensive research on the architecture of Archaean biofilms. We are not even certain if these clusters of Archaean cells could even be labeled as biofilms in the true sense of the term. We presently lack an exact definition of a biofilm. In our study, we do see sedimentation and bacteria and their encapsulation in cell debris. From a broader perspective, any such aggregation of cells enclosed in cell debris could be annotated as a biofilm. However, more in-depth studies show that biofilm is not a random but a highly organized structure. Different bacterial species have different biofilm architectures and chemical composition. The multispecies biofilms in natural environments are even more complex. We do agree with the reviewer that these structures could broadly be labeled as biofilms, but we presently lack a good, if any, understanding of the Archaean biofilm architecture.</p>
<p>Regarding the annotation of microfossils as cyanobacteria, we respectfully disagree with the reviewer. This is not a new concept. Many of the Archaean microfossils were annotated as cyanobacteria at the time of their discovery. This annotation is not without controversy. With the advent of genome-based studies, researchers are increasingly moving away from this school of thought.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer that debris cannot be definitely differentiated. Traditionally, annotations given to microfossil structures such as biofilm, intact cells, or laminations were all based on morphological similarities with existing structures observed in microorganisms. Given that the structures observed in our study are very similar to the microfossil structures, it is logical to make such inferences. Scales in A &amp; B match perfectly well. The structure in C is much larger, but, as we mentioned in reply to one of the reviewer’s earlier questions, some of the structures from natural environments could not be reproduced at scale in lab experiments. Working in a 2 ml chamber slides does impose some restrictions.</p>

<p>Figure 8: The figure does not show any honeycomb patterns. The &quot;gaps&quot; in the Moodies laminae are known as lenticular particles in biofilms. They form by desiccated and shriveledup biofilm that mineralizes in situ. Sometimes also entrapped gases induce precipitation. Note also that the modelled material shows a kind of skin around the blobs that are not present in the Moodies material.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that entrapped gas bubbles could have formed lenticular gaps. In the manuscript, we did not discount this possibility. However, if that is the case, one should explain why we often find clumps of organic carbon within these gaps. As we presented a step-by-step transformation of parallel layers of cells into laminations, which also had similar lenticular gaps, we believe this is a more plausible way such structures could have formed. In the end, there could have been more than one way such structures could have been formed.</p>
<p>We do see the honeycomb pattern in the hollow gaps. Often, the 3D-rendering of the STED images obscures some details. Hence, in the figure legend, we referred to the supplementary figures also show the sequence of steps involved in the formation of such a pattern.</p>

<p>Line 405-417: During deposition of clastic sediment any hollow space would be compressed during burial and settling. It is rare that additional pore space (except between the graingrain-contacts) remains visible, especially after consolidation. The exception would be if very early silicification took place filling in any pore space. What about EPS being replaced by mineralic substance? The arguments are not convincing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are suggesting that EPS or cell debris is rapidly encrusted by cations from the surrounding environment and gets solidified into rigid structures. This makes it possible for the structures to be preserved in the fossil record. We believe that hollow structures like the lenticular gaps will be filled up with silica.</p>
<p>We do not agree with the reviewer’s comment that all biological structures will be compressed. If this is true, there should be no intact microfossils in the Archaean sedimentary structures, which is definitely not the case.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 419-430: Lithification takes place within the sediment and therefore is commonly controlled by the chemistry of pore water and chemical compounds that derive from the dissolution of minerals close by. Another aspect to consider is whether &quot;desiccation cracks&quot; on that small scale may be artefacts related to sample preparation (?).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that desiccation cracks could have formed during the sample preparation for SEM imaging, as this involves drying the biofilms. However, we observed that the sample we used for SEM is a completely solidified biofilm (Fig. S84), so we expect little change in its morphology during drying. Moreover, visible cracks and pointy edges were also observed in wet samples, as shown in Fig. S87.</p>

<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>Line 477f: &quot;all known microfossil morphologies&quot; - is this a correct statement? Also, would the Archean world provide only one kind of &quot;EM-P type&quot;? Morphologies of prokaryote cells (spherical, rod-shaped, filamentous) in general are very simple, and any researcher of Precambrian material will appreciate the difficulties in concluding on taxonomy. There are papers that investigate putative microfossils in chert as features related to life cycles. Microfossil-papers commonly appear not to be controversial give and take some specific cases.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We made a mistake in using the term “all known microfossil morphologies.” We have now changed it to “all known spherical microfossils” from this statement (line 483). However, we do not agree with the statement that microfossil manuscripts tend not to be controversial. Assigning taxonomy to microfossils is anything but controversial. This has been intensely debated among the scientific community.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 494-496: This statement should be in the Introduction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. In an earlier version of the manuscript this statement was in the introduction. To put this statement in its proper context, it needs to be associated with a discussion about the importance of morphology in the identification of microfossils. The present version of the manuscript do not permit moving an entire paragraph into the introduction. Hence, we think making this statement in the discussion section is appropriate.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 484ff. The discussion on biogenicity of microfossils is long-standing (e.g., biogenicity criteria by Buick 1990 and other papers), and nothing new. In paleontology, modern prokaryotes may serve as models but everyone working on Archean microfossils will agree that these cannot correspond to modern groups. An example is fossil &quot;cyanobacteria&quot; that is thought to have been around already in the early Archean. While morphologically very similar to modern cyanobacteria, their genetic information certainly differed - how much will perhaps remain undisclosed by material of that high age.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we agree with the reviewer that there has been a longstanding conflict on the topic of biogenicity of microfossils. However, we have never come across manuscripts suggesting that modern microorganisms should only be used as models. If at all, there have been numerous manuscripts suggesting that these microfossils represent cyanobacteria, streptomycetes, and methanotrophs. Regarding the annotation of microfossils as cyanobacteria, we addressed this issue in one of the previous questions raised by the reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 498ff: Can the variation of morphology and sizes of the EM-Ps be demonstrated statistically? Line 505ff are very speculative statements. Relabeling of what could be vesicles as &quot;microfossils&quot; appears inappropriate. Contrary to what is stated in the manuscript, the morphologies of the Dresser Formation vesicles do not resemble the S3 to S14 spheroids from the Strelley Pool, the Waterfall, and Mt Goldsworthy sites listed in the manuscript. The spindle-shaped vesicles in Wacey et al are not addressed by this manuscript. What roles in mineral and element composition would have played diagenetic alteration and the extreme hydrothermal overprint and weathering typical for Dresser material? S59, S60 do not show what is stated, and the material derives from the Barberton Greenstone Belt, not the Pilbara.</p>
<p>Please see the comments below regarding the supplementary images.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not observe huge variations in the cell morphology. Morphologies, in most cases, were restricted to spherical cells with intracellular vesicles or filamentous extensions. Regarding the sizes of the cells, we see some variations. However, we are reluctant to provide exact numbers. We have presented our reasons above.</p>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer’s comments. We see quite some similarities between Dresser formation microfossils and our cells. Not just the similarities, we have provided step-by-step transformation of cells that resulted in these morphologies. We fail to see what exactly is the speculation here. The argument that they should be classified as abiotic structures is based on the opinion that cells do form such structures. We clearly show here that they can, and these biological structures resemble Dresser formation microfossils more closely than the abiotic structures.</p>
<p>Regarding the figures S3-S14. We think they are morphologically very similar. Often, it's not just comparing both images or making exact reproductions (which is not possible). We should focus on reproducing the distinctive morphological features of these microfossils.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that we did not reproduce all the structures reported by Wacey’s original manuscript, such as spherical structures. We are currently preparing another manuscript to address the filamentous microfossils. These spindle-like structures will be addressed in this subsequent work.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer, we often have difficulties differentiating between cells and vesicles. This is not a problem in the early stages of growth. During the log phase, a significant volume of the cell consists of the cytoplasm, with hollow vesicles constituting only a minor volume (Fig. 1B or S1A). During the later growth stages (Fig. 1E7F or S11), cells were almost hollow, with numerous daughter cells within them. These cells often resemble hollow vesicles rather than cells. However, given these are biologically formed structures, and one could argue that these vesicles are still alive as there is still a minimal amount of cytoplasm (Fig. S27). Hence, we should consider them as cells until they break apart to release daughter cells.</p>
<p>Regarding Figures S59 and S60, we did not claim either of these microfossils is from Pilbara Iron Formations. The legend of Figure S59 clearly states that these structures are from Buck Reef Chert, originally reported by Tice et al., 2006 (Figure 16 in the original manuscript). The legend of Figure S60 says these structures were originally reported by Barlow et al., 2018, from the Turee Creek Formation.</p>

<p>As shown in several subsequent figures, the hollow spherical vesicles are compressed first into honeycomb-like structures, and they often undergo further compression to form lamination-like structures.
