<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Cells are exposed to a wide variety of internal and external stresses. Whereas many studies have focused on cellular responses to acute and severe stresses, little is known about how cellular systems adapt to sublethal chronic stresses. Using mammalian cells in culture, we discovered that they adapt to chronic mild stresses, notably proteotoxic stresses such as heat, by increasing their size and translation, thereby scaling the amount of total protein. These adaptations render them more resilient to persistent and subsequent stresses. We demonstrate that Hsf1, well known for its role in acute stress responses, is required for the cell size increase, and that the molecular chaperone Hsp90 is essential for coupling the cell size increase to augmented translation. We term this translational reprogramming the “rewiring stress response”, and propose that this protective process of chronic stress adaptation contributes to the increase in size as cells get older, and that its failure promotes aging.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stress has shaped the interactions between organisms and their environment since the origin of the first cell (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Kultz, 2020b</xref></italic>). Throughout their lifetime, cells and organisms are exposed to different kinds of environmental and cell-intrinsic stresses such as heat, genotoxic agents, oxidative agents, alterations of external pH, hypoxia, nutrient deficiency, osmotic changes, protein misfolding and aggregation, and various pathological conditions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Kristensen et al., 2020</xref></italic>). While intense acute stresses can cause lethal damage, in a physiological environment, cells are mostly exposed to mild and often chronic stresses, so that cells have a chance to adapt (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bijlsma and Loeschcke, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Kultz, 2020a</xref></italic>). For example, body or tissue temperature increases of only a few degrees constitute a mild heat stress at the cellular level (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Mainster et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Evans et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">van Norren and Vos, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Rzechorzek et al., 2022</xref></italic>). Similarly, the ecosystem may contain several pollutants that cause a continuous mild oxidative stress (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Taborsky et al., 2021</xref></italic>). Cells and organisms cannot easily escape such stresses and must therefore adapt.</p>
<p>Because cells and organisms need to live with such lifelong stresses, evolution has endowed them with highly conserved stress response pathways (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Liu et al., 1997</xref></italic>). Heat-shock factor 1 (Hsf1), a transcription factor, is the master regulator of cellular stress management (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Li et al., 2017</xref></italic>). Hsf1 governs a protective transcriptional program known as the heat-shock response (HSR), which involves the selective transcription of stress response proteins known as heat-shock proteins (Hsps), most of which are molecular chaperones (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Lindquist and Craig, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Richter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Vihervaara and Sistonen, 2014</xref></italic>). Molecular chaperones collectively promote the initial folding of newly made proteins, the refolding of unfolded or misfolded proteins, the dissociation of protein aggregates, and the degradation of terminally misfolded or aggregated, and potentially toxic, proteins (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hartl et al., 2011</xref></italic>). Overall, this process of maintaining protein homeostasis is known as proteostasis. During acute stress of different kinds, apart from the Hsf1-mediated transcriptional response, eukaryotic cells elicit a specific adaptive stress response, known as the integrated stress response (ISR). The ISR reprograms translation to avoid overloading the proteostasis system (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Persson et al., 2020</xref></italic>). In the ISR, global cap-dependent protein translation is reduced, while the translation of some proteins, needed to deal with the challenge, is specifically enhanced.</p>
<p>Hsps are not only required for cells to respond to stress. Even without stress, cells need a basal level of Hsps for folding nascent polypeptide chains, refolding partially denatured or misfolded proteins, or for their degradation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Balchin et al., 2016</xref></italic>). Hsps are categorized into different families based on their molecular weights. Among those, Hsp90 is essential for the viability and growth of eukaryotic cells and organisms, and it is a major hub of cellular proteostasis through a large number of client proteins (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Taipale et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Echeverria et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Johnson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Fierro-Monti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bhattacharya et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bhattacharya and Picard, 2021</xref></italic>). It is one of the most abundant proteins in cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Nollen and Morimoto, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Mollapour et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Finka and Goloubinoff, 2013</xref></italic>), and in mammals, a large fraction of it is indeed required during prenatal development, and for tissues and cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bhattacharya et al., 2022</xref></italic>). In mammalian cells, there are two different cytosolic Hsp90 isoforms, which are encoded by two different genes, Hsp90α (encoded by the gene <italic>HSP90AA1)</italic> and Hsp90β (encoded by <italic>HSP90AB1</italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Sreedhar et al., 2004</xref></italic>). Hsp90α is the more stress-inducible isoform whereas Hsp90β is more constitutively expressed. There are extensive overlapping functional similarities between the two Hsp90 isoforms, which are 84% identical in humans, but there is also some evidence for isoform-specific functions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Maiti and Picard, 2022</xref></italic>). However, to what extent mammalian cells require these two isoforms during stress adaptation is not clear.</p>
<p>Cellular stress responses, molecular chaperones, and proteostasis are interconnected with cellular and organismal aging (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hipp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bhattacharya and Picard, 2021</xref></italic>). Although the process of aging is broadly influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and extrinsic factors, it is increasingly apparent that most of these factors ultimately interface with cellular stress response mechanisms (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Kourtis and Tavernarakis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Vilchez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Lu et al., 2020</xref></italic>). One of the hallmarks of aging is cellular senescence (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Childs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">McHugh and Gil, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Calcinotto et al., 2019</xref></italic>), which is characterized by a number of features, including a larger cell size. Earlier studies claimed that, as cells become senescent, they stop dividing. But since cell growth, defined as the addition of cell mass, continues, senescent cells become larger (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hayflick and Moorhead, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Mitsui and Schneider, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adolphe et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Yang et al., 2011</xref></italic>). That is why cells of older mammalian indiviuals are often two or three times larger than those of younger ones (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cristofalo and Kritchevsky, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Treton and Courtois, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Demidenko and Blagosklonny, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Mammoto et al., 2019</xref></italic>). Remarkably, recent studies have established that a larger cell size is not a consequence, but rather the cause of senescence. If cells fail to scale the amount of their macromolecules as they become larger, this causes cytoplasmic dilution and induces senescence (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Neurohr et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Lanz et al., 2022</xref></italic>). The question remains why mammalian cells increase their size to the point of becoming senescent. There are a number of indications that some cells increase their size in response to external cues or functional needs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Dhawan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Boehlke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Samak et al., 2016</xref></italic>). However, it is poorly understood whether the cell size itself is the target of regulation or a byproduct of some other adaptation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ginzberg et al., 2015</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Here we report that mammalian cells gradually enlarge their size to adapt to chronic mild stress (or “chronic stress” for short). Whereas the cellular response to acute stress has been extensively characterized (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Richter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Somero, 2020</xref></italic>), little is known about how cells adapt to chronic mild stress and to what extent certain Hsps or molecular chaperones are involved. We exposed cells to several chronic stresses to investigate these issues, notably also the role of specific cytosolic Hsp90 isoforms. We discovered that in response to chronic stress cells increase their size in an Hsf1-dependent fashion, and that their adaptation to chronic stress is different from the response to acute stress. Unlike acute stress, which causes a shutdown of global translation to reduce the protein burden, chronic stress induces global translation to increase the amount of total proteins. Hsp90, irrespective of its isoform, supports the increase in translation and, through this adaptation, the cell size increase.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>A mammalian cell model to study the effects of chronic mild stress</title>
<p>To study how mammalian cells adapt to chronic stress, we applied several stressors, such as mild heat shock (HS), hypoxia, sodium arsenite, and the protein misfolding agent L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZC), to several cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1A - figure supplement 1A</xref>). To gage the level of chronic stress, which we would consider mild for a given stressor, we decided that it would be the duration or the intensity, where cell death is ≤10%. To determine the chronic mild HS conditions, we kept all cell lines at different temperatures for seven days. We found the threshold for chronic HS to be 39 °C for HEK293T (HEK) and HCT116 cancer cells, and 40 °C for A549 cancer cells and the normal epithelial cell line RPE1. For hypoxia, we determined that 4 days of hypoxia (1% oxygen) are the appropriate threshold for chronic hypoxic stress. For both sodium arsenite and AZC, 5 μM for 5 days is an appropriate threshold for oxidative and proteotoxic stresses, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Chronic mild stress causes an increase in cell size</title>
<p>While we were checking cell death by flow cytometry to optimize the threshold for the different chronic stresses, we noticed that in all types of chronic stresses, cells increased their size over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1B - figure supplement 1B</xref>), as indicated by the forward scatter (FSC) intensity, which is proportional to the diameter (d) of the cell (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Tzur et al., 2011</xref></italic>). Measuring the cell diameter by microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">figure supplement 1C</xref>) confirmed the size increase suggested by the FSC values after 7 days of mild HS, verifying that FSC values can be used as a proxy for cell diameter. Assuming cells in suspension are a round ball, note that a 10% increase in cell diameter translates to more than a 30% increase in cell volume since volume = (4/3) × π × (d/2)<sup>3</sup>. It is well supported that mammalian cells control their size via modulation of the cell cycle (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ginzberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Miettinen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Varsano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cadart et al., 2018</xref></italic>). Specifically, a lengthening of the G1 phase is responsible for cell size increases. Hence, we determined whether this increase in cell size is caused by a cell cycle arrest. After seven days of chronic HS, we checked the cell cycle profiles of HEK and A549 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, the two cell lines showed different cell cycle patterns in chronic HS. While A549 cells have a slightly increased G1 population, HEK cells maintain a similar cell cycle profile. We repeated the analyses at different time points of chronic HS and found that at the initiation of chronic stress, there is a substantial number of cells in the G1 population for both cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Over time, the cell cycle stabilizes in a cell line-specific fashion, suggesting that cells are able to adapt to chronic HS. Importantly, despite the stabilization of the cell cycle during continued chronic stress, cells maintain an enlarged cell size (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) with an almost equal proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1F-G - figure supplement 1D</xref>) in the beginning of the stress or after 7 days of stress adaptation. To check if this cell size enlargement is reversible, we put the cells back at 37°C after 7 days of chronic HS. During this recovery period at 37°C, both HEK and A549 cells returned to their usual size (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>), and A549 cells also reverted back to a normal cell cycle profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 1I - figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>A minimal level of Hsp90 is required for chronic stress adaptation</title>
<p>A key question is how cells cope with and adapt to these chronic stresses. A complex network of molecular chaperones and their respective co-chaperones acts as a buffer to the myriad of changes during stress (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bijlsma and Loeschcke, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Richter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Horwich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref></italic>). The cytosolic Hsp90 isoforms are the most abundant molecular chaperones (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Jakob and Buchner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Mayer and Bukau, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Young et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Picard, 2002</xref></italic>). Since Hsp90 had been found to support the size increase of cardiomyocytes following myocardial infarction (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Tamura et al., 2019</xref></italic>), we wondered whether it plays any role in the stress- induced cell size increase, and if so, which one of the two cytosolic Hsp90 isoforms, that is Hsp90α or Hsp90β (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Maiti and Picard, 2022</xref></italic>). To address this, we used our human Hsp90α knockout (KO) and Hsp90β KO HEK and A549 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bhattacharya et al., 2022</xref></italic>). Note that hereafter we will refer to cells lacking one <italic>or</italic> the other isoform as Hsp90α/β KO cells and that their basal cell sizes are essentially indistinguishable from those of their respective wild-type cells. We observed that the loss of either one of the two isoforms makes them vulnerable to different chronic stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure 2B - figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, even in the absence of one Hsp90 isoform, cells enlarged their size during chronic HS, and hypoxic and oxidative stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure 2C-D - figure supplement 2B-C</xref>). This suggests that the stress-induced cell size increase is not directly associated with a particular cytosolic Hsp90 isoform.</p>

<title>The canonical Hsf1 activity regulates the cell size increase in response to chronic stress</title>
<p>Hsf1 is an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor that mediates the cytoprotective HSR throughout the eukaryotic kingdom (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Anckar and Sistonen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gomez-Pastor et al., 2018</xref></italic>). It is well established that Hsf1 activity increases in response to acute stresses (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Li et al., 2017</xref></italic>). During stress, mammalian Hsf1 monomers in the cytosol are activated to form trimers, which localize to the nucleus, bind DNA sequences known as heat shock elements (HSE), and trigger the transcription of target genes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Vihervaara and Sistonen, 2014</xref></italic>). It has been proposed that Hsp90 controls Hsf1 activity by titrating Hsf1 under non-stress conditions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Zou et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Leach et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hentze et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Kijima et al., 2018</xref></italic>). Using an Hsf1 reporter plasmid, we found that Hsp90α/β KO cells, and most prominently Hsp90α KO cells, have a higher basal level of Hsf1 activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In Hsp90α/β KO cells, the higher basal Hsf1 activity could be due to a larger number of Hsp90-free Hsf1 molecules. We did observe that there is more Hsf1 in the nucleus of Hsp90α/β KO cells in non-stressed conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), and yet Hsf1 becomes even more nuclear in cells of all three genotypes during chronic HS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This also translates to a higher Hsf1 activity, as we could observe with a Hsf1 reporter assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). To characterize the proteomic changes associated with Hsp90α/β KO and chronic HS, we performed quantitative label-free proteomic analyses of cells maintained in non-stressed conditions, and after one day and four days of HS. The proteomic data confirmed the increased basal Hsf1 activity that we had seen in Hsp90α/β KO cells with the Hsf1 reporter assay. Many proteins whose expression was known to be regulated by Hsf1 proved to be upregulated in Hsp90α/β KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">figure supplement 3A</xref> and source data 1). Under chronic HS, cells of all three genotypes were able to increase the expression of several Hsf1 target genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), reminiscent of what we had seen with the Hsf1 reporter assay. Thus, cells are perfectly capable of mounting a HSR in the absence of either one of the two Hsp90 isoforms, suggesting that their increased vulnerability to stress may be due to something else.</p>

<p>To obtain more direct experimental evidence for a role of Hsf1 in the cell size increase induced by chronic HS, we overexpressed WT Hsf1 and a transcriptionally defective Hsf1 mutant (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Kijima et al., 2018</xref></italic>) in HEK, A549, and RPE1 cells. We observed a strong induction of basal Hsf1 activity in cells overexpressing WT Hsf1 but not the mutant form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">figure supplement 3B</xref>), correlating with an increase in cell size under normal non-stress conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Taken together, our observations suggest a correlation between the canonical transcriptional Hsf1 activity and cell size. We further strengthened this correlation by determining the effect of inducing Hsf1 activity pharmacologically with capsaicin, which is known to trigger a calcium influx and HSR through the vanilloid receptor TRPV1 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hagenacker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Bromberg et al., 2013</xref></italic>). We found that A549 cells of all three genotypes display a capsaicin-induced and dose-dependent transcriptional Hsf1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">figure supplement 3C</xref>) and cell size increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">figure supplement 3D</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that the transcriptional Hsf1 activity is sufficient to cause a cell size increase. To determine whether Hsf1 is necessary for the cell size increase, we used RNA interference to knock down Hsf1 expression in A549 WT and Hsp90α KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">figure supplement 3E</xref>). Hsf1 knockdown cells exposed to chronic HS failed to display Hsf1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">figure supplement 3F</xref>), and could not increase their cell size during adaptation to chronic HS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>So far, we have only shown results obtained with established human cell lines. We also explored the link between Hsp90 and Hsf1 activity in mouse adult fibroblasts (MAFs) established from mice with only a single allele for cytosolic Hsp90 left. These are both homozygous <italic>hsp90α</italic> KO and heterozygous <italic>hsp90β</italic> KO, and will be referred to as 90αKO 90βHET (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bhattacharya et al., 2022</xref></italic>). These MAFs proved to be substantially bigger than WT MAFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">figure supplement 3G</xref>), and to display a several-fold higher basal Hsf1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">figure supplement 3H</xref>). It should be emphasized that these MAFs were obtained from adult mice that had escaped the stringent developmental attrition of embryos with this genotype through translational reprogramming of Hsp90β expression (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bhattacharya et al., 2022</xref></italic>). This may explain why these mutant MAFs, unlike WT MAFs, could not augment their Hsf1 activity nor increase their size any further in chronic HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">figure supplement 3I-J</xref>). At this point, we conclude that the HSR correlates with cell size during chronic stress, and that both outcomes are mediated by Hsf1.</p>

<title>Hsp90α/β KO cells overall maintain their chaperome and proteome complexity during chronic stress</title>
<p>Under normal physiological conditions, cells maintain proteostasis through a complex network of molecular chaperones and co-chaperones, a protein collective referred to as the cellular chaperome (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Joshi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Yan et al., 2020</xref></italic>). Cellular adaptation to stress does not only require increased Hsf1 activity, but it is also modulated by complex functional relationships between Hsf1 and the cellular chaperome (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Li et al., 2017</xref></italic>). Even though the HSR in chronic stress is not impaired by the loss of one of the Hsp90 isoforms, Hsp90α/β KO cells gradually die off during the chronic HS adaptation period (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). This raises the question whether the chaperome is compromised in the absence of Hsp90α or β. Using the proteomic data sets mentioned above, we focused on the protein levels of all molecular chaperones and co-chaperones at 37°C and in chronic HS at different time points. This analysis revealed that Hsp90α/β KO cells could still maintain or increase expression of molecular chaperones and co-chaperones during chronic HS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Immunoblots confirmed the upregulation of the heat-inducible molecular chaperones Hsp90α (in some instances also Hsp90β), Hsp70, Hsp40, and Hsp27 throughout the chronic stress in cells of all three genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure 4B - figure supplement 4A</xref>). This suggests that the chaperome of Hsp90α/β KO cells is not compromised by chronic stress. Similarly, at the whole proteome level, standardized to the same amount of protein, and although there are genotype-specific differences, the proteome remained complex during chronic stress indicating that proteostasis was largely intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">figure supplement 4B</xref>). Next, we analyzed the Hsp90 interactome. We found that the Hsp90α or Hsp90β KO cells could largely maintain the Hsp90 interactors throughout the chronic stress. These data demonstrate that one Hsp90 isoform is sufficient to support most interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure 4C - figure supplement 4C-D</xref>).</p>

<p>To address the protein folding ability of Hsp90α/β KO cells more directly, we performed an <italic>in vivo</italic> refolding assay with exogenously expressed firefly luciferase subjected to unfolding by a short HS at 43 °C. Surprisingly, we found that Hsp90α/β KO cells do even better than WT cells under basal conditions (37° C) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). The KO cells also showed an increased luciferase refolding ability when they were cultured for 2 days at 39 °C prior to luciferase unfolding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). This higher refolding activity of the Hsp90α/β KO cells at 37° C might be due to some other molecular chaperones being more highly expressed than in WT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Similarly, Hsp90α/β KO cells might do better than WT cells under chronic HS because of their ability to further increase the levels of other molecular chaperones, such as Hsp27, Hsp40, and Hsp70, during chronic HS. So far, these observations suggest that a reduced level of Hsp90 is at least in part functionally compensated by other molecular chaperones in these assays.</p>

<title>A normal level of Hsp90 is required to maintain the cytoplasmic protein density in chronic stress</title>
<p>If Hsp90α/β KO cells do as well or even better than WT cells for almost all parameters investigated so far, what causes them to be more sensitive to stress (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>)? It is known that when cells grow larger, it is critical for them to maintain a constant cellular protein concentration (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kempe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Lin and Amir, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berenson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Lanz et al., 2022</xref></italic>). To achieve this, cells need to increase the total amount of proteins proportionately to their size increase (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Neurohr et al., 2019</xref></italic>), a process that can be referred to as scaling. Uncoupling of protein synthesis and cellular volume causes a dilution of the cytoplasm, which results in cellular senescence and aging. We tested cytoplasmic density by measuring the mobility of EGFP <italic>in vivo</italic> using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">figure supplement 5A</xref>). We calculated the t-half values and diffusion rates (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Persson et al., 2020</xref></italic>), and found that only WT cells could maintain the same cytoplasmic density under chronic HS as at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure 5A - figure supplement 5B-D</xref>). Hsp90α/β KO cells of both cell lines showed lower t-half values and higher diffusion coefficients in chronic stress indicating that they have a reduced cytoplasmic density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure 5A - figure supplement 5B-D</xref>). This observation suggests that a full complement of cytosolic Hsp90 is necessary to maintain the cytoplasmic density with the increase of cell size in chronic stress. There is no significant difference between Hsp90α/β KO cells, which indicates that total Hsp90 levels rather than a specific isoform are critical for maintaining the cytoplasmic density.</p>
<p>If the cytosol is more diluted, this should be reflected in the total amount of proteins. Therefore, we collected the same number of non-stressed and stressed enlarged cells after one day and four days of chronic HS, lysed them in the same amount of lysis buffer, and measured the protein concentrations in the lysates. We found that after four days of chronic stress, the total amount of proteins was higher in WT cells, whereas it decreased in Hsp90α/β KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">figure supplement 5E</xref>). Quantitation by flow cytometric analysis of total cellular protein stained with an amine-reactive dye revealed qualitatively similar results. The total amount of proteins per cell increased with cell size in WT but not in Hsp90α/β KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure 5B - figure supplement 5E</xref>). These results demonstrate that cells are unable to maintain the ratio of total protein to cell size in chronic stress when Hsp90 levels are reduced.</p>

<title>Normal levels of Hsp90 are required to scale protein biosynthesis during stress-induced cell size enlargement</title>
<p>One of the key features of the acute stress response of mammalian cells is a global inhibition of translation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Shalgi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Advani and Ivanov, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Jobava et al., 2021</xref></italic>). We demonstrated here that WT cells exposed to chronic stress increase the total amount of proteins as they get larger, raising the question of how they do it. Revisiting our proteomic data set, we saw that the levels of ribosomal proteins are least reduced in WT compared to Hsp90α/β KO cells under chronic stress (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). A reduction of the core machinery of translation may explain why Hsp90α/β KO cells have decreased amounts of total proteins compared to WT in chronic stress. However, it does not explain the observation of the increased amount of total proteins in WT cells under chronic stress. To address this issue, we checked global translation by labelling nascent polypeptide chains with a fluorescent version of puromycin, which allows measurements for individual cells by flow cytometry. We saw a strong increase of labelled nascent polypeptides in WT cells both on day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">figure supplement 5F</xref>) and day 4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>) of adaptation to chronic HS. By comparison, Hsp90α/β KO cells failed to maintain the same rate of protein biosynthesis under chronic HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure 5D - figure supplement 5F</xref>). While the stress-adapted bigger cells have a higher level of total translation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), it is known that acute HS causes ribosomal dissociation from mRNA, which results in a translational pause (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Shalgi et al., 2013</xref></italic>). Polysome profiling of WT cells adapted to stress for four days showed that the polysome profiles of cells grown at 37 °C or in chronic HS are largely similar (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Similar peaks of single ribosomal particles (40S and 60S), monosomes (80S), and polysomes (both small and large) suggest that the association of ribosomes and mRNAs in WT cells is not affected during adaptation to chronic stress. This raises the question of whether the ISR is not triggered when the stress is chronic. To address this, we did puromycin labeling at earlier time points of chronic HS. We observed that at the beginning of chronic stress (4 h), reminiscent of the ISR (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Persson et al., 2020</xref></italic>), translation is reduced as seen by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">figure supplement 5G</xref>) and puromycin labelling of nascent chains detected by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">figure supplement 5H</xref>). Moreover, cells of all three genotypes displayed an increased inhibitory phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A (eIF2α), a hallmark of the ISR (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Wek, 2018</xref></italic>), after 4 h of HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure 5F - figure supplement 5I</xref>). After having been exposed to chronic HS for one day and more, cells increase total translation, to an even higher level than the basal translation at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">figure supplement 5G</xref>), consistent with the higher translation rate observed by puromycin labeling of nascent chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure 5D - figure supplement 5F</xref>). As cells remained in chronic HS, the phosphorylation of eIF2α only dropped in WT but not Hsp90α/β KO cells. These findings indicate that at the very beginning of chronic HS, an ISR is induced with the accompanying inhibitory phosphorylation of eIF2α and global reduction of translation. WT cells but not Hsp90α/β KO cells, once adapted to the stress, recover normal or even increased global translation. Translational recovery of WT cells is also reflected in several other translation markers and regulators. We could see an increase in the phosphorylation of mTOR, 4EBP1, and S6 during adaptation to chronic HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure 5G - figure supplement 5I</xref>). Thus, it is primarily this recovery, which constitutes a critical and Hsp90-dependent aspect of stress adaptation.</p>

<p>The mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is known to regulate cell size by regulating cellular translation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fingar et al., 2002</xref></italic>). Hsf1 in a non-transcriptional mode has been linked to regulating organ and cell size by preserving mTORC1 activity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Su et al., 2016</xref></italic>). And yet, we saw that Hsp90α/β KO cells increase their size in chronic HS despite failing to augment global translation. We therefore determined cell size and translation at different time points following exposure to chronic HS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). In contrast to WT cells for which cell size and translation appear to be coupled, Hsp90α/β KO cells increase cell size while translation is still reduced. Thus, cell size and translation must be coupled for adaptation to chronic stress. It remains to be seen how Hsp90α/β KO cells manage to increase their size without a concomitant scaling of translation and to what extent the mTORC1-mediated regulation of translation is involved.</p>

<title>Hsp90α/β KO cells are efficient at maintaining cellular proteostasis under normal unstressed conditions</title>
<p>In experiments presented above, we showed that the loss of one Hsp90 isoform does not impair the protein refolding ability (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-E</xref>), but reduces translation under chronic stress. Proteolysis is complementary to translation and folding, and crucial to prevent cytotoxicity by eliminating damaged proteins (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hipp et al., 2019</xref></italic>).

We performed an <italic>in vivo</italic> activity assay for the UPS, which involved the transient expression and flow cytometric quantitation of a degradation-prone ubiquitin-GFP fusion protein (Ub-R-GFP) and its stable counterpart (Ub-M-GFP) as a control (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dantuma et al., 2000</xref></italic>). We observed no significant differences in the UPS activity of Hsp90α/β KO cells compared to WT cells at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">figure supplement 6A</xref>). We checked the ALP by measuring the autophagic flux using a mCherry-GFP-LC3 reporter (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Leeman et al., 2018</xref></italic>). Here also, we observed that the autophagic flux remains unchanged in Hsp90α/β KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">figure supplement 6B</xref>). These results lead us to conclude that one Hsp90 isoform is sufficient to maintain cellular proteostasis under normal, unstressed conditions.</p>

<title>A normal level of Hsp90 is required to maintain cellular proteostasis in chronic stress</title>
<p>We recently reported that Hsp90α/β KO HEK cells accumulate insoluble proteins in long-term mild HS (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bhattacharya et al., 2022</xref></italic>). We therefore checked the above-mentioned cellular proteostasis axes after four days of adaptation to chronic stress.

Hsp90α/β KO cells subjected to chronic HS also had reduced proteasomal activity when measured <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). When we expressed the aggregation-prone model protein EGFP-Q74 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Narain et al., 1999</xref></italic>) in stress-adapted Hsp90α/β KO cells, more and larger aggregates of EGFP-Q74 were readily detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure 6D - figure supplement 6C</xref>). This suggests that Hsp90α/β KO cells cannot efficiently maintain proteostasis in chronic stress. Since Hsp90α KO and Hsp90β KO cells are largely affected the same way, we conclude that there is no isoform specificity for maintaining proteostasis during stress, but that total Hsp90 levels above a certain threshold might be the critical parameter.</p>

<title>Enlarged cells are more resistant to subsequent stress</title>
<p>We hypothesized that the stress-induced cell size enlargement is a protective adaptation. To address this, we induced the enlargement or reduction of cell size with different inhibitors and examined how cell size affects cell survivability (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). At first, we enlarged the A549 WT and Hsp90α/β KO cells by treating them with a CDK4/6 inhibitor (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>), which is known to promote a G1 arrest-associated increase in cell size (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Neurohr et al., 2019</xref></italic>). In contrast to what we had seen with chronic HS, upon becoming bigger in response to treatment with the CDK4/6 inhibitor, Hsp90α/β KO cells were able to scale the amount of total proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">figure supplement 7A-B</xref>). This demonstrates that scaling total protein is possible even in the absence of one Hsp90 isoform and a reduced amount of total Hsp90 when cells are not in chronic HS. We showed above that Hsp90α/β KO cells were dying in chronic HS, possibly because they could not scale their protein with increasing cell size. We therefore wondered whether Hsp90α/β KO cells, enlarged with prior treatment with the CDK4/6 inhibitor, might be more resistant to chronic HS because they would already have scaled their total protein. After treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors for three days, we washed off the inhibitors and subjected the cells to chronic HS for three days. We observed that cells that were already enlarged due to the CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment did not get even bigger in chronic HS. As predicted, these pre-enlarged Hsp90α/β KO cells were more resistant and less prone to apoptosis and cell death (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Thus, when given a chance to get bigger with protein scaling, even cells lacking one Hsp90 isoform are more resistant to chronic stress.</p>

<p>We further explored the connection between increase in cell size and scaled protein, and stress resistance with other stresses and cell lines. We treated the cells pre-enlarged with the CDK4/6 inhibitor with an acutely toxic concentration of sodium arsenite for one day. Again, pre-enlarged A549 cells of all three genotypes and the normal RPE1 cells were more resistant to this subsequent stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">figure supplement 7C</xref>). We then wondered whether reducing cell size would have the opposite effect. We treated HEK and A549 WT, and Hsp90α/β KO cells with rapamycin to inhibit mTOR-induced cell growth (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fingar et al., 2002</xref></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure 7C - figure supplement 7D</xref>). Cell size was indeed reduced after three days of rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure 7C - figure supplement 7D</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that even in the presence of rapamycin cells enlarged their size under chronic HS, albeit not up to the level of cells without rapamycin pretreatment. More of these comparatively smaller rapamycin-treated WT cells were apoptotic than of the bigger cells not treated with rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure 7C - figure supplement 7D</xref>). The increased cell death could also be due to the translational inhibition, in light of the fact that WT cells display increased total translation and mTOR activity to adapt to chronic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure 5G - figure supplement 5I</xref>). In contrast, we observed that comparatively smaller rapamycin-treated Hsp90α/β KO cells were less prone to apoptosis than the non-treated bigger cells. It remains to be seen whether the ratio of total protein to cell size is slightly more favorable in Hsp90α/β KO cells under these conditions. To further support the importance of mTOR, we treated the larger cells adapted to chronic HS with rapamycin. We observed that WT cells became more apoptotic when we added rapamycin after three days of stress adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure 7C - figure supplement 7D</xref>). As rapamycin pre-treatment failed to restrict the cell size increase caused by chronic stress, we then tried to limit the cell size increase with serum starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">figure supplement 7E</xref>). We observed that even serum-starved cells enlarged their size in additional chronic stress as they did with rapamycin. Here again, the size enlargement was not up to the level of non-starved cells. We observed that the serum-starved smaller WT cells died more under stress than the non-starved bigger cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">figure supplement 7E</xref>). As with the rapamycin treatment, in most cases, the serum-starved smaller Hsp90α/β KO cells survived better than the bigger non-starved cells. In both experiments, we did not succeed in preventing the cell size increase upon exposing cells to chronic HS. As a control experiment, we subjected smaller cells obtained with cycloheximide or rapamycin treatment to an acute stress with arsenite for one day. We found that smaller cells were more sensitive to acute stress irrespective of Hsp90 isoform and levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">figure supplement 7F</xref>). The above-mentioned control experiments also argue that stress resistance is not <italic>per se</italic> afforded by increased autophagy, as induced by rapamycin, nor by cellular quiescence as induced, for example, by starvation.</p>
<p>We then wondered what would happen if we limited the cell size increase by limiting the available space (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). We used RPE1 cells, as these cells always grow in single layers and do not grow on top of each other once they are entirely confluent. We observed that at 37°C, once they become confluent, they do not stop dividing, but become smaller and smaller (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E-F</xref>). In contrast, in chronic HS, over time, they enlarge their size and keep dividing when seeded at low density. Next, we seeded a comparatively higher number of cells, such that the culture plate would already be confluent from the beginning, and put it in chronic HS. We observed that the cells in the ‘already-confluent’ plate at 37 °C kept dividing and shrinking, without obvious cell death (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E-F</xref>). However, in chronic HS, the cells in the ‘already-confluent’ plate, while they were initially able to enlarge their size to some extent, when their size eventually shrank because of the limited space, they started dying off (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>).</p>

<title>Adaptation to chronic stress requires cytosolic Hsp90 above a threshold level irrespective of Hsp90 isoform</title>
<p>So far, our experiments did not reveal any obvious functional differences between the two cytosolic Hsp90 isoforms. This supports the conclusion that the observed phenotypes in chronic stress, rather than being linked to a specific isoform, are due to below threshold levels of total Hsp90. To address this more directly, we exogenously overexpressed Hsp90α or Hsp90β as mCherry or EGFP fusion proteins, respectively, in Hsp90α/β KO cells. This caused an overall increase in total Hsp90 levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). The transfected cells were subjected to chronic HS. After four days, we checked the scaling of total protein by loading an equal volume of cell lysate on a protein gel (see Materials and Methods for details). We found that when the total levels of Hsp90 are elevated by either one of the two isoforms, Hsp90α/β KO cells are able to scale total protein under chronic HS (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). This result complements our previous findings that Hsp90α/β KO cells become more resistant to chronic HS upon increasing total Hsp90 levels, irrespective of Hsp90 isoform (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bhattacharya et al., 2022</xref></italic>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is now increasingly recognized that exposure to mild environmental stressors is not necessarily detrimental to the organism. Instead, such experiences may foster a resistant or adapted phenotype through hormesis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Agathokleous and Calabrese, 2022</xref></italic>). Hormesis is a core mechanism of developmental plasticity by which an organism’s response to a stressor varies with exposure (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Schirrmacher, 2021</xref></italic>). In contrast, hormetic priming is confined to specific temporal windows and can be considered a preparation to cope with stress. The biological process of aging is claimed to be associated with hormesis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gems and Partridge, 2008</xref></italic>). Therefore, physiological cellular responses to mild rather than severe stresses may be more important to address in order to comprehend the biology of aging.</p>

<title>Cell size enlargement is a prerequisite for chronic stress adaptation</title>
<p>We report that cells adapt to chronic stress by gradually enlarging their size, through a process coupled with increased translation. Stress-induced cell size enlargement is a step towards stress adaptation as part of an intrinsic stress response. Even when we used inhibitors known for restricting the cell size, chronic stress still induced a cell size increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure 7 - figure supplement 7</xref>). This suggests that cell size enlargement is a necessity for cells to adapt to prolonged stress. Cell size enlargement has also been linked to cellular senescence, which is a state of long-term cell cycle arrest (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Childs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">McHugh and Gil, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Calcinotto et al., 2019</xref></italic>). In contrast, stress-adapted bigger cells continue to proliferate. It has been reported that bigger cells, when they cannot scale their cellular macromolecules, suffer from cytoplasmic dilution and become senescent (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Neurohr et al., 2019</xref></italic>). The adaptive cell size enlargement in response to chronic stress is coupled with increased translation, which enables cells to maintain their cytoplasmic density and macromolecular crowding. Maintaining macromolecular crowding is necessary to control the kinetics of cellular reactions and to avoid an aging-related deterioration of cellular biochemical processes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Mourao et al., 2014</xref></italic>). Hence, the adaptive cell size increase in response to chronic stress is different from that associated with cellular senescence. Our observations demonstrate that the coupling of cell size enlargement and translation is essential for cells to adapt to chronic stress. Failure to do so causes their elimination during stress exposure, as we observed with Hsp90-deficient cells.</p>

<title>Hsp90 enables the rewiring of the stress response</title>
<p>Hsp90-deficient cells subjected to chronic stress suffer from cytoplasmic dilution. For long-term survival under intrinsic or environmentally imposed chronic stress, cells must maintain an equilibrium of protein synthesis, maintenance, and degradation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hipp et al., 2019</xref></italic>). Our results indicate that Hsp90 is a key molecule for sustaining translation under these conditions. Unlike during the ISR, in which global cap-dependent protein translation is specifically reduced by the hyperphosphorylation of eIF2α (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Costa-Mattioli and Walter, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Persson et al., 2020</xref></italic>), during adaptation to chronic stress, we observed a different phenomenon, which we term “rewiring stress response” (RSR). During RSR, cells initially reduce global translation as happens during an ISR. Then, they turn global translation back on, even when they continue to be exposed to the same stress. This leg of the response requires a threshold level of Hsp90. A hallmark of these transitions is the phosphorylation status of eIF2α and its accompanying impact on global translation. At the beginning of a chronic stress, eIF2α is hyperphosphorylated and global translation is inhibited, whereas prolonged exposure to chronic stress results in the reduction of eIF2α phosphorylation and resumption of translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure 5D-F - figure supplement 5F-I</xref>). Thus, the dephosphorylation of eIF2α is central to this phase of the RSR, as it is to terminating the ISR (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref></italic>). While WT cells switch translation back on, the status of eIF2α phosphorylation and puromycin labeling show that Hsp90α/β KO cells are unable to support this transition, even though they continue to express stress-inducible chaperones and co-chaperones at high levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). It appears that Hsp90-deficient cells are stuck at the ISR stage of the RSR. While the ISR is a powerful survival strategy in acute stress, it fails to support the survival of Hsp90-deficient cells during chronic stress adaptation. The ability to mount a RSR is pivotal for the adaptation of cells to chronic stress. The translational recovery and the expression of some of the stress-inducible genes in response to acute stress of the endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress depend on protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and its regulator GADD34 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Novoa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Carrara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Krzyzosiak et al., 2018</xref></italic>). However, our proteomic data indicated that there are no significant changes of PP1 or GADD34 protein levels when one compares cells of different genotypes and stress conditions. Hence, what factors and mechanisms allow cells to transition to RSR remains to be discovered. We report here that a threshold level of total Hsp90 is important to turn on the RSR, not the presence of a particular Hsp90 isoform. If one experimentally elevates the levels of either one of the isoforms, cells can activate the RSR (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Larger cells may be more stress-resistant because of above-threshold levels of macromolecules</title>
<p>When acute stress triggers the ISR, cells only translate selected proteins. With persistent intense stress, the ISR cannot support proteostasis and shifts cells toward apoptosis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Tian et al., 2021</xref></italic>). When stress is chronic, cells need more than this limited set of proteins. This is where the RSR comes in, allowing cells to get bigger, and to accumulate more protein molecules, and potentially other macromolecules, per cell. It is conceivable that there is an evolutionarily optimized range or a minimal threshold level for all macromolecules, and that this depends on the specific biological needs of a given cell type subjected to a particular type of stress (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>). If the absolute numbers per cell of certain molecules are more important than concentration to adapt and to survive under chronic stress, then bigger cells, which have larger stocks of those molecules, may be better at coping with limited damage than smaller cells. This may even apply to proteins involved in translation, including ribosomal proteins, which did not fully scale even in WT cells. As long as individual cells are above the threshold levels for all relevant macromolecules, they can adapt. Hence, growing bigger is an adaptive response that confers higher stress resistance.</p>
<p>This notion is also supported by our recent findings with mouse KOs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bhattacharya et al., 2022</xref></italic>). When we reduced the number of alleles for the cytosolic Hsp90 isoforms from four to one, only embryos that could reestablish the threshold levels of Hsp90 protein by translational reprogramming survived and displayed no apparent phenotype, despite the fact that Hsp90 levels were still lower than those of WT littermates (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bhattacharya et al., 2022</xref></italic>). There is also evidence that cells can maintain favorable macromolecular crowding by reducing the concentration of highly abundant proteins. The mTORC1 pathway modulates the effective diffusion coefficient within the cytoplasm by reducing the number of ribosomes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Delarue et al., 2018</xref></italic>). This can avoid increasing molecular crowding, which has been shown to hinder the kinetics of biochemical reactions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Trappe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Miermont et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Mourao et al., 2014</xref></italic>). Increased macromolecular crowding might affect protein folding, final shape, conformational stability, binding of small molecules, enzymatic activity, protein-protein interactions, protein-nucleic acid interactions, and pathological aggregation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Kuznetsova et al., 2014</xref></italic>). Hence, cells that are exposed to prolonged proteotoxic stress might try to maintain a threshold of all the required proteins instead of scaling all proteins at a particular concentration, while tuning molecular crowding to maintain optimal cytoplasmic diffusion coefficients.</p>

<title>Hsf1-dependent cell size enlargement drives the activation of translation in chronic stress</title>
<p>We found that cell size enlargement during chronic stress depends on Hsf1 activity. This is reminiscent of prior evidence that demonstrated that Hsf1 is linked to the regulation of cell size in different tissues in mammals (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Sakamoto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Koya et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Su et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Obi et al., 2019</xref></italic>). Hsf1 had been reported to maintain cell growth in a noncanonical way by preserving mTORC1 activity and translation by binding and inactivating the kinase JNK, a known inhibitor of mTORC1 activity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Su et al., 2016</xref></italic>). In contrast, the cell size increase in response to chronic stress appears to be a canonical Hsf1-mediated HSR phenomenon, which is upstream and independent of the scaling of cellular translation. This is supported by several experiments. Hsp90α/β KO cells subjected to chronic stress could increase their size despite reduced translation. Chronic stress still induced an increase of cell size upon inhibition of translation with rapamycin or cycloheximide, or by serum starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure 7 - figure supplement 7</xref>). We conclude from all of these observations that increased translation is not necessary for cells to increase their size under chronic stress. WT cells start enlarging their size as a response to chronic stress and then translation follows to scale total protein levels. Hsp90α/β KO cells also increase their size in response to stress but fail to couple that to translation, which causes cytoplasmic dilution.</p>

<title>Aging as a failure to adapt to chronic stress</title>
<p>Overall, our findings are relevant to understanding aging. It is well established that mammalian cells get bigger as they grow older (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cristofalo and Kritchevsky, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Treton and Courtois, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Demidenko and Blagosklonny, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Mammoto et al., 2019</xref></italic>). We speculate that cells enlarge their size with aging as a protective adaptation to accumulating intra- and extracellular stressors. As long as cells manage to scale the biosynthesis of macromolecules such as proteins, their increasing size mitigates the impact of aging. Eventually, the accumulation of stressors cannot completely prevent the development of features of aging.</p>
<p>Our findings may have implications for rejuvenation therapies aimed at delaying or even reverting cellular aging (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Blagosklonny, 2019</xref></italic>). Treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin has been reported to improve the function of aged cells and to lengthen the life span of laboratory animals (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Selman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bjedov et al., 2010</xref></italic>). Despite the low doses that are experimentally used to prevent an age-related decline, there are several adverse side effects. Our data indicate that treatment with mTORC1 inhibitors should be personalized based on the cellular stress level. For healthy cells, where translation plays a vital role in chronic stress adaptation, long-term treatment with rapamycin might affect cellular homeostasis and precipitate aging, or even induce apoptosis. For aged cells with a weakening proteostatic system, rapamycin may rejuvenate cells by reducing translation and inducing autophagy. This is supported by our observation that Hsp90α/β KO cells, where proteostasis is compromised, rapamycin treatment helped the cells to survive better under chronic stress (see also ref.<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bhattacharya et al., 2022</xref></italic>). We conclude that rather than running the risk of inducing premature aging with prolonged rapamycin treatment from a relatively early age, efforts should focus on developing compounds that induce Hsp90 expression and/or activity, which one could expect to delay aging.</p>

<title>Physiological changes of cell size</title>
<p>Our observations demonstrate that changes of cell size do not have to be the result of physical constraints, but can be a regulated adaptation. There is evidence for changes in cell size that are induced by physiological conditions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ginzberg et al., 2015</xref></italic>), and, of course, aging would be one of them. For example, for rat pancreatic β-cells, insulin secretion, metabolic activity, and global protein production rates are positively correlated with cell size (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bernal-Mizrachi et al., 2001</xref></italic>). In the kidney, epithelial cells modulate their size in response to fluid flow rates (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Boehlke et al., 2010</xref></italic>). Muscle fibers increase their size in an Hsf1-mediated response to heat generated by exercise (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Obi et al., 2019</xref></italic>). Hsf1 null mice cannot increase the size of their skeletal muscle cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Koya et al., 2013</xref></italic>). Furthermore, Hsf1 plays a critical role in the adaptive increase of the size of cardiac cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Sakamoto et al., 2006</xref></italic>). In many organs, when cell numbers decrease due to aging, this is compensated by an increase in cell size to maintain the overall functional capacity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ginzberg et al., 2015</xref></italic>). Pancreatic β cells increase their size by over 25% during pregnancy in response to increased insulin demand (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Dhawan et al., 2007</xref></italic>). Similarly, the size of the liver increases during pregnancy through hepatocyte hypertrophy (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Milona et al., 2010</xref></italic>), and liver organ and cell size undergo circadian oscillations (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Sinturel et al., 2017</xref></italic>). Hepatocyte size was also found to increase in organisms continuously exposed to toxic environments (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hall et al., 2012</xref></italic>). These examples support the idea that it is advantageous for a specific cell type to adopt a specific size under particular physiological conditions. Based on our findings with chronic stress, it would be worth investigating whether Hsp90 more generally supports translational scaling in the context of these physiological changes in cell size.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3g">
<title>Limitations of this study</title>
<p>Hsf1 mediates the cell size increase stimulated by chronic stress, but how chronic stress is sensed and relayed to Hsf1 remains to be established. The underlying mechanism may not be exactly the same as the one involved in mediating acute stress, which itself remains poorly understood. Furthermore, how Hsf1 induces the cell size increase is unknown, and the role of Hsp90 in stimulating translation needs to be dissected in more detail, which undoubtedly would be very challenging considering that many of the factors involved in translation are likely to be Hsp90 clients.</p>

<title>Measurement of cell size</title>
<p>Cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA (PAN-Biotech #P10-024100), collected in complete medium, and thoroughly washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Single-cell suspensions were resuspended in 100–200 µl (PBS) containing 2.5 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) (Cayman Chemical #14289-10), for 10 min at room temperature (RT). Cells were analyzed with FACS Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter), and data were analyzed with the FlowJo software package. Cell populations were gated for size measurements based on the value of the forward scatter (FSC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">figure supplement 8A</xref>). We made the assumption that trypsinized cells are round in shape, and therefore, that the respective FSC values are proportional to the diameter of the cells. The PI-positive population was excluded from the size measurement analysis. The respective FSC value was converted to a % value. Control experiments showed that initially preparing the cell suspension in medium containing 5% FCS rather than PBS had no impact on the measured values. However, cell size can be changed if cells are in apoptosis. For the experiments where apoptosis could be observed, cells were stained with PI and annexin V (Biolegend #640906) as described below. Cells positive for PI and annexin V were excluded from the size measurement analysis. Again, controls showed that the annexin V buffer had no impact. For all flow cytometric analyses mentioned here or below, a minimum of 10,000 cells were analyzed for each sample. Additionally, cell diameter was also determined by image analysis using an Innovatis Cedex XS cell counter (Roche) set to auto-calculation.</p>

To determine <italic>de novo</italic> protein translation at the single cell level in relation to cell size, cells were maintained at 39 °C for 4 h, 1 day, and 4 days. Nascent polypeptides were labelled using Click-iT Plus OPP Alexa Fluor 594 (Thermo Fisher Scientific #C10457) as described in the manufacturer’s protocol.

<p>Protein digestion: HEK WT and their respective Hsp90α/β KO cells were cultured at 37 °C, and at 39 °C for 1 day and 4 days. Cells were harvested and snap-frozen. Replicate samples were digested according to a modified version of the iST method (named miST method) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Kulak et al., 2014</xref></italic>). Briefly, frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 3 ml miST lysis buffer (1% sodium deoxycholate, 100 mM Tris pH 8.6, 10 mM DTT). Resuspended samples were sonicated and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. After quantification with tryptophan fluorescence, 100 μg of samples in 50 μl buffer were diluted 1:1 (v:v) with water. Reduced disulfides were alkylated by adding ¼ volume of 160 mM chloroacetamide (final 32 mM) and incubating at 25 °C for 45 min in the dark. Samples were adjusted to 3 mM EDTA and digested with 1.0 μg Trypsin/LysC mix (Promega #V5073) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by a second 1-h digestion with a second aliquot of 0.5 μg trypsin. To remove sodium deoxycholate, two sample volumes of isopropanol containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were added to the digests, and the samples were desalted on a strong cation exchange (SCX) plate (Oasis MCX; Waters Corp., Milford, MA) by centrifugation. After washing with isopropanol/1% TFA, peptides were eluted in 200 µl of 80% acetonitrile, 19% water, 1% (v/v) NH<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p>Peptide fractionation for library construction: After redissolution of samples in 1.0 ml of loading buffer (2% acetonitrile with 0.05% TFA), aliquots (10 μl) of samples were pooled and separated into 6 fractions by off-line basic reversed-phase (bRP) using the Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The fractions were collected in 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, and 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% triethylamine (∼pH 10). Dried bRP fractions were redissolved in 40 μl loading buffer, and 4 μl were injected for LC-MS/MS analyses.</p>
<p>LC-MS/MS: LC-MS/MS analyses were carried out on a TIMS-TOF Pro (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) mass spectrometer interfaced through a nanospray ion source (“captive spray”) to an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC system (Dionex). Peptides were separated on a reversed-phase custom-packed 40 cm C18 column (75 μm ID, 100 Å, Reprosil Pur 1.9 µm particles, Dr. Maisch, Germany) at a flow rate of 0.250 μl /min with a 2-27% acetonitrile gradient in 93 min followed by a ramp to 45% in 15 min and to 90% in 5 min (all solvents contained 0.1% formic acid). Identical LC gradients were used for DDA and DIA measurements.</p>
<p>Library creation: Raw Bruker MS data were processed directly with Spectronaut 15.4 (Biognosys, Schlieren, Switzerland). A library was constructed from the DDA bRP fraction data by searching the reference human proteome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org">www.uniprot.org</ext-link>; accessed on September 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2020, containing 75,796 sequences). For identification, peptides of 7-52 AA length were considered, cleaved with trypsin/P specificity, and a maximum of 2 missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine (fixed), methionine oxidation and N-terminal protein acetylation (variable) were the modifications applied. Mass calibration was dynamic and based on a first database search. The Pulsar engine was used for peptide identification. Protein inference was performed with the IDPicker algorithm. Spectra, peptide and protein identifications were all filtered at 1% FDR against a decoy database. Specific filtering for library construction removed fragments corresponding to less than 3 AA and fragments outside the 300-1800 m/z range. Also, only fragments with a minimum base peak intensity of 5% were kept. Precursors with less than 3 fragments were also eliminated, and only the best 6 fragments were kept per precursor. No filtering was done on the basis of charge state, and a maximum of 2 missed cleavages was allowed. Shared (non-proteotypic) peptides were kept. The library created contained 119,573 precursors mapping to 91,154 stripped sequences, of which 35,119 were proteotypic. These corresponded to 8,632 protein groups (12,252 proteins). Of these, 959 were single hits (one peptide precursor). In total 701,091 fragments were used for quantitation.</p>
<p>DIA quantitation: Peptide-centric analysis of DIA data was done with Spectronaut 15.4 using the library described above. Single hits proteins (defined as matched by one stripped sequence only) were kept in the Spectronaut analysis. Peptide quantitation was based on XIC area, for which a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 3 (the 3 best) precursors were considered for each peptide, from which the median value was selected. Quantities for protein groups were derived from inter-run peptide ratios based on MaxLFQ algorithm (Cox et al 2014). Global normalization of runs/samples was done based on the median of peptides.</p>
<p>Data processing and statistical tests: All subsequent analyses were done with the Perseus software package (version 1.6.15.0). Intensity values were log2-transformed, and after assignment to groups, t-tests were carried out with permutation-based FDR correction for multiple testing (Q-value threshold &lt;0.01). The difference of means obtained from the tests was used for 1D enrichment analysis on associated GO/KEGG annotations as described (Cox and Mann, 2012). The enrichment analysis was also FDR-filtered (Benjamini-Hochberg, Q-val&lt;0.02). The data of the proteomic analysis are supplied as source data 1.</p>

<title>Ribosome and polysome fractionation</title>
<p>Polysome fractionation was performed at the “BioCode: RNA to Proteins” core facility of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Geneva. Cells were cultured at 37 °C or 39 °C for 4 days. Before harvesting the cells, 100 µg/ml CHX was added to the medium, and cells were maintained in the respective incubator for 15-20 min. Cells were then harvested and washed in ice-cold PBS containing 100 µg/ml CHX, snap-frozen and proceeded to the next steps. Cells were weighed, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, 100 µg/ml CHX, 1 mg/ml heparin, 25 u/ml Turbo DNase I (Roche, #04716728001), 25 u/µl SUPERaseIn RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen, #AM2694), protease inhibitors (Roche, #04693132001)) at 200 µl lysis buffer per 100 µg pellet. Cell suspensions were passed through a 25G needle 10-12 times. Cell debris were pelleted at 20,000 g at 4 °C for 20 min. The total RNA concentration of the supernatant was determined. Cell lysates containing 350 µg of total RNA were loaded onto linear 20-60% sucrose gradients prepared with the gradient buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 100 µg/ml CHX). Ribosomes/polysomes were centrifuged at 247,600 g (38,000 rpm) in a SW41 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, #331362) for 3 h 30 min at 4 °C. Fractionated ribosomes/polysomes were measured and collected using a density gradient fractionation system (ISCO).</p>

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> study that describes the coordinated regulation of cellular size and protein translation in response to chronic stress as an adaptive mechanism regulated by the heat shock response. The evidence supporting this conclusion is <bold>solid</bold>, utilizing diverse methods to monitor and manipulate cell size and evaluate stress resistance; however, it is currently unclear in the manuscript to what extent the effects observed are confounded by cell overcrowding. Additionally, the study could be strengthened by the inclusion of more experiments focused on defining the mechanistic basis of this coordination. This work will be of broad interest to researchers interested in diverse fields including cellular proteostasis, stress-responsive signaling, and aging and senescence.</p>

<p>The manuscript describes that cultured mammalian cells adapt to chronic stress by increasing their size and protein translation through Hsp90. The authors extensively use Hsp90 knockout cells and mass spectrometry to provide solid evidence that chronic heat shock response is accompanied by cell size changes and stress resistance in large cells. The major strength of the work is the authors ability to document the heat shock response in detail, while the main weakness is that the cell size changes appear not to be quantitative making it difficult to assess how much the cell density is changed in chronic stress. Nevertheless, the increased stress resistance of large cells is conceptually important and provides one potential explanation why cells need to control their size. This work adds to our understanding of how cellular stress is managed, and while stress responses have been observed previously in relation to cell size, this work provides evidence for increased stress resistance in larger cells.</p>

<p>The paper by Maiti et al. reporting a highly interesting, previously un-noticed, phenomenon of cell size increase as part of the response to chronic proteotoxic stresses, such as heat shock, which the authors term &quot;rewiring stress response&quot;. Furthermore, they establish that it is mediated via HSF1, and, strikingly, necessitates a certain threshold levels of HSP90. Dwelling deeper into the underlying mechanisms, they find that HSP90 help scale protein synthesis with the increased cell sizes, and when diminished, this scaling is impaired, and also cell viability in chronic stress is also compromised. These findings correspond with a previous study by this group on the lethality of HSP90 deficient mice, and moreover, have implications to our understanding of cellular adaptation to stress, and generate interesting hypotheses about the possible links of this mechanism to the impairments of the ability to cope with stress during aging and senescence.</p>
<p>This is an excellent study, with highly novel and important findings, which illuminate a new phenomenon related to cellular adaptation to chronic stress. I have only one major concern, about some technical aspects, specifically over-crowding effects, which could confound the results, which should be answered by the authors. Other than that, further details which I think are pertinent to the study most likely already exist in the experiments performed, and most could be answered with additional simple experiments and by further analyses of the proteomics data which has already been performed, but which results are not sufficiently shown in detail.</p>

<p>This study focuses on defining the specific importance of HSP90 isoforms in stress-resistance. Specifically, addressing the importance of the two HSP90 isoforms alpha and beta in adapting cells to chronic stress. Noting that chronic stresses of different types can induce increases of cellular size, the authors investigated the role of HSP90a/b in this process. Intriguingly, they found that KO of either of these isoforms did not influence chronic stress-dependent increases of cell size. However, they did find that HSF1 plays an important role in this process through undefined mechanisms. The authors go on to show that this increase in cell size appears to be correlated with enhanced protein synthesis during conditions of stress, which allow cells to maintain protein density in the enlarged cell. Intriguingly, this correlation is disrupted in HSP90a/b KO cells, where cell size increases, but there is a deficiency in recovery of protein synthesis following the initial insult. This appears to involve sustained ISR signaling that does not resolve in HSP90-deficient cells. Using a number of different compounds that increase (e.g., CDKi) or inhibit (e.g., rapamycin) cell size changes, the authors demonstrate that protection against chronic stress correlates with cell size and protein density, linking cell expansion to stress resistance.</p>
<p>Overall, this is an observational study that heavily relies on correlation to define a proposed stress responsive signaling mechanism termed the 'rewiring stress response' to explain the coordinated increase in cell size and protein translation in protection against chronic stress.</p>
<p>Due to the reliance on correlation, there remains many questions unanswered related to this work. For example. What is the specific role for HSP90a/b in regulating protein translation during chronic stress through the ISR or related pathways? The authors indicate that the induction of the eIF2a phosphatase GADD34 is not impacted in HSP90-deficient cells, so what role does HSP90 have in this process. Is HSP90 required for proper folding of GADD34? Would you see similar effects in protein translation recovery if other ISR activators are used in HSP90-deficient cells? Addressing this central unanswered question that would significantly enhance the current study. While the authors are undoubtedly pursuing this in subsequent studies, it is difficult to fully gauge the impact of this work without more clarity on that point specifically.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, another critical unanswered question is 'Are similar effects observed in non-dividing cells?' Does chronic stress lead to increases of size and regulation of protein translation in primary cell models that are not undergoing division.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is an interesting study that does a good job of establishing correlations between increases in cell size and protein translation, but does not get to the really intriguing questions related to this coordination. As this study is extended through either revisions to this manuscript or subsequent papers, the importance of this rewiring stress response in the context of cellular stress and pathologic conditions (e.g., age-associated disease) will become increasing apparent.</p>

<p>Regarding the two main points emphasized by the eLife assessment:</p>
<p>•   Potentially confounding effects of overcrowding: This is indeed an important point, which we avoided, unfortunately without explicitly mentioning it in the manuscript (assuming that it went without saying.) We will point out that our proliferation assays, already part of the original manuscript, indicated that cells were not overcroweded. Nevertheless, we will include additional evidence indicating that our cells were not overcrowded and remained subconfluent.</p>
<p>•   Mechanisms: We will mention even more explicitly than we already did that this is beyond the scope of this story and why that is. As we did say, there are lots of factors directly or indirectly involved in translation that depend on Hsp90. Figuring out which one or which ones it might be is a whole new and totally open-ended project.</p>
<p>Regarding some of the other public comments:</p>
<p>•   While we did provide quantitative (!) data on changes in cytoplasmic density (e.g. diffusion coefficients, total amount of protein relative to cell size), we will emphasize in the revised manuscript that the changes in cell size, as measured by both flow cytometry and image analyses, are a relative and approximate measure of the 3D changes in cell volume. Although our data on the diffusion coefficients, which report on cytoplasmic density, are directly comparable, our measurements of the amounts of protein relative to cell size (if this is what the comment meant with &quot;cell density&quot;) have at least relative value.</p>
<p>•   Results of proteomic data not shown in sufficient detail: We recognize that it is not trivial to &quot;read&quot; the data as presented in the paper (volcano plots, full datasets as an Excel file and through ProteomeXchange). We will add subsets of the proteomic data to the Excel file and include some Gene Ontology analyses.</p>
<p>•   We did demonstrate that Hsf1 most likely acts transcriptionally to promote the observed cell size increase.</p>
<p>•   We acknowledge that a large fraction of our data is &quot;observational&quot;, but some experiments clearly go beyond providing correlations. When we manipulate some of the players genetically (KO, knockdown, overexpression) or pharmacologically, we get results that support our conclusions about underlying mechanistic connections.</p>
<p>•   GADD34: This protein is not known to be an Hsp90 client (or interactor), which is also supported by our mass spec data since its steady-state levels don't change in Hsp90α or β KO cells compared to wild-type cells.</p>
<p>•   Non-dividing cells: it would indeed be exciting to determine whether the same phenomena and mechanisms apply to non-dividing cells. However, there are likely to be substantial technical challenges. We would need primary human (or alternatively murine) cells such as B-cells or hepatocytes, and it is difficult to predict whether they would tolerate mild heat stress for several days. It might also be possible to explore this with a mouse model, but clearly, this must be left to future studies.</p>
