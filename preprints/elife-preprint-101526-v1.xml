<title>Abstract</title><p>Education is related to a wide variety of beneficial health, behavioral, and societal outcomes. However, whether education causes long-term structural changes in the brain remains unclear. A pressing challenge is that individuals self-select into continued education, thereby introducing a wide variety of environmental and genetic confounders. Fortunately, natural experiments allow us to isolate the causal impact of increased education from individual (and societal) characteristics. Here, we exploit a policy change in the UK (the 1972 ROSLA act) that increased the amount of mandatory schooling from 15 to 16 years of age to study the impact of education on long-term structural brain outcomes in a large (n∼30.000, UK Biobank) sample. Using regression discontinuity – a causal inference method – we find no evidence of an effect from an additional year of education on any structural neuroimaging outcomes. This null result is robust across modalities, regions, and analysis strategies. An additional year of education is a substantial cognitive intervention, yet we find no evidence for sustained experience-dependent plasticity. Our results provide a challenge for prominent accounts of cognitive or ‘brain reserve’ theories which identify education as a major protective factor to lessen adverse aging effects. Our preregistered findings are one of the first implementations of regression discontinuity on neural data – opening the door for causal inference in population-based neuroimaging.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Access to education is codified as a fundamental human right with immense societal and economic benefits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Individuals who experience more education tend to show a wide variety of beneficial health, cognitive, and neural outcomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Correlational evidence across disparate contexts, countries, and demographics offers overwhelming support for these findings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Education not only increases learned skills and knowledge, but also reasoning and fluid intelligence abilities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. One plausible mechanism underlying these widespread benefits from education is the long-term reorganization of brain structure. Lifespan theories on heterogenous neurodevelopment place particular emphasis on education <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and correlative work further support the role of brain structure as a mechanism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. For instance, more educated individuals show higher mean cortical thickness in later life – taken as evidence of ‘increased brain reserve’ lessening the neurodegenerative effects of aging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Yet, strong causal evidence for the effect of education on brain structure does not yet exist. Both ethical and practical constraints mean that the effect of education cannot be experimentally tested. This makes it unclear if any findings from education are causal, or if instead, they reflect a complex web of preexisting, or amplifying, sociodemographic and individual characteristics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> – many of which have been associated with brain structure (e.g., intelligence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, parental income <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, neighborhood pollution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>). Among the plethora of environmental factors, there is also a substantial (∼40% heritability) genetic component implicated in educational attainment, further confounding potential effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. In addition, access to higher education involves substantial selection processes at the level of the individual and educational system which further complicate the causal pathways involved.</p>
<p>One solution to this problem is using a <italic>natural experiment</italic> – a ‘random-like’ (exogenous) external event – allowing causal inference in observational phenomena <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. A crucial feature of this design is an assignment mechanism outside a participant’s control, usually of natural (e.g., geographical, weather events) or governmental (e.g., policy decisions, cutoff rules) origin. For instance, a law that increases the number of mandatory school years affects everyone equally, in turn, decoupling individual characteristics and other unmeasured confounders from the effects of additional education <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. One of the most widely used causal inference analysis techniques is regression discontinuity (RD), which is applicable when treatment is assigned via a cutoff of a particular score or running variable <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Recent advances in the field of econometrics have optimized inference and largely standardized regression discontinuity (RD) analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. These methods have provided robust evidence that additional education <italic>causes</italic> an increase in intelligence (0.14 – 0.35 SD) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Despite the many strengths and potential causal insights natural experiments offer the field of cognitive neuroscience they have not been used to address such questions.</p>
<p>On September 1<sup>st</sup> 1972, the minimum mandatory age to leave school was raised from 15 to 16 years of age in England, Scotland, and Wales (called here ‘ROSLA’) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. The consequence of this law change was substantial: it resulted in almost 100% of children aged 15 staying in school for an additional year, in turn, increasing formal qualifications, income, and cognition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>However, whether this substantial intervention also affected the long-term brain structure of those born right around the cut-off remains an open question. This is unfortunate, as regression discontinuity is a powerful tool to study phenomena that cannot (ethically or practically) be randomized. Recent developments of increased large population-based neuroimaging cohorts provide the sample size needed to make use of these cross-disciplinary methods. One such cohort, the UK BioBank, has recruitment criteria matching the geographic and birth window of the natural experiment ROSLA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. This provides the ideal opportunity to test, for the first time, the causal effect of a year of education on long-term structural neuroimaging properties.</p>
<p>Using a preregistered design (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/rv38z/">https://osf.io/rv38z/</ext-link>) with over 30,000 participants we evaluate if an additional year of education, as mandated by ROSLA, causes changes in six global neural properties (total surface area, average cortical thickness, normalized total brain volume, mean weighted fractional anisotropy, white matter hyperintensities, and normalized cerebral spinal fluid volume) as compared to individuals born before the cut-off. It is also possible an effect from education could manifest only in specific regions, in the absence of a broad, macro-neural effects. For this reason, we further tested 66 individual cortical regions for surface area and cortical thickness, 27 white matter fiber tracks for fractional anisotropy, and subcortical gray matter volume in 18 regions. Taken together, the combination of cutting-edge quantitative methods, a large sample, a well-validated natural experiment and high-quality imaging allows us to examine, for the first time, if an additional year of education causes long-term structural reorganization in the brain.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>Results</title>
<p>To test if an additional year of education causes long-lasting changes in neural properties we used fuzzy local-linear regression discontinuity (RD) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. This continuity-based technique exploits the fact that ROSLA affected individuals based on a date of birth cutoff (September 1<sup>st</sup>, 1957). More specifically, adolescents born after this date had to spend one more year in school than those born only one day earlier. Local-linear RD analysis tests this by comparing the limits of two non-parametric functions, one fit using only participants right before the policy change to another function fit on participants right after <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. If an additional year of education affects neural outcomes, we assume that brain structure will be <italic>discontinuous</italic> exactly at the cutoff. In contrast, if ROSLA does not affect long-term neural outcomes the functions should be <italic>continuous</italic>, or smooth around the cutoff.</p>
<p>Using fuzzy local-linear RD we fit a series of regressions to various measures of brain structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) to test for any discontinuity at the cutoff. To determine the optimal number of participants to include, we use mean square error optimized bandwidths to a maximal range of 10 years before and after the cutoff (N &gt; 30,000). Doing so, we observed no evidence of an effect from additional education on any of our preregistered global neuroimaging measures (<italic>p’s</italic> &gt; .05; <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Sup. Table 2</xref>). In other words, the relationship between the year of birth and neural outcomes was <italic>continuous</italic> around ROSLA’s cutoff, indicating no differences in global structural measures from an extra year of education. The optimized bandwidths used in this analysis included participants born 20 to 35 months around the cutoff (average <italic>N</italic> = 5124). The absence of a causal effect of education was observed for all our global neuroimaging metrics: total surface area (SA), average cortical thickness (CT), normalized total brain volume (TBV), mean weighted fractional anisotropy (wFA), white matter hyperintensities (WMh), or normalized cerebral spinal fluid volume (CSF) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 3</xref>). These results did not change when imputing missing (∼4%) covariate data.</p>

</fig>
<p>These findings strongly suggest that an additional year of education did not lead to changes detectable by MRI decades later. However, to ensure the validity of our (causal) inferences, a critical step in any regression discontinuity approach is to test the validity of the design <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. For instance, if participants can manipulate their treatment by sorting around the cutoff this severely limits the strength of causal claims. In the context of ROSLA, this is highly unlikely since the assignment was based on date of birth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. However, for completeness we tested this question <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, finding no evidence that individuals were somehow able to adjust their enrollment (<italic>T<sub>q</sub></italic> = -0.72, <italic>p</italic> = .47; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 2</xref>). A second validation approach is to employ <italic>placebo outcome tests</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. This approach uses variables that should <italic>not</italic> be causally related to your treatment (e.g., an additional year of education), to ensure the absence of spurious effects arising through unknown mechanisms. To accomplish this, we used all of our neuroimaging covariates (e.g., sex, head motion, site) as placebo outcomes, under the assumption that ROSLA should not affect these variables. Other than one covariate (summer) which was deterministically related to ROSLA (therefore excluded), none of the placebo outcomes were related to ROSLA (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Sup. Table 1</xref>). Our findings add to the existing body of prior work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> further solidifying ROSLA as a valid natural experiment.</p>
<p>Next, we tested whether there may be any regionally specific neuroimaging effects. It is possible that an additional year of education caused localized neural changes that are not picked up globally. As preregistered, we used the Desikan-Killiany cortical atlas <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> to test the effect of an additional year of education on 33 bilateral regions for both cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA). These analyses included on average 5080 effective participants (N range = 3884 – 7771) for CT and 5392 participants (N range = 3739 – 8727) for SA. Despite these relatively high participant numbers, we did not find an additional year of education to cause changes in any regions for CT or SA (<italic>p’s<sub>FDR</sub></italic> &gt; .05). This was also the case for weighted mean fractional anisotropy in all 27 tracks tested <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> (p’s<sub>FDR</sub> &gt; .05; mean n = 4766). Lastly, we tested the volume of 18 subcortical regions, finding none to be related to an additional year of education (<italic>p’s</italic><sub>FDR</sub> &gt; .05, mean n = 5174). To summarize, there was no evidence of an additional year of education affecting any regional neuroimaging measures with fuzzy local-linear regression discontinuity (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Sup. Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Bayesian Local Randomization Robustness Analysis</title>
<p>As an additional preregistered robustness test, we used a slightly different approach, often referred to as ‘local randomization’, to analyze natural experiments. This approach works under the assumption that individuals close to the cutoff are exchangeable and similar except for the treatment (in our case an additional year of school) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. To implement this analysis, we compared participants born <italic>exactly</italic> right before the cutoff (August 1957; n ≈ 130) to those born right after the cutoff (September 1957; n ≈ 100). An additional benefit is that we implemented this analysis in a Bayesian framework, allowing us to more readily interpret the strength of evidence either in favor of the null or alternative hypothesis. Our preregistered default point null Bayes factors were too wide, arguably providing relatively strong evidence in favor of the null. Taking a more conservative approach, we report these analyses with a narrower normal prior (mean=0, sd=1). Doing so, we replicated and extended our findings from fuzzy local-linear RD analysis, observing <italic>strong</italic> evidence in favor of the null hypothesis for total surface area (BF<sub>01</sub> = 18.21), average cortical thickness (BF<sub>01</sub> = 15.09), total brain volume (BF<sub>01</sub> = 13.61), weighted fractional anisotropy (BF<sub>01</sub> = 11.63), white matter hyperintensities (BF<sub>01</sub> = 13.26), and cerebral spinal fluid volume (BF<sub>01</sub> = 14.50). In addition, we tested across a range of priors which did not meaningfully affect our inferences, as each showed evidence in favor of the null (<xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Sup. Table 4</xref> &amp; <xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">6</xref>).</p>
<p>The two quantitative RD approaches described here (local-linear and local randomization) have strengths and challenges similar to the widespread bias versus variance tradeoff. As the number of months on either side of the cutoff increases, bias is introduced as participants become less similar, yet at the same time, the sample size increases, thereby lowering the variance of the estimate. Our local randomization approach runs a negligible risk of bias, but at the cost of a relatively modest sample size: One could argue the 230 participants included in our 1-month window are too few for neuroimaging outcomes. To examine the consequences of this tradeoff, we therefore expanded the boundary to a 5-month window around September 1<sup>st</sup>, 1957 (n per group ≈ 600). This larger participant pool provided further evidence in support of the null hypothesis of education not affecting global neural measures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> &amp; 3, <xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Sup. Table 6</xref>). Lastly, we repeated our placebo outcome tests for both a one- and five-month window local randomization analysis, finding no associations (<xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Sup Table 5</xref> &amp; <xref rid="tbls7" ref-type="table">7</xref>), demonstrating the robustness of the natural experiment ROSLA and our analysis approach.</p>

<title>Correlational Effect of Education</title>
<p>The above analyses employed an RD design allowing us to investigate the hypothesized causal effect of (additional) education on differences in brain structure independent of confounding pathways. To ensure our sample is at least <italic>in principle</italic> sensitive to observing brain-behavior associations (cf. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>), we reran the analysis as a simple association instead. This allows us to examine whether more years of education are associated with differences in brain structure. Notably, such an observational analysis (and resulting parameter estimate) would reflect an indeterminate mixture of causal effects as well as any indirect, sociodemographic, and individual pathways. These associations would still be of considerable potential scientific interest, but could not be interpreted as <italic>causal</italic> effects of education on brain structure. Crucially, this was done using the same subset of participants as in the local randomization analysis. Resulting in an estimate of how much one additional year of education correlates with brain structure.</p>
<p>First, we estimated the association between education (in years of attainment) and global neuroimaging measures using the same sample of participants from the one-month window local randomization analysis (i.e., August &amp; September 1957; n ∼ 230). Similar to the causal approach, five of the six measures showed evidence in support of the null hypothesis (<xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Sup. Table 4</xref>). In contrast, total surface area showed weak evidence in support of a positive association of education (BF<sub>10</sub> = 2.3, n = 229). To increase power, we expanded our observational analysis to participants born in a five-month window around the ROSLA cutoff (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This considerably increased the strength of evidence in support of a positive association between years of education and total surface area (BF<sub>10</sub> = 41.7, N = 1185). In addition, the larger pool of participants provided extreme evidence in <italic>support</italic> of an association between years of education and cerebral spinal fluid volume (BF<sub>10</sub> = 80.7, n = 1193). This analysis highlights the stark difference between a causal and associational approach, while also providing evidence of sensitivity to brain-behavioral associations in the same sample. Of the remaining four global measures, three meaningful decreased in their strength of evidence (in terms of Jeffrey criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>) in favor of the null when compared to the causal estimate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3</xref>; <xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Sup. Table 6</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In a large, preregistered study we find converging evidence <italic>against</italic> a causal effect of education on long-term structural neuroimaging outcomes. This null result is present across imaging modalities, different regions, and analysis strategies. We find no issues with the design of the 1972 ROSLA, substantiating it as a valid natural experiment, in agreement with prior work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Despite a large sample (min N = 4238), we find no evidence of an effect of education on any of the global neuroimaging measures with a continuity-based RD analysis. Confirming this result, we find strong evidence in support of the null hypothesis for these global neuroimaging measures using a Bayesian local randomization analysis. Moreover, we find no regionally specific effect of education on local mean cortical thicknesses or surface area across 66 cortical regions. This lack of localized effects was further confirmed in weighted mean fractional anisotropy for 27 white matter tracks, as well as subcortical gray matter volume in 18 regions. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability to find strong evidence in favor of observational associations between education and brain structure at this resolution, suggesting our findings are not due to lack of sensitivity more generally.</p>
<p>Our robust null result is seemingly at odds with causal inference findings of education’s positive behavioral effect on intelligence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> – which is sustained throughout decades <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. This juxtaposition suggests that, to the extent that the additional year of education induced long-term changes in cognitive abilities, the neural manifestation is at a level of resolution not detectable with conventional MRI field strengths. However, this would seem to contrast with a range of influential findings demonstrating that high-intensity experimental behavioral interventions (e.g. juggling, studying, memory training) lead to measurable differences in brain structure (with similar imaging pipelines) in much smaller samples <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Moreover, compared to even these high-intensity interventions, a year of education is an <italic>extensive</italic> period of learning. The 1972 ROSLA was well implemented, schools had time to prepare and were given additional funding, increasing standardized formal qualifications of those affected <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. This leaves open the question of how to interpret this constellation of findings.</p>
<p>One potential explanation to account for this discrepancy is the concept of <italic>expansion-renormalization</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, which posits following a period of skill acquisition, the cortex initially expands and then renormalizes over the course of a few months. In our context, this would suggest that the additional year would have manifested at a level detectable in MRI when the difference in educational exposure between children pre- and post-ROSLA was most pronounced and recent. In other words, MRI effects at the macro-scale might have been detectable immediately post-ROSLA in 16-year-old adolescents, before renormalizing, to a micro-scale, leaving in place permanent, but microstructural changes. Possible cellular candidates for initial experience-dependent plasticity are an increase in dendritic spines, the swelling of astrocytes, and intracortical myelin adaptations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. These structural changes may be detectable using other approaches such as in vivo cellular work (cf. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>), extreme high field strengths <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, or postmortem histology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the long period of time between additional education and neuroimaging offers both strengths and weaknesses for our design. First, it could be the case that 46 years is too long and any potential effect faded out over the years. That is, rather than having a micro-neural effect, it may be that there simply are no lingering effects at the brain level at all. In this case, it may be better to think of the (causal) impact of additional education as more akin to fitness or strength interventions which are also unlikely to persist across such a period. However, we note that prominent aging-related theories of heterogeneity argue <italic>directly against</italic> this rationale, instead positing life course experiences offer a reserve or ‘brain buffer’ that leads to an increasing cascade of processes limiting adverse aging effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Here, the timing between our intervention (ROSLA) and scanning makes our design particularly well-powered to test these theories, since education would contribute to an initial brain buffer (intercept) and any cumulative educational effect (slope) over 46 years. While our results are at odds with prior conceptual and observational work, a recent longitudinal study found prior education to not affect the rate of brain aging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> – in alignment with our findings.</p>
<p>Lastly, to demonstrate the importance of controlling for unobserved confounders we conducted a simple correlation analysis – using the same subset of participants – relating education to differences in brain structure. We found evidence to support an <italic>association</italic> between more years of education and greater surface area and cerebral spinal fluid volume. This result emphasizes the need for caution in attributing causation in non-causal designs, as unobserved confounders can masquerade as an effect of interest. For instance, more education is frequently highlighted as offering behavioral and neural protection against the adverse effects of aging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>– while we replicate this inference associationally, we find no causal evidence for any neuroprotective effects. This suggests a more complex pathway of effects unfolding over time. Environmental causes are most likely very small and additive, which makes them not only difficult to study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> but also equally hard to adequately control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Our findings suggest that to truly understand the neural and behavioral processes that unfold after interventions such as education we need a multipronged, mixed methods approach that combines deep phenotyping, longitudinal imaging and behavioral follow-up <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, as well as more sophisticated models that can capture gene-by-environment-interplay <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Only then will we be able to identify idiosyncratic environmental effects and individual characteristics underlying heterogenous lifespan development.</p>
<p>Here, we report a lack of causal evidence of a year of school on long-term neural outcomes in thousands of participants. An additional year of education is a substantial intervention and our preregistered findings are robust across imaging modalities, different regions, and analysis strategies. While our design cannot inform us of any short-term neural effects of education, our results call into question <italic>sustained</italic> experience-dependent plasticity, with significant ramifications for prominent theories of aging-related heterogeneity. The recent availability of large neuroimaging cohort data paired with cutting-edge methods from econometrics offers new avenues in studying neural effects. Causal inference is a new tool to the neuroimager’s toolkit – opening novel, societally relevant phenomena – with the potential to move the field of population neuroscience from one of <italic>association</italic> to one of <italic>causation</italic>.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>On September 1<sup>st</sup>, 1972 the minimum age to leave school was increased from 15 years of age to 16 in England, Scotland, and Wales <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. This law, henceforth ROSLA, mandated children born after September 1<sup>st</sup>, 1957 to stay in school for an additional year. In contrast, a child born only one day earlier was unaffected and legally allowed to stop formal schooling at 15 years of age. The consequence of this law change was substantial: it resulted in almost 100% of children aged 15 staying in school for an additional year, in turn, increasing formal qualifications (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig 2</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Crucially for our purposes, ROSLA is a well-studied natural experiment with (commonly agreed, e.g. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>) high design validity. A sizable body of prior work has found behavioral effects from the 1972 ROSLA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we leverage ROSLA to study the causal effect of an additional year of education on the brain. To do so, we will use the neuroimaging sub-sample of the UK BioBank – the largest neuroimaging study to date – which also lines up perfectly with geographic and birth window (∼1935-1971) requirement characteristics for ROSLA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. We followed our preregistration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/rv38z">https://osf.io/rv38z</ext-link>) closely, yet some minor deviations were necessary and explicitly outlined in <italic>‘deviations from preregistration’</italic> (code: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/njudd/eduBrain">https://github.com/njudd/eduBrain</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Structural neuroimaging outcomes</title>
<p>It is very plausible that a broad intervention like education could affect the brain in either a global, or more regionally specific manner. For this reason, we examined both whole-brain averaged measures in addition to regional specificity in atlas-based regions and tracts. We tested the following global measures; total surface area (SA), average cortical thickness (CT), total brain volume normalized for head size (TBV), mean weighted fractional anisotropy (wFA), white matter hyperintensities (WMh), and cerebral spinal fluid volume normalized for head size (CSF). Next, we examined cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) regionally using the Desikan-Killiany Atlas <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. The temporal pole was not included by the UK BioBank making the total number of regions 66. We will also test weighted mean fractional anisotropy (wFA) with a global average and, regionally on 27 white matter tracks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Lastly, we examine subcortical volume in 18 regions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>All measures are derived from the image preprocessing pipeline from the UKB, further preprocessing details are outlined elsewhere <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. All outliers were identified if they were either above quartile 3 plus 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) or below quartile 1 minus 1.5 times the IQR and brought to the fence by manually recoding them to this limit (Tukey/Boxplot Method). Our alpha level for global neuroimaging measures (mean CT, total SA, average FA, WM hyper-intensities, normalized TBV &amp; normalized CSF) is 0.05. The regional metrics (SA, CT, wFA &amp; subcortical structures) are false discovery rate (FDR) corrected using the number of regions per modality (e.g., 66 regions for SA) with a q value less than 0.05 considered significant. Neuroimaging measures are reported in raw units.</p>

<title>Continuity-based framework: Local-linear fuzzy regression discontinuity</title>
<p>Regression discontinuity (RD) is a technique we use to estimate the effect of an intervention on an outcome where assignment (usually binary) is based on a cutoff of a running or ‘forcing’ variable <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> – in our case, age in months. One major design issue in RD is if participants select into (or out of) the treatment group by sorting around to the cutoff of the running variable. However, as the 1972 ROSLA law was not pre-announced, generally strictly enforced, and affected teenagers, such alternative explanations are highly improbable <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, we conducted a density test of the running variable to check for bunching near the cutoff <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Although the design validity of the 1972 ROSLA is well established <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> we still tested a variety of placebo outcomes (outlined in ‘covariates of no interest’) – outcomes implausible to be affected by the intervention.</p>
<p>RD analysis broadly falls into two separate but complementary frameworks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. The first, continuity-based approach defines the estimand as the difference between the limits of two continuous non-parametric functions: one fit using only participants right before the policy change to another function fit on participants right after. The other, so-called <italic>local randomization</italic> approaches assume participants are <italic>‘as if random’</italic> in a small window (<italic>ω</italic>) around the cutoff (described more in detail in the section “Bayesian Local Randomization analysis”). In this case, the estimand is the mean group difference between participants before and after the cutoff within <italic>ω</italic>. As <italic>ω</italic> approaches zero around the cutoff, the estimand becomes conceptually more similar to continuity-based approaches.</p>
<p>To empirically test whether an additional year of education caused long-lasting global and regional neural changes we used a fuzzy local linear regression discontinuity design (a continuity-based approach) with robust confidence intervals from the RDHonest package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Our outcome variables are the neuroimaging metrics described above, which were adjusted to increase statistical precision (see section ‘covariates of no interest’). The running variable (<italic>X</italic>) is a participant’s date of birth in months (mDOB), as is convention, it was centered at zero around the birth cutoff of ROSLA (September 1<sup>st</sup>, 1957). Our first-stage (fuzzy) outcome was a dummy coded variable of whether the participant completed at least 16 years of education. Participants who indicated they completed college were not asked this question, therefore we recorded their response as 21 years <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Our choice of using the RDHonest package was primarily due to its ability to provide accurate inference with discrete running variables (in our case mDOB). We used the default settings of local-linear analysis on MSE-derived bandwidths with triangular kernels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We included participants born in England, Scotland, or Wales 10 years on either side of the September 1<sup>st</sup>, 1957 cutoff (dob Sept. 1<sup>st</sup>, 1947 – Aug 31<sup>st</sup>, 1967) with neuroimaging data. The range of the running variable (age in our case) to include on either side of the cutoff (known as the bandwidth; <italic>z</italic>) is one of the most consequential analytical decisions in regression discontinuity designs. Prior work using ROSLA in the UK BioBank has analyzed bandwidths as large as 10 years <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> to as small as a year <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Large bandwidths include more participants (decreasing variance) yet these participants are also further away from the cutoff, in turn, potentially increasing bias in the estimand <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Conversely, smaller bandwidths provide a less biased, yet noisier estimates. State-of-the-art continuity-based RD methods use data-driven bandwidth estimation such as mean squared error (MSE) optimized bandwidths <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Since we used this approach the optimal bandwidth range and, in turn, the number of included participants, will differ per fitted model. This also makes it logically incompatible to sensitivity test our bandwidths <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, since they are mean squared error derived – widening them will lower variance and, in turn, increase bias while tightening them will have the opposite effect. Lastly, the use of triangular kernels means participants further away from the cutoff will be weighted less than those closer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Both MSE-optimized bandwidths and triangular kernels determine the number of ‘effective observations’ to be fit by a fuzzy local linear RD model.</p>
<p>For our global continuity-based analysis we made sure the results did not change due to missing covariate data. This was accomplished by imputing missing covariate data (≈4%) with classification and regression trees from the MICE package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. We imputed using information from only the variables included in each analysis and did not use the running variable (DOB in months) or our first-stage instrument for prediction. We did this ten times checking the estimates and inferences across each iteration to ensure robustness.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Bayesian Local Randomization Analysis</title>
<p>As a robustness test and to provide evidence for the null hypothesis, we conducted a Bayesian analysis using the local randomization framework for RD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. This alternative framework assumes a small window (<italic>ω</italic>) around the cutoff (c) where the running variable is treated “as if random” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. While the local randomization framework invokes stricter assumptions on the assignment mechanism, placing more importance on the window around the cutoff (<italic>ω</italic> = [c − w, c + w]) it handles discrete running variables well <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. As the number of months on either side of the cut-off increases, bias is introduced as subjects become less similar, yet at the same time, the sample size increases, thereby lowering the variance of the estimate.</p>
<p>As recommended <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, we included participants within the smallest window possible (<italic>ω</italic> = 1 month; August vs September 1957), then expanded to a 5-month window around September 1<sup>st</sup>, 1957. A dummy variable (ROSLA) was constructed to reflect if a participant was impacted by the policy change. We then tested the effect of this variable on our six global neuroimaging measures while correcting for the covariates listed above. A few neuroimaging covariates did not have sufficient observations to be included (see ‘deviations from preregistration’).</p>
<p>Models were fit in R (v. 4.3.2) with rstanarm with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of 80,000 iterations over 4 chains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. All priors (<italic>p</italic>) used a normal distribution centered at 0 with autoscaling [<italic>p</italic>*sd(y)/sd(x)]. Our preregistration referred to using the <italic>‘default’</italic> weakly informative prior of STAN (i.e., 2.5 SDs). However, this is a relatively wide prior for point null Bayesian hypothesis testing, and at odds with the defaults from packages meant for this purpose (e.g., BayesFactor). We therefore deviated from our preregistration and reported Bayes Factors with a normal prior centered at 0 with a standard deviation of 1 (medium informative). We also report strongly informative (SD = .5) and weakly informative (SD = 1.5) normal priors.</p>
<p>Model diagnostics were checked with trace plots, posterior distributions, and rhat values (&lt;1.05) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. We then computed log Bayes Factors using the bayestestR package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> using the Savage-Dickey density ratio with a point-null of 0 for each of the 3 priors. The strength of evidence was interpreted on a graded scale using the criteria preregistered <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. If the two frameworks disagree our primary inference will be based on the continuity-based framework.</p>
<p>Similarly to our continuity-based approach, we conducted placebo outcome tests within both windows (<italic>ω</italic> = 1 &amp; 5 months) using each included covariate as the outcome being predicted by ROSLA. In addition, we preregistered four placebo cutoffs – an analysis where the cutoff is artificially moved to test the specificity of the effect – yet null findings made this test no longer necessary (see ‘deviations from preregistration’).</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Correlational Analysis</title>
<p>To compare our results to a correlational approach, we tested self-reported years of total education (EduYears) on the six global neuroimaging measures using the same participants as the local randomization analysis (<italic>ω</italic> = 1 &amp; 5 months). The analysis pipeline is identical to the local randomization approach, except the dummy coded term ROSLA was substituted for continuous EduYears.</p>

<sec id="s4e">
<title>Covariates of no interest</title>
    <p>In neuroimaging it is common to include covariates. However, for identification in a valid regression discontinuity design covariates <italic>by definition</italic> should be equal on either side of the cutoff <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. We used standard neuroimaging covariates for two purposes, <italic>1)</italic> to further test the validity of the 1972 ROSLA and <italic>2)</italic> to increase statistical precision in our RD analysis. For instance, there are large sex differences in certain neural measures mostly related to head size <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, therefore we included a dummy variable for sex. We expect ROSLA to not affect the proportion of males and females, yet including this measure as a covariate will increase the estimation precision for measures sensitive to sex-related head size differences (e.g., surface area). [As expected, we found a 24% precision gain for total Surface Area, measured as the difference in CI width of the RD parameter pre and post-correction. Precision increased for <italic>all</italic> global measures (3-7%, 24%)].</p>
<p>Children born in July and August could technically leave school at 15 after 1972 ROSLA due to the exam period ending in mid-June and the school year starting on September 1<sup>st 40</sup>. This is an artifact of asking <italic>‘What age did you complete full-time education?’</italic>, rather than <italic>‘How many years of education did you complete?’</italic>. This artifact predates and is not influenced by ROSLA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>, yet to account for this we included a dummy variable for children born in July or August.</p>
<p>Lastly, Neuro-UKB recruitment is still ongoing and started in April 2014 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. In turn, there is a wide range of intervals in terms of the period between when someone was born and the age at which they were scanned. We control for this discrepancy by including a variable ‘date of scanning’ (DoS). This was done by coding the earliest date a (included) participant was scanned to 0 and counting the number of days until the last included participant. This resulted in a value for each participant that was the number of days they were scanned after the first participant. We also include this variable squared, so we can model quadratic effects, resulting in two variables (DoS &amp; DoS<sup>2</sup>). Other (preregistered) neuroimaging quality control measures were included such as scanning site, head motion, whether a T2 FLAIR sequence was used, T1 intensity scaling, and 3 diffusion measures recommended <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. No additional covariates other than those preregistered (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/rv38z">https://osf.io/rv38z</ext-link>) were added.</p>
<p>Our first aim, known as a placebo outcome test, involved testing the effect of an additional year of education on each covariate. This was accomplished identically to our neuroimaging outcomes (see section ‘Continuity-based framework’) using RDHonest. We expect there to be no effect of ROSLA on any covariate. This was also tested for the Local-Randomization Framework (<italic>ω</italic> = 1 &amp; 5 months).</p>
<p>For our second aim, increasing the precision of the RD estimand we used covariate-adjusted outcomes (Y). This was done by fitting a local linear regression for each MSE-derived bandwidth <bold><italic>z</italic></bold> with a matrix of covariates (<bold>C</bold>′) on the unadjusted outcome (<italic>Y</italic>) using Equation 1 below. Let <italic>X</italic> denote the running variable (date of birth in months) which is centered around the ROSLA cutoff (i.e., September 1<sup>st</sup>, 1957 = 0). In the second step, this matrix of covariates is then multiplied by the fitted coefficients <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="594682v2_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and subtracted from the unadjusted outcome (<italic>Y</italic>) to make a covariate-adjusted outcome (<italic>Y</italic>). Since our assignment mechanism is probabilistic (i.e., fuzzy RD) we also corrected our first-stage outcome, a dummy coded variable reflecting if the participant stayed in school until 16, in an identical manner. This method was used after personal communication with Prof. Michal Kolesar the package creator of RDHonest. For the Bayesian local randomization analysis and correlational analysis, we simply included the covariates in the model.

<title>Deviations from the preregistration</title>
<p>The study closely followed the preregistration pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/rv38z">https://osf.io/rv38z</ext-link>), yet in a few minor cases it was not possible to follow. For instance, our initial plan involved placebo cutoffs – a sensitivity test where the cutoff is artificially moved to check if a significant result may also appear (for whatever reason) at other, non-hypothesized dates. Due to our lack of findings, we did not conduct this analysis as it was not necessary.</p>
<p>Some covariates lacked variance in specific specifications due to very few observations and therefore could not be included. In the global continuity analysis, this only impacted weighted fractional anisotropy, where the variable ‘T2_FLAIR’ was not used. This dummy-coded variable, indicating if a participant had a T2-weighed MRI scan, was also not used in the regional continuity-based analysis nor for the local-randomization analysis. The local randomization analysis included a small number of participants around September 1<sup>st</sup> 1957 therefore we did not include the covariate “summer” as this would have been isomorphic to our effect of interest (ROSLA). Lastly, for the one-month window analysis, there were not enough observations to include imaging center 11028.</p>

<title>Choice of priors</title>
<p>The Savage-Dickey density ratio is the height of the posterior divided by the height of the prior at a particular point (0 in our case for Point null Bayes Factors). This makes them particularly sensitive to the prior used. Our preregistration referred to using a <italic>‘default weakly informative prior</italic>’. While not specified this was referencing the default prior of STAN (i.e., normal of 2.5 SDs). However, this is arguably too wide for adequate point null Bayesian hypothesis testing and at odds with the defaults from packages meant for this purpose (e.g., BayesFactor package). If we used the default prior from STAN it would have given us unrealistically strong support for the null hypothesis. We therefore deviated from our preregistration and reported Bayes Factors with a normal prior centered at 0 with a standard deviation of 1 (mediumly informative). We also report strongly informative (SD = .5) and weakly informative (SD = 1.5) normal priors both also centered at 0. All of our priors supported the null hypothesis they just varied in the amount of evidence in support of the null. Lastly, for illustration purposes, we ran the 5-month local randomization analysis for surface area regions using the mediumly informative prior (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>A regression discontinuity analysis finds essentially no effect of 1 additional year of secondary education on brain structure in adulthood. This is a <bold>valuable</bold> finding that adds to the literature on the impact of education on brain health. The evidence presented is <bold>solid</bold>, with strengths including methodological novelty as well as principled study design; the impact is, however, limited as the manipulated variable only relates to a single additional year of education (remaining in education to 15 vs 16 years of age). The interpretation is further missing discussion of the healthy volunteer bias of the UK Biobank sample, amplified in the imaging extension.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This fascinating manuscript studies the effect of education on brain structure through a natural experiment. Leveraging the UK BioBank, these authors study the causal effect of education using causal inference methodology that focuses on legislation for an additional mandatory year of education in a regression discontinuity design.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The methodological novelty and study design were viewed as strong, as was the import of the question under study. The evidence presented is solid. The work will be of broad interest to neuroscientists</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There were several areas which might be strengthed from additional consideration from a methodological perspective.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors conduct a causal analysis of years of secondary education on brain structure in late life. They use a regression discontinuity analysis to measure the impact of a UK law change in 1972 that increased the years of mandatory education by 1 year. Using brain imaging data from the UK Biobank, they find essentially no evidence for 1 additional year of education altering brain structure in adulthood.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors pre-registered the study and the regression discontinuity was very carefully described and conducted. They completed a large number of diagnostic and alternate analyses to allow for different possible features in the data. (Unlike a positive finding, a negative finding is only bolstered by additional alternative analyses).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the work is of high quality for the precise question asked, ultimately the exposure (1 additional year of education) is a very modest manipulation and the outcome is measured long after the intervention. Thus a null finding here is completely consistent educational attainment (EA) in fact having an impact on brain structure, where EA may reflect elements of training after a second education (e.g. university, post-graduate qualifications, etc) and not just stopping education at 16 yrs yes/no.</p>
<p>The work also does not address the impact of the UK Biobank's well-known healthy volunteer bias (Fry et al., 2017) which is yet further magnified in the imaging extension study (Littlejohns et al., 2020). Under-representation of people with low EA will dilute the effects of EA and impact the interpretation of these results.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates evidence for a hypothesised, causal relationship between education, specifically the number of years spent in school, and brain structure as measured by common brain phenotypes such as surface area, cortical thickness, total volume, and diffusivity.</p>
<p>To test their hypothesis, the authors rely on a &quot;natural&quot; intervention, that is, the 1972 ROSLA act that mandated an extra year of education for all 15-year-olds. The study's aim is to determine potential discontinuities in the outcomes of interest at the time of the policy change, which would indicate a causal dependence. Naturalistic experiments of this kind are akin to randomised controlled trials, the gold standard for answering questions of causality.</p>
<p>Using two complementary, regression-based approaches, the authors find no discernible effect of spending an extra year in primary education on brain structure. The authors further demonstrate that observational studies showing an effect between education and brain structure may be confounded and thus unreliable when assessing causal relationships.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) A clear strength of this study is the large sample size totalling up to 30k participants from the UK Biobank. Although sample sizes for individual analyses are an order of magnitude smaller, most neuroimaging studies usually have to rely on much smaller samples.</p>
<p>(2) This study has been preregistered in advance, detailing the authors' scientific question, planned method of inquiry, and intended analyses, with only minor, justifiable changes in the final analysis.</p>
<p>(3) The analyses look at both global and local brain measures used as outcomes, thereby assessing a diverse range of brain phenotypes that could be implicated in a causal relationship with a person's level of education.</p>
<p>(4) The authors use multiple methodological approaches, including validation and sensitivity analyses, to investigate the robustness of their findings and, in the case of correlational analysis, highlight differences with related work by others.</p>
<p>(5) The extensive discussion of findings and how they relate to the existing, somewhat contradictory literature gives a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in this area.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) This study investigates a well-posed but necessarily narrow question in a specific setting: 15-year-old British students born around 1957 who also participated in the UKB imaging study roughly 60 years later. Thus conclusions about the existence or absence of any general effect of the number of years of education on the brain's structure are limited to this specific scenario.</p>
<p>(2) The authors address potential concerns about the validity of modelling assumptions and the sensitivity of the regression discontinuity design approach. However, the possibility of selection and cohort bias remains and is not discussed clearly in the paper. Other studies (e.g. Davies et al 2018, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0279-y">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0279-y</ext-link>) have used the same policy intervention to study other health-related outcomes and have established ROSLA as a valid naturalistic experiment. Still, quoting Davies et al. (2018), &quot;This assumes that the participants who reported leaving school at 15 years of age are a representative sample of the sub-population who left at 15 years of age. If this assumption does not hold, for example, if the sampled participants who left school at 15 years of age were healthier than those in the population, then the estimates could underestimate the differences between the groups.&quot;. Recent studies (Tyrrell 2021, Pirastu 2021) have shown that UK Biobank participants are on average healthier than the general population. Moreover, the imaging sub-group has an even stronger &quot;healthy&quot; bias (Lyall 2022).</p>
<p>(3) The modelling approach used in this study requires that all covariates of no interest are equal before and after the cut-off, something that is impossible to test. Mentioned only briefly, the inclusion and exclusion of covariates in the model are not discussed in detail. Standard imaging confounds such as head motion and scanning site have been included but other factors (e.g. physical exercise, smoking, socioeconomic status, genetics, alcohol consumption, etc.) may also play a role.</p>

<p><bold>To Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>Thank you for your kind words regarding the novelty, study design, and evidence presented. We will clarify our language when describing fuzzy local-linear regression discontinuity analysis. We thank you for this feedback as our goals are to introduce these methods to a neuroscientific audience. Lastly, we will respond and clarify the methodological points, including post-selection inference, bandwidths, and Bayesian analysis in version 2.</p>
<p><bold>To Reviewers #2 and #3:</bold></p>
<p>We thank you both for your constructive feedback, specifically in highlighting <italic>1)</italic> the scope of the intervention and <italic>2)</italic> the UKB-neuro healthy volunteer bias. In the next manuscript version, we will expand our discussion of plausible reasons for not finding an effect – weighing up the strengths and limitations of our study in 3 aspects; statistical (RD power), design-based (lack of representativeness <italic>vs.</italic> large sample), and mechanistic (the impact/or lack thereof of one-year of education on neural plasticity decades later). As we believe the approach of natural experiments with RD designs has considerable promise for the field of population cognitive neuroscience beyond this particular study, we will address each of these points within a broader section focused on considerations on how to optimize the insight, power, and inferences gained in future work within and beyond Biobank. Moreover, we will situate our discussion on the magnitude of the educational intervention among a broader discussion of cognitive training versus education, and short - versus long-term effects. We believe revising the manuscript will improve interpretation for the reader and thank you for your in-depth feedback. Lastly, we will provide a point-by-point response in the next version.</p>
