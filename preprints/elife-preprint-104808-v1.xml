<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Precise coordination of molecular programs and neuronal growth govern the formation, maintenance, and adaptation of neuronal circuits. RNA metabolism has emerged as a key regulatory node of neural development and nervous system pathologies. To uncover cell-type-specific RNA regulators, we systematically investigated expression of RNA recognition motif-containing proteins in the mouse neocortex. Surprisingly, we found RBM20, an alternative splicing regulator associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, to be expressed in cortical parvalbumin interneurons and mitral cells of the olfactory bulb. Genome-wide mapping of RBM20 target mRNAs revealed that neuronal RBM20 binds pre-mRNAs in distal intronic regions. Loss of neuronal RBM20 has only modest impact on alternative splice isoforms but results in a significant reduction in an array of mature mRNAs in the neuronal cytoplasm. This phenotype is particularly pronounced for genes with long introns that encode synaptic proteins. We hypothesize that RBM20 ensures fidelity of pre-mRNA splicing by suppressing non-productive splicing events in long neuronal genes. This work highlights a common requirement for RBM20-dependent transcriptome regulation in cardiomyocytes and neurons and demonstrates that a major genetic risk factor of heart disease impacts neuronal gene expression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neurons exhibit complex transcriptional programs that instruct the specification of functionally distinct neuronal cell types. Functional and anatomical properties of neurons emerge during development. However, the molecular underpinnings that define cell type-specific properties are only beginning to be elucidated. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have emerged as key regulators of neuronal function through modification of mRNA processing, localization, stability, and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ule &amp; Darnell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Babitzke <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Vuong <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mauger &amp; Scheiffele, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Holt <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ule &amp; Blencowe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gomez <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Moreover, RBP dysfunction is a significant contributor to pathologies, including neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ling <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lopez Soto <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gebauer <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schieweck <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Here, we discovered an unexpected neuronal function for the SR-related protein, RNA Binding Motif Protein 20 (RBM20). Thus far, RBM20 was considered to be muscle-specific and to represent a key alternative splicing regulator in cardiomyocytes. Mutations in the <italic>RBM20</italic> gene are linked to an aggressive form of dilated cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brauch <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Parikh <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). In cardiomyocytes, RBM20 protein controls alternative exon usage of transcripts encoding key sarcomere components (Titin and Tropomyosin) and proteins involved in calcium signaling, such as CAMK2D and the Î±1 subunit of the L-type voltage gated calcium channel (CACNA1C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Guo <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Maatz <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">van den Hoogenhof <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). RBM20 contains an RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) domain, two zinc finger motifs, and an extended arginine/serine-rich region. This domain organization is shared with the paralogues Matrin-3 (MATR3) and ZNF638 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Watanabe <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), and is similar to FUS and TDP43, two RNA/DNA binding proteins that regulate various steps of RNA metabolism. Comprehensive RBM20 protein-RNA interaction maps have been defined for cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Maatz <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">van den Hoogenhof <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Briganti <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). However, RBM20 expression and function in the brain, are unknown. Considering its highly selective expression in specific cell populations and the critical roles in cardiomyocytes, we hypothesized that neuronal RBM20 controls key steps of RNA metabolism and contributes to the regulation of neuronal gene expression.</p>

<title>RBM20 is selectively expressed in specific GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons</title>
<p>To discover regulators of neuronal cell type-specific transcriptomes, we analyzed a neuronal gene expression dataset covering cortical pyramidal cells and the major GABAergic interneuron populations of the mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Furlanis <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). We generated a hand-curated list of 234 potential RBPs, selected based on the presence of at least one predicted RRM domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). Transcripts for 182 of these RRM proteins were significantly expressed in mouse cortical neurons. While some (such as <italic>Eif3g</italic>, <italic>Hnrnpl</italic>) were broadly detected across all neuronal populations, others were differentially expressed in specific neuron classes. Thus, <italic>Rbm38</italic> was almost exclusively expressed in VIP<sup>+</sup> (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-positive) interneurons and <italic>Ppargc1b and Rbm20</italic> in parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) interneurons, indicating that they may play an important role in cell type-specific gene regulation. Identification of <italic>Rbm20</italic> expression in the brain was surprising considering that the RBM20 protein was thought to be muscle-specific. Thus, we focused our further studies on probing potential functions of RBM20 in the mouse brain.</p>

<p>To validate the neuronal expression, we investigated <italic>Rbm20</italic> mRNA distribution in the mouse neocortex by RNA fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FiSH). This analysis confirmed significant expression of <italic>Rbm20</italic> in PV<sup>+</sup> GABAergic interneurons (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B-D</xref>). Moreover, we detected low <italic>Rbm20</italic> mRNA levels in somatostatin-positive (SST<sup>+</sup>) interneurons of the somatosensory cortex (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B - D</xref>). A survey of open-source datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sjostedt <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>) revealed that <italic>Rbm20</italic> mRNA expression in PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons is evolutionary conserved in human. To examine RBM20 at the protein level, we raised polyclonal antibodies and confirmed RBM20 expression in PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons of the somatosensory cortex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). These experiments also uncovered RBM20 expression outside of the neocortex, with particularly high protein levels in the olfactory bulb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Here, RBM20 was restricted to glutamatergic cells in the mitral cell layer (MCL) and glomerular layer (GL) as opposed to the expression in GABAergic populations in the somatosensory cortex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Genetic marking and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization for markers <italic>Vglut2</italic> and <italic>Tbr2</italic> confirmed the glutamatergic neuron expression of <italic>Rbm20</italic> mRNA in tufted and mitral cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1E - G</xref>), with only low levels in a small number of GABAergic neurons (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1H</xref>). Similarly, we detected RBM20 protein in mitral cells of newborn mice (genetically marked with <italic>Tbx<sup>cre</sup>::Ai9<sup>tdTOM</sup></italic>), suggesting that its expression is initiated during development and continues into the adult (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>Neuronal RBM20 binds distal intronic regions of mRNAs encoding synaptic proteins</title>
<p>In cardiomyocytes, RBM20 acts as an alternative splicing regulator that gates exon inclusion by binding to exon-proximal intronic splicing silencers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Maatz <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dauksaite &amp; Gotthardt, 2018</xref>). Within the nucleus, RBM20 localizes to specific foci in close proximity to <italic>Titin</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Guo <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>) and has been proposed to form âsplicing factoriesâ, sites for coordinated processing of mRNAs derived from multiple genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bertero <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). By contrast, neuronal RBM20 did not concentrate in nuclear foci but instead, was distributed throughout the nucleoplasm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). This difference in the sub-nuclear localization likely arises from the lack of <italic>Titin</italic> and/or other similarly abundant mRNA targets in neuronal cells. To contrast neuronal and cardiomyocyte RNA targets, we mapped transcripts directly bound by RBM20 in the olfactory bulb and in the heart using cross-linking immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (CLIP-seq) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ule <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Van Nostrand <italic>et al</italic>, 2017b</xref>). Our RBM20 antibodies lacked sufficient affinity for immunoprecipitation. Thus, we generated a <italic>Rbm20<sup>HA</sup></italic> knock-in mouse line where the endogenous RBM20 protein is tagged with a Histidine-Biotin acceptor peptide and a triple HA-epitope (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">C</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Introduction of this tag did not alter overall RBM20 protein levels or expression pattern (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B, C</xref>).</p>

<p>RBM20 CLIP-seq analysis on heart and olfactory bulb tissues from P35-P40 <italic>Rbm20<sup>HA</sup></italic> knock- in mice identified significant peaks in 956 and 2707 unique transcripts, respectively. The CLIP tags obtained in biological replicates were highly correlated (two replicates for heart and three for olfactory bulb, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). In both tissues, the majority of the identified RBM20 CLIP peaks mapped to introns (80% in the heart and 94% in the olfactory bulb) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Only a low fraction of peaks was identified in the 3â untranslated region (11% in the heart and 1% in the olfactory bulb) and coding regions (7% in the heart and 3% in the olfactory bulb). RBM20 targets detected in the heart recapitulated all major target mRNAs identified in previous studies, including <italic>Ttn, Tpm, Pdlim5, Scn5a, Camk2d, Cacna1c, Cacna1d</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Guo <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Maatz <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">van den Hoogenhof <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Watanabe <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fenix <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). In heart and olfactory bulb, approximately 90% of the intronic RBM20 binding sites localized to distal regions (&gt; 500 bp from splice site) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). The previously reported UCUU motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Guo <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Upadhyay &amp; Mackereth, 2020</xref>) was significantly enriched at cross-link-induced truncation sites (CITS) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>) and <italic>de novo</italic> binding motif enrichment analysis identified a corresponding U-rich motif at RBM20 bound sites (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2D</xref>).</p>
<p>When directly comparing heart and olfactory bulb CLIP-seq datasets, we found transcripts from 363 genes that were commonly bound by RBM20 in both tissues. Other transcripts like <italic>Ttn</italic> are recovered as RBM20-bound only in one of the two tissues due to tissue-specific expression of the mRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Camk2d</italic> and <italic>Cacna1c</italic>, two important targets of RBM20 alternative splicing regulation in the heart, were identified as RBM20-bound in the olfactory bulb, however, binding sites mapped to different introns (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, and see TableS1). Finally, there was a sizable portion of pre-mRNAs (from 2721 genes) commonly expressed in both heart and olfactory bulb but selectively recovered as RBM20-bound in only one of the two tissues (539 genes in the heart and 2182 in the olfactory bulb). This suggests that RBM20 binds to target mRNAs in a tissue-specific manner. A tissue-specific function of RBM20 was further supported by gene ontology (GO) analysis. RBM20 target mRNAs in the heart showed enrichment for terms of muscle fiber components (M-band, Z-disc, T-tubule, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). By contrast, target genes in the olfactory bulb showed enrichment for terms related to pre- and postsynaptic structures, ion channels, and cytoskeletal components (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref> and Table S2). This suggests that neuronal RBM20 plays a role in the regulation of synapse-related mRNA transcripts.</p>

<title>Neuronal RBM20 is required for normal expression of long pre-mRNAs encoding synaptic proteins</title>
<p>To investigate the impact of RBM20 on the neuronal transcriptome, we performed loss-of-function experiments in <italic>Rbm20</italic> global and conditional knock-out mice. <italic>Rbm20</italic> was conditionally inactivated selectively in either parvalbumin-positive interneurons (<italic>Pvalb<sup>cre</sup>::Rbm20<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, referred to as â<italic>Rbm20<sup>ÎPV</sup></italic>â) or glutamatergic neurons (<italic>Vglut2<sup>cre</sup>::Rbm20<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, referred to as â<italic>Rbm20<sup>ÎVglut2</sup></italic>â). In global <italic>Rbm20</italic> knock-out mice, RBM20 immune-reactivity was abolished in the olfactory bulb and cells of the somatosensory cortex (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig.S4</xref> and see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> for western blots). Similarly, in the conditional knockout mice we observed a loss of RBM20 immune-reactivity in the respective cell populations (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Importantly, neuronal cell types were normally specified in <italic>Rbm20<sup>ÎVglut2</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C-F</xref>). We then applied a Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification protocol (RiboTRAP) optimized for small tissue samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Heiman <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sanz <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Di Bartolomei &amp; Scheiffele, 2022</xref>) to uncover the impact of RBM20 loss-of-function on the neuronal transcriptome. Isolations were performed for <italic>Rbm20<sup>ÎPV</sup></italic> and <italic>Rbm20<sup>ÎVglut2</sup></italic> conditional knock-out and matching <italic>Rbm20<sup>WT</sup></italic> mice (postnatal day 35-40). For quality control, we confirmed appropriate enrichment and de-enrichment of cell type-specific markers (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A, B</xref>). Subsequently, we assessed the transcriptomes by deep RNA sequencing (4-5 replicates per condition, male and female mice, paired-end, 150 base pair reads, &gt;80 million reads per replicate, see TableS3 and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C - F</xref> for details). Differential gene expression analysis by DESEQ2 did not identify significant differences in the overall transcriptome of <italic>Rbm20<sup>ÎPV</sup></italic> PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons as compared to wild-type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and Table S4). However, in the olfactory bulb glutamatergic cells isolated from Rbm20<italic><sup>ÎVglut2</sup></italic> mice we identified de-regulation of 409 genes (FC â¥ 1.5, adjusted p-value &lt; 0.01). 256 of these genes showed decreased expression in the conditional knockout mice as opposed to transcripts from 153 transcripts that were elevated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In the heart, RBM20 is considered a major regulator of alternative splicing. Thus, we quantified shifts in alternative exon usage upon <italic>Rbm20</italic> loss-of-function. We identified 859 differentially regulated alternative exons in PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons and 1924 exons in the <italic>Vglut2<sup>+</sup></italic> population in the olfactory bulb (FC in splicing index â¥ 1.5, p-value â¤ 0.05) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and Table S5). The functions of the gene products with alternative splicing de-regulation were diverse and the only significantly enriched gene ontology term for genes with de-regulated exons was âmitochondrial protein-containing complexesâ (p-value = 0.0003, 100 genes identified) for the olfactory bulb (<italic>Vglut2<sup>+</sup></italic>) population (Table S6).</p>

<p>To uncover transcript isoforms directly regulated by RBM20, we probed the intersection of the RBM20 binding sites identified by CLIP and alternative exon expression in the <italic>Vglut2<sup>+</sup></italic> cell population. Of the 1924 exons with differential incorporation in <italic>Rbm20<sup>ÎVglut2</sup></italic> cells, there were 659 exons with at least one significant RBM20 CLIP peak mapping to the corresponding gene. This frequency was higher than expected for a random distribution of CLIP peaks over all genes expressed in the sample (p = 5.2 * 10<sup>-</sup> <sup>8</sup>, hypergeometric distribution test for enrichment analysis). Interestingly, the vast majority of CLIP peaks were distant (&gt;10kb) from differentially expressed exons. This applied regardless of the type of alternative exon feature (alternative last exon, alternative transcription start sites, cassette exons or complex alternative splicing events). Thus, we identified only 1 differentially regulated cassette exon with a proximal RBM20 binding event (&lt; 500bp from the regulated exon) in the gene <italic>Arhgef1</italic>, (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). This suggests that suppression of alternative exons through proximal intronic splicing silencer elements is unlikely to be the primary essential function of neuronal RBM20.</p>
<p>Overall, RBM20 binding sites identified by CLIP distributed throughout the entire length of introns and did not exhibit a particular concentration at exon-intron boundaries (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). When examining the intersection of differential gene expression and CLIP data, we observed that 129 of the 256 down-regulated transcripts contained CLIP peaks (50.4%) whereas only 7 of the 153 up-regulated transcripts were bound by RBM20 (4.5%) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). This suggests that RBM20 loss-of-function in neuronal cells results in the loss of mRNAs whereas the observed elevation of selective transcripts is likely to be an indirect, compensatory response. This notion is further supported by the distinct gene ontologies of the de-regulated transcripts. Down-regulated genes displayed a significant enrichment in GO terms related to synaptic components and the cytoskeleton (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref> and Table S6). By contrast, for the up-regulated genes, there was a pronounced enrichment in mitochondrial components and ribosome composition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref> and see Table S6).</p>

<p>TDP-43 and MATR3, two proteins with similar domain organization to RBM20, regulate target mRNAs by suppressing aberrant splicing into cryptic exons, a phenotype most significant for genes with long introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Polymenidou <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ling <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Attig <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, intron length of transcripts showed a significant correlation with differential gene expression and the number of CLIP peaks in <italic>Rbm20<sup>ÎVglut2</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-F</xref>). Importantly, mean intron length was substantially larger for down-regulated transcripts when compared to all detected genes or to up-regulated genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). This difference was amplified when selectively examining introns of down-regulated genes with CLIP peaks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). Finally, introns bound by RBM20 were significantly longer than expected by chance as assed with a permutation test. Random regions with the same properties as RBM20 CLIP peak regions were generated on introns from genes expressed in our Ribo-TRAP dataset (see methods). This resulted in a mean expected intron size of 41.5 kb which is substantially smaller than the mean size of RBM20-bound introns (59.0 kb; p-value &lt; 0.0002). Thus, long neuronal mRNAs are preferentially bound by RBM20 and particularly sensitive to loss of neuronal RBM20 protein.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our work establishes an unexpected function for RBM20 in neuronal RNA metabolism. We identified RBM20 expression in two specific neuronal populations in the mouse brain. Interestingly, these two populations are derived from highly divergent lineages: glutamatergic neurons of the olfactory bulb from the rostral telencephalon and PV<sup>+</sup> GABAergic interneurons in the somatosensory cortex which arise from the medial ganglionic eminence of the subcortical telencephalon. Genetic deletion of RBM20 had only a modest impact on gene expression and transcript isoforms in PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons but was associated with substantial alterations in glutamatergic cells of the olfactory bulb. This might be due to the higher expression of RBM20 in mitral and tufted cells as compared to PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons. Moreover, PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons express high levels of the RBM20 paralogue MATR3 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig.S1A</xref>) which may have overlapping functions.</p>
<p>In cardiomyocytes, several direct targets of RBM20-dependent alternative splicing regulation contain intronic RBM20 binding sites in close proximity to regulated exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Maatz <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">van den Hoogenhof <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). In neuronal cells, we did not observe a similar regulation of proximal exons by RBM20. Interestingly, a large fraction of transcripts down-regulated in olfactory bulb RBM20 knock-out cells contained intronic RBM20 binding sites. Transcripts with long introns â which are prominently expressed in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sibley <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zylka <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) â were particularly sensitive to RBM20 loss. Thus, in neuronal cells, the splicing repressive function of RBM20 might prevent the recruitment of cryptic splice acceptor sites within long intronic segments. We hypothesize that the reduced expression of RBM20 target mRNAs observed in <italic>Rbm20<sup>ÎVglut2</sup></italic> neurons arises from aberrant nuclear splicing which ultimately result in the degradation of the transcripts.</p>
<p>The association of <italic>RBM20</italic> mutations with cardiomyopathies have directed substantial research efforts to uncover its function in the heart and to understand the impact of cardiomyopathy-associated mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Khan <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Briganti <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Schneider <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fenix <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). As for mice, human <italic>RBM20</italic> mRNA is also expressed in PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sjostedt <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). There is a growing body of literature highlighting shared genetic etiology of congenital heart disease and neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Homsy <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jin <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Rosenthal <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). A significant fraction of children with congenital heart disease exhibit autistic traits including problems with theory of mind and cognitive flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Marino <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>) and the probability of an individual with congenital heart disease being diagnosed with autism was estimated to be more than twofold higher than in the typically developing population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gu <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). A homozygous Ser529Arg substitution in the RNA recognition domain of RBM20 was recently identified in two brothers of consanguineous families affected by epilepsy and developmental delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Badshah <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). The <italic>RBM20</italic> variant segregated with a second mutation in the <italic>CNTNAP2</italic> gene, which encodes a neuronal transmembrane protein implicated in axon-glia interactions. Thus, it remains to be explored whether alterations in neuronal RBM20 function contributes to the clinical characteristics observed in these individuals. However, given the neuronal expression and function of RBM20 identified in our study, a survey of â thus far unexplored â neurological phenotypes in <italic>RBM20</italic> mutation carriers might be warranted.</p>

Libraries were quality-checked on the Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical, Ames, IA, USA) using the Standard Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit (Cat# DNF-473, Advanced Analytical).</p>
<p>The samples were pooled to equal molarity. The pool was quantified by Fluorometry using the QuantiFluor ONE dsDNA System (Cat# E4871, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) before sequencing. Libraries were sequenced Paired-End 151 bases (in addition: 8 bases for index 1 and 8 bases for index 2) setup using the NovaSeq 6000 instrument (Illumina) and the S1 Flow-Cell loaded at a final concentration in Flow-Lane loaded of 340pM and including 1% PhiX.</p>
<p>Primary data analysis was performed with the Illumina RTA version 3.4.4. On average per sample: 49Â±4 millions pass-filter reads were collected on this Flow-Cell.</p>

<title>RNA Seq data analysis</title>
<p>Initial gene expression and alternative splicing analysis was done in collaboration with GenoSplice Technology, Paris as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Furlanis <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). In brief, sequencing, data quality, reads repartition (e.g., for potential ribosomal contamination), and insert size estimation were performed using FastQC, Picard-Tools, Samtools and RSeQC tool packages. Reads were mapped using STAR (v2.4.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dobin <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>) on the mm10 Mouse genome assembly. The input read count matrix was the same as used for the splicing analysis. Two samples from the olfactory bulb were excluded from the analysis after the quality control of the data.</p>
<p>Read counts were summarized using featureCounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liao <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). For each gene present in the FASTDB v2021_4 annotations, reads aligning on constitutive regions (that are not prone to alternative splicing) were counted. Based on these read counts, normalization and differential gene expression were performed using DESeq2 (values were normalized to the total number of mapped reads of all samples) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Love <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>) on R (v.3.5.3). Genes were considered as expressed if their FPKM value is greater than 96% the background FPKM value based on intergenic regions. A gene is considered as expressed in the comparison if it is expressed in at least 50% of samples in at least one of the 2 groups compared. Results were considered statistically significant for adjusted p-values â¤ 0.01 (Benjamini Hochberg for p-value adjustment as implemented in DESeq2) and log<sub>2</sub>(FC) â¥ 1.5 or or â¤-1.5. For the principal component analysis, counts were normalized using the variance stabilizing transform (VST) as implemented in DESeq2. The internal normalization factors of DESeq2 were used to normalize the counts for generation of heatmaps. The alternative splicing analysis was performed by calculating a splicing index (SI) which is the ratio of read density on the exon of interest and the read density on constitutive exons of the same gene. The log<sub>2</sub> fold change (FC) and p-value (unpaired Studentâs t-test) was calculated by pairwise comparisons of the respective Splicing Index (SI) values. Results were considered significantly different for p-values â¤ 0.01 and log<sub>2</sub>(FC) â¥1 or â¤-1.</p>
<p>For the generation of volcano plots, exons and genes with <italic>NA</italic> or <italic>Inf</italic> values were removed to prevent bias caused by genes or exons with very low expression. Plots were created in R with the <italic>ggplot2</italic> package.</p>

<title>CLIP and library preparation</title>
<p>The CLIP experiments were performed according to the seCLIP protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Van Nostrand <italic>et al</italic>., 2017b</xref>) with some minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Traunmuller <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Olfactory bulbs from seven mice were pooled for each biological replicate and for heart tissue one heart was used per biological replicate. Samples were flash frozen and ground on dry ice first in a metal grinder and a porcelain mortar. The frozen powder was transferred into a plastic Petri dish and distributed in a thin layer. The samples were UV-crosslinked 3 times at 400 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> on dry ice with a UV-crosslinker (Cleaver Scientific). The powder was mixed and redistributed on the Petri dish before each UV exposure. After crosslinking, the powder was collected in 3.5ml (olfactory bulbs) or 5.5 ml (heart) in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, complete protease inhibitors, Roche) and 4 U per ml Turbo-DNase (Thermofisher). Samples were further processed as described in the extended methods section.</p>
<p>seCLIP data processing was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Van Nostrand <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Van Nostrand <italic>et al</italic>, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Van Nostrand <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). In brief, raw reads were processed to obtain unique CLIP tags mapped to mm10 using Clipper (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/YeoLab/clipper">https://github.com/YeoLab/clipper</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/YeoLab/eclip">https://github.com/YeoLab/eclip</ext-link>). Reads from replicates 1 and 2 from the olfactory bulb were concatenated. Peak normalization was performed by processing the SMInput samples using the same peak calling pipeline. Irreproducible discovery rate (IDR) analysis was performed to identify reproducible peaks across biological replicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). IDR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nboley/idr">https://github.com/nboley/idr</ext-link>) was used ranking seCLIP peaks by the fold change over the size-matched input. Clip peaks were called based on IDR &lt; 0.05. We observed some short highly represented sequences that were not specific to RBM20 seCLIP isolations, which were excluded based on peak shape and width (&lt; 30 bp) using StoatyDive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Heyl &amp; Backofen, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>For motif discovery, crosslinking-induced truncation sites (CITS) were called using the CTK pipeline (Shah et al. 2017). Briefly, unique tags from replicates were combined and CITS were called by requiring FDR &lt; 0.001. Sequences from â10bp to +10 bp from called CITS were used as input sequences for DREME software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bailey <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bailey <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Nystrom &amp; McKay, 2021</xref>). As a control, sequences of the same length coming from 500 bp upstream of the (â510 to â490 bases) from the CITS site were used. Enrichment of the UCUU motif at the CITS sites was calculated.</p>

<title>Analysis of RBM20-Bound Intron Length</title>
<p>For investigating the intron length of RBM20-bound introns, we performed a permutation test to calculate an empirical p-value. We generated 5,000 sets of random genomic coordinates, mirroring the length distribution and quantity of RBM20 seCLIP peaks. These coordinates were confined to the intronic regions of genes identified in the Vglut2 RiboTrap datasets.</p>
<p>In each permutation, we computed the mean length of all introns that included these random regions. The resulting distribution, based on 6,000 mean intron lengths, yielded a mean of â¼ 41.4 kb nucleotides and a standard deviation of â¼288.The average length of introns containing RBM20 seCLIP peaks was â¼ 59.0 kb, corresponding to a z-score of 60.95 and yielding a p-value 1.666667 * 10<sup>-4</sup>.This p-value is constrained by the number of permutations conducted.</p>

<title>Gene Ontology analysis</title>
<p>All the gene ontology analysis were performed by using a statistical overrepresentation test and the cellular component function in PANTHER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pantherdb.org/">http://pantherdb.org/</ext-link>). All genes being detected as expressed in the Ribo-TRAP RNA-sequencing data were used as reference. GO cellular component annotation data set was used and Fisherâs Exact test and Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied. GO terms with at least 5 genes and with P-value &lt;0.05 were considered as significantly enriched. Significant GO terms were plotted in Prism 9.</p>
<p>For seCLIP GO analysis, any gene that had significant peak expression in the CLIP dataset either for olfactory bulb or heart samples was used and all genes being detected as expressed in the seCLIP size-matched input samples were used as reference.</p>

<title>Statistical methods and data availability</title>
<p>Sample sizes were determined based on the 3R principle, past experience with the experiments and literature surveys. Pre-established exclusion criteria were defined to ensure success and reliability of the experiments: for stereotaxic injection, all mice with mis-targeted injections were excluded from analysis (e.g. if no eGFP signal was detected in the mitral cell layer of the OB). Investigators performing image analysis and quantification were blinded to the genotype and/or experimental group. For Ribo-TRAP pull-down experiments, all the samples presenting enrichment of the wrong marker genes were excluded. For the quantification of RBM20 expression in the olfactory bulb statistical analysis was performed with Prism 9 (GraphPad software) using unpaired t-test. Data presented are mean Â± SD. Images were assembled using Fiji, Omero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Swedlow <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) and Adobe Illustrator software.</p>
<p>A detailed description of the exclusion criteria for different experiments is included in the respective method sections. Statistical analyses were conducted with GraphPad Prism 9. The applied statistical tests were chosen based on sample size, normality of data distribution and number of groups compared. Details on <italic>n</italic>-numbers, p-values and specific tests are found in the figure legends. All raw data files, excel analysis tables and additional data supporting the findings of this study could not be included in the manuscript due to space constraints but are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p>

Dattaâs Laboratory.</p>
<p>The <italic>Rbm20</italic>-COIN allele knock-in mouse line was generated in collaboration with the Center for Transgenic Mouse (CTM) lines in Basel. The line was generated using the Crispr-Cas9 system. gRNAs targeting the last intron of <italic>Rbm20</italic> and template â<italic>coin allele</italic>â construct were injected together with RNA encoding for Crispr-Cas9 nuclease into C57BL/6J zygotes.

<title>Antibodies</title>
<p>The following commercially available antibodies were used: rat-anti-HA (Roche, #11867431001) and rabbit-anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling #5174), rabbit-anti-MAP2 (Synaptic Systems #188002), rabbit-anti-RFP (Rockland #600-401-379), chicken-anti-GFP (Aves Labs Inc. #GFP-1020), goat anti-Parvalbumin (Swant, PVG213), rabbit-anti-NeuN (Novus Biologicals cat. n. NBP1-77686SS). Secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or fluorescent dyes were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (goat anti-rabbit HRP #111-035-003; goat anti-rat HRP #112-035-143), donkey anti-rat IgG-Cy3 and Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 712-165-153, 706-175-148) donkey anti-goat IgG-Cy3 and donkey anti-chicken IgG-Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 705-165-147, 703-165-155).</p>
<p>For the generation of polyclonal anti-RBM20 antibodies, a synthetic peptide consisting of the RBM20 C-terminus was used: C+PERGGIGPHLERKKL (n- to c-terminus, C+ indicates a cysteine added to the n-terminus for thiol-mediated coupling). The synthetic peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin for immunization of rabbits and guinea pigs (Eurogentec, Belgium). Resulting sera were affinity-purified on the peptide antigen and the specificity of the resulting antibodies was confirmed using lysates and tissue sections from <italic>Rbm20</italic> knock-out mice.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>For quantifications of RBM20 positive neurons in the olfactory bulb, tile-scan images from 30 Âµm slices from the olfactory bulb of P35 mice were acquired. Mean intensity analyses for RBM20 signal were performed in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Schindelin <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>) using a custom-made Python script, as previously described (DOI-<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/imcf-shareables/3D_spots_count/blob/main/README.md">https://github.com/imcf-shareables/3D_spots_count/blob/main/README.md</ext-link>). In brief, neuronal cells were identified based on the nuclear DAPI signal. The mean intensity of RBM20 protein in each nucleus was then measured and the background signal was subtracted.</p>
<p>For the characterization of RBM20 sub-nuclear localization, brain and heart samples from <italic>Rbm20</italic> WT and <italic>Rbm20</italic> cKO mice (P35-P40) were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100/10 mg/kg <italic>i.p.</italic>) and transcardially perfused with fixative (4% paraformaldehyde). The brains and hearts were post-fixed overnight in the same fixative at 4Â°C and washed 3 times with 100 mM phosphate buffer (PB). Coronal brain slices were cut at 40 Âµm with a vibratome (Leica Microsystems VT1000). Brain samples were immersed in 15% and subsequently 30% sucrose in 1X PBS for 48 h, cryoprotected with Tissue-Tek optimum cutting temperature (OCT) and frozen at â80Â° until use. Tissue was sectioned at 40 Âµm on a cryostat (Microm HM560, Thermo Scientific) and collected in 1X PBS. Immunohistochemistry and imaging were performed as previously described.</p>

<title>Targeted LC-MS sample preparation and analysis</title>
<p>Murine nuclear extracts of heart tissue were lysed in 100 mM Triethylamonium bicarbonate pH 8.5 / 5% SDS / 10 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphin using 20 cycles of sonication (30 s on / 30 s off per cycle) on a Bioruptor system (Dianode) followed by heating to 95Â° C for 10 min. Protein extracts were alkylated using 15 mM iodoacetamide at 25Â°C in the dark for 30 min. For each sample, 50 Âµg of protein lysate was captured, digested, and desalted using STRAP cartridges (Protifi, NY, US) following the manufacturerâs instructions. Samples were dried under vacuum and stored at â80Â°C until further use.</p>
<p>For parallel reaction-monitoring (PRM) assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Peterson <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>) three proteotypic peptides derived from RBM20 were selected for assay development (ASPPTESDLQSQACR, QGFGCSCR and SGSPGPLHSVSGYK). A mixture containing 100 fmol of each heavy reference peptide (JPT, Berlin, Germany) including iRT peptides (Biognosys, Schlieren, Switzerland) was used. The setup of the Î¼RPLC-MS system was as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Ahrne <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Peptides were analyzed per LC-MS/MS run using a linear gradient ranging from 95% solvent A (0.15% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile) and 5% solvent B (98% acetonitrile, 2% water, 0.15% formic acid) to 45% solvent B over 60 min at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Hauser <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). The acquired raw-files were database searched against a <italic>Mus musculus</italic> database (Uniprot, download date: 2020/03/21, total of 44â786 entries) by the MaxQuant software (Version 1.0.13.13). To control for variation in sample amounts, the total ion chromatogram (only comprising peptide ions with two or more charges) of each sample was determined by Progenesis QI (version 2.0, Waters) and used for normalization. The datasets of this study are deposited on MassIVE (code: MSV000093344) and PRIDE (code: PXD046806).</p>

<title>In situ hybridization</title>
<p>For quantification of <italic>Vglut2, Tbr2</italic> and <italic>Rbm20</italic> transcripts expression in mitral and tufted neurons of the olfactory bulb, P25 animals were euthanized and the brains were harvested and processed as described above. Stacks of 10-15 Âµm width (0.44 Âµm interval between stacks) were acquired from olfactory bulb slices at room temperature with an upright LSM700 confocal microscope (Zeiss) using 40X Apochromat objectives. A ROI was drawn to define the area of each cell residing either in the mitral cell layer or glomeruli layer of the olfactory bulb. Dots in the ROIs were detected automatically throughout the z-stacks for each channel, using a custom-made Python script, as described in (DOI- <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/imcf-shareables/3D_spots_count/blob/main/README.md">https://github.com/imcf-shareables/3D_spots_count/blob/main/README.md</ext-link>).

<title>Two photon image analysis</title>
<p>A total of 10 neurons (5 neurons per genotype from at least 3 biological replicates) were analyzed. Both apical and lateral dendrites of mitral cells were traced semi-automatically by using the user-guided 3D image detection algorithm. Tracings were checked and corrected manually when needed. Subcellular components, such as spines and other small protrusions were not traced. The following parameters were extracted from the software Neurolucida ExplorerÂ®. for each traced neuron: the number of dendrites from different centrifugal orders (<italic>i.e.</italic> primary dendrites, secondary dendrites etc.) and the total dendritic lengt of the glomeruli tufts. Average values were calculated for each neuron analyzed. Graphs and statistical analyses (t-tests) were made using GraphPad Prism.</p>

<title>CLIP sample preparation</title>
<p>The lysate was transferred into a glass homogenizer and homogenized by 30 strokes on ice. 1 ml aliquots of homogenized tissue were transferred to 2 ml tubes, 10 Âµl of RNaseI (Thermofisher) diluted in PBS (1:5 â1:40) were added to each tube. Samples were incubated at 37Â°C with shaking for 5 min at 1200 x rpm and then put on ice. 10 Âµl RNasin RNase-inhibitor (40 U/Âµl, Promega) were added to each tube. Sample were mixed and centrifuged at 16.000 x g for 15min at 4Â°C. The supernatants were transferred to a new tube and 60 Âµl from each sample were taken and further processed for sized matched INPUT (SMIn). 10 Âµl HA-magnetic beads (Pierce) was added to each sample and incubated at 4Â°C for 4h in a rotating shaker. Following incubation, the beads were washed 2x with a high salt wash buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), 2x with the lysis buffer, 2x with low salt wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 10mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2% Tween-20) and 1x with PNK buffer (70 mM Tris-HCl pH6.5, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>).

Upon RNA dephosphorylation, the beads were washed (2x high salt, 2x lysis and 2x low salt buffers as before) and additionally with 1x Ligase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 10 mM MgCl2). Beads were then re-suspended in 50 Âµl ligase mix (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM ATP, 3% DMSO, 15% PEG8000, 30 U RNasin, 75 U T4 RNA-ligase (NEB)). 10 Âµl of the beads / ligase mix were transferred to a new tube and 1 Âµl of pCp-Biotin (Jena Bioscience) were added to validate IP of the RNA-protein-complexes by western blot. 4 Âµl of the RNA-adaptor mix containing 40 ÂµM of each InvRiL19 &amp; InvRand3Tr3 (IDT) were added to the remaining of the samples (40 Âµl). Samples were placed at RT for 2 h for adaptor ligation. Samples were washed 2x with high salt, 2x with lysis and 1x with low salt buffers. Finally, beads were re-suspended in 1x LDS sample buffer (Thermofisher) supplemented with 10 uM DTT and incubated for 10 min at 65Â°C, shaking on a thermomixer at 1200 x rpm. Eluates or inputs were loaded on 4-12% Bis-Tris, 1.5 mm gel (Thermofisher) and separated at 130 V for â¼ 1.5 h. Proteins were transferred overnight at 30 V to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham). The membranes were placed in a 15 cm Petri dish on ice and an area between 55 and 145 kDa was cut out small pieces and transferred in a 2 ml tube.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors of this study set out to find RNA binding proteins in the CNS in cell-type specific sequencing data and discover that the cardiomyopathy-associated protein RBM20 is selectively expressed in olfactory bulb glutamatergic neurons and PV+ GABAergic neurons. They make an HA-tagged RBM20 allele to perform CLIP-seq to identify RBM20 binding sites and find direct targets of RBM20 in olfactory bulb glutmatergic neurons. In these neurons, RBM20 binds intronic regions. RBM20 has previously been implicated in splicing, but when they selectively knockout RBM20 in glutamatergic neurons they do not see changes in splicing, but they do see changes in RNA abundance, especially of long genes with many introns, which are enriched for synapse-associated functions. These data show that RBM20 has important functions in gene regulation in neurons, which was previously unknown, and they suggest it acts through a mechanism distinct from what has been studied before in cardiomyocytes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study finds expression of the cardiomyopathy-associated RNA binding protein RBM20 in specific neurons in the brain, opening new windows into its potential functions there.</p>
<p>The study uses CLIP-seq to identify RBM20 binding RNAs in olfactory bulb neurons.</p>
<p>Conditional knockout of RBM20 in glutamatergic or PV neurons allows the authors to detect mRNA expression that is regulated by RBM20.</p>
<p>The data include substantial controls and quality control information to support the rigor of the findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors do not fully identify the mechanism by which RBM20 acts to regulate RNA expression in neurons, though they do provide data suggesting that neuronal RBM20 does not regulate alternate splicing in neurons, which is an interesting contrast to its proposed mechanism of function in cardiomyocytes. Discovery of the RNA regulatory functions of RBM20 in neurons is left as a question for future studies.</p>
<p>The study does not identify functional consequences of the RNA changes in the conditional knockout cells, so this is also a question for the future.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The group around Prof. Scheiffele has made seminal discoveries reg. alternative splicing that is reflected by a current ERC advanced grant and landmark papers in eLife (2015), Science (2016), and Nature Neuroscience (2019). Recently, the group investigated proteins that contain an RRM motif in the mouse cortex. One of them, termed RBM20, was originally thought to be muscle-specific and involved in alternative splicing in cardiomyocytes. However, upon close inspection, RBP20 is expressed in a particular set of interneurons (PV positive cells of the somatosensory cortex) in the cortex as well as in mitral cells of the olfactory bulb (OB). Importantly, they used CLIP to identify targets in the OB and heart. Next and quite importantly, they generated a knock-in mouse line with a His-biotin acceptor peptide and a HA epitope to perform specific biochemistry. Not surprisingly, this allowed them to specifically identify transcripts with long introns, however, most of the intronic binding sites were very distant to the splice sites. Closer GO term inspection revealed that RBM20 specifically regulates synapse-related transcripts. In order to get in vivo insight into its function in the brain, the authors generated both global as well as conditional KO mice. Surprisingly, there were no significant differences in in RBM20 ÎPV interneurons, however, 409 transcripts were deregulated in in OB glutamatergic neurons. Here, CLIP sites were mostly found to be very distant from differentially expressed exons. Furthermore, loss-of-function RBM20 primarily yields loss of transcripts, whereas upregulation appears to be indirect. Together, these results strongly suggest a role of RBM20 in the inclusion of cryptic exons thereby promoting target degradation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The quality of the data and the figures is high, impressive and convincing. The reported results strongly suggest a role of RBM20 in the inclusion of cryptic exons thereby promoting target degradation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I would not use the term weakness here.</p>
<p>
The description of the results is sometimes too dense and technical. As eLife does not have a size limit, there is no reason for the results section to be less than three pages. Especially the last paragraph of the results part (p4) does not do justice to the high importance of Fig. 5, which I consider of high importance and originality. Here are a few suggestions from a person that is not working on splicing, to improve the text part of this important manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) Introduction: too short, include a paragraph on splicing and cryptic exons</p>
<p>
(2) Results:</p>
<p>
- shortly describe the phenotypes of the mice mentioned</p>
<p>
- expand the section on Fig. 5 and cryptic exons especially</p>
<p>
(3) Discussion: too short, expand on the possible new role of RBM20 and target degradation, possibly by adding a scheme?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors identified RBM20 expression in neural tissues using cell type-specific transcriptomic analysis. This discovery was further validated through in vitro and in vivo approaches, including RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), open-source datasets, immunostaining, western blotting, and gene-edited RBM20 knockout (KO) mice. CLIP-seq and RiboTRAP data demonstrated that RBM20 regulates common targets in both neural and cardiac tissues, while also modulating tissue-specific targets. Furthermore, the study revealed that neuronal RBM20 governs long pre-mRNAs encoding synaptic proteins.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>â¢ Utilization of a large dataset combined with experimental evidence to identify and validate RBM20 expression in neural tissues.</p>
<p>
â¢ Global and tissue-specific RBM20 KO mouse models provide robust support for RBM20 localization and expression.</p>
<p>
â¢ Employing heart tissue as a control highlights the unique findings in neural tissues.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>â¢ Lack of physiological functional studies to explore RBM20's role in neural tissues.</p>
<p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for the constructive suggestions made in the Public Reviews and the Recommendations to Authors. We intend to address these comments in a revised manuscript as follows:</p>
<p>(1) We will revise the text according to the reviewer suggestions with regards to specific RBM20-dependent mRNAs and providing more detailed explanations in results and discussion.</p>
<p>(2) We will upload higher resolution images of several figures (resolution had been reduced to achieve lower file sizes) to address the comment regarding âdata qualityâ.</p>
<p>(3) We will include data on eCLIP control experiments.</p>
<p>(4) We will add information on replication and new data for the western blot analysis.</p>
