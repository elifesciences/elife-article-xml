<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Human mutations in the gene encoding the solute carrier (SLC) 6A17 caused intellectual disability (ID). The physiological role of SLC6A17 and pathogenesis of Slc6a17-based-ID were both unclear. Here we report learning deficits in SLC6A17 knockout and point mutants. Biochemistry, proteomics and electron microscopy (EM) support SLC6A17 protein localization in synaptic vesicles (SVs). Chemical analysis of SVs by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) revealed glutamine (Gln) in SVs containing SLC6A17. Virally mediated overexpression of SLC6A17 increased Gln in SVs. Either genetic or virally mediated targeting of SLC6A17 reduced Gln in SVs. One ID mutation caused SLC6A17 mislocalization while the other caused defective Gln transport. Multidisciplinary approaches with 7 types of genetically modified mice have shown Gln as an endogenous substrate of SLC 6A17, uncovered Gln as a new molecule in SVs, established the necessary and sufficient roles of SLC6A17 in Gln transport into SVs, and suggested SV Gln decrease as the key pathogenetic mechanism in human ID.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With an approximate prevalence of 1%, intellectual disability (ID) in humans is a neurodevelopmental disorder with debilitating effects on patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Maulik et al., 2011</xref>). Molecular genetic research into ID has identified multiple genes whose defects underly ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">de Ligt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gilissen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hamdan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Khan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lelieveld et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Rauch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Ropers, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Vissers et al., 2016</xref>). Functional studies of products encoded by these genes are essential for our mechanistic understanding of ID pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Mutations causing ID were found in the gene encoding SLC6A17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Iqbal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Waltl, 2015</xref>). SLC6A17, also known as Rxt1, NTT4, XT1, or B<sup>0</sup>AT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">el Mestikawy et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Liu et al., 1993</xref>), was discovered 29 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">el Mestikawy <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>). It is predominantly expressed in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">el Mestikawy <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fischer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hagglund et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Jursky and Nelson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kachidian, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Luque et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Masson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Masson et al., 1999</xref>). SLC6A17 protein was localized on SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fischer <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; Kachidian, 1999; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Masson <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). Those facts, together with its membership in the SLC6 or the neurotransmitter transporter (NTT) family, suggest that SLC6A17 could be a vesicular transporter for a neurotransmitter(s).</p>
<p>Early efforts failed to identify substrates transported by SLC6A17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Broer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">el Mestikawy <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>). A later study using pheochromocytoma (PC)12 cells and SLC6A17-tranfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells found that SLC6A17 could transport 4 amino acids (AA): proline (Pro), glycine (Gly), leucine (Leu) and alanine (Ala) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Parra et al., 2008</xref>). Another study using human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells reported transport of 9 AAs: Leu, methionine (Met), Pro, cysteine (Cys), Ala, glutamine (Gln), serine (Ser), histidine (His) and Gly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Zaia and Reimer, 2009</xref>). There are three differences between these two studies: that the second study reported 5 more amino acids (Met, Cys, Gln, Ser and His) as substrates of SLC6A17, that the second study used modified SLC6A17 to facilitate its membrane localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Zaia and Reimer, 2009</xref>), and that one reported Na<sup>+</sup> dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Zaia and Reimer, 2009</xref>) whereas the other reported H<sup>+</sup> dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Parra <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). However, none of these AAs have been found in the SVs. It remains unknown which of the 4 or 9 AAs, if any, are present in the SVs in an SLC6A17 dependent manner <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Thus, how mutations in a single AA of SLC6A17 lead to ID is unknown, the substrate(s) physiologically transported by SLC6A17 is unknown and behavioral phenotypes of animals lacking SLC6A17 or carrying any mutation pathogenic in human patients have not been characterized.</p>
<p>We have now generated mouse mutants either lacking the Slc6a17 gene or mimicking a point mutation found in ID patients. They had similar phenotypes including deficient learning and memory, indicating that the human mutation was a loss of function (LOF) mutation. These are the first animal models of ID caused by Slc6a17 mutations. While two in vitro studies with cell lines suggested that SLC6A17 could transport up to 9 neutral AAs, we could only find that Gln was present in the SVs. From multiple gain of function (GOF) and LOF experiments, we have obtained evidence that SLC6A17 is not only sufficient for Gln presence in the SVs <italic>in vivo</italic>, but it is also physiologically necessary for Gln presence in the SVs. Thus, we have found the endogenous substrate for SLC6A17. Of the two known human mutations pathogenic for ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Iqbal <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), we provide evidence that one caused the SLC6A17 to be mislocalized subcellularly and the other, while still on SVs, was defective in Gln transport. Decreases of Gln in SVs caused by SLC6A17 mutations were not correlated with any decrease in glutamate (Glu) or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dissociating vesicular Gln from the Glu/GABA-Gln cycle between neurons and glia. In addition to dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying ID caused by Slc6a17 mutations, we report for the first time that Gln is robustly and reproducibly detected in the SVs, which should stimulate further research into its potential roles in neurotransmission.</p>

<title>Pattern of Slc6a17 expression</title>
<p>To examine the pattern of Slc6a17 expression, we designed a knock-in mouse line Slc6a17<sup>-2A-CreERT2</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). These mice were generated by in frame fusion of a T2A sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahier and Jarriault, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Daniels et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Trichas et al., 2008</xref>) and CreERT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Feil et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Indra et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Sauer and Henderson, 1988</xref>) to the C terminus of Slc6a17 with its stop codon removed (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). We crossed the Slc6a17<sup>-2A-CreERT2</sup> mice with the Ai14 reporter line which contained floxed stop-tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>). Treatment with Tamoxifen removed the stop codon and thus allowed specific expression of tdTomato in Slc6a17 positive cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). Labeled cells were exclusively neuronal with no glial expression detected.</p>

<p>To investigate learning and memory of Slc6a17-KO mice, we first tested Slc6a17-KO mice on a classical associative learning model of contextual and cued fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Phillips and Ledoux, 1992</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Both the WT and the heterozygous (Slc6a17<sup>+/-</sup>) mice spent a significant amount of time freezing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) on day 2 in Context-a environment. However, homozygous (Slc6a17<sup>-/-</sup>) mutants showed a dramatic decrease in freezing behavior compared to the other genotypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).

<p>We then investigated learning and memory in Slc6a17<sup>P633R</sup> mice. In contextual and cued fear conditioning (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), Slc6a17<sup>P633R/P633R</sup> mutants showed significantly less freezing behavior compared to Slc6a17<sup>+/+</sup> and heterozygous (Slc6a17<sup>P633R/+</sup>) mice on day 2 in Context-a environment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).

These results indicate that Slc6a17<sup>P633R</sup> mice are defective in contextual and cued fear memory.</p>
<p>We then tested Slc6a17<sup>P633R</sup> mice in the Morris Water Maze for hippocampal spatial learning and memory (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Morris, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Morris <italic>et al</italic>., 1982</xref>).

<p>Taken together, these data indicate that Slc6a17<sup>P633R</sup> mice are also significantly impaired both in contextual and cued fear memory and in hippocampus-dependent long-term spatial learning.

<p>We used the anti-HA antibody to immunoisolate SLC6A17-HA protein from Slc6a17<sup>-HA-2A-iCre</sup> mice (Slc6a17<sup>HA/+</sup>), with WT (SLC6A17<sup>+/+</sup>) mice as a control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and S5D). After examining markers of subcellular organelles, the fraction containing SLC6A17-HA was found to be co-localized with SV markers such as Syp, Syt1, Syb2, VATPase and vesicular neurotransmitter transporters including VGluT1, VGluT2, and VGAT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and S5D), but not with markers of axons or dendrites (GLUT4 or transferrin receptor), ER (ERp72), the lysosome (LAMP2, LC3b or cathepsin D), the cytoplasmic membrane (SNAP23, PSD95 and GluN1), the Golgi apparatus (GM130 and Goglin-97), mitochondria (VADC), the active zone (ERC1b/2), the endosome (EEA1) and the proteosome (PSMC6) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and S5D).

Quantitative analysis showed distinct populations of SVs distinguished by electron density (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref> and S6B, S6D, S6F, S6H).</p>

<title>Functional significance of the SV localization of SLC6A17</title>

Thus, Slc6a17 gene knockout indeed specifically decreased SLC6A17 protein, but none of the other transporters.</p>
<p>To investigate the functional significance of the subcellular localization of SLC6A17, we examined the subcellular localization of SLC6A17<sup>P633R</sup> protein in the mouse brain.

<p>Surprisingly, of the 9 AAs reported previously using cultured cells, 8 (Ala, Gly, Leu, Pro, Cys, Gly, His and Ser) were not found to be significantly enriched in SVs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>).

<p>There could be several reasons why molecules transported into cultured cells were not detected in SVs of the mouse brain, including, e.g., relative abundance in subsets of SVs specific for different transporters, or the redundancy of multiple transporters for a single molecule among the 9 candidates.

<p>The above results with SVs purified by the anti-Syp antibody revealed Gln presence in SVs, but did not show association of Gln with specific transporter on SV, because Syp is a universal marker of SVs (Jahn, Schiebler, Quimet and Greengard, 1985; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Wiedenmann and Franke, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Leube et al., 1987</xref>; Südhof et al., 1987). To determine the potential relationship of SLC6A17 with Gln in the SVs, we used magnetic beads coated with the anti-HA antibody to immunoisolate SLC6A17-positive SVs from Slc6a17<sup>-HA-2A-iCre</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and S5D).</p>
<p>The monoclonal anti-HA antibody could enrich SVs containing SLC6A17 from the brains of Slc6a17<sup>-HA-2A-iCre</sup> mice but not from wt mice, as confirmed by the analysis of 23 markers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and S5D). SVs thus isolated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) were subject to chemical analysis with LC-MS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). Glu, GABA and ACh were detected in SVs containing SLC6A17-HA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> to <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6G</xref>), consistent with the immunoblot results that these SVs contained VGluT1, VGluT2 and VGAT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Significant enrichment of Gln was detected in SVs containing SLC6A17-HA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref> and 6H). By contrast, the other 8 AAs had not been found to be enriched in SVs containing SLC6A17-HA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref> and 6I).</p>

To investigate whether SLC6A17<sup>G162R</sup> affected Gln transportation, we used AAV-PHP.eb to overexpress either hSLC6A17<sup>G162R</sup>-HA or Syp-HA in mouse brains. Overexpressed hSLC6A17<sup>G162R</sup>-HA was still localized on SVs (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9A and S9E</xref>).

<p>LC-MS analysis of contents of SVs immunoisolated by the anti-HA antibody from OE-Syp-HA mice, when compared with immunoprecipitates by the anti-HA antibody from the brains of WT mice, would indicate SV enriched molecules.

<p>The contents of SVs immunoisolated from OE-hSLC6A17<sup>G162R</sup>-HA mice, when compared with that from OE-Syp-HA and WT mice, would indicate molecules enriched in SVs containing hSLC6A17<sup>G162R</sup> mutation, above the general contents of all SVs. Levels of Glu and GABA in SVs containing hSLC6A17<sup>G162R</sup>-HA were higher than those in WT mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7K</xref> and S9B), but not significantly different with those from OE-Syp-HA mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7K</xref>).

<p>Importantly, when the SV contents from the brains of knockout (AAV-sgRNA/Slc6a17<sup>iCre</sup>/Cas9<sup>+</sup>) and control (AAV-sgRNA/Slc6a17<sup>iCre</sup>/Cas9<sup>-</sup>) mice were compared after LC-MS analysis, Gln was the only vesicular content significantly decreased in SVs from the knockout mice (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>, <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9D</xref> and 9H).</p>
<p>To our surprise, GABA and Glu were moderately increased (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>, <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9D</xref>, 9E and 9F). The level of ACh, and those of the other 8 AAs (Ala, Gly, Leu, Pro, Cys, Gly, His and Ser) were not significantly changed in the SVs from adult Slc6a17 knockout mice (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>, <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9D</xref>, 9G and 9I). The increased levels of Glu and GABA in SVs of virally mediated knock-out mice were different from the absence of Glu and GABA increases in the straightforward Slc6a17 KO (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8B</xref>), making the significance of the observed increases of Glu and GABA in the virally mediated Slc6a17 knockout unclear.</p>
<p>These results indicate that SLC6A17 is physiologically necessary for Gln in SVs, but not for the other 8 AAs.</p>

<p>LC-MS analysis of contents from SVs showed a significant decrease of Gln level in Slc6a17<sup>P633R/P633R</sup>, as compared to Slc6a17<sup>+/+</sup> and Slc6a17<sup>P633R/+</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10H</xref>). The difference in Gln between Slc6a17<sup>+/+</sup> and Slc6a17<sup>P633R/+</sup> was not statistically significant (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10H</xref>). The levels of Glu (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A</xref>), GABA (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B</xref>) and ACh (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10C</xref>) in SVs were not significantly different among Slc6a17<sup>+/+</sup>, Slc6a17<sup>P633R/+</sup> and Slc6a17<sup>P633R/P633R</sup> mice.

<p>We have taken multiple approaches to analyze 7 kinds of genetically modified mice (4 modified in the germline and 3 in adult brains) and our results indicating that Gln as an endogenous substrate of SLC6A17 and SLC6A17 is necessary and sufficient for Gln presence in SVs in vivo.</p>
<p>We have discovered the presence of Gln in the SVs and shown that it is functionally important because two mutations pathogenic for human ID patients both resulted in reduction of Gln in the SVs. We discuss these findings in basic neurobiology with implications in human ID pathology.</p>

<title>The discovery of Gln in SVs and its functional significance</title>
<p>With behavioral studies in two types of Slc6a17 mutant mice, we have shown that one ID pathogenic Slc6a17 mutation (Slc6a17<sup>P633R</sup>) causes defective learning and memory (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), similar to the phenotype of Slc6a17 knockout mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). With biochemical purifications and genetically assisted EM, we have confirmed SLC6A17 localization on SVs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>We demonstrate the functional significance of the SV localization of SLC6A17 by showing that the human ID mutation Slc6a17<sup>P633R</sup> causes mislocalization of SLC6A17 outside the SVs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and S6A). Gln transport into the SVs was decreased in Slc6a17<sup>P633R</sup> mutant mice (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10I</xref>).</p>
<p>With multiple rounds of biochemical purification of SVs and chemical analysis of SV contents of genetically modified mice, we have found that Gln is present in SVs containing SLC6A17 and that SLC6A17 is sufficient for Gln presence in SVs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and 7). With two lines of germline mutant mice and virally mediated gene edited mice, we demonstrate that Gln is the only molecule reliably and reproducibly reduced in SVs when Slc6a17 gene is deleted (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>).</p>
<p>We have also characterized mice carrying a human ID mutation SLC6A17<sup>G162R</sup> and found it could not transport Gln into SVs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>), further supporting the importance of Gln in SVs. Thus, two mutations pathogenic in human ID are both LOF mutations: SLC6A17<sup>P633R</sup> with mislocalization outside the SVs and the SLC6A17<sup>G162R</sup> with defective Gln transport into the SVs.</p>
<p>The fact that all four kinds of SLC6A17 LOF mutations (two KOs, two point mutations) have led to reduction of Gln in SVs strongly support the functional significance of Gln in SVs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Functional mechanisms of Gln in SVs</title>
<p>There are three possible functions for Gln in SVs: serving as a neurotransmitter, serving as a carbon source and serving in a function so far unknown.</p>
<p>The first possibility is most attractive. SLC6A17 is a member of the SLC6 family, which is also known as the NTT family because many members of this family are transporters for neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blakely and Edwards, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Broer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Kristensen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Rudnick et al., 2014</xref>): SLC6A1 for GABA (Guastella et al., 1992; Clark et al., 1992; Borden et al., 1992; Lopez-Corcuera et al. 1992), SLC6A2 for noradrenaline (Pachoczyk, Blakely and Amara, 1991), SLC6A3 for DA (Giros et al., 1991; Kilty et al., 1991; Shimada et al., 1991), SLC6A4 for 5-HT or serotonin (Blakely et al., 1991; Hoffman et al., 1991), SLC6A5 and SLC6A9 for Gly (Guastella et al., 1992; Smith et al. 1992; Liu et al., 1992). Most of these are cytoplasmic transporters for transporting neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft into the presynaptic cytoplasm.</p>
<p>The presence of the SLC6A17 protein on the vesicular membrane further supports the possibility that it is a neurotransmitter transporter, because most of the vesicular transporters with known substrates transport neurotransmitters. If this is true for SLC6A17, then Gln would be a good candidate for a new neurotransmitter. However, this exciting possibility remains to be investigated. For Gln to be a transmitter, in addition to its presence in the SVs, more criteria should be satisfied: 1) it should be released from the nerve terminals upon electric stimulation, 2) it should be active on postsynaptic membrane, 3) it should be up-taken by a cytoplasmic transporter back into the presynaptic terminal or be removed otherwise (such as degraded enzymatically), and 4) a pharmacological blocker inhibiting its activity should interfere with chemical transmission in a physiologically significant context. Because Gln is abundant both intracellularly and extracellularly, we expect that demonstration of all the above would take some time, and likely by many laboratories.</p>
<p>There is a Glu/Gln cycle in which Glu released from neurons is taken up by glia and transformed into Gln, followed by Gln release from glia and taken up by neurons and transformed into Glu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bak et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benjamin and Quastel, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ottersen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">van den Berg and Garfinkel, 1971</xref>). Gln uptake across the neuronal cytoplasmic membrane relies on system A transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mackenzie et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Reimer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Varoqui et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Weiss et al., 2003</xref>), while Gln uptake across the glia cytoplasmic membrane uses system L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deitmer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kanai et al., 1998</xref>), system N transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Broer and Brookes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chaudhry et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chaudhry et al., 1999</xref>) and system ASC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Broer et al., 2000</xref>). It is unlikely that SLC6A17 and the Gln it transports could be part of the Glu/Gln cycle, because: 1) the Glu/Gln cycle uses cytoplasmic transporters for Gln, not vesicular transporters for Gln; 1. 2) Gln is transformed into Glu in the cytoplasm of neurons before being transported in the SVs as Glu; 3) in all of our experiments presented here, when SLC6A17 was genetically disrupted, Gln was consistently decreased, but Glu was either unchanged but not concomitantly increased, which was against the expectation of the Glu/Gln cycle. The only result in which Glu was increased when SLC6A17 was decreased came from an experiment with virally mediated genetic knockdown of SLC6A17 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9E</xref>), but GABA was also increased in that experiment (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9F</xref>). When the same experiment was carried with a germline genetic knockout of SLC6A17, Glu was not changed when SLC6A17 was decreased (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>).</p>
<p>The possibility of Gln as a carbon source is based on the fact that it is one of the major carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hensley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Reitzer et al., 1979</xref>). It would be very curious if a carbon source should be stored in the SVs. It would suggest an entirely new function for Gln in the nerve terminal which has never been suspected before and may require considerable efforts before one can fully understand.</p>
<p>Multiple other functions for Gln have been proposed (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Curi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Wischmeyer, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Other substrates for SLC6A17</title>
<p>Of the nine AAs (Ala, Gly, Leu, Pro, Cys, Gln, Gly, His and Ser) previously reported to be in vitro substrates for SLC6A17 transport in cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Parra <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Zaia and Reimer, 2009</xref>), we have reliably and reproducibly found evidence supporting only one (Gln) as present <italic>in vivo</italic> in all 5 types of experiments conducted with SV purifications: SVs immunoisolated from the WT brains by anti-Syp (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), SVs immunoisolated from the brains of mice with the HA tag fused in frame to the endogenous SLC6A17 protein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), SVs immunoisolated from mice with virally introduced overexpression of Syp-HA, SVs immunoisolated from mice with virally introduced overexpression of SLC6A17<sup>G162R</sup>-HA, and SVs immunoisolated from mice with virally introduced overexpression of SLC6A17-HA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). While we did observe a moderate increase of His in one set of experiments (OE SLC6A17-HA vs WT), we did not find evidence for its changes in other experiments.</p>
<p>Because multiple transporters can transport AAs, and the relative contribution of each transporter varies and the relative abundance of each small molecules and their detectability varies, we can not rule out the possibility that SLC6A17 can contribute to the transport of other AAs into the SVs. However, our results can establish that Gln is transported <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>In summary, integration of genetics, biochemistry, behavioral analysis, mass spectrometry and electron microscopy has resulted in the discovery of Gln as a novel chemical in SVs, provided <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that SLC6A17 is necessary and sufficient for Gln in SVs, generated animal models for, and suggested pathogenetic mechanism of, human ID. However, while we have answered the question how Slc6a17 mutations may cause ID in animals, our research has also raised more questions. This natural process of questions begetting answers begetting questions is intrinsic to scientific inquiries and is a source of endless fun in conducting research.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Center of Peking University, and the experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Peking University. Mice were weaned at the age of 21 days. Mice were maintained under standard conditions (12[h light, 12 [dark schedule). Room temperature was 23[[C. Humidity was 40–60%. Mice for behavior assays were 10-16 weeks old.</p>
<p>All transgenic mouse lines were generated in C57BL/6J background. Ai14 mice were a gift from Dr. Hongkui Zeng. Rosa26-LSL-Cas9 mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (028551). SLC6A17-2A-CreERT2 and SLC6A17-KO mice were generated by CasGene biotech (Beijing, China). SLC6A17-HA-2A-iCre and SLC6A17P633R mice were generated by Biocytogen (Beijing, China). Mutant strains were generated by CRISPR/Cas9. Approximately 1.5 kb homologous arms upstream and downstream of target site were cloned into the targeting vector. The cleavage efficiency of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting SLC6A17 were tested in HEK cells. The sgRNAs selected for final injection were: 5’- ccaacggacgctatggaagcggc-3’ for SLC6A17-2A-CreERT2 mice; 5’-catgcccaggtaacacctatggg-3’ and 5’-cctgttaacaacactatctgaca-3’ for SLC6A17-KO mice; 5’-actgaggggtgctggccaagagg-3’ for SLC6A17-HA-2A-iCre mice; and 5’-ctgctagaatccaggaggcagg-3’ for SLC6A17P633R mice. All mutant strain were confirmed by PCR sequencing of the targeting regions. Southern blots were performed by Biocytogen for SLC6A17-HA-2A-iCre and SLC6A17P633R mice to rule out random insertions. For CreERT2 induction, tamoxifen was administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.) 1mg/day/mice for 5 consecutive days at the age of 4-5 weeks. Two weeks after tamoxifen injection, mice were killed for histology examination.</p>

<title>Histology and Immunocytochemitry</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized, perfused, and post-fixed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Liu, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Qin and Luo, 2009</xref>). Briefly, mice were deeply anesthetized with Tribromoethanol (250 mg/kg; i.p.) and transcardially perfused with cold 0.1M PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M PBS. Brains were fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4 °C and then immersed in 30% sucrose until it sank to the bottom at 4 °C. It was embedded in the Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound and frozen in a freezing microtome chamber (Leica CM 3050; Leica). Sections were 40 μm thick and collected on adhesion glass slides (P/N.80312-3161, CITOTEST). Slc6a172A-CreERT2::Ai14 mice sections were washed with 0.3% Trtion X-100 in PBS (PBST) and then placed under cover-slips with a mounting solution (Fluoroshield with DAPI, F6057, sigma). Sections were imaged by confocal microscope (Zesis LSM710) or Slide scanner (Zeiss Axio Scan. Z1). For immunofluorescence, freshly prepared slides were washed with PBST, followed by 1 h 10% normal goat serum (in PBST) to block non-specific binding. Primary antibodies were diluted to working concentrations in PBST, and incubated with slides overnight at 4°C. Slides were washed with PBST and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1h at room temperature. After PBST washes, slides were placed under cover-slips with a mounting solution. For double staining in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7B</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7C</xref>, anti-HA antibody (RmAb, 1:200 dilution) was applied and labeled in Alexa Fluor 546, then Alexa Fluor 488 Anti-Syp (RmAb, ab196379, Abcam, 1:200 dilution) was applied.

<title>Behavioral Tests</title>
<p>Mice were placed in the experiment room for at least 1 h before behavioral tests. All experiments were performed with the genotypes blind to the researchers. 70% ethanol was used to clear odor cues after each test.</p>
<sec id="s4d1">
<title>Open field Tests</title>
<p>Experiments were conducted in a square Plexiglas apparatus (40× 40× 35 cm) with illumination kept at 100-200 lux. Mice were gently placed in the center of the apparatus and allowed to explore for 30 minutes (min). Activities were recorded by a digital camera (HDR-XR550, SONY) set directly above the apparatus. After each trial, the apparatus was cleaned and the animals put back to home cage. Videos were analyzed by a home-made program created for SLC6A17-KO mice and Open Filed (Mobile Datum, Shanghai, China) for SLC6A17P633R mice. The home-made program is based on OpenCV. Briefly, mice were extracted by subtracting background which was updated for each frame in order to prevent environmental light shift. The center of the mouse was calculated, from which the distance was determined.</p>

<title>Novel object recognition task</title>
<p>The experimental protocol was adopted from previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bevins and Besheer, 2006</xref>). On the first day, mice were individually habituated in an open box (40× 40× 25 cm). Next day, two identical objects (O) were placed into left and right corners of the box and mice were allowed to explore for 10 min. Object recognition was tested 1 hr later. One familiar object (O) was replaced by a novel object (N) before mice were placed back into the box. Mice were allowed to explore freely for 5 mins. The time spent in the exploring the object was measured. Discrimination ratio was calculated by novel object interaction time/total interaction time with both objects. Testing sessions were recorded by a digital camera (HDR-XR550, SONY) and analyzed by software (Mobile Datum, Shanghai, China).</p>

<title>Morris water maze</title>
<p>The Morris water maze task was modified according to previously described procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Qin et al., 2017</xref>). The maze contained a round pool (diameter: 120 cm) and a round platform (diameter: 10 cm, 2 cm below the water surface). Water was 50 cm deep and set at 20 ± 1 °C. Visual cues were placed above the pool. Titanium white was added into water to make it opaque for mice. We trained mice for four 1 min-trials per day. If a mouse successfully found the platform, it was taken back to home cage 15 s after locating the platform. If a mouse failed to find the platform during 1 min, it was gently placed on platform for 15s then taken back to the home cage. On days 1 and 2, cued learning was conducted to find the platform marked with a visible object. Mice were trained from different start points at each trial. On days 3 to 7, the object was removed while mice were trained with different start points to locate the hidden platform whose location was different with cue learning session. The latency for each animal to find the platform was recorded. On day 8, spatial memory was tested with a 1-min probe trial in which the platform was removed. Crossings into the platform area and total time spent in the target platform quadrant were recorded. The trajectories of probe trial were analyzed by Noldus Video Tracking Software (Ethovision XT 15, Noldus, Netherlands).</p>

<title>Fear conditioning</title>
<p>A three-day delay fear-conditioning protocol was employed to test fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Qin et al., 2017</xref>). A conditioning chamber (25 cm × 25 cm × 40 cm) with 2 types of contexts (context a: black walls, metal net floor for electrical stimulation; context b: white walls and white plastic floor) was used. On day 1, mice were trained in context a. Two rounds of training were performed. Each round consisted of a 1 min adaptation of environment, followed by a cued tone (30 s, 300 Hz, 90 dB sound) and a foot shock (2 s, 0.75 mA constant current). On day 2, contextual fear memory was assayed by placing the mice back in context a for 300 s. On day 3, mice were placed in context a. After 180 s, a training tone was sounded for 180 s. 5% acetic acid were used to clean chambers between day 3 and day 2. Two kinds of apparatus were used. SLC6A17-KO mice were tested in Fear Conditioning (Mobile Datum, Shanghai, China) and SLC6A17P633R mice were tested in Startle and Fear Combined System (Panlab, Spain). Animal activities were recorded and the percentage of time spent freezing (defined as the absence of all movement except for respiration) was measured by the software accordingly. Fear Conditioning (Mobile Datum) is a video-based recording system, so freezing time was re-analyzed by a double blinded researcher to revise software variations. Startle and Fear Combined System (Panlab) is a gravity-based recording system.</p>

<title>Subcellular Fractionation</title>
<p>Experimental protocols were based on previously described methods for SV purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Evans, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Huttner et al., 1983</xref>). Homogenate buffer [0.32 M sucrose and 5 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete EDTA-free, Roche)] was pre-cooled on ice, and all operations were conducted on ice. Whole mouse brains were homogenized (kept as fraction H) in the homogenate buffer in a Potter Elvehjem homogenizer (Wheaton Instruments, US, 9 strokes at 900 rpm) and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was kept as Fraction S1 and pellet containing large membranes was resuspended (kept as Fraction P1). Fraction S1 was then centrifuged at 13,000 g for 20 min to yield a crude synaptosomal pellet (kept as Fraction P2), and remaining supernatant collected as Fraction S2. Synaptosomes in Fraction P2 were osmotic-lysed by adding 9 volumes of ice-cold ddH<sub>2</sub>O (protease inhibitor cocktail added), followed by quick homogenization (3 strokes, 2000 rpm) and 1/20 volume 1M HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) was added. The osmotic-lysed samples were incubated on ice for 40 min to maximize yields. Lysates were then centrifuged at 25,000 g for 20 min. Supernatant was collected as Fraction LS1 and pellet containing synaptic plasma membranes was resuspended (kept as Fraction LP1). Fraction LP2 was obtained after centrifugation of fraction LS1 for 2 h at 165,000 g in a SW40 Ti rotor (Beckman, US). Corresponding supernatant was collected as Fraction LS2. Further purification of the SVs in Fraction LP2 was performed by centrifugation on a continuous sucrose gradient. Fraction LP2 was resuspended in gradient buffer (40 mM sucrose, 5 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4) and 200 μl (1 mg/ml) resuspended fraction LP2 was layered onto a 11 ml 50-800 mM continuous sucrose gradient. The gradient was centrifuged at 65,000 g for 5 h in SW40 Ti rotor and then divided to 11 equal fractions from the top to the bottom. 4 volumes of pre-cooled methanol (-20°C) was added into sub-fractions to precipitate proteins. Proteins were collected by centrifugation in 20,000 g for 20 min. All centrifugations were conducted at 4°C.</p>

<title>Immunoisolation of SVs</title>
<p>Experimental protocols were adopted from previous established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Burger, et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Burger et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Martineau et al., 2013</xref>). The entire experiments were conducted at 2-8 °C. Whole brains were homogenized immediately after decapitation by ice-cold immunoisolation buffer (4 mM HEPES-KOH, 100 mM K2-tartrate, 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitor cocktail) in Potter Elvehjem homogenizer (15 strokes, 2000 rpm). Homogenates were centrifuged 35,000 g for 25 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (protein concentration 3 mg/ml) was used as input to incubated with magnetic beads coupled with antibody. For anti-Syp immunoisolation, anti-Syp (101 011, SySy) antibody was pre-incubated with Pierce protein G magnetic beads (88848, Thermo Scientific) in 0.1% BSA PBS at 4 °C overnight. The anti-Syp antibody and mice IgG (02-6502, Invitrogen) were bound to Pierce protein G magnetic beads at the ratio of 33 μg of IgG per mg beads. For anti-HA immunoisolation, Pierce anti-HA magnetic beads (88837, Thermo Scientific) were used and washed just before each experiment. Beads were incubated with input supernatant for 2 h with constant rotation at 4°C. Beads were washed 6 times by immunoisolation buffer after incubation. Following the final wash, beads were magnetically separated and vesicular contents were extracted by 50 μl 80%/20% methanol/H<sub>2</sub>O (-80 °C) with 5 μM internal standards. To maximize the extraction efficiency and protein precipitation rate, the extraction mix was transferred to -20 °C for 1 h. The extraction mix was then centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 g, and supernatant was transferred to new vials subjected to LC-MS. The remaining beads were extracted by SDS loading buffer for immunoblot analysis.</p>

<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Proteins were extracted from each sample with SDS loading buffer (3% SDS, 15% glycerol, 180 mM Tris-HCl, 4% β-mercaptoethanol). For subcellular fractionation samples, protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce, 23250, Thermo Scientific), and equal quantities of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. For immunoisolation samples, equal volumes of SDS loading buffer were added to magnetic isolated beads. Samples were incubated in 75 °C for 20 min to better immunoblot transmembrane proteins. Briefly, samples were loaded to 10% SDS-PAGE gels (TGX FastCast Acrylamide Kits, 1610183, Bio-Rad) and transferred to 0.45mm NC membranes (HATF00010, Millipore) for 2 h. Membranes were subjected to 5% milk in TBST buffer (Tri-buffered Saline with Tween 20) at room temperature for 1h to block non-specific binding. Primary antibodies were prepared in TBST and incubated with membranes at 4 °C overnight. Secondary antibodies were either anti-rabbit IgG HRP (A6154, Sigma, 1:5000 dilution) or anti-mouse IgG HRP (715-035-150, Jackson Immuno Research, 1:5000 dilution).

<title>AAV Plasmid Construction and Virus Injection</title>
<p>AAV-PHP.eb viruses were packaged in HEK293T cells by the vector center of CIBR. The titres of AAVs were determined by real-time PCR. Viruses were subpackaged and stored in -80 °C before use. All AAV constructs used for viral packaging were linearized by restriction enzymes to insert target sequences. Bacterial cultures were grown at 33 °C. AAV-PHP.eb viruses were packaged by Vector Center in CIBR. Viruses were delivered retro-orbitally into the venous sinus of 6-week-old mice.

Briefly, the AAV injected animals were anesthetized and perfused with PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 1% glutaraldehyde (GA) for pre-fixation. Mouse brains were dissected and cut into approximately 1 mm3 blocks and was added into 2.5% GA for post-fixation for 2 h. Samples were then washed with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB). Following pre-incubation in 0.5 mg/ml 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB, D5905, Sigma) for 30 mins, 0.03% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (final concentration) was added into samples for APEX2 oxidation (Note that different sources of DAB had considerable disparity, and D5905 produced the best signal than other DABs in our lab), although the recommended D8001 was poorer than D5905) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ludwig, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Martell et al., 2017</xref>). The reaction was monitored by the dark brown color in tissue block and was stopped by removing the DAB solution and washed three times with 0.1 M PB. Most of the successful DAB staining usually turned deep color within 10 mins. After DAB staining, samples were incubated in 4% osmium tetroxide in 0.1M PB on ice for 1 h in dark environment. Samples were washed with ddH<sub>2</sub>O and incubated in 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate overnight at 4°C. Next day, samples were dehydrated in graded ethanol series (30%, 50%, 75%, 85%, 95% and 100%) at 4°C and rinsed once in acetone with each rinse for 10 mins at room temperature. Samples were infiltrated in Epon 812 resin using a 1:3, 1:1 and 3:1 ratio of resin and acetone for 2 h each followed by 3 infiltrations with 100% resin for 30 mins each. Finally, samples were embedded in fresh resin in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 65°C. Blocks were sectioned by UC7 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria) into 70 nm. A 120 kV JEOL JEM-1400Flash TEM (JEOL, Japan) was used to image the brain and images were acquired by an XAROSA camera (Emsis GmbH, Muenster, Germany). Images were saved in a .tif format and were further analyzed using FIJI-ImageJ 2.1.0/1.53c (Wayne Rasband, NIH). The segmentation of SVs was performed using the TrakEM2 v1.0a (Univ/ETH Zurich) plugin in FIJI and the mean intensity of DAB + or - SV was quantified using a custom-made macro.

A Vanquish UHPLC system coupled to a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (both instrument Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) were used for LC-MS analysis along with SeQuant ZIC-HILIC column (150 mm×2.1 mm, 3.5 μm, Merck Millipore, 150442) in the positive mode and SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC column (150 mm×2.1 mm, 5 μm, Merck Millipore, 150460) in the negative mode. For ZIC-HILIC column, the mobile phase A was 0.1% formic acid in water and the mobile phase B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The linear gradient was as following: 0 min, 80% B; 6 min, 50% B; 13 min, 50% B; 14 min, 20% B; 18 min, 20% B; 18.5 min, 80% B; 30 min, 80% B. The flow rate used was 300 μl/min and the column temperature was maintained at 30 °C. For ZIC-pHILIC column, the mobile phase A is 20 mM ammonium carbonate in water, adjusted to pH 9.0 with 0.1% ammonium hydroxide solution (25%) and the mobile phase B is 100% acetonitrile. The linear gradient was as following: 0 min, 80% B; 2 min, 80% B; 19 min, 20% B; 20 min, 80% B; 30 min, 80% B. The flow rate used is 150 μl/min and the column temperature is 25 °C. Samples were maintained at 4 °C in Vanquish autosampler. 3 µL of extracted metabolites were injected for each run. IP samples were subjected to ZIC-HILIC column in positive mode for major metabolites detection, and then subject to ZIC-pHILIC column in negative mode for orthogonal detection.</p>
<p>Calibration was performed prior to analysis using the Pierce<sup>TM</sup> Positive and Negative Ion Calibration Solutions (Thermo Fisher Scientific) every 7 days. Acetonitrile was LC-MS grade (A955, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and all other regents were LC-MS Optima grade from sigma. Isotope-labeled amino acids (sigma) as internal extraction standards were supplemented into extraction solution. Orbitrap mass spectrometer was operated with the following parameters: scanning in Full MS mode (2 μ cans) from 70 to 1050 m/z at 70,000 resolution, with 4 kV spray voltage (3.5 kV for negative mode), 50 shealth gas (35 for negative mode), 12 auxiliary gas (8 for negative mode), capillary temperature 300C, S-lens RF level 55, AGC target 1E6, and maximum injection time 200 ms.</p>

<title>TMT-labeled SV Proteomics</title>
<p>Procedures for quantitative SV proteomics were modified from previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Boyken, et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gronborg et al., 2010</xref>). Proteins were labeled using TMT10plex Isobaric Label Reagent Set (90113, Thermo Scientific). In short, LP2 fractions were purified form both SLC6A17-KO +/+ and +/- mice, with the final step centrifuged in 230,000 g instead of 165, 000 g. Purified LP2 were stored in -80°C for long-term storage. SVs were further purified by immunoisolation with the anti-Syp antibody coupled to magnetic protein G beads incubated with resuspended LP2 fraction for 2h at 4 °C (LP2 should be repeatedly passed through 28 gauge needles to be fully resuspended). After 6 washes in PBS, SVs were magnetically separated and dissociated form beads by adding lysis buffer [10% SDS in 100 mM TEAB (triethyl ammonium bicarbonate)] to samples. Beads were heated in 70°C for 10 min to fully dissolve proteins and then centrifuged 10 min at 16,000 g to remove beads. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA kits (23227, Thermo Scientific) to ensure the total proteins between 50-100 µg. Equal amounts of proteins were transferred into new tubes and adjusted to 100µL with 100mM TEAB. 5µL 200 mM TCEP (3,3’,3’’-phosphinetriyltripropanoic acid) was added and incubated in 55°C for 1 h. Then 5 µL freshly prepare 375 mM iodoacetamide were added to the samples and incubated for 30 minutes in dark environment at room temperature. Following addition of six volumes (∼600µL) of pre-chilled (-20°C) acetone, proteins were precipitated overnight at -20°C. Next day, samples were centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C to precipitate proteins. After acetone removal, 100 µL of 100 mM TEAB were added to resuspend proteins. Trypsin was added at 2.5 µg per sample and incubated at 37°C. Then freshly made TMT Label Reagents (0.8 mg/41µL anhydrous acetonitrile) were added to samples and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. 8 µL 5% hydroxylamine were added to the samples and incubated for 15 minutes to quench the reaction. Equal amounts of each sample were combined in a new centrifuge tube and labeled peptides dried in SpeedVac. Pierce™ High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (84868, Thermo Scientific) were used to clean up and fractionate TMT-labeled peptides before LC-MS/MS. Peptides were identified and analyzed by the Proteomic Center of PKU.</p>

<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>For statistical comparisons of two groups, we used the Nonparametric Mann-Whitney test to compare two columns of data. For comparisons of more than two groups, we used the One-way ANOVA Brown-Forsythe ANOVA test, and Dunnett’s T3 multiple comparisons test. We used Two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test for multiple factor comparation. An α level of 0.05 (two-tailed) was set for significance. All statistical analysis was done using Prism 8 (GraphPad Software).</p>

<p>This study makes a <bold>valuable</bold> contribution to our functional understanding of the atypical amino-acid transporter SLC6A177 at nerve cell synapses and the role of SLC6A17 variants in certain forms of intellectual disability. The reported evidence that disease-linked SLC6A17 variants cause behavioral abnormalities is <bold>convincing</bold>. However, corresponding molecular underpinnings, i.e. the molecular role of SLC6A17 in synapses and the functional molecular consequences of disease-related SLC6A17 variations, remain unclear because corresponding informative experimental approaches are missing - most importantly direct measurements of the transport activity of SLC6A17 in the various genetic contexts studied. This limits the robustness and validity of key mechanistic conclusions drawn from the present work.</p>

<p>The molecular composition of synaptic vesicles (SVs) has been defined in substantial detail, but the function of many SV-resident proteins are still unknown. The present study focused on one such protein, the 'orphan' SV-resident transporter SLC6A17. By utilizing sophisticated and extensive mouse genetics and behavioral experiments, the authors provide convincing support for the notion that certain SLC6A17 variants cause intellectual disability (ID) in humans carrying such genetic variations. This is an important and novel finding. Furthermore, the authors propose, based on LC-MS analyses of isolated SVs, that SLC6A17 is responsible for glutamine (Gln) transport into SVs, leading to the provocative idea that Gln functions as a neurotransmitter and that deficits in Gln transport into SVs by SLC6A17 represents a key pathogenetic mechanism in human ID patients carrying variants of the SLC6A17 gene.</p>
<p>This latter aspect of the present paper is not adequately supported by the experimental evidence so that the main conceptual claims of the study appear insufficiently justified at this juncture. Key weaknesses are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Detection of Gln, along with classical neurotransmitters such as glutamate, GABA, or ACh, in isolated SV fractions does not prove that Gln is transported into SVs by active transport. Gln is quite abundant in extracellular compartments.

<p><bold>Joint Public Review</bold></p>
<p>The molecular composition of synaptic vesicles (SVs) has been defined in substantial detail, but the function of many SV-resident proteins are still unknown. The present study focused on one such protein, the 'orphan' SV-resident transporter SLC6A17. By utilizing sophisticated and extensive mouse genetics and behavioral experiments, the authors provide convincing support for the notion that certain SLC6A17 variants cause intellectual disability (ID) in humans carrying such genetic variations. This is an important and novel finding. Furthermore, the authors propose, based on LCMS analyses of isolated SVs, that SLC6A17 is responsible for glutamine (Gln) transport into SVs, leading to the provocative idea that Gln functions as a neurotransmitter and that deficits in Gln transport into SVs by SLC6A17 represents a key pathogenetic mechanism in human ID patients carrying variants of the SLC6A17 gene.</p>
<p>This latter aspect of the present paper is not adequately supported by the experimental evidence so that the main conceptual claims of the study appear insufficiently justified at this juncture. Key weaknesses are as follows:</p>
<p>A) Detection of Gln, along with classical neurotransmitters such as glutamate, GABA, or ACh, in isolated SV fractions does not prove that Gln is transported into SVs by active transport. Gln is quite abundant in extracellular compartments. Its appearance in SV samples can therefore also be explained by trapping in SVs during endocytosis, presence in other - contaminating - organelles, binding to membrane surfaces, and other processes. Direct assays of Gln uptake into SVs, which have the potential to stringently test key postulates of the authors, are lacking.</p>

<p>We have conducted multiple control experiments  to exclude the possibility of contamination.</p>
<p>1). Western blot analysis of SLC6A17-HA immunoisolation (Figure 4D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1)  has shown that this faction contained little other organelles and membranes. These results are strong argument that contaminations in our isolated fraction were in very low level.</p>
<p>2). We then examined the proportion of SLC6A17 localized SVs through quantifying the co-localization of Syp and SLC6A17 by anti-Syp immunoisolation in Slc6a17-2A-HA-iCre mice. We found that SLC6A17 is predominately localized on SVs (with 98.7% compared with classical SV marker, Author response image 1A). This further showed that immunoisolated SLC6A17 fraction was mainly composed of SVs.</p>
<p>3). We also analyzed other SV marker proteins such as Syt1 and Syb2 for IP-LC-MS, all results supported
Gln enrichment (Author response image 1B).</p>
<p>4). Importantly, immunoisolation of the SLC6A17P633R-HA protein, which caused SLC6A17 mislocalization away from the SVs (Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D), showed no Gln enrichment (Author response image 1C).</p>
<p>5). Moreover, immunoisolation of AAV-PHP.eb overexpressed cytoplasmic membrane Gln transporter SLC38A1-HA did not show Gln enrichment (Author response image 1D).</p>
<p>6). We also tested whether trafficking organelles such as the lysosome could enrich Gln. As is shown in Author response image 1E, immunoisolation of AAV-PHP.eb overexpressed TMEM192-HA did not show Gln enrichment.
For active transport, we tested the effects of proton dissipator FCCP, v-ATPase inhibitor NEM and ΔpH  dissipator nigercin. As is shown in Author response image 1F, 1G, Gln level was reduced by these inhibitors, supporting active transport of Gln.</p>

<p>The verification of transgenic mouse line is described in the Material and Methods section of our manuscript. There are numerous literatures published for CRISPR mediated gene editing in animals and the off-target effect of CRISPR-Cas9 system is widely studied with optimized design tools developed by many groups (Platt et al., 2014; Chu et al., 2015, 2016; Liu et al., 2017; Gemberling et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2022). The gRNAs used for animal generation were chosen carefully based on publically available tools. Apart from basic genomic PCR sequencing of target regions of all gene edited mouse models, Southern blots were performed by Biocytogen company for Slc6a17-HA-2A-iCre and Slc6a17P633R mice to rule out random insertions. Expression levels in Slc6a17-KO and Slc6a17P633R mice were not affected, as shown in Figure R2. HA-tagged protein in Slc6a17-HA-2A-iCre and Slc6a17P633R mice were detected by immunoisolation, immunofluorescence, and fractionation (Figure 3, 4, Figure 3—figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Both showed localizations expected from previous reports ().</p>

<p>The biophysics of SLC6A17 was carefully studied (Para et al 2008; Zaia and Reimer, 2009). Our work focused on in vivo biochemical results, not biophysics.</p>
