<title>Abstract</title><p>NLRP3 is an inflammasome seeding pattern recognition receptor activated in response to multiple danger signals which perturb intracellular homeostasis. Electrostatic interactions between the NLRP3 polybasic (PB) region and negatively charged lipids on the trans-Golgi network (TGN) have been proposed to recruit NLRP3 to the TGN. In this study, we demonstrate that membrane association of NLRP3 is critically dependant on S-acylation of a highly conserved cysteine residue (Cys-130), which traps NLRP3 in a dynamic S-acylation cycle at the Golgi, and a series of hydrophobic residues preceding Cys-130 which act in conjunction with the PB region to facilitate Cys-130 dependent Golgi enrichment. Due to segregation from Golgi localised thioesterase enzymes caused by a nigericin induced breakdown in Golgi organisation and function, NLRP3 becomes immobilised on the Golgi through reduced de-acylation of its Cys-130 lipid anchor, suggesting that disruptions in Golgi homeostasis are conveyed to NLRP3 through its acylation state. Thus, our work defines a nigericin sensitive S-acylation cycle that gates access of NLRP3 to the Golgi.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Inflammasomes are multimolecular complexes that control the initiation of inflammatory responses to various damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chou et al., 2023</xref>). The core complex involved in the formation of an active inflammasome consists of a pattern recognition receptor (PRR), which sense various perturbations in intracellular homeostasis and are the trigger point for inflammasome activation, the adaptor protein ASC, which acts to amplify recognition of DAMPs and PAMPs by PRRs and ensure a robust and rapid response, and a final effector protein – Caspase-1, which, amongst other substrates, cleaves the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β) and the pore forming protein Gasdermin-D into their bioactive forms. Due to its involvement in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Duewell et al., 2010</xref>) and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Heneka et al., 2013</xref>), one of the most well studied inflammasome seeding PRRs is NLRP3 (<bold><underline>N</underline></bold>ACHT, <bold><underline>L</underline></bold>R<bold><underline>R</underline></bold> and <bold><underline>P</underline></bold>YD domain containing protein <bold><underline>3</underline></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akbal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fu and Wu, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Liang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Seoane et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Swanson et al., 2019</xref>). Stimuli that trigger canonical NLRP3 activation are diverse, ranging from bacterial ionophores such as nigericin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Perregaux et al., 1992</xref>) to agents which damage lysosomal integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Duewell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hornung et al., 2008</xref>). The majority of these stimuli are unified by their ability to deplete intracellular potassium, which has been proposed to be a common danger signal sensed by NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Munoz-Planillo et al., 2013</xref>). Recent studies have revealed that NLRP3 is a peripheral membrane protein, recruited to the Golgi apparatus and endosomes through interactions between a highly conserved polybasic (PB) region within NLRP3 itself, and negatively charged phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) found in the cytoplasmic leaflet of intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen and Chen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schmacke et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Membrane binding is important for formation of an inactive NLRP3 oligomer and an optimal response to NLRP3 stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andreeva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen and Chen, 2018</xref>), although how membrane binding and sensing of NLRP3 stimuli are linked is at present unclear.</p>
<p>The presence of a PB motif alone is often insufficient to allow stable membrane association. As one example directly relevant to NLRP3, basic residues within the hyper-variable region (HVR) at the C terminus of K-Ras4B, a membrane bound GTPase that mediates key signalling events from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>), are paired with a proximal lipid anchor to confer specific localisation to the plasma membrane, with neither module alone sufficient for plasma membrane binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Choy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hancock et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hancock et al., 1990</xref>). A working model for the steady state localisation of K-Ras4B at the plasma membrane posits that the farnesyl group provides an initial non-specific weak affinity for all intracellular cellular membranes. The PB region acts in concert with the farnesyl lipid anchor to allow K-Ras4B to preferentially partition to the plasma membrane through complementary charge-based interactions between the PB region and the high net negative charge of the plasma membrane imparted by the relative abundance of several species of negatively charged lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Schmick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yeung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The ‘two signal’ model of stable association of peripheral membrane proteins lacking folded lipid binding domains with intracellular membranes also applies to additional members of the Ras family and many other peripheral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hancock et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Heo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Laude and Prior, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Linder et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Michaelson et al., 2001</xref>). In the absence of a PB region, a second membrane binding module can be provided by an additional lipid anchor, such as the covalent attachment of an acyl group to free cysteine residues. For the farnesylated forms of H-Ras and N-Ras, Golgi localised palmitoyl-acyltransferases (PATs) catalyse the addition of an acyl group to cysteine residues adjacent to the farnesylation motif at the C terminus of H-Ras and N-Ras, trapping these proteins at the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hancock et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rocks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rocks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Swarthout et al., 2005</xref>). The opposing action of thioesterase enzymes, such as those of the APT and ABHD families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Anwar and van der Goot, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Won et al., 2018</xref>), to remove covalently attached acyl groups helps to prevent the equilibration of S-acylated peripheral membrane proteins across all intracellular membranes through vesicular transport, concentrating H-Ras and N-Ras at the Golgi and downstream compartments such as the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dekker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Goodwin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rocks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rocks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Salaun et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>At present it is unclear how NLRP3 preferentially associates with the Golgi given that only a PB region in NLRP3 has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen and Chen, 2018</xref>). In this study, we went in search of additional signals in NLRP3 that may mediate recruitment of NLRP3 to intracellular membranes alongside the PB region. We find that the Golgi association of NLRP3 is dependent on S-acylation of NLRP3 at a highly conserved cysteine residue (Cys-130) adjacent to the PB region with NLRP3 dynamically associating with the Golgi through reversible S-acylation at Cys-130. We also identify a string of hydrophobic residues upstream of Cys-130 that are also important for recruitment of NLRP3 to the Golgi. Enhanced Golgi recruitment of NLRP3 in response to nigericin is likely caused by alterations in the NLRP3 S-acylation cycle, which leads to a fraction of NLRP3 becoming immobilised on the Golgi. We present data consistent with this immobilisation being attributable to nigericin induced alterations in Golgi organisation and function, which potentially limits the ability of Golgi resident thioesterase enzymes to encounter NLRP3 and de-acylate it. Overall, our results provide an enhanced understanding of the features within NLRP3 required for membrane binding and suggest that disruptions in Golgi homeostasis are coupled to alterations in the NLRP3 S-acylation cycle.</p>

<title>The NLRP3 polybasic region is insufficient to localise NLRP3 to the Golgi</title>
<p>Previous work on NLRP3 has demonstrated that association with TGN46 positive structures is dependent on the NLRP3 polybasic region between residues 131-145. To determine if the NLRP3 polybasic region alone was sufficient to mediate Golgi localisation, we fused the NLRP3 polybasic sequence to GFP (GFP-NLRP3<sup>131-158</sup>) and expressed this construct in HeLaM cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Expression of GFP-NLRP3<sup>131-158</sup> was insufficient to achieve a Golgi localisation however and predominantly localised to the nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B - top row, 3<sup>rd</sup> panel</xref>). As polybasic regions are often paired with a ‘second signal’ to confer a specific localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Heo et al., 2006</xref>), we next tested whether the addition of a second membrane binding signal was sufficient to allow association of GFP-NLRP3<sup>131-158</sup> with intracellular membranes. For this purpose, we appended a C terminal farnesylation motif (CVIM) to GFP-NLRP3<sup>131-158</sup> (GFP-NLRP3<sup>131-158-CVIM</sup>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Similar to the charge biosensor probe +8-Pre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eisenberg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Roy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yeung et al., 2008</xref>), which is farnesylated and contains a PB region with a similar net positive charge to the NLRP3 PB region, expression of GFP-NLRP3<sup>131-158-CVIM</sup> resulted in strong recruitment of GFP to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B - middle row, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> panels</xref>, quantified in 1C). Thus, whilst the PB region alone is insufficient to drive association with intracellular membranes, residues 131-158 within NLRP3 can act in conjunction with a second membrane binding signal to confer binding to specific intracellular membranes.</p>

<title>Identification of additional features necessary for NLRP3 Golgi localisation</title>
<p>Dual membrane binding signals in peripheral membrane proteins are often located near one another in a proteins primary sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hancock et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hancock et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Heo et al., 2006</xref>). As the PB region alone was insufficient for membrane recruitment, we therefore examined the NLRP3 sequence around the PB region for additional features that may contribute to recruitment of NLRP3 to the Golgi. Two features preceding the NLRP3 polybasic region stand out; a highly conserved cysteine residue at position 130 (Cys-130), which we hypothesised may be S-acylated, and a series of hydrophobic residues upstream of Cys-130 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). We speculated that these hydrophobic residues may fulfil an analogous role to the farnesyl anchor in N-Ras and H-Ras, providing a weak non-specific membrane affinity. In a recently published Cryo-EM structure of the inactive NLRP3 complex bound to CRID3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hochheiser et al., 2022</xref>), the hydrophobic residues form part an alpha helix (residues 115-125, helix<sup>115-125</sup>), with several hydrophobic residues (I113, W117, L120, L121, L24) aligned along a single face (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure 1A-C</xref>). Cys-130 resides between helix<sup>115-125</sup> and the polybasic region. Helix<sup>115-125</sup> and Cys-130 sit at the centre of one NLRP3 pentamer and are largely surface exposed, as they face away from the core of the decameric complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting these additional features may work together with the polybasic region to allow localisation to the Golgi.</p>
<p>To first determine if NLRP3 Golgi association was dependent on S-acylation, we treated cells with 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), a palmitic acid analogue which is thought to block global protein S-acylation through covalent binding to the active site of ZDHHC enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Davda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jennings et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Webb et al., 2000</xref>). Golgi enrichment of NLRP3 in HeLaM cells transiently transfected with GFP-tagged NLRP3 was inhibited by treatment of cells with 2-BP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F, G</xref>), suggesting that S-acylation regulates recruitment of NLRP3 to the Golgi. 2-BP induced loss of NLRP3 from the Golgi was not due to alterations in Golgi PI4P levels, which remained similar in both untreated and 2-BP treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>), or due to an overall loss of Golgi integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2B-E</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have demonstrated that NLRP3 stimuli cause an increase in the recruitment of NLRP3 to intracellular membranes, which have been proposed to represent either the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen and Chen, 2018</xref>) or endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Consistent with these studies, we observed a similar increase in NLRP3 signal within the perinuclear area following nigericin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Figure 3A, B, C</xref>). The membranes NLRP3 resides on post-stimulation are likely derived from the Golgi as both GFP-NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Figure 4A-C</xref>) and an untagged-NLRP3 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Figure 4D</xref>) were sensitive to BrefeldinA (BFA), a Golgi disassembling fungal metabolite that has previously been shown to inhibit NLRP3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Phulphagar et al., 2021</xref>). BFA treatment abolished Golgi enrichment of NLRP3 at steady state and prevented accumulation of NLRP3 in the perinuclear region following nigericin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Figure 4A-D</xref>). To test whether enhanced recruitment of NLRP3 to the Golgi in response to nigericin was dependent on S-acylation, we pre-treated cells with 2-BP overnight prior to a 1-hour stimulation with nigericin. 2-BP treatment prevented the perinuclear clustering of NLRP3 signal observed following nigericin stimulation and instead induced the formation of peripherally localised aggregates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F, G</xref>), indicating that enhanced recruitment of NLRP3 to the Golgi in response to NLRP3 stimuli is S-acylation dependent. The puncta seen following nigericin stimulation of 2BP treated cells showed minimal overlap with the early endosomal marker EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2E-F</xref>) or PI4P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that these structures do not represent recruitment of NLRP3 to early endosomes. In agreement with Cys-130 being a critical determinant of NLRP3 Golgi localisation, mutation of this residue phenocopied the effect of 2-BP, preventing Golgi enrichment of GFP-NLRP3 at steady state and in response to nigericin treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H, I</xref>). The sensitivity of NLRP3 membrane binding to 2-BP and mutation of Cys-130 could also be seen with untagged NLRP3, although untagged NLRP3<sup>C130S</sup> did not form peripheral puncta in response to nigericin, suggesting these may be an artifact of GFP tagging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether the hydrophobic residues within helix<sup>115-125</sup> are also important for membrane binding we mutated residues isoleucine-113, tryptophan-117, leucine-120 and leucine-124 (hydrophobic face mutant; NLRP3<sup>HF</sup>), which are predicted to form a hydrophobic face as part of helix<sup>115-125</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supplementary Figure 6A, B</xref>). These mutations abolished recruitment of NLRP3 to the Golgi at steady state and in response to nigericin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supplementary Figure 6C, D</xref>), indicating that these residues also play an important role in recruitment of NLRP3 to intracellular membranes alongside Cys-130 and the polybasic region.</p>

<title>Definition of a minimal NLRP3 membrane binding region</title>
<p>To determine if Cys-130 and helix<sup>115-125</sup> were sufficient in isolation to drive Golgi localisation, we again expressed minimal NLRP3 peptides containing these residues in cells. GFP alone localised to both the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, top row, 1<sup>st</sup> panel</xref>). In contrast, expression of residues 95-130 (NLRP3<sup>95-130</sup>), containing both helix<sup>115-125</sup> and Cys-130, localised predominantly to the cytoplasm with some Golgi enrichment visible, however this was not at levels similar to full length NLRP3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B – bottom row, 1<sup>st</sup> panel</xref>). Surprisingly, inclusion of the polybasic region (NLRP3<sup>95-158</sup>) also failed to recapitulate Golgi enrichment equivalent to the full-length protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B – bottom row, 2<sup>nd</sup> panel</xref>), suggesting that additional features within NLRP3 are necessary to achieve recruitment to the Golgi. Consistent with the need for an additional membrane affinity for maximal binding of NLRP3 to the Golgi, attachment of a C-terminal farnesylation sequence (CVIM) to NLRP3<sup>95-158</sup> (NLRP3<sup>95-158-CVIM</sup>) was sufficient to achieve levels of Cys-130 dependent Golgi enrichment comparable to full length NLRP3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, bottom row, 3<sup>rd</sup> panel</xref>, quantified in 1C) with this construct also showing a high degree of overlap with NLRP3 at the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supplementary Figure 7A-E</xref>). Thus, whilst helix<sup>115-125</sup>, Cys-130 and the polybasic region are all essential for Golgi localisation, additional properties in NLRP3 are required to allow full Golgi binding.</p>
<p>To attempt to define a minimal NLRP3 region that shows levels of Golgi enrichment equivalent to the full-length protein, we created NLRP3 mutants truncated from either the N or C terminus. Removal of the pyrin domain (PYD, residues 1-95) had no impact on Golgi localisation, however further truncation to residue 121 prevented association of NLRP3 with the Golgi in both untreated and nigericin treated cells, consistent with the requirement for an intact helix<sup>115-125</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Figure 8A-C, H</xref>). A C-terminal NLRP3 truncation lacking the LRR domain (NLRP3<sup>1-699</sup>) localised to the Golgi at reduced levels, with further truncation down to residue 680 largely abolishing NLRP3 Golgi enrichment under both control and nigericin treated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Figure 8D-F, H</xref>). Expression of a minimal NLRP3 construct spanning residues 95-699 (NLRP3<sup>95-699</sup>) behaved the same as NLRP3<sup>1-699</sup>, confirming that the LRR domain is important for optimal association of NLRP3 with the Golgi and that the PYD domain is dispensable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Figure 8G, H</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that the presence of the LRR domain boosts NLRP3 membrane affinity, potentially through its role in establishing the formation of a multimeric NLRP3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andreeva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hochheiser et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>ZDHHC3 and ZDHHC7 overexpression enhance the Golgi localisation of NLRP3</title>
<p>Protein S-acylation is mediated by a family of 23 palmitoyltransferases (PAT) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lemonidis et al., 2015</xref>). PATs are multi-pass transmembrane proteins defined by the presence of a characteristic zinc dependent DHHC domain (zDHHC) responsible for the covalent attachment of acyl chains of varying length to exposed cysteine residues on target substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fukata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Greaves et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jennings and Linder, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ohno et al., 2006</xref>). To probe whether the Golgi localisation of NLRP3 is sensitive to ZDHHC overexpression, indicative of NLRP3 membrane binding being controlled by S-acylation, we co-expressed a library of HA-tagged ZDHHC enzymes alongside GFP-NLRP3. Overexpression of the related enzymes ZDHHC3 and ZDHHC7 both markedly enhanced recruitment of NLRP3 to the Golgi at the expense of cytosolic NLRP3 signal, with ZDHHC3 having a slightly stronger effect than ZDHHC7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>). To a much weaker extent, ZDHHC2, ZDHHC8 and ZDHHC9 also enhanced NLRP3 Golgi recruitment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Unexpectedly, overexpression of the plasma membrane localised PAT ZDHHC5 decreased the amount of NLRP3 at the Golgi and instead caused NLRP3 to re-localise to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>).</p>

<p>In a secondary screen using lower amounts of each ZDHHC enzyme, ZDHHC3, ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC7 all altered NLRP3 localisation to a similar degree seen when using higher amounts of DNA, however ZDHHC2, ZDHHC8 and ZDHHC9 had minimal impact on Golgi recruitment when expressed at lower levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Consistent with the results seen for GFP-tagged NLRP3, ZDHHC3 and ZDHHC5 also altered the localisation of untagged NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>). The effect of ZDHHC overexpression on NLRP3 localisation was dependent on the catalytic activity of the enzyme as catalytically inactive ZDHHC3<sup>C157S</sup> had no effect on recruitment on NLRP3 to the Golgi (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E, F</xref>). Thus, the localisation of NLRP3 can be altered by manipulating the levels and activity of ZDHHC enzymes, consistent with S-acylation controlling the sub-cellular localisation of NLRP3. Cys-130 and hydrophobic residues within helix<sup>115-125</sup> were both essential for the enhanced effect of ZDHHC3 and ZDHHC7 on NLRP3 Golgi recruitment and the effect of ZDHHC5 on recruitment of NLRP3 to the plasma membrane as mutating either of these features prevented NLRP3 re-localisation in response to ZDHHC overexpression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Figure 5B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supplementary Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>To gain further insight into how helix<sup>115-125</sup> and Cys-130 act together with the PB region to drive interaction of NLRP3 with intracellular membranes, we co-expressed NLRP3 containing mutations in the polybasic region with ZDHHC3 or ZDHHC5. PB mutations prevented localisation of NLRP3 to the Golgi at steady state and in response to nigericin, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Supplementary Figure 9A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen and Chen, 2018</xref>). In agreement with the polybasic region driving affinity for highly charged membranes such as the plasma membrane and TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eisenberg et al., 2021</xref>), sensitivity to PM localised ZDHHC5 required an intact PB region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Supplementary Figure 9B</xref>), however cis-Golgi localised ZDHHC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ernst et al., 2018</xref>) was still able to recruit NLRP3 when the PB region was mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Supplementary Figure 9C, D</xref>). These results suggest that helix<sup>115-125</sup> and Cys-130 can drive low levels of interaction with intracellular membranes independent of the polybasic region, likely through the hydrophobic residues within helix<sup>115-125</sup>, but not at sufficient levels to show noticeable enrichment. The presence of the PB region alongside helix<sup>115-125</sup> boosts membrane affinity, preferentially favouring membranes with a high net negative charge, as illustrated by PB dependent plasma membrane trapping in the presence of overexpressed HA-ZDHHC5.</p>

<title>NLRP3 Localisation to the Golgi in macrophages is dependent on Cys-130 and helix<sup>115-125</sup></title>
<p>As NLRP3 is predominantly expressed in myeloid cell types such as macrophages and monocytes, we stably transduced THP-1 cells with GFP-NLRP3, GFP-NLRP3<sup>C130S</sup> or GFP-NLRP3<sup>HF</sup> and assessed Golgi localisation in PMA treated THP-1 cells to determine whether Cys-130 and helix<sup>115-125</sup> are also required for localisation to the Golgi in macrophages. As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andreeva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen and Chen, 2018</xref>), endogenous NLRP3 localised to the perinuclear region where it partially overlapped with the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi marker p230 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), with this perinuclear localisation matched by GFP-NLRP3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Consistent with the requirement for Cys-130 and the preceding hydrophobic residues for Golgi localisation in HeLaM cells, mutation of these residues removed the perinuclear pool of NLRP3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, C</xref>), with GFP-NLRP3 also sensitive to overexpression of HA-tagged ZDHHC3 in a manner that was again dependent on Cys-130 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). To test the effects of enhanced levels of ZDHHC3 activity on inflammasome activation, we measured levels of nigericin induced cell death by propidium iodide (PI) staining of cells stably expressing HA-tagged ZDHHC3, as this had the strongest effect on NLRP3 Golgi recruitment in both HeLaM cells and THP-1 cells. Wild type but not catalytically inactive HA-ZDHHC3<sup>C157S</sup> enhanced Golgi recruitment of endogenous NLRP3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) and markedly enhanced the percentage of cells positive for PI following nigericin treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F, G</xref>), demonstrating that higher levels of ZDHHC3 activity can induce a greater percentage of cells to undergo NLRP3 dependent cell death.</p>

<title>NLRP3 can be S-acylated at Cys-130</title>
<p>To determine if the cysteine at position 130 is S-acylated, we visualised NLRP3 S-acylation using an acyl-PEG exchange (APE) assay and 5kDa PEG maleimide, which adds an additional mass of 5kDa to every cysteine residue that is S-acylated. Recent work has shown that NLRP3 is S-acylated within its LRR domain at position 844 by the Golgi localised PAT ZDHHC12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wang et al., 2023</xref>) and at Cys-8 within the PYD domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lv et al., 2023</xref>). S-acylation at Cys-8 and Cys-844 are both dispensable for recruitment to the Golgi as deletion of the PYD or LRR domains had minimal effect on Golgi recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Consistent with the presence of multiple cysteines in NLRP3 being S-acylated, labelling of S-acylated cysteines in NLRP3 revealed two bands indicative of singly and doubly S-acylated NLRP3 species in both HeLaM and THP1 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, C</xref>). A large amount of NLRP3 remained resistant to hydroxylamine, suggesting a significant proportion of NLRP3 is not S-acylated at steady state. Surprisingly, mutation of Cys-130 led to only subtle changes in the S-acylation profile of NLRP3 with no loss of doubly S-acylated NLRP3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, C</xref>), suggesting this species may represent a mix of S-acylation events at dual cysteines (i.e. Cys8/Cys844, Cys8/Cys130, Cys130/Cys844). The absence of a third band (Cys8, Cys130, Cys844) also suggests that S-acylation events at Cys-8, Cys-130 and Cys-844 may be mutually exclusive. Enhanced NLRP3 Golgi binding driven by ZDHHC3 over-expression and nigericin treatment both correlated with an increased amount of a singly S-acylated wild type NLRP3 species which did not occur when Cys-130 was mutated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>).</p>

<p>As efforts to determine whether NLRP3 is S-acylated at Cys-130 were complicated by the presence of additional S-acylation sites in NLRP3, we next attempted to confirm S-acylation at Cys-130 using GFP-NLRP3<sup>95-158</sup>, which incorporates helix<sup>115-125</sup>, Cys-130 and the PB region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). GFP-NLRP3<sup>95-158</sup> displayed no mass shift following labelling of exposed S-acylated cysteines and did not localise to the Golgi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-G</xref>), indicating that in the context of the small peptide used for this experiment, Cys-130 is not significantly S-acylated at steady state. However, overexpression of HA-ZDHHC3 significantly increased enrichment of NLRP3<sup>95-158</sup> at the Golgi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E, F</xref>) and induced a mass shift of NLRP3<sup>95-158</sup> following 5kDa PEG maleimide labelling that was dependent on Cys-130 and the preceding hydrophobic residues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). These results provide evidence that the linker region preceding the PB region is capable of undergoing S-acylation at Cys-130. Similar to their full-length counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Supplementary Figure 9B, C</xref>), NLRP3<sup>95-158</sup> peptides containing mutations in the PB region remained as sensitive to HA-ZDHHC3 overexpression as WT NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Supplementary Figure 9E-H</xref>).</p>

<p>S-acylation of proteins can be reversed by the action of the APT and ABHD family of thioesterases which catalyse the removal of acyl groups from S-acylated cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lin and Conibear, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tomatis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Won et al., 2018</xref>). Small molecule inhibition of thioesterase activity by the Palmostatin family of compounds has been shown to abolish the TGN and PM localisation of H-Ras and N-Ras and leads to their redistribution across intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dekker et al., 2010</xref>) due the stability of membrane binding provided by an acyl lipid anchor and carry over of acylated Ras proteins to the PM by vesicular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Apolloni et al., 2000</xref>). Treatment of cells with PalmostatinB had a similar effect on NLRP3, with loss of NLRP3 signal at the Golgi (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) and re-localisation of NLRP3 to the plasma membrane, tubular recycling endosomes, and late endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Supplementary Figure 10A, B, C</xref>). Consistent with NLRP3 undergoing de-acylation, overexpression of the Golgi localised thioesterase APT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abrami et al., 2021</xref>), but not mitochondrially localised APT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kathayat et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Supplementary Figure 11A</xref>), significantly reduced localisation of NLRP3 to the Golgi in unstimulated cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Both PalmostatinB treatment and APT2 overexpression also limited the accumulation of NLRP3 on the Golgi in response to nigericin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, D</xref>), although likely for different reasons; NLRP3 remains membrane bound following PalmostatinB treatment but is physically segregated from the Golgi on post-Golgi compartments, whilst APT2 overexpression likely acts to block significant accumulation of NLRP3 on the Golgi through higher rates of NLRP3 de-acylation. The effect of APT2 overexpression appeared to be acute, suggestive of a direct action on NLRP3, as mitochondrial re-routing of APT2 from the Golgi prior to nigericin stimulation restored the enhanced recruitment of NLRP3 to the Golgi observed in response to nigericin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Supplementary Figure 11B-G</xref>). Thus, NLRP3 dynamically associates with intracellular membranes through an S-acylation cycle. Overexpressed APT2 had no impact on Golgi morphology, indicating that loss of NLRP3 from Golgi membranes was not due to an effect of excess APT2 on Golgi integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Supplementary Figure 11H-J</xref>).</p>

The basis for enhanced Golgi recruitment is unknown. To test whether the membrane binding cycle of NLRP3 is altered in response to nigericin, we monitored the dynamics of NLRP3 membrane association by performing fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments on GFP-NLRP3 in the presence or absence of nigericin. The kinetics of NLRP3 membrane binding in untreated cells were similar to those described for mono-S-acylated N-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rocks et al., 2005</xref>) with a half time to recovery of 58.4 seconds (± 9.3 seconds S.D.), in agreement with NLRP3 rapidly cycling on and off the Golgi in an S-acylation cycle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E, F</xref>). Nigericin treatment suppressed the fluorescence recovery; whilst GFP-NLRP3 signal on average recovered to 75% of the pre-bleach signal in untreated cells, this was reduced to 44% after nigericin treatment, indicating that a greater fraction of NLRP3 that makes up the signal in the Golgi region is immobile following nigericin treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Reduced mobility of Golgi localised NLRP3 by FRAP was consistent with a mitochondrial re-routing assay using FKBP tagged GFP-NLRP3 where a proportion of perinuclear NLRP3 in nigericin treated cells remained resistant to rapamycin induced mitochondrial re-routing (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H, I</xref>). Changes in the membrane binding cycle of NLRP3 therefore accompany its activation, with less NLRP3 cycling off Golgi membranes following nigericin treatment.</p>

<title>The thioesterase APT2 becomes segregated from NLRP3 following nigericin treatment</title>
<p>We next sought to understand how NLRP3 becomes immobilised on the Golgi. Golgi binding in nigericin treated cells is dependent on S-acylation at Cys-130 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-I</xref>), suggesting that increased Golgi recruitment of NLRP3 could potentially be a result of changes in the Cys-130 S-acylation cycle, either through higher rates of S-acylation or lower rates of de-acylation. As a fraction of NLRP3 was resistant to mitochondrial rerouting (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H, I</xref>), suggestive of less NLRP3 being de-acylated, we tested whether immobilisation of NLRP3 may be the result of changes in the access of thioesterase enzymes to NLRP3 post nigericin treatment. The thioesterase enzyme APT2 is known to reside at the Golgi and is tethered to its cytoplasmic face via S-acylation by the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi localised PATs ZDHHC3 and ZDHHC7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abrami et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Anwar and van der Goot, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ernst et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lin and Conibear, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Vartak et al., 2014</xref>).

In untreated cells, APT2<sup>S122A</sup> and NLRP3 signal were closely opposed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, B</xref>). However, whilst some NLRP3 signal overlapped with APT2<sup>S122A</sup> after nigericin treatment, a large proportion of NLRP3 accumulated on structures that were largely devoid of APT2<sup>S122A</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, B</xref>) indicating that APT2 becomes partially segregated from NLRP3 following nigericin treatment.</p>

</fig>
<p>Segregation between NLRP3 and APT2 after nigericin treatment may be due to alterations in Golgi organisation and function, which could prevent mixing between Golgi compartments and encounter of NLRP3 with APT2. To investigate whether the organisation of the Golgi is affected by nigericin, we examined cis / medial, trans and TGN Golgi markers relative to one another by fluorescence microscopy. In untreated cells the cis-Golgi, trans-Golgi and TGN were maintained in close proximity as part of a well-defined Golgi ribbon (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-D</xref>). In contrast, nigericin treatment induced dissociation of TGN membranes (marked by TGN46) from the cis- and medial-Golgi (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen and Chen, 2018</xref>), with a less pronounced dissociation of p230 positive trans-Golgi membranes from the cis / medial Golgi also observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Nigericin treatment therefore leads to significant alterations in the organisation of distal Golgi cisternae relative to proximal cisternae.</p>
<p>We next investigated whether nigericin treatment also impairs Golgi function, as has previously been reported for the related ionophore monensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Griffiths et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Tartakoff and Vassalli, 1977</xref>). For this, we used a secretory reporter system that utilises a modified version of human growth hormone (EGFP-FM4-hGH, hereafter referred to as FM4-hGH), a luminal cargo which is normally secreted from cells via the Golgi. In this system, hGH is tagged to four repeats of FKBP containing an F&gt;M mutation at position 36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Rollins et al., 2000</xref>). This mutation causes FKBP to aggregate and leads to retention of FKBP tagged hGH in the lumen of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gordon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rivera et al., 2000</xref>). FM4-hGH aggregates can be solubilised by the addition of rapamycin, which allows FM4-hGH to then be exported from the ER and transit through the Golgi stack before being secreted (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Nigericin treatment in the presence of rapamycin had no effect on exit of FM4-hGH from the ER, but inhibited its trafficking through the Golgi, with FM4-hGH accumulating in structures which overlapped with the cis/ medial Golgi marker STX5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C, D, F</xref>), demonstrating that Golgi secretion and the flow of material beyond cis- and medial-Golgi cisternae is impaired by nigericin. Consistent with segregation of NLRP3 from earlier Golgi compartments, minimal overlap of STX5 and hGH with NLRP3 could be seen following nigericin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs12">Supplementary Figure 12A-D</xref>). Thus, disruptions to Golgi organisation and function caused by nigericin may limit the ability of APT2 to come into contact with NLRP3 and de-acylate it (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G, H</xref>). Enhanced Golgi recruitment of NLRP3 appears to be insufficient for NLRP3 activation however as treatment of cells with the Na<sup>+</sup> selective ionophore monensin, which does not activate NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Munoz-Planillo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Perregaux et al., 1992</xref>), also caused NLRP3 to accumulate on the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs12">Supplementary Figure 12E, F, H</xref> and impaired Golgi function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs12">Supplementary Figure 12G</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper we describe the identification of additional features in NLRP3 that are necessary for localisation to the Golgi apparatus. NLRP3 Golgi binding has to date been shown to require interactions between the polybasic region of NLRP3 and PI4P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen and Chen, 2018</xref>). The NLRP3 polybasic region alone however, is insufficient to achieve localisation of NLRP3 to the Golgi, which is consistent with studies on the mechanistic basis for stable association of peripheral membrane proteins lacking folded lipid binding domains with intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Choy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hancock et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hancock et al., 1990</xref>). Similar to other peripheral membrane proteins that are S-acylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chumpen Ramirez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Greaves et al., 2008</xref>), electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with intracellular membranes provided by the polybasic region and helix<sup>115-125</sup> likely drive an initial low affinity membrane interaction, with stable anchoring to and enrichment on Golgi membranes provided by S-acylation at Cys-130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs13">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>). Collectively, Cys-130, helix<sup>115-125</sup> and the polybasic region form a highly conserved functional unit that are essential for localisation of NLRP3 to the Golgi apparatus and potentially other intracellular membranes.</p>
<p>Despite the identification of additional structural features in NLRP3 that are essential for membrane binding, these regions alone are insufficient to achieve Golgi enrichment comparable to full length NLRP3. We could determine a minimal NLRP3 membrane binding region between residues 95-699, which incorporates all the NACHT domain, and part of the trLRR preceding the LRR domain, although this truncated protein failed to accumulate on the Golgi at steady state and after nigericin treatment to the same degree as the full-length protein. Thus, the LRR appears to play some role in the localisation of NLRP3 to intracellular membranes. Mutations in key residues involved in interactions between the LRR domains of individual NLRP3 monomers appear to limit the amount of NLRP3 on the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andreeva et al., 2021</xref>). LRR dependent formation of an oligomeric NLRP3 complex may therefore increase affinity for intracellular membranes through an avidity-based effect dependent on multiple monomers working together within a larger NLRP3 oligomer. The Cryo-EM structures of NLRP3 are interesting in this respect, as the polybasic regions from multiple monomers appear to be organised within each pentamer / hexamer to form an expanded positively charged docking site around Cys-130 and helix<sup>115-125</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andreeva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hochheiser et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure 1D-G</xref>). Membrane contact driven through polybasic / helix<sup>115-125</sup> based multi-valent interactions could then be stabilised by S-acylation at Cys-130 at one or multiple monomers.</p>
<p>Consistent with S-acylation controlling NLRP3 localisation, we provide evidence that NLRP3 is highly sensitive to levels of ZDHHC3, ZDHHC5, ZDHHC7 and APT2, and that overexpression of ZDHHC3 can sensitise macrophages to nigericin. However we did not identify the endogenous enzymes responsible for stable NLRP3 recruitment to the Golgi through S-acylation and de-acylation, although both ZDHHC3/5/7 and APT2 transcripts are expressed at high levels in THP-1 cells relative to other ZDHHC and APT/ABHD family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs14">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>). In agreement with our results showing that localisation of NLRP3 to the Golgi can be controlled by the levels of ZDHHC3/7, a recent pre-print demonstrated that knockout of ZDHHC7 prevents localisation of NLRP3 to the Golgi and limits NLRP3 activation, suggesting that ZDHHC7 is responsible for NLRP3 S-acylation at Cys-130 in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yu et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data showing sensitivity of NLRP3 to ZDHHC enzymes localised to distinct organelles (Golgi localised ZDHHC3/7 vs plasma membrane localised ZDHHC5) is intriguing as it suggests NLRP3 can be recruited to different sub-cellular locations through S-acylation at Cys-130, dependent upon PAT abundance and the affinity of NLRP3 for different intracellular membranes dictated by the polybasic region and helix<sup>115-125</sup>. This may help to reconcile our own observations demonstrating NLRP3 association with the Golgi through an S-acylation cycle controlled by Golgi localised palmitoylation machinery, with recent work describing NLRP3 localisation to early and late endosomes in response to NLRP3 agonists, where it is proposed to sense disruptions in endocytic trafficking and ER-endosome contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Alterations in the levels of charged lipids on endosomes caused by NLRP3 stimuli, as has previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>), could potentially allow NLRP3 to visit endosomal membranes and be trapped there by an endosomally localised PAT. Re-localisation of NLRP3 upon overexpression of ZDHHC5 supports the idea that a switch in the use of differentially localised PATs could re-route NLRP3 to different sub-cellular compartments including early endosomes, where ZDHHC5 has been proposed to function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Breusegem and Seaman, 2014</xref>). An alternative route of endosomal recruitment could also be through a broader inhibition of thioesterase activity, as we observed NLRP3 co-localisation with late endosomes and Rab8<sup>+</sup> tubular recycling endosomes when de-acylation was inhibited by PalmostatinB, although this re-localisation occurred over the timescale of a number of hours.</p>
<p>Membrane binding is required for formation of an inactive oligomeric NLRP3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andreeva et al., 2021</xref>). Disruption of oligomer formation, either through mutation of residues involved in contacts between individual monomers or mutation of the NLRP3 polybasic region, limits NLRP3 activation, suggesting that membrane dependent oligomer formation is essential for sensing of NLRP3 stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andreeva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen and Chen, 2018</xref>). Regulation of access to the Golgi through S-acylation at Cys-130 is likely to be important for oligomer formation and may represent another aspect of regulatory control over NLRP3 activation. The steady state balance of S-acylation and de-acylation at Cys-130 may keep levels of Golgi localised NLRP3 below a critical threshold required for further NLRP3 oligomerisation or access to interaction partners and post translational modifications needed for optimal activation. The importance of membrane binding for NLRP3 inflammasome formation in humans remains unclear. In mice, deletion of residues 92-120, which removes part of helix<sup>115-125</sup>, impairs IL1β release, with longer deletions (Δ92-132 and Δ92-148) completely removing Cys-130 and helix<sup>115-125</sup> producing an even stronger reduction in inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tapia-Abellan et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, deletion of exon-3 (spanning residues 95-134) from human NLRP3 delays but does not completely block NLRP3 activation in human macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mateo-Tórtola et al., 2023</xref>). In light of the latter study, S-acylation at Cys-130 and binding to the Golgi may accelerate the process of inflammasome formation or increase sensitivity to NLRP3 agonists, although activation of human NLRP3 can still seemingly occur in the absence of Golgi binding.</p>
<p>Based on our mechanism proposing that nigericin induced alterations in Golgi organisation and trafficking may limit access of thioesterases to NLRP3, enhanced binding of NLRP3 to the Golgi would likely occur in response to treatments that perturb Golgi function in a similar manner. However, enhanced recruitment of NLRP3 to the Golgi is not necessarily indicative of NLRP3 activation, given that monensin also triggers accumulation of NLRP3 on the Golgi, although it is worth nothing that monensin can potentiate the effect of weaker NLRP3 agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). Whilst the exact reason NLRP3 has evolved to bind to intracellular membranes at present remains unknown, our results nonetheless provide new insight into the mechanisms underpinning membrane recruitment of NLRP3.</p>

Following this, to remove NEM and precipitate proteins, 4 volumes of 100% acetone were added to lysates and incubated for 1 hour at -20°C before lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 10 minutes to pellet precipitated proteins. The acetone-sample buffer mix was aspirated, and protein pellets were washed 4 times with 70% acetone to remove residual NEM. After the final wash, acetone was aspirated and protein pellets dried at room temperature for 10 minutes. Pellets were resuspended in 200 µl PS buffer before the sample was split in two and either 0.4M hydroxylamine (SLS, 159417-100G) or water added. Samples were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C before proteins were again acetone precipitated for 1 hour as described above. Pellets were washed once more with 70% acetone, air-dried for 10 minutes and resuspended in 100 µl PS buffer. 2 mM PEG-maleimide was then added to label exposed S-acylated cysteine residues and samples incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. Following addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer the samples were boiled for 5 minutes at 95 °C and resolved by SDS-PAGE.</p>

<p>SDS-PAGE sample buffer (BioRad, 1610747) supplemented with 5% (v/v) mercaptoethanol was added to samples lysed in PS buffer before boiling for 5 minutes at 95°C. Samples were then loaded onto an appropriate percentage Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel and proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to PVDF membrane using a BioRad semi-dry transfer system. Following transfer, membranes were blocked in 5% milk in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBSTx) for a minimum of 30 minutes. Blocked membranes were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBSTx and 5% milk overnight at 4°C. The next day, unbound antibodies were removed by 3 x 5 minute washes in PBSTx before incubation with secondary antibodies in PBSTx containing 5% milk for 1 hour with rotation at room temperature. Membranes were again washed 3 times for 5 minutes with PBSTx and signal detected using BioRad ECL chemiluminescence substrate and the LiCor c-digit system.</p>

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>For quantification of Golgi associated NLRP3 signal in untreated and nigericin treated cells, the Golgi region was identified using a Golgi marker which remains associated with the Golgi following nigericin treatment (either GM130 or p230) and the amount of NLRP3 associated measured through manual segmentation of the Golgi region in FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). An equivalent area of GFP-NLRP3 signal in the cytosol away from the perinuclear region was measured and the ratio between the Golgi NLRP3 signal and cytosolic NLRP3 signal calculated for each cell expressing GFP-NLRP3. All N numbers represent a minimum of 20 cells quantified per experiment with each graphed datapoint representing an independent experiment performed on separate days. All graphs included in figures were made using the GraphPad Prism software package. All statistical comparisons between groups were made using an unpaired t-test in GraphPad Prism 9.0.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> paper implicates S-acylation of Cys-130 in recruitment of the inflammasome receptor NLRP3 to the Golgi, and it provides <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that S-acylation plays a key role in response to the stress induced by nigericin treatment. While Cys-130 does seem to play a previously unappreciated role in membrane association of NLRP3, further work will be needed to clarify the details of the mechanism.</p>

<p>This paper examines the recruitment of the inflammasome seeding pattern recognition receptor NLRP3 to the Golgi. Previously, electrostatic interactions between the polybasic region of NLRP3 and negatively charged lipids were implicated in membrane association. The current study concludes that reversible S-acylation of the conserved Cys-130 residue, in conjunction with upstream hydrophobic residues plus the polybasic region, act together to promote Golgi localization of NLRP3, although additional parts of the protein are needed for full Golgi localization. Treatment with the bacterial ionophore nigericin inhibits membrane traffic and apparently prevents Golgi-associated thioesterases from removing the acyl chain, causing NLRP3 to become immobilized at the Golgi. This mechanism is put forth as an explanation for how NLRP3 is activated in response to nigericin.</p>
<p>The experiments are generally well presented. It seems likely that Cys-130 does indeed play a previously unappreciated role in Golgi association of NLRP3. However, the evidence for S-acylation at Cys-130 is largely indirect, and the process by which nigericin enhances membrane association is not yet fully understood. Therefore, this interesting study points the way for further analysis.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This is an interesting study investigating the mechanisms underlying membrane targeting of the NLRP3 inflammasome and reporting a key role for the palmitoylation-depalmitoylation cycle of cys130 in NRLP3. The authors identify ZDHHC3 and APT2 as the specific ZDHHC and APT/ABHD enzymes that are responsible for the s-acylation and de-acylation of NLRP3, respectively. They show that the levels of ZDHHC3 and APT2, both localized at the Golgi, control the level of palmitoylation of NLRP3. The S-acylation-mediated membrane targeting of NLRP3 cooperates with polybasic domain (PBD)-mediated PI4P-binding to target NLRP3 to the TGN under steady-state conditions and to the disassembled TGN induced by the NLRP3 activator nigericin.</p>
<p>However, the study has several weaknesses in its current form as outlined below.</p>
<p>(1) The novelty of the findings concerning cys130 palmitoylation in NLRP3 is unfortunately compromised by recent reports on the acylation of different cysteines in NLRP3 (PMID: 38092000), including palmitoylation of the very same cys130 in NLRP3 (Yu et al <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.07.566005">https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.07.566005)</ext-link>, which was shown to be relevant for NLRP3 activation in cell and animal models. What remains novel and intriguing is the finding that NLRP3 activators induce an imbalance in the acylation-deacylation cycle by segregating NLRP3 in late Golgi/endosomes from de-acylating enzymes confined in the Golgi. The interesting hypothesis put forward by the authors is that the increased palmitoylation of cys130 would finally contribute to the activation of NLRP3. However, the authors should clarify the trafficking pathway of acylated-NLRP3. This pathway should, in principle, coincide with that of TGN46 which constitutively recycles from the TGN to the plasma membrane and is trapped in endosomes upon treatment with nigericin.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think the data presented in our manuscript are consistent with the majority of S-acylated NLRP3 remaining on the Golgi via S-acylation in both untreated and nigericin treated cells. We have performed an experiment with BrefeldinA (BFA), a fungal metabolite that disassembles the Golgi without causing dissolution of early endosomes, that further supports the conclusion that NLRP3 predominantly resides on Golgi membranes pre and post activation. Treatment of cells with BFA prevents recruitment of NLRP3 to the Golgi in untreated cells and blocks the accumulation of NLRP3 on the structures seen in the perinuclear area after nigericin treatment (see new Supplementary Figure 4A-D). We do see some overlap of NLRP3 signal with TGN46 in the perinuclear area after nigericin treatment (see new Supplementary Figure 2E), however this likely represents TGN46 at the Golgi rather than endosomes given that the NLRP3 signal in this area is BFA sensitive.  As with 2-BP and GFP-NLRP3C130S, GFP-NLRP3 spots also form in BFA / nigericin co-treated cells but not with untagged NLRP3. These spots also do not show any co-localisation with EEA1, suggesting that under these conditions, endosomes don’t appear to represent a secondary site of NLRP3 recruitment in the absence of an intact Golgi. However, we cannot completely rule out that some NLRP3 may recruited to endosomes at some point during its activation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) To affect the S-acylation, the authors used 16 hrs treatment with 2-bromopalmitate (2BP). In Figure 1f, it is quite clear that NLRP3 in 2-BP treated cells completely redistributed in spots dispersed throughout the cells upon nigericin treatment. What is the Golgi like in those cells? In other words, does 2-BP alter/affect Golgi morphology? What about PI4P levels after 2-BP treatment? These are important missing pieces of data since both the localization of many proteins and the activity of one key PI4K in the Golgi (i.e. PI4KIIalpha) are regulated by palmitoylation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point and agree that it is possible the observed loss of NLRP3 from the Golgi might be due to an adverse effect of 2-BP on Golgi morphology or PI4P levels. We have tested the effect of 2-BP on the Golgi markers GM130, p230 and TGN46. 2BP has marginal effects on Golgi morphology with cis, trans and TGN markers all present at similar levels to untreated control cells (Supplementary Figure 2B-D). We also tested the effect of 2-BP on PI4P levels using mCherry-P4M, a PI4P biosensor. Surprisingly, as noted by the reviewer, despite recruitment of PI4K2A being dependent on S-acylation, PI4P was still present on the Golgi after 2-BP treatment, suggesting that a reduction in Golgi PI4P levels does not underly loss of NLRP3 from the Golgi (Supplementary Figure 2A). The pool of PI4P still present on the Golgi following 2-BP treatment is likely generated by other PI4K enzymes that localise to the Golgi independently of S-acylation, such as PI4KIIIB. We have included this data in our manuscript as part of a new Supplementary Figure 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors argue that the spots observed with NLRP-GFP result from non-specific effects mediated by the addition of the GFP tag to the NLRP3 protein. However, puncta are visible upon nigericin treatment, as a hallmark of endosomal activation. How do the authors reconcile these data? Along the same lines, the NLRP3-C130S mutant behaves similarly to wt NLRP3 upon 2-BP treatment (Figure 1h). Are those NLRP3-C130S puncta positive for endosomal markers? Are they still positive for TGN46? Are they positive for PI4P?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a fair point given the literature showing overlap of NLRP3 puncta formed in response to nigericin with endosomal markers and the similarity of the structures we see in terms of size and distribution to endosomes after 2BP + nigericin treatment. We have tested whether these puncta overlap with EEA1, TGN46 or PI4P (Supplementary Figure 2A, E-G). The vast majority of spots formed by GFP-NLRP3 co-treated with 2-BP and nigericin do not co-localise with EEA1, TGN46 or PI4P. This is consistent with these spots potentially being an artifact, although it has recently been shown that human NLRP3 unable to bind to the Golgi can still respond to nigericin (Mateo-Tórtola et al., 2023). These puncta might represent a conformational change cytosolic NLRP3 undergoes in response to stimulation, although our results suggest that this doesn’t appear to happen on endosomes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors expressed the minimal NLRP3 region to identify the domain required for NLRP3 Golgi localization. These experiments were performed in control cells. It might be informative to perform the same experiments upon nigericin treatment to investigate the ability of NLRP3 to recognize activating signals. It has been reported that PI4P increases on Golgi and endosomes upon NG treatment. Hence, all the differences between the domains may be lost or preserved. In parallel, also the timing of such recruitment upon nigericin treatment (early or late event) may be informative for the dynamics of the process and of the contribution of the single protein domains.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting point which we thank the reviewer for highlighting. However, we think that each domain on its own is not capable of responding to nigericin as shown by the effect of mutations in helix115-125 or the PB region in the full-length NLRP3 protein. NLRP3HF, which still contains a functional PB region, isn’t capable of responding to nigericin in the same way as wild type NLRP3 (Supplementary Figure 6C-D). Similarly, mutations in the PB region of full length NLRP3 that leave helix115-125 intact show that helix115-125 is not sufficient to allow enhanced recruitment of NLRP3 to Golgi membranes after nigericin treatment (Supplementary Figure 9A). We speculate that helix115-125, the PB region and the LRR domain all need to be present to provide maximum affinity of NLRP3 for the Golgi prior to encounter with and S-acylation by ZDHHC3/7. Mutation or loss of any one of the PB region, helix115-125 or the LRR lowers NLRP3 membrane affinity, which is reflected by reduced levels of NLRP3 captured on the Golgi by S-acylation at steady state and in response to nigericin.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) As noted above for the chemical inhibitors (1) the authors should check the impact of altering the balance between acyl transferase and de-acylases on the Golgi organization and PI4P levels. What is the effect of overexpressing PATs on Golgi functions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have checked the effect of APT2 overexpression on Golgi morphology and can show that it has no noticeable effect, ruling out an impact of APT on Golgi integrity as the reason for loss of NLRP3 from the Golgi in the presence of overexpressed APT2. We have included these images as Supplementary Figure 11H-J.</p>
<p>It is plausible that the effects of ZDHHC3 or ZDHHC7 on enhanced recruitment of NLRP3 to the Golgi may be via an effect on PI4P levels since, as mentioned above, both enzymes are involved in recruitment of PI4K2A to the Golgi and have previously been shown to enhance levels of PI4K2A and PI4P on the Golgi when overexpressed (Kutchukian et al., 2021). However, NLRP3 mutants with most of the charge removed from the PB region, which are presumably unable to interact with PI4P or other negatively charged lipids, are still capable of being recruited to the Golgi by excess ZDHHC3. This would suggest that the effect of overexpressed ZDHHC3 on NLRP3 is largely independent of changes in PI4P levels on the Golgi and instead driven by helix115-125 and S-acylation at Cys-130. The latter point is supported by the observation that NLRP3HF and NLRP3Cys130 are insensitive to ZDHHC3 overexpression.</p>
<p>At the levels of HA-ZDHHC3 used in our experiments with NLRP3 (200ng pEF-Bos-HAZDHHC3 / c.a. 180,000 cells) we don’t see any adverse effect on Golgi morphology (Author response image 1), although it has been noted previously by others that higher levels of ZDHHC3 can have an impact on TGN46 (Ernst et al., 2018). ZDHHC3 overexpression surprisingly has no adverse effects on Golgi function and in fact enhances secretion from the Golgi (Ernst et al., 2018).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper examines the recruitment of the inflammasome seeding pattern recognition receptor NLRP3 to the Golgi. Previously, electrostatic interactions between the polybasic region of NLRP3 and negatively charged lipids were implicated in membrane association. The current study reports that reversible S-acylation of the conserved Cys-130 residue, in conjunction with upstream hydrophobic residues plus the polybasic region, act together to promote Golgi localization of NLRP3, although additional parts of the protein are needed for full Golgi localization. Treatment with the bacterial ionophore nigericin inhibits membrane traffic and prevents Golgi-associated thioesterases from removing the acyl chain, causing NLRP3 to become immobilized at the Golgi. This mechanism is put forth as an explanation for how NLRP3 is activated in response to nigericin.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments are generally well presented. It seems likely that Cys-130 does indeed play a previously unappreciated role in the membrane association of NLRP3.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The interpretations about the effects of nigericin are less convincing. Specific comments follow.</p>
<p>(1) The experiments of Figure 4 bring into question whether Cys-130 is S-acylated. For Cys130, S-acylation was seen only upon expression of a severely truncated piece of the protein in conjunction with overexpression of ZDHHC3. How do the authors reconcile this result with the rest of the story?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Providing direct evidence of S-acylation at Cys-130 in the full-length protein proved difficult. We attempted to detect S-acylation of this residue by mass spectrometry. However, the presence of the PB region and multiple lysines / arginines directly after Cys-130 made this approach technically challenging and we were unable to convincingly detect S-acylation at Cys-130 by M/S. However, Cys-130 is clearly important for membrane recruitment as its mutation abolishes the localisation of NLRP3 to the Golgi. It is feasible that it is the hydrophobic nature of the cysteine residue itself which supports localisation to the Golgi, rather than S-acylation of Cys-130. A similar role for cysteine residues present in SNAP-25 has been reported (Greaves et al., 2009). However, the rest of our data are consistent with Cys-130 in NLRP3 being S-acylated. We also refer to another recently published study which provides additional biochemical evidence that mutation of Cys-130 impacts the overall levels of NLRP3 S-acylation (Yu et al., 2024).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Nigericin seems to cause fragmentation and vesiculation of the Golgi. That effect complicates the interpretations. For example, the FRAP experiment of Figure 5 is problematic because the authors neglected to show that the FRAP recovery kinetics of nonacylated resident Golgi proteins are unaffected by nigericin. Similarly, the colocalization analysis in Figure 6 is less than persuasive when considering that nigericin significantly alters Golgi structure and could indirectly affect colocalization.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that it is likely that the behaviour of other Golgi resident proteins are altered by nigericin. This is in line with a recent proteomics study showing that nigericin alters the amount of Golgi resident proteins associated with the Golgi (Hollingsworth et al., 2024) and other work demonstrating that changes in organelle pH can influence the membrane on / off rates of Rab GTPases (Maxson et al., 2023). However, Golgi levels of other peripheral membrane proteins</p>
<p>that associate with the Golgi through S-acylation, such as N-Ras, appear unaltered (Author response image 2.), indicating a degree of selectivity in the proteins affected. Our main point here is that NLRP3 is amongst those proteins whose behaviour on the Golgi is sensitive to nigericin and that this change in behaviour may be important to the NLRP3 activation process, although this requires further investigation and will form the basis of future studies.</p>
<p>The reduction in co-localisation between NLRP3 and APT2, due to alterations in Golgi organisation and trafficking, was the point we were trying to make with this figure, and we apologise if this was not clear. We think that the changes in Golgi structure and function caused by nigericin potentially affect the ability of APT2 to encounter NLRP3 and de-acylate it. We have added a new paragraph to the results section to hopefully explain this more clearly. We recognise that our results supporting this hypothesis are at present limited and we have toned down the language used in the results section to reflect the nature of these findings..</p>
