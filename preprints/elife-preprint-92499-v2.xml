<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>The environmental challenges the human malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, faces during its progression into its various lifecycle stages warrant the use of effective and highly regulated access to chromatin for transcriptional regulation. Microrchidia (MORC) proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing across plant and animal kingdoms. Accumulating evidence has shed light into the role MORC protein plays as a transcriptional switch in apicomplexan parasites. In this study, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool along with complementary molecular and genomics approaches, we demonstrate that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC not only modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite erythrocytic cycle, but is also essential to the parasite survival. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments suggest that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC binds to not only sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation but may also play a role in modulating stage transition. Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) studies indicate that downregulation of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC impairs key histone marks and induces the collapse of the parasite heterochromatin structure leading to its death. All together these findings confirm that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, validating this factor as a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Among the five human-infecting species, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is the deadliest, with over 619,000 deaths in 2023(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). To adapt to extreme environmental challenges, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> possesses unique strategies that direct the tightly coordinated changes in gene expression and control transcriptional switching in genes encoded by multigene families to ensure antigenic variation and immune evasion. Changes in gene expression throughout the parasite life cycle are controlled by a surprisingly low repertoire of transcription factors (TFs) encoded in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). The 27 apicomplexan APETALA2 (ApiAP2) DNA-binding proteins are the only well documented parasite TFs known to contribute to the modulation of gene expression throughout various stages of the parasite’s development(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Since the discovery of the AP2 gene family(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), evidence has alluded to their role as master regulators of gene expression throughout transitory phases of the parasite life cycle. The most well documented are the gametocyte specific TFs (AP2-G, AP2-G2)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) with subsequent discovery of those associated with transition to sexual differentiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) as well as sporozoite (AP2-SP) and liver stages (AP2-L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genome, however, encompasses well over 5,000 protein-coding genes suggesting there are most likely other molecular components responsible for gene expression. It is believed that, to offset the relatively low TF range, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> has evolved additional mechanisms regulating gene expression including mechanisms that use epigenetics factors, RNA binding proteins or regulate chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). All together these components work in combination to regulate the dynamic organization of DNA and the cascade of gene expression required for the parasite life cycle progression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Despite their importance, the identification and functional characterization of regulatory players controlling chromatin remains a challenge in this intractable organism. However, with the advent of sensitive technologies capable of capturing important chromatin associated regulatory complexes such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), chromatin conformation capture Hi-C technologies, and chromatin enrichment for proteomics (ChEP), we can now solve important facets of molecular components controlling epigenetics and chromatin structure.</p>
<p>Microrchidia (MORC) belong to a highly conserved nuclear protein superfamily with widespread domain architectures that link MORCs with signaling-dependent chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation across plant and animal kingdoms, including the apicomplexan parasites(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). In all organisms, MORC contains several domains that form a catalytically active ATPase. Apicomplexan MORC ATPases are encircled by Kelch-repeat β-propellers as well as a CW-type zinc finger domain functioning as a histone reader(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). In higher eukaryotes, MORCs were first identified as epigenetic regulators and chromatin remodelers in germ cell development. Currently, these proteins are shown to be involved in various human diseases including cancers and are expected to serve as important biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). In the apicomplexan parasite, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, <italic>Tg</italic>MORC was shown to recruit the histone deacetylase HDAC3 to particular genome loci to regulate chromatin accessibility, restricting sexual commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). <italic>Tg</italic>MORC-depleted cells also resulted in change in gene expression with up regulation of secondary AP2 factors and a significant shift from asexual to sexual differentiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Having multiple homologs with <italic>T. gondii</italic>, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> AP2 protein conservation is primarily restricted to their AP2 DNA-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Recently, ChEP experiments done in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> identified <italic>Pf</italic>MORC as one of the highest enriched chromatin-bound proteins at different stages of the parasite intraerythrocytic development cycle (IDC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). <italic>Pf</italic>MORC was also detected at a relatively high level throughout the parasite life cycle, including sporozoites and liver stages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), and has been identified in several protein pull down experiments as targeting both AP2 TFs and epigenetic factors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC seems to interact with AP2-G2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), a TF that plays a critical role in the maturation of gametocytes. However, the genome wide distribution and exact function of this protein throughout the parasite life cycle remained elusive.</p>
<p>In this study, we apply CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing technologies to determine the function, genome distribution, and indispensability of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC throughout the parasite’s IDC. Immunoprecipitation of an HA-tagged parasite line validates the role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in heterochromatin structure maintenance. Using downregulation of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC induced through TetR-DOZI system, we demonstrate the functional significance of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in heterochromatin stability and gene repression. Immunofluorescence based assays and ChIP-seq experiments show that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC localizes to heterochromatin clusters at or near <italic>var</italic> genes with significant overlap with well-known signatures of the parasite heterochromatin post-translational modification (PTM) H3K9-trimethylation (H3K9me3) marks. When <italic>Pf</italic>MORC was downregulated, level of H3K9me3 was detected at a lower level, demonstrating a possible role of this protein in epigenetic regulation and gene repression. Finally, Hi-C analyses demonstrate that downregulation of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC results in significant dysregulation of chromatin architectural stability resulting in parasite death. All together our work provides significant insight into the role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in the maintenance of the pathogens’ epigenetics and chromosomal architectural integrity and validates this protein as a promising target for novel therapeutic interventions.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>P</italic>fMORC-HA transgenic line shows nuclear localization in heterochromatin clusters</title>
<p>To characterize the role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, we applied CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool to add a 3X-HA tag at the C-terminal coding region of the <italic>Pfmorc</italic> locus (PF3D7_1468100) in an NF54 line(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, Sup. data 1). Recovered transgenic parasites were cloned using limiting dilution and the correct incorporation of the tag into the parasite genome was validated via PCR and whole genome sequencing (WGS) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, Sup. data 2). WGS analysis confirmed the presence of the HA tag at the expected locus with no obvious off-target effect but uncovered an additional nonsense mutation in the <italic>gametocyte development protein 1</italic> (<italic>gdv1</italic>) gene (PF3D7_0935400) at amino acid position 561 out of 599 total. Mutations in <italic>gdv1</italic> have been detected in the past and seem to emerge relatively often, indicating a fitness benefit in the in <italic>vitro</italic> culture system used in the laboratory(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). The involvement of GDV1 as essential in sexual commitment is well substantiated and further study involving the role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in sexual commitment could not be fully addressed(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>)(Sup. data 2). Despite this finding, we were able to design experiments to determine the role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC throughout the IDC as no other major detrimental mutations were detected in the genome. We first validated <italic>Pf</italic>MORC protein expression through Western blot analysis (Fig. S1). Regardless of potential protein degradation, results showed an expected band size within the ∼290 kDa range that was absent in NF54 control compared to our tagged line (Fig. S1). Immunofluorescence (IFA) analysis of intracellular parasites revealed that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC is localized in the nucleus throughout the parasite IDC in punctate patterns (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). A single foci per parasite was detected in the nuclear periphery at the ring stage. An increased number of foci with a more diffuse signal could be detected as the number of DNA copies increased at the schizont stage. Moreover, punctuates were shown to have strong colocalization signals with histone H3K9me3 marks present at the different parasite developmental stages analyzed. This was most evident during the early ring stage of the parasite IDC where the chromatin organization is more compact with a single DNA copy. Altogether, our findings indicated that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC is a true nuclear protein that is most likely associated with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> heterochromatin cluster(s).</p>

<title><italic>Pf</italic>MORC interacting partners include proteins involved in heterochromatin maintenance, transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling</title>
<p>To confirm the association of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC with proteins involved in heterochromatin cluster(s), we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by mass-spectrometry (MS) analysis using mature stages of <italic>P</italic>fMORC-HA and parental line as control. MORC was detected with highest peptides (97 and 113) and spectra (1041 and 1177) counts compared to control conditions (5 and 7 peptides; 16 and 43 spectra) confirming the efficiency of our pull-down. However, considering the relatively large size of the MORC protein (295kDa) and its weak detection in the control, the log<sub>2</sub> FC and Z-statistic after normalization are minimal when compared to smaller proteins that were not identified in the control samples. To define a set of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC associated proteins, we used the QPROT statistical framework(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>) to compare proteins detected in <italic>Pf</italic>MORC samples and controls. We identified 73 <italic>Pf</italic>MORC associated proteins (log<sub>2</sub> FC ≥ 2 and Z statistic &gt; 5) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, Sup. data 3). Additional chromatin remodeling proteins were detected such as ISWI chromatin-remodeling complex ATPase (PF3D7_0624600) and SWIB/MDM2 domain-containing protein (PF3D7_0611400), as well as the epigenetic readers BDP3 (PF3D7_0110500) and PHD2 (PF3D7_1433400)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). We also detected a significant enrichment of histone erasers and writers such as a N-acetyltransferase (PF3D7_1020700), HDAC1 (PF3D7_0925700), and SET3 (PF3D7_0827800). Several of which have been detected to interact with MORC in previous studies including the AP2-G5, HDAC1, ELM2 and ApiAp2 proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Notably, we observed that many of the detected proteins were enriched at levels comparable to those of the bait protein such as AP2-P and HDAC1. This may be a result of proteins forming complexes in a one-to-one ratio, leading to similar enrichment levels. Notably, two of these three proteins have been reported to interact with MORC in several studies, further supporting a strong interaction between them. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that these proteins are nuclear and are associated with heterochromatin, DNA binding, and transcription factor activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Detailed analysis showed the detection of SIP2, involved in heterochromatin formation and chromosome end regulation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>), and 8 AP2 transcription factors, including AP2-G2, AP2-O2, AP2-G5. Among the other AP2s detected, 5 were previously identified by ChIP-seq as <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> AP2 Heterochromatin-associated Factors (<italic>Pf</italic>AP2-HFs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Our findings, corroborated with several published works, indicate that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC interacts with multiple ApiAP2 TFs, chromatin remodelers, and epigenetic players associated with heterochromatin regions.</p>

<title>Genome-wide distribution of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC displays functional roles in stage-specific gene silencing and antigenic variation</title>
<p>Given the multifunctional role of MORC proteins throughout apicomplexan parasites, we further explored the association of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC with chromatin accessibility and stage-specific gene regulation by assessing the genome-wide distribution of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP–seq) in duplicate at the ring, trophozoite and schizont stages. Inspection of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC binding sites across each chromosome revealed a strong signal for telomeric and subtelomeric regions of the parasite genome, as well as the internal clusters of genes responsible for antigenic variation such as <italic>var</italic> and <italic>rifin</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-c</xref>, Sup. data 4). We found that while only 47% of reads mapped to antigenic genes in the ring stage, 95% of reads mapped to the same genes during the trophozoite stage and 82% during the schizont stage. Although a vast majority of the genome is actively transcribed during the trophozoite stage, these antigenic gene families are under tight regulatory control to ensure mutually exclusive expression and participate in immune evasion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). This could explain the disparity in the level of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC binding of the coding regions between the ring and trophozoite stages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, Fig. S2b).</p>

<p>We also evaluated <italic>Pf</italic>MORC binding of stage-specific gene families including gametocyte-related genes, and merozoite surface proteins (<italic>msp</italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). In trophozoite and schizont stages, gametocyte-associated genes contain a mean of &lt;0.5 RPKM normalized reads per nucleotide of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC binding within their promoter region, whereas antigenic gene families such as <italic>var</italic> and <italic>rifin</italic> contain ∼1.5 and 0.5 normalized reads, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). The difference is even greater within the gene body with gametocyte genes displaying almost no reads mapped more than 200 bp downstream of the TSS and antigenic gene families containing 0.5-1.5 RPKM normalized reads. However, the gametocyte-specific transcription factor AP2-G, known to be repressed during the IDC and required for sexual commitment, deviates from this trend and contains similar levels of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC binding to <italic>var</italic> genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> and S2c, d). These results indicate a major role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in controlling AP2-G and sexual differentiation. For some of the <italic>msp</italic> genes that are usually expressed later during the IDC to prepare the parasite for egress and invasion of new erythrocytes, <italic>Pf</italic>MORC binding was detected in the gene bodies at the trophozoite stage. We also detected a small switch in <italic>Pf</italic>MORC binding sites, moving from their gene bodies to their intergenic regions at the schizont stage (Fig. S2d). <italic>Pf</italic>MORC most likely moved away from the gene body to the regulatory regions surrounding the transcription start site (TSS) to guide RNA Polymerase and transcription factors and aid in activating expression of genes at the schizont stage that are crucial for egress and invasion. These results provide strong evidence for the direct effects that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC binding has on tightly controlled antigenic and stage-specific genes including crucial invasion and gametocyte genes.</p></sec>

<title><italic>P</italic>fMORC is essential for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> survival</title>
<p>We next sought to confirm the functional relevance of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC protein in parasite survival. While partial <italic>Pf</italic>MORC knockdown using the glmS-ribozyme system had previously shown to have no significant effect on the parasite survival(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), another study using transposon mutagenesis (<italic>piggyBac)</italic> identified <italic>Pf</italic>MORC as likely essential(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). To resolve these conflicting results, we applied a complementary approach using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing strategy to incorporate an inducible TetR-DOZI system to knockdown (KD) <italic>Pf</italic>MORC(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>) through administration of anhydrotetracycline (aTC) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>).

While results from our WGS validated our editing strategy without the detection of any obvious deleterious off-target effect, we identified a nonsense mutation in AP2-G gene (PF3D7_1222600) explaining our inability to obtain mature gametocytes. Protein expression and successful KD was confirmed via western blot with a decrease of ∼ 58% and ∼ 88.2% in <italic>Pf</italic>MORC expression at 24 hpi and 36 hpi respectively compared to their aTC supplemented conditions (Fig. S3).

<p>We then performed a phenotypic assay on (+/-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC-HA-TetR-DOZI parasite cultures. The assay was conducted in replicates of synchronized cultures that were then split into (+) aTC and (-) aTC conditions either at the ring or trophozoite stages on <italic>Pf</italic>MORC-HA-TetR-DOZI clones and WT control lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c-f</xref>, Sup. data 5). Sequential morphological screens were performed through Giemsa-stained smears and monitored by microscope imaging. As opposed to what was observed previously with the glmS-ribozyme system(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), aTC removal at the ring stage induced clear signs of stress and cell cycle arrest in mid-trophozoite and schizont stages of the first intraerythrocytic cycle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c-d</xref>) compared to (+) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC and WT parasites. Our data showed an ∼53%, 77%, and 84% (n=3, p≤0.0001) drop in parasitemia at 48-, 72- and 120-hours post invasion (hpi), respectively, when compared to control conditions. aTC supplemented and WT cultures showed unperturbed cell cycle progression, reinvasion, and morphological development. Interestingly, when aTC was withheld at the late trophozoite stages (24 to 30 hpi), parasites could complete the first cycle and successfully reinvade into new red blood cells (RBCs) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e-f</xref>). The evident hindered phenotypic response may either be associated with the delay time for the protein to be completely depleted or may suggest a more dispensable role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in the schizont stage. However, clear indications of stress and cell cycle arrest were ultimately detected at trophozoite and early schizont stages of the second cell cycle. Quantitative analysis of (-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC cultures revealed significantly decreased parasitemia of ∼37% and 66% (n=3, p≤0.0001) at 96 hpi and 120 hpi, respectively, compared to (+) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC and WT control lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e-f</xref>, Sup. data 5), confirming the importance of the protein at the trophozoite and early schizont stages.</p>

<title>Effect of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC knockdown on parasite transcriptome</title>
<p>To define the effects of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC KD on transcription, we conducted detailed time-course measurements of mRNA levels using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) throughout the parasite asexual cycle on (+/-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC lines. Parasites were first synchronized and aTC was removed from one set of samples. Total RNA was then extracted at the trophozoite (24 hpi) and the schizont (36 hpi) stages to allow for detection of early and late changes in gene expression after aTC removal. Pairwise correlations analysis (Fig. S4a) between (+/-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC treated lines at the two different time points confirmed appropriate reproducibility of our RNA-seq experiments.</p>
<p>Our results identified a relatively low number of differentially expressed genes at 24 hpi with 96 and 93 upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively (FDR &lt; 0.05 and log<sub>2</sub> FC &gt; 0.5 or &lt; -0.5) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>, Sup. data 6). This data is in agreement with the absence of major phenotypic changes observed in (-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC parasite cultures after 24 hours. GO enrichment analysis indicated upregulation of genes in response to xenobiotic stimulus including several phosphatases, hydrolases and heat shock proteins suggesting stress sensing of the parasites at this stage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). GO analyses of downregulated genes, on the other hand, were found to be closely associated with regular metabolic processes and intracellular transport mechanisms suggesting dysregulation of regular cellular activity. Although, at this stage it is probable that the limited depletion of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC (58%) has restricted effects at the transcriptional level (See Fig. S3) and that the observed down-regulated genes are likely due to an indirect effect of cell cycle arrest. At 36 hpi the number of genes that exhibit changes in gene expression were significantly higher with 1319 upregulated and 1150 downregulated (FDR &lt; 0.05 and log<sub>2</sub> FC &gt; 0.5 or &lt; -0.5) in (-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC conditions, reflecting of a significant decrease of the protein ( ∼ 88.2%) and confirming the significant changes observed at the phenotypic level (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). These results emphasize the cascading effects of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC KD as the parasite progressed throughout its cell cycle. GO analysis indicated an enrichment of upregulated genes involved in multiple pathways including ATP metabolic process, mitochondria, translation, food vacuole and protein folding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>); characteristic of not only stress, but also a clear signal of cell cycle arrest in (-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC samples. Among upregulated genes, we also observed several <italic>var</italic> genes and genes exported at the surface of the red blood cell that could be linked to significant decreased in <italic>Pf</italic>MORC binding of these genes families as well as a disorganization of the heterochromatin cluster(s) at the trophozoite and schizont stages. GO enrichment analysis for genes that were downregulated included many genes involved in DNA replication, chromosome organization and mitotic spindle further emphasizing a strong cell cycle arrest and absence of potential major compensatory mechanisms for cell division and chromatin organization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Additional downregulated genes were required for invasion such as several merozoite surface proteins. Our results clearly indicate stress sensing and an arrest in cell cycle progression at the trophozoite and schizont stages (Sup. data 5)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>).</p>

<p>Although these results are compelling, the small overlap observed between the ChIP-seq signals and RNA-seq results indicate that major changes observed in gene expression at the schizont stages are not simply the result of reduced <italic>Pf</italic>MORC binding in targeted gene bodies but a combination of direct and indirect effects of the degradation of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC that leads to cell cycle arrest and potential collapse of the heterochromatin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Pf</italic>MORC knockdown erodes antigenic-gene silencing framework</title>
<p>We next sought to analyze the effect of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC down-regulation on the global chromatin landscape. We therefore performed a ChIP-seq experiment against histone H3K9me3 and H3K9ac marks in response to <italic>Pf</italic>MORC depletion. Synchronized parasites were equally split between permissive and repressive conditions. At trophozoite (24 hpi) and schizont (36 hpi) stages of development, both control (+aTC) and experiment (-aTC) samples were fixed and parasites collected for chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing. The experimental procedure was performed in duplicate between (+/-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC treated lines. Correlation analysis confirms the reproducibility of our ChIP–seq experiments.</p>
<p>Results revealed no significant changes in histone H3K9ac marks across the genome (data not shown) but a reduction in the heterochromatin landscape in the <italic>Pf</italic>MORC depleted conditions, specifically in the telomere regions of the chromosomes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). <italic>Pf</italic>MORC KD resulted in significantly reduced (Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, p &lt; 0.05) H3K9me3 marks within <italic>var</italic> gene promoters from 200-800 bp upstream of the TSS, as well as 400-800 bp downstream of the TSS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b-c</xref>). This result coincides with our transcriptomic profile and the upregulation of <italic>var</italic> genes at 36 hpi of (-)aTC samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4d</xref>, Sup. data 6). Further analyses revealed similar trends in other gene families associated with parasite reinvasion and immune response typically silenced under WT conditions. Most noticeable was the reduced H3K9me3 coverage across the <italic>rifin</italic> gene family, which displayed a significant reduction (p &lt; 0.05) in all bins from 1000 bp upstream of the TSS to 1000 bp downstream from the end of the gene (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b-c</xref>) in response to <italic>Pf</italic>MORC depletion. There is a clear reduction of H3K9me3 coverage of virulence genes shown to be upregulated following <italic>Pf</italic>MORC knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Overall, these findings confirm that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC protein depletion not only affects chromatin landscape but has significant impact on heterochromatin. <italic>Pf</italic>MORC downregulation leads to the erosion of heterochromatin integrity most likely required for mutually exclusive gene expression and immune evasion within heterochromatin clusters.</p>

<title>Knockdown of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC expression results in the loss of tightly regulated heterochromatin structures</title>
<p>To better understand the effect that downregulation of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC has on the chromatin structure and investigate whether changes in chromatin accessibility may explain large changes in gene expression observed using RNA-seq, we performed Hi-C on (+/-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC cultures at 24 hpi (trophozoite) and 36 hpi (schizont). Biological replicates for each sample were collected and used to generate Hi-C libraries with &gt;37 million reads per replicate/sample, ensuring comprehensive coverage of both intrachromosomal and interchromosomal interactions. After processing (pairing, mapping, and quality filtering) the raw sequences via HiC-Pro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>), there were approximately 15 million (σ = ∼10 million) high quality interaction pairs per sample. Due to the high number of reads and relatively small size of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome (23.3 Mb) compared to higher eukaryotes, we elected to bin our Hi-C data at 10-kb resolution, which allowed the identification of genome-wide patterns while not introducing much noise by binning at too high of a resolution. A high stratum-adjusted correlation (Fig. S4), especially at the 24 hpi time point, suggested that the chromatin structure was consistent between biological replicates, therefore we chose to combine replicates for downstream analyses and visualization.</p>
<p>Because of variation in the number of valid interaction pairs between (+/-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC samples, 100 iterations of random sampling were performed on samples with higher read count to obtain ∼35 million and ∼9 million interaction pairs at 24 hpi and 36 hpi, respectively. ICED normalized intrachromosomal heatmaps displayed a high proportion of interactions at distances less than 10% the length of each chromosome as well as strong subtelomeric interactions and internal regions containing genes involved in antigenic variation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a-b</xref>, Fig. S6-S9) This pattern was similar to those observed previously at various stages of the life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>) and confirm that genes involved in antigenic variation are usually confined within dense heterochromatin rich regions to aid the tight control of <italic>var</italic> genes necessary for their mutually exclusive expression and immune evasion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Data generated at 36 hpi in (-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC parasite cultures were however tumultuous, with a decrease in defined heterochromatin borders and fewer long-range intrachromosomal interactions across the genome.

<p>To pinpoint which regions were most strongly affected by knockdown of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC, we used Selfish(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>) to identify differential intrachromosomal and interchromosomal interactions in the (+/-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC samples. Although the 24 hpi and 36 hpi time points shared similarities in loci most highly affected by <italic>Pf</italic>MORC KD on many chromosomes, the changes at 36 hpi were more significant with a higher log<sub>2</sub> FC (FDR &lt; 0.05) at most loci (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c-d</xref>, Fig. S10-S11). We also observed consistent loss of interactions between most regions containing <italic>var</italic> genes. These results indicate a failed attempt of the (-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC parasites to maintain their overall chromatin structure with a significant weakening of the tightly controlled heterochromatin cluster.</p>
<p>We further validated our results using PASTIS to generate coordinate matrices and subsequently visualize a consensus three-dimensional model of the chromosome folding and their overall organization within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). This can indicate changes in spatial distance that best describe the interaction data. The overall change in the chromatin 3D structure was clearly shown by our models of (+/-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC samples (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>). While the co-localization of centromeres and telomeres in different regions of the nucleus were conserved, the 3D chromatin structure of (-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC at 36 hpi displayed clear opening of the chromatin and loss of interactions in most regions. This could explain the large changes in gene expression, including increased expression of all <italic>var</italic> and <italic>rifin</italic> genes in the (-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC line (Sup. data 6). While heterochromatin maintenance may be essential for tight control of <italic>var</italic> gene expression, preservation of the overall structure of the chromatin may be necessary to regulate the accurate expression of most <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transcripts.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite intensive investigations on the dynamic nature of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> chromatin, progress has been slow in capturing the regulatory factors that maintain and control chromatin structure and gene expression throughout parasite development.

MORC proteins from plant to animal cells have a broad range of binding sites within the genome and participate in either DNA methylation establishment or heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>).

For instance, AP2-P (PF3D7_1107800), AP2-G5, ISW1, NUP2, MCM5 and HDAC1 have been shown to interact with MORC in several published works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), including this work. Protein pull-down experiments in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. and <italic>T. gondii</italic> studies have detected MORC in complexes with several AP2 TFs. In <italic>T. gondii, Tg</italic>MORC was characterized as an upstream transcriptional repressor of sexual commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). In <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, the role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC was still poorly understood. Conflicting results on the essentiality of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC using either KD or KO strategies remained unresolved(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool, we have determined the nuclear localization, genome-wide distribution, and regulatory impacts of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC on the parasite chromatin, transcriptome, and cell cycle development. We now have powerful evidence demonstrating that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC is not only critical for parasite cell cycle progression and its survival but has a direct role in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing, including regulating immune evasion through antigenic variation. Disparities observed in the essentiality of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC for the parasite survival in previous studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) are most likely the results of weak protein disruption highlighting the need for a significant downregulation of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC for true functional analysis. Using IFA and protein pull-downs, we have confirmed that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC localizes to the nucleus and interacts with multiple ApiAP2 TFs, chromatin remodelers, and epigenetic players associated with heterochromatin regions including H3K9me3, SIP2, HDAC1 and the ISWI chromatin-remodeling complex (SWIB/MDM2)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Although some discrepancies have been observed with other studies, mainly due to the fact that MORC protein was not used as the bait protein, our study validated the interaction of MORC with these partners, supporting that <italic>Pf</italic>MORC is in complex with key heterochromatin regulators. Using a combination of ChIP-seq, protein knock down, RNA-seq and Hi-C experiments, we also demonstrated that the MORC protein is essential for the tight regulation of gene expression. We can speculate that lack of MORC impacts heterochromatin and chromatin compaction, preventing access to gene promoters from TFs and the general transcriptional machinery in a stage specific manner. Although additional experiments will be required, our hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that downregulation of the <italic>Pf</italic>MORC significantly reduced H3K9me3 coverage in the heterochromatin cluster(s) and 5’ flanking regions of <italic>var</italic> and <italic>rifin</italic> genes. While we were unable to confirm a direct role of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC in sexual conversion due to a nonsense mutation in AP2-G gene in our transfected lines, its strong interaction with AP2-G during the asexual cell cycle indicates that PfMORC in combination with other epigenetic factors may most likely control AP2-G expression and sexual differentiation. It is also important to recognize that the many pathways affected at the transcriptional level throughout the asexual stages in (-) aTC <italic>Pf</italic>MORC lines are not only the direct results of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC downregulation and decrease of its targeted DNA binding site. They are most likely a combination of direct and indirect effects of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC KD warranted by the cell cycle arrest observed at the phenotypic level and the collapse of the chromatin organization confirmed using chromatin conformation capture experiment. These direct and indirect effects should be carefully considered, and a combination of functional genomic studies should be completed when interpreting changes in gene expression in mutant generated lines.</p>
<p>All together our work demonstrated that in addition to its direct role in heterochromatin formation and antigenic variation, <italic>Pf</italic>MORC may act as a potential repressor to control a set of parasite specific genes including genes involved in parasite egress and invasion, and antigenic variation between the trophozoite to schizont stage transition(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). As our data confirm the importance of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC and the parasite specificity of several interacting partners, it is tempting to speculate that drugs targeting these protein complexes could lead to novel antiparasitic strategies.</p>

<p>Flagging of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> MORC (Pf3D7_1468100) gene spanning position (Ch14: 2785386 - 2797934 (-)) was performed using a two-plasmid design to insert a 3x HA tag. The pCasG-Cas9-sgRNA plasmid vector (gifted by Dr. Sean Prigge) contains the site to express the sgRNA, along with the yDHODH gene as the positive selection marker. The gRNA oligos (Sup. data 1) were ligated after digestion of the plasmid with BsaI. The pDC2-cam-Cas9-U6 plasmid (gifted by Dr. Marcus Lee) was digested with BamHI and Apal to remove the eGFP tag from the backbone. 453 bp of C-terminal region of <italic>Pf</italic>MORC and 469 bp of 3’UTR were amplified from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genomic DNA with their respective primers (Sup. data 1).

The pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of nuclear extraction buffer (10 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM AEBSF and 1x Protease inhibitor cocktail), and incubated on ice for 30 min before addition of NP-40/Igepal to a final of 0.25%. After lysis, the parasites are subject to homogenization by passing through a 26G 3/8 needle/syringe to burst the nucleus.

A mapping quality cutoff of 30 was set while aligning to the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome (PlasmoDB, v58) and the resulting reads were binned at 10 kb resolution and ICED-normalized. Stratum-adjusted correlation coefficients were calculated using HiCRep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>), then replicates were merged to generate a single consensus sample for each time point and condition. The normalized matrices were per-million read count normalized and maximum values for the heatmap color scale on each chromosome was set to the maximum value for all samples to allow for direct comparisons between each condition and time point. Furthermore, due to the overrepresentation of short-range interactions, the maximum values for each heatmap were also set to the 90th percentile of each chromosome to slightly compress highly interacting regions and enhance visualization of interactions. Significant intrachromosomal interactions were identified with FitHiC(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>) to identify the log-linear relationship between contact probability and genomic distance. Differential interchromosomal and intrachromosomal interactions between (+) aTC and (-) aTC were identified using Selfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>) with default parameters (FDR &lt; 0.05). The maximum and minimum values for the color scales in the differential heatmaps were set to the absolute value of the largest log<sub>2</sub> fold change within each chromosome. PASTIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>) was used to generate coordinate matrices from the raw read count matrices output by HiC-Pro, and then visualized as 3D chromatin models in ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>), highlighting regions containing <italic>var</italic> genes, telomeres, and centromeres.</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Parasitemia and proportion of asexual stages were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons. Significant differences were indicated as following: * for p &lt; 0.05; ** for p &lt; 0.01, *** for p &lt; 0.001 and **** for p &lt; 0.0001. Statistical tests were performed with GraphPad Prism. Figures were generated with GraphPad Prism and BioRender.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigated the function of Microrchidia (MORC) proteins in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Recognizing MORC's implication in DNA compaction and gene silencing across diverse species, the study aimed to explore the influence of PfMORC on transcriptional regulation, life cycle progression and survival of the malaria parasite. Depletion of PfMORC leads to the collapse of heterochromatin and thus to the killing of the parasite. The potential regulatory role of PfMORC in the survival of the parasite suggests that it may be central to the development of new antimalarial strategies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The application of the cutting-edge CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool, combined with other molecular and genomic approaches, provides a robust methodology. Comprehensive ChIP-seq experiments indicate PfMORC's interaction with sub-telomeric areas and genes tied to antigenic variation, suggesting its pivotal role in stage transition. The incorporation of Hi-C studies is noteworthy, enabling the visualization of changes in chromatin conformation in response to PfMORC knockdown.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although disruption of PfMORC affects chromatin architecture and stage-specific gene expression, determining a direct cause-effect relationship requires further investigation. Furthermore, while numerous interacting partners have been identified, their validation is critical and understanding their role in directing MORC to its targets or in influencing the chromatin compaction activities of MORC is essential for further clarification. In addition, the authors should adjust their conclusions in the manuscript to more accurately represent the multifaceted functions of MORC in the parasite.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary: The authors investigated the function of Microrchidia (MORC) proteins in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Recognizing MORC's implication in DNA compaction and gene silencing across diverse species, the study aimed to explore the influence of PfMORC on transcriptional regulation, life cycle progression and survival of the malaria parasite. Depletion of PfMORC leads to the collapse of heterochromatin and thus to the killing of the parasite. The potential regulatory role of PfMORC in the survival of the parasite suggests that it may be central to the development of new antimalarial strategies.</p>
<p>Strengths: The application of the cutting-edge CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool, combined with other molecular and genomic approaches, provides a robust methodology. Comprehensive ChIP-seq experiments indicate PfMORC's interaction with sub-telomeric areas and genes tied to antigenic variation, suggesting its pivotal role in stage transition. The incorporation of Hi-C studies is noteworthy, enabling the visualization of changes in chromatin conformation in response to PfMORC knockdown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the overall positive feedback and cognisense of our efforts. Our application of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools coupled with complementary cellular and functional approaches shed light on the importance of _Pf_MORC in maintaining chromatin structural integrity in the parasite and highlights this protein as a promising target for novel therapeutic intervention.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses: Although disruption of PfMORC affects chromatin architecture and stage-specific gene expression, determining a direct cause-effect relationship requires further investigation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our conclusions were made on the basis of multiple, unbiased molecular and functional genomic assays that point to the relevance of the _Pf_MORC protein in maintaining the parasite’s chromatin landscape. Although we do not claim to have precise evidence on the step-by-step pathway to which _Pf_MORC is involved, we bring forth first-hand evidence of its role in heterochromatin binding, gene-regulation and its association with major TFs as well as chromatin remodeling and modifying enzymes. We however agree with the comment regarding the lack of direct effects of _Pf_MORC KD and have since provided additional evidence by performing ChIP-seq experiments against H3K9me3 and H3K9ac during KD. Our new results are presented in Fig. 5. We showed that the level of H3K9me3 decreased significantly during _Pf_MORC KD.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, while numerous interacting partners have been identified, their validation is critical and understanding their role in directing MORC to its targets or in influencing the chromatin compaction activities of MORC is essential for further clarification. In addition, the authors should adjust their conclusions in the manuscript to more accurately represent the multifaceted functions of MORC in the parasite.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Validation of the identified interacting partners is indeed critical and essential to understanding their role in directing MORC to its targets. Our protein pull down experiments have been done using several biological replicates. Several of the interacting partners have also been identified and published by other labs and collaborators. To confirm our results, we completed a direct comparison of our work with previous published work. Results have now been incorporated into the revised manuscript to confirm the identified interacting partners and the accuracy of the data we obtained in our experiment. Molecular validation of novel proteins identified in our protein pull down requires generation of tagged lines and may take a few more years but will be submitted for publication in a follow up manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary: This paper, titled &quot;Regulation of Chromatin Accessibility and Transcriptional Repression by PfMORC Protein in Plasmodium falciparum,&quot; delves into the PfMORC protein's role during the intra-erythrocytic cycle of the malaria parasite, P. falciparum. Le Roch et al. examined PfMORC's interactions with proteins, its genomic distribution in different parasite life stages (rings, trophozoites, schizonts), and the transcriptome's response to PfMORC depletion. They conducted a chromatin conformation capture on PfMORC-depleted parasites and observed significant alterations. Furthermore, they demonstrated that PfMORC depletion is lethal to the parasite.</p>
<p>Strengths: This study significantly advances our understanding of PfMORC's role in establishing heterochromatin. The direct consequences of the PfMORC depletion are addressed using chromatin conformation capture.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s comments and reflection on the importance of our work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses: The study only partially addressed the direct effects of PfMORC depletion on other heterochromatin markers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here again, we agree with the reviewer’s comment and have performed additional experiments to delve deeper into the multifaceted roles of _Pf_MORC. We have performed additional ChIP-sequencing analysis on _Pf_MORC depleted conditions focusing on known heterochromatin and euchromatin markers H3K9me3 and H3K9ac respectively. We hope our new results presented in figure 5 will shed light on the more direct implications of _Pf_MORC on heterochromatin and gene silencing.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Suggestions for improved or additional experiments, data or analyses.</p>
<p>• Why does MORC, which was used in the pull-down, seem to be only minimally enriched in the volcano plot, while a series of proteins (marked in red) and AP2 (highlighted in green) are enriched with log2 fold changes exceeding 15?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion. MORC was detected with the highest number of peptides (97 and 113) and spectra (1041 and 1177) confirming the efficiency of our pull-down. However, considering the relatively large size of the MORC protein (295kDa) and it weak detection in the control (5 and 7 peptides; 16 and 43 spectra), the Log2 FoldChange and Z-statistic after normalization are minimal compared to smaller proteins that were not identified in the control samples.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, can you explain why these proteins appear to be enriched at the same fold?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We can postulate that these proteins form a complex with a ratio of 1:1. Two of these three proteins are described to interact with MORC in several publications, supporting a strong interaction between them.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Variations in the interactome could result from the washing buffer's stringency.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the IP conditions could affect the detection of the interactome as well as the parasite stage used. As indicated below, the overlap with previous publications and the presence of AP2 TFs and chromatin remodelers strongly support our results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would be highly appropriate for the authors, similar to the co-submitted article (Maneesh Kumar Singh et al.), to present their mass spectrometry data in relation to previous purifications in Plasmodium (Bryant et al. 2020; Subudhi et al. 2023; Hillier et al. 2019) and also in Toxoplasma (Farhat et al. 2020). It would be good if authors could also put their results into perspective in light of the following pre-prints:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. In this revised manuscript, we compared our IP-MS data to previous published manuscripts. Key proteins including the AP2-P (PF3D7_1107800) and HDAC1 were indeed identified in several experiments validating our initial findings of the formation of large complexes with MORC. However, it’s important to highlight that the MORC protein was not used as the bait protein in previously published papers, and thus some discrepancies can be observed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Given the tendency of MORCs to form multiple complexes with AP2 factors, have you explored whether specific AP2s are conserved between Plasmodium and Toxoplasma, within the phylum?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> encodes for 27 putative AP2s, while <italic>T. gondii</italic> has over 60 AP2s, making direct comparison challenging. Some <italic>Plasmodium</italic> AP2s have multiple counterparts in <italic>T. gondii</italic> and typically conservation is limited to the AP2 binding domains. Attempts to identify sequence homology among AP2s and the regions of conservation have been performed (PMID: 30959972, PMID: 30959972, PMID: 16040597). Although this information would provide interesting insight, we believe exploring this topic at this time would diverge from our primary objectives. It would be more appropriate to address this in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Could this conservation be identified either through phylogenetic means or by using tools such as AlphaFold, especially considering not just the AP2 domains but also any existing ACDC domains?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although this may reveal important information regarding the association between MORC proteins and AP2 domains, we believe investigating the conservation between AP2 across apicomplexan parasites may prove too challenging and is beyond the scope of this work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Most of the genes are depicted without their immediate surroundings (Fig. 2d and Fig S2c, d). For instance, the promoter region of AP2g is not shown (Fig. 2d). It is therefore very challenging to determine the presence or absence of MORC upstream or downstream; considering that this factor, which can create DNA loop protrusions, might bind at a distance from the genes in question.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All gene coverage plots, including AP2-G, show 500 bp up- and downstream of the displayed gene. We have modified our figure legends to make sure that this information is provided.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Upon examining Figure S3, it is evident that the authors have indicated a decline in PfMORC expression, represented as percentages over two unique time frames. The methodology behind this quantification remains ambiguous. It's essential for the authors to specify whether normalization was done using a loading control. As a benchmark, Singh et al. (2021) in their Figure 4 transparently used GAPDH as a loading control and included an untreated sample in their western blot analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for bringing this to our attention. Our initial quantification was performed using ImageJ. To address the Reviewer’s comment, we have reperformed the experiment. Our quantitative analysis was performed through Bio-Rad ImageLab software using aldolase expression as a loading control (50% of the MORC loading).

<p>There's a striking observation that, despite significant degradation of PfMORC (as depicted in Figures S1 and S3), only the upper band in the western blot diminishes. This inconsistency needs addressing, as it can raise questions about the interpretation of the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer's comment. We experienced some challenges upon performing a Western Blot on such a large protein (295kDa). Our initial attempts required long exposure that may have highlighted non-specific signals of smaller proteins. To address the reviewer’s comment, we have performed the experiment one more time and made necessary changes to our WB protocol. Our new result better reflects the expected down regulation of _Pf_MORC. These changes have been incorporated to our manuscript and Fig S3.</p>

<p>Recommendations for improving the writing and presentation.</p>
<p>MORC KD quantification and consistency with previous findings (Figure S3): When comparing their results with those from another study (Singh et al. 2021), it's critical to ensure that the experimental conditions, especially the methodology for KD and the quantification of protein levels, are similar. If not, a direct comparison might be misleading.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the suggestions and have made efforts to redesign the MORC KD quantifications according to the reviewer’s recommendations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While the manuscript mentions the level of KD, it does not delve into the functional consequences of such a decrease in protein levels. It would be of interest to understand how this level of KD affects the parasite's biology, especially in the context of the paper's main findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have addressed this question by looking at the changes in chromatin structure in WT versus KD parasites upon atc removal. We have also validated this initial result by designing an additional ChIP-seq experiment against histone marks in WT versus KD parasites upon atc removal. Our findings showed a significant downregulation in H3K9me coverage in heterochromatin regions, specifically in genes associated with antigenic variation and invasion genes. These findings suggest that PfMORC regulates at least partially gene silencing and chromatin arrangements. The manuscript has been edited accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Concluding page 5, the authors present an interpretation of their findings that suggests a multi-faceted role of PfMORC in regulating stage-specific gene families, particularly the gametocyte-related genes and merozoite surface proteins. While the narrative they present is intriguing, several concerns arise:</p>
<p>Over-reliance on correlation: The authors draw a direct line between the levels of PfMORC binding and the function of these genes in the parasite's life cycle. However, a mere correlation between PfMORC binding and stage-specific gene activity does not necessarily imply causation. They would need to provide experimental evidence showing that manipulation of PfMORC levels directly impacts these genes' expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer's comment. We have however partially addressed this issue by comparing our ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and Hi-C experiments. We concluded that several of the transcriptional changes observed were due to an indirect effect of PfMORC KD and were most likely induced by a cell cycle arrest and partial collapse of the chromatin structure. The collapse of the heterochromatin structure was validated using our Hi-C experiment. To further address additional concerns the review’s had, we have included additional ChIP-seq experiments targeting histone marks to confirm our initial hypothesis. Result of this additional experiment has been incorporated in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>

<p>Ambiguity surrounding &quot;low levels&quot; and &quot;high levels&quot;: The terms &quot;low levels&quot; and &quot;high levels&quot; of PfMORC binding are qualitative and could be subject to interpretation. Without quantification or a clear benchmark, these descriptions remain vague.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewers that the terms &quot;low levels&quot; and &quot;high levels&quot; of PfMORC binding are qualitative and could be subject to interpretation. We have however quantified our change in DNA binding using normalized reads (RPKM). In trophozoite and schizont stages, most of the genes contain a mean of &lt;0.5 RPKM normalized reads per nucleotide of _Pf_MORC binding within their promoter region, whereas antigenic gene families such as <italic>var</italic> and <italic>rifin</italic> contain ~1.5 and 0.5 normalized reads, respectively (Fig. 2b). Similar results are also obtained for the gametocyte-specific transcription factor AP2-G  that contains levels of _Pf_MORC binding similar to what is observed in <italic>var</italic> genes (Fig. 2c and S2c, d).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Shift in Binding Sites: The observed minor switch in PfMORC binding sites from gene bodies to intergenic and promoter regions is mentioned, but without context on how these shifts impact gene expression or any comparative analysis with other proteins showing similar shifts. The claim that this shift implicates PfMORC as an &quot;insulator&quot; is a leap without direct evidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion. We  have compared our ChIP-seq with RNA seq results at different time points of the cell cycle and demonstrated that the shift observed has an effect in gene expression. We have edit the manuscript to clarify these results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overextension of PfMORC's Role: The authors suggest that PfMORC moves to the regulatory regions around the TSS to guide RNA Polymerase and transcription factors. This is a substantial claim and would require additional experiments to validate. Simply observing binding in a region is insufficient to assign a specific functional role, especially one as critical as guiding RNA Polymerase. Historically, the MORC family has been primarily linked with gene silencing across Apicomplexan, plants, and metazoans. On page 7, the authors noted a minimal overlap between the ChIP-seq and RNA-seq signals (Fig. 4e). They also acknowledged that the pronounced gene expression shifts at schizont stages result from a combination of direct and indirect impacts of PfMORC degradation, which could cause cell cycle arrest and potential heterochromatin disintegration, rather than just decreased PfMORC binding. Therefore, the authors should adjust their conclusions in the manuscript to more accurately represent the multifaceted functions of MORC in the parasite.</p>

<p>DISCUSSION:</p>
<p>The authors concluded that &quot;Using a combination of ChIP-seq, protein knock down, RNA-seq and Hi-C experiments, we have demonstrated that the MORC protein is essential for the tight regulation of gene expression through chromatin compaction, preventing access to gene promoters from TFs and the general transcriptional machinery in a stage specific manner.&quot;</p>
<p>Again, the assertion that MORC protein is essential for tight regulation of gene expression, based purely on correlational data (e.g., ChIP-seq showing binding doesn't prove functionality), assumes causality which might not be fully substantiated. The phrase &quot;preventing access to gene promoters from TFs and the general transcriptional machinery in a stage-specific manner&quot; needs also validation. Asserting that MORC is essential for this function might oversimplify the process and overlook other critical contributors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s comments and the conclusion has since been edited accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The discussion is quite poor. It would be pertinent to put MORC in perspective within the broader picture of regulatory mechanisms of chromatin state at telomeres and var genes. For instance, how do SIR2 and HDAC1 (associated with MORC) divide the task of deacetylation? Or the contribution of HP1 and other non-coding RNAs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion. However, in order to put MORC in perspective within a broader picture, we would need to measure changes in localization of several molecular components regulating heterochromatin in WT versus KD condition. This will require access to several molecular tools and specific antibodies that we do not currently have. We have addressed these issues in our discussion.</p>

<p>I recommend presenting Figure S2b as a panel within a primary figure. This change would offer readers a more quantitative understanding of the distinct differences between developmental stages.

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The study lacks a direct link between PfMORC's inferred function and the state of heterochromatin in the genome post-depletion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer's comment and have included additional ChIP-seq experiments to measure changes in histone marks in PfMORC depleted parasite line. We show a significant decrease in histone H3K9me3 marks in PfMORC KD condition.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Conducting ChIP-seq on well-known heterochromatin markers such as H3K9me3, HP1, or H3K36me2/3 could shed light on the consequences of PfMORC depletion on global heterochromatin and its boundaries.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>With no access to an anti-HP1 antibody with reasonable affinity, we have not been able to study the impact of MORC KD on HP1 but have successfully observed the impact on H3K9me3 marks. These results have been added to the revised manuscript in (Fig. 5).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors should conduct a more comprehensive analysis of PfMORC's genomic localization, comparing it to ApiAP2 binding (interacting proteins) and histone modifications. This would provide valuable insights.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have performed a more comprehensive genome wide analysis of MORC binding through ChIP-seq on WT and MORC-KD conditions. Our results show that _Pf_MORC localizes to heterochromatin with significant overlap with H3K9-trimethylation (H3K9me3) marks, at or near <italic>var</italic> gene regions. When downregulated, level of H3K9me3 was detected at a lower level, validating a possible role of _Pf_MORC in gene repression. Regarding the comparison with AP2 binding, our proteomics datasets have shown extensive MORC binding with several AP2 proteins.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) RNA-seq data reveals that only a few genes are affected after 24 hours of PfMORC depletion, with an equivalent number of up-regulated and down-regulated genes. The reasons behind down-regulation resulting from a heterochromatin marker depletion are not clearly established.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. At this stage (24 hours), _Pf_MORC depletion is limited and the effects at the transcriptional level are quite restricted. Furthermore, it is highly probable that down-regulated genes are most likely due to an indirect effect of a cell cycle arrest. We have edited the manuscript to address this comment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The relationship between this data and the partial depletion of PfMORC needs further discussion.</p>

<p>(4) The authors did not compare their ChIP-seq data with the genes found downregulated in the RNA-seq data. Examining the correlation between these datasets would enhance the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion. We have compared ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data and identified a very limited number of overlapping genes indicating that most of the changes observed in gene expression are in fact most likely indirect due to a cell cycle arrest and a collapse of the chromatin.
