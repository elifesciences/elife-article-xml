<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The genomes of close unicellular relatives of animals encode orthologs of many genes that regulate animal development. However, little is known about the function of such genes in unicellular organisms or the evolutionary process by which these genes came to function in multicellular development. The Hippo pathway, which regulates cell proliferation and tissue size in animals, is present in some of the closest unicellular relatives of animals, including the amoeboid organism <italic>Capsaspora owczarzaki</italic>. We previously showed that the <italic>Capsaspora</italic> ortholog of the Hippo pathway nuclear effector Yorkie/YAP/TAZ (coYki) regulates actin dynamics and the three-dimensional morphology of <italic>Capsaspora</italic> cell aggregates, but is dispensable for cell proliferation control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Phillips et al., 2022</xref>). However, the function of upstream Hippo pathway components, and whether and how they regulate coYki in <italic>Capsaspora</italic>, remained unknown. Here, we analyze the function of the upstream Hippo pathway kinases coHpo and coWts in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> by generating mutant lines for each gene. Loss of either kinase results in increased nuclear localization of coYki, indicating an ancient, premetazoan origin of this Hippo pathway regulatory mechanism. Strikingly, we find that loss of either kinase causes a contractile cell behavior and increased density of cell packing within <italic>Capsaspora</italic> aggregates. We further show that this increased cell density is not due to differences in proliferation, but rather actomyosin-dependent changes in the multicellular architecture of aggregates. Given its well-established role in cell density-regulated proliferation in animals, the increased density of cell packing in <italic>coHpo</italic> and <italic>coWts</italic> mutants suggests a shared and possibly ancient and conserved function of the Hippo pathway in cell density control. Together, these results implicate cytoskeletal regulation but not proliferation as an ancestral function of the Hippo pathway and uncover a novel role for Hippo signaling in regulating cell density in a proliferation-independent manner.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite the increasing recognition that the last unicellular ancestor of animals possessed many genetic components that mediate development in modern animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ros-Rocher et al., 2021</xref>), little is known about the function of such developmental regulators in the unicellular ancestor, and the process of how such genes came to function in these roles over evolutionary time is poorly understood. One example of a developmental pathway that is now known to be conserved in close unicellular relatives of animals is the Hippo pathway, which regulates tissue size in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zheng and Pan, 2019</xref>). The Hippo pathway consists of a kinase cascade in which the kinase Hippo/MST phosphorylates the kinase Warts/LATS, which in turn phosphorylates the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie/YAP/TAZ, resulting in inactivation though cytoplasmic sequestration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ma et al., 2019</xref>)). In the nucleus, Yorkie/YAP/TAZ forms a complex with the transcription factor Sd/TEAD, and this complex drives the expression of genes that promote proliferation and affect cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). The Hippo pathway thus serves to inhibit Yorkie/YAP/TAZ activity, and by this regulatory activity restricts tissue growth in development and homeostasis. In cultured cells, the Hippo pathway is known to be regulated by cell density in a process called contact inhibition, whereby Hippo signaling is low in sparse culture to allow cell proliferation but activated in confluent culture to arrest proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). Although the state of the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>) and epithelial cell architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) are known to regulate Hippo signaling, and many additional upstream regulatory components have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hamaratoglu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>), how exactly Hippo signaling is regulated to achieve appropriate tissue size during development or stop cell proliferation in confluent cultures remains incompletely understood. As Hippo pathway dysregulation underlies multiple human cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Zanconato et al., 2016</xref>), a more complete understanding of Hippo pathway regulation could guide the development of novel cancer therapeutics.</p>

<p>Although once thought to be present only in animals, the Hippo pathway is now known to be present in some of the closest unicellular relatives of animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Sebe-Pedros et al., 2012</xref>)). One such unicellular organism is <italic>Capsaspora owczarzaki</italic> from the clade Filasterea, the sister group to Choanozoa (a clade comprising animals and choanoflagellates) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Shalchian-Tabrizi et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Capsaspora</italic> is a motile amoeboid organism with a 5-micron-diameter cell body covered with F-actin-rich microvilli-like structures, and was initially identified as an apparent endosymbiont in the snail <italic>B. glabrata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Stibbs et al., 1979</xref>)</italic>. However, all other known filasterians are apparent free-living heterotrophs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hehenberger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Patterson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Tong, 1997</xref>), and whether <italic>Capsaspora</italic> is an obligate or facultative endosymbiont is not known. Physical or chemical signals can induce <italic>Capsaspora</italic> cells to aggregate into round, 3-dimensional multicellular structures that require calcium for cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ros-Rocher et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Sebe-Pedros et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Capsaspora</italic> is easily culturable in axenic medium, has a complete genome with chromosome-level assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Schultz et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Suga et al., 2013</xref>), and is genetically tractable owing to gene disruption and stable transgenic techniques that we have recently developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Phillips et al., 2022</xref>). Further, the <italic>Capsaspora</italic> genome contains many genes once thought specific to animals, such as cell-cell adhesion and ECM proteins (cadherins, integrins, and laminins) and developmental regulators (NF-κB, P53/63/73, Brachyury, and RUNX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Suga et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, along with other emerging holozoan research organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Booth and King, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kozyczkowska et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Olivetta and Dudin, 2023</xref>), <italic>Capsaspora</italic> is a valuable system for studying the function of such genes in unicellular organisms.</p>
<p>Previously, we have studied the role of the Hippo pathway in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> by generating a mutant of the single Yorkie/YAP/TAZ ortholog found in the genome (coYki) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Phillips et al., 2022</xref>). We found that coYki affects cytoskeletal dynamics, with coYki mutants showing constant ectopic blebbing at the cell cortex. Further, coYki affects the morphology of multicellular aggregates: whereas WT aggregates are spheroid, coYki mutant aggregates are flat and less circular than WT. Despite the well-characterized role of Yorkie/YAP/TAZ in promoting proliferation in animals, we saw no effect on cell proliferation in the coYki mutant, suggesting that regulation of proliferation by Yorkie/YAP/TAZ emerged after the last common ancestor of <italic>Capsaspora</italic> and animals. However, two important questions remain unanswered: 1) do the upstream components of the Hippo pathway regulate coYki, as they do in animals? 2) What effect does an increase of coYki activity have on <italic>Capsaspora</italic>?</p>
<p>In this study, we addressed these questions by generating homozygous mutant cell lines for the Hippo (coHpo) and Warts (coWts) kinases in <italic>Capsaspora</italic>. Loss of either kinase results in increased nuclear localization of coYki, showing that the regulatory activity of the Hippo kinase cascade is conserved. Loss of coHpo or coWts does not increase cell proliferation, consistent with our previous conclusion that the Hippo pathway does not significantly affect proliferation in <italic>Capsaspora</italic>. However, loss of either kinase results in a distinct cytoskeletal phenotype: cells display a contractile behavior in which an initially round cell will elongate on an axis, adhere to the substrate at two terminal adhesion sites connected by an F-actin fiber, and then undergo contraction, returning to a round morphology. Further, we find that loss of these kinases increases the density of cell packing within multicellular aggregates, and we present evidence that this cell packing phenotype involves actomyosin-mediated contractile forces. Transgenic expression of a coYki mutant predicted to be hyperactive results in phenotypes like those observed in the coHpo and coWts mutants, suggesting that these phenotypes are caused by increased coYki activity due to a lack of kinase activity. Together, these results support our previous conclusions that the Hippo pathway regulates cytoskeletal dynamics but not proliferation in <italic>Capsaspora</italic>. In light of its well-established role in cell density-regulated proliferation control in animals, we speculate that the Hippo pathway may represent an ancient mechanism of cell density control preceding the emergence of animal multicellularity.</p>

<title>The Hippo pathway kinases regulate the subcellular localization of coYki in <italic>Capsaspora</italic></title>
<p>Characterizing the function of the Hippo pathway in close unicellular relatives of animals may a) enhance our understanding of the evolutionary origins and ancestral function of this pathway and b) provide a relatively simple system to better understand how this biomedically significant pathway is regulated. To address these aims, we generated homozygous mutant cell lines for the single <italic>Capsaspora</italic> orthologs of the Hippo/MST and Warts/LATS kinases (coHpo and coWts, respectively.) For each gene, homologous recombination was used to replace the kinase domain of both WT alleles with selectable markers (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Phillips et al., 2022</xref>). Homozygous mutation of the kinases was verified by PCR and by sequencing the disrupted region of the genes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In animals, the Hippo kinase cascade regulates the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie/YAP/TAZ by phosphorylation-mediated cytoplasmic sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dong et al., 2007</xref>). To test if the Hippo kinase cascade similarly regulates the subcellular localization of the single YAP/TAZ/Yorkie orthologue in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> (coYki), we transiently co-transfected WT, <italic>coHpo-/-</italic>, and <italic>coWts-/-</italic> cells with the fluorescent fusion proteins mScarlet-coYki and Histone H2B-Venus, a marker of the nucleus. In WT cells, mScarlet-coYki was predominantly cytoplasmic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Phillips et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, the majority of <italic>coHpo-/-</italic> and <italic>coWts-/-</italic> cells showed nuclear levels of mScarlet-coYki greater than or equal to that seen in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Interestingly, we found that <italic>coWts-/-</italic> cells were significantly more likely to show nuclear mScarlet-coYki localization than <italic>coHpo-/-</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), which is consistent with Hpo/MST-independent activity of Wts/LATS previously reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these results show that the <italic>Capsaspora</italic> Hippo kinase cascade regulates coYki by cytoplasmic sequestration, indicating a premetazoan origin of this regulatory activity of the Hippo pathway.</p>

<title>The Hippo pathway kinases do not restrict cell proliferation in <italic>Capsaspora</italic></title>
<p>The Hippo pathway negatively regulates tissue size and cell proliferation by restricting the activity of the growth-promoting oncogene Yorkie/YAP/TAZ in animals. However, we have previously reported that <italic>coYki</italic> is genetically dispensable for cell proliferation in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Phillips et al., 2022</xref>). To further evaluate the role of proliferation control by the Hippo pathway in <italic>Capsaspora</italic>, we examined the requirement of <italic>coHpo</italic> and <italic>coWts</italic> in cell proliferation control under three distinct conditions: adherent growth while attached to a solid substrate, proliferation in shaking culture, and proliferation within multicellular aggregates. In adherent growth conditions, <italic>coWts</italic>-/- and <italic>coHpo</italic>-/- cells proliferated at similar rates as WT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In shaking culture, <italic>coHpo-/-</italic> cells proliferated at similar rates as WT cells, whereas <italic>coWts-/-</italic> cells proliferated slower than WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). As cells lacking a negative regulator of proliferation are expected to proliferate faster than WT cells, this result suggests that coWts is not a negative regulator of cell proliferation as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals, but instead is required for normal cell viability under some growth conditions. Finally, to examine cell proliferation within multicellular aggregates, we used EdU labeling, a marker of cells that have undergone S phase. The percentage of cells labeled by EdU in <italic>coHpo-/-</italic> and <italic>coWts-/-</italic> aggregates was not significantly different from WT aggregates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C and D</xref>), indicating that coHpo and coWts do not affect cell proliferation within multicellular aggregates. Together with our previous characterization of <italic>coYki</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Phillips et al., 2022</xref>), these results support the view that the Hippo pathway kinases coHpo and coWts do not restrict cell proliferation in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals.</p>

<title>The Hippo pathway kinases regulate cell morphology and actomyosin-dependent contractile behaviors in <italic>Capsaspora</italic></title>
<p>We have previously shown that, in contrast to WT <italic>Capsaspora</italic> cells with a round and relatively stable actin cortex, <italic>coYki-/-</italic> cells show aberrant, actin-depleted bleb-like protrusions at the cell cortex, implicating coYki in the control of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Phillips et al., 2022</xref>). To test whether the Hippo pathway kinases affect the same processes in <italic>Capsaspora,</italic> we examined the morphology of adherent <italic>coHpo-/-</italic> and <italic>coWts-/-</italic> cells. While most cells showed a round cell body morphology (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), a distinct elongated cell morphology was observed in a subset of <italic>coWts</italic> -/- or <italic>coHpo</italic> -/- cells, which was seen much less frequently in WT cells. Quantification of cellular aspect ratio in cell populations showed a non-gaussian distribution, with a distinct population of high aspect ratio cells in <italic>coHpo</italic> or <italic>coWts</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The presence of elongated cells was rescued by transgenic expression of coHpo or coWts in the respective mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A and B</xref>), demonstrating that the elongated cell phenotype was specifically due to the absence of these kinases.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="550562v1_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>To examine the dynamic properties of these elongated cells, we imaged <italic>coHpo -/-</italic> and <italic>coWts -/-</italic> cells by time-lapse microscopy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and Videos S1-S3). These elongated cells are highly dynamic. A previously round, motile cell starts extending along an axis, the direction of which does not necessarily correspond with the cell’s previous direction of movement. The cell then stops extending, remaining for approximately 20 seconds in its elongated form. Microvilli appear enriched at the poles of elongated cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, 2:00 timepoint), although it is not clear whether more microvilli are present at the poles, or whether microvilli at the poles are more adherent to the substrate and are thus more visible microscopically. After this elongated form, the cell then contracts: adhesion at one of the poles is apparently lost, leading to a rapid contractile movement toward the other pole and returning the cell to the initial round morphology. Together, these results suggest that <italic>Capsaspora</italic> cells can perform a dynamic contractile behavior that is regulated by the Hippo pathway kinases.</p>
<p>The actomyosin cytoskeletal network mediates amoeboid motion and cytokinesis in unicellular organisms and contractile processes such as muscle contraction in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brunet and Arendt, 2016</xref>). To examine the behavior of the actomyosin network in contractile <italic>Capsaspora</italic> cells, we stably expressed Lifeact-mScarlet, which labels F-actin in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Phillips et al., 2022</xref>). As contractile cells in the <italic>coHpo</italic> mutant background tended to show a more extreme elongated morphology than the <italic>coWts</italic> mutant, we focused on the <italic>coHpo</italic> mutant for further analysis. We have previously reported that adherent WT <italic>Capsaspora</italic> cells show F-actin-rich foci near the area of contact with the substrate. In motile cells, these foci do not move relative to the substrate, suggesting that they are points of adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Phillips et al., 2022</xref>). Similar F-actin-rich foci were observed at or near the polar ends of elongated <italic>coHpo -/-</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, blue arrowheads). In most elongated cells, an F-actin fiber running parallel to the axis of elongation was observed connecting the two polar foci (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, yellow arrow; Videos S4-S5). During the contractile process, the cell contracts towards one of the foci, which remains intact, while the other substrate-foci interaction is lost, and the cell resumes a round morphology.</p>

<p>Superficially, the actin fibers observed in elongated <italic>coHpo</italic> -/- cells resemble stress fibers, which are contractile cytoskeletal structures found in animal cells with functions in processes such as extracellular matrix remodeling and cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Tojkander et al., 2012</xref>). Contractility of stress fibers is generated by the motor protein myosin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chrzanowska-Wodnicka and Burridge, 1996</xref>). If myosin mediates the contractile behavior of <italic>coHpo -/-</italic> cells, then inhibition of myosin activity may slow or prevent the contraction of elongated cells, resulting in more cells with an elongated morphology in a population. To test this prediction, we treated cells with the myosin inhibitor blebbistatin and then examined the occurrence of elongated cell morphology. Blebbistatin treatment increased the occurrence of elongated cell morphology in <italic>coHpo -/-</italic> cell populations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Interestingly, despite the rarity of elongated cell morphology in WT cell populations, blebbistatin also resulted in greatly increased occurrence of this morphology in WT cell populations. (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B and C</xref>). These results suggest that the contractile behavior of <italic>Capsaspora</italic> cells is mediated by myosin activity.</p>

<title>The Hippo pathway kinases regulate the density of cell packing in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> aggregates via actomyosin-mediated contractility</title>
<p><italic>Capsaspora</italic> cells can aggregate into three-dimensional multicellular structures. We have previously identified a critical role for coYki in this process: whereas WT <italic>Capsaspora</italic> cells form round, spheroid aggregates, <italic>coYki-/-</italic> cells form asymmetrical and flattened aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Phillips et al., 2022</xref>). To test whether the Hippo pathway kinases regulate aggregate morphology, we induced aggregate formation and then measured the size and circularity of aggregates. <italic>coHpo -/-</italic> aggregates showed similar size and circularity as WT aggregates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A and B</xref>). However, <italic>coWts -/-</italic> aggregates, while similar in size to WT, showed reduced circularity. Whereas WT aggregates showed a round, smooth boundary, <italic>coWts -/-</italic> aggregate boundaries were rough and showed nonuniform protrusions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A and B</xref>). These results suggest that Hippo signaling through coWts can affect aggregate morphology, but inactivation of the upstream Hippo kinase alone is not sufficient to induce this effect.</p>

<p><italic>Capsaspora</italic> aggregates are composed of adherent cells that form connections primarily through microvilli-like protrusions on the cell surface. This can be visualized by mosaic aggregates consisting of cells expressing mScarlet, which labels the cell body, and cells expressing NMM-Venus, which labels the cell membrane and allows visualization of the microvilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Parra-Acero et al., 2018</xref>). In mosaic aggregates, contacts are visible between microvilli but not between cell bodies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), showing that microvilli-microvilli contacts, but not cell body to cell body contacts, are the primary mode of adhesion in aggregates.</p>
<p>While examining aggregate morphology by, we noticed that <italic>coHpo -/-</italic> aggregates appeared more opaque than WT, suggesting that the Hippo pathway kinases may affect the internal structure of aggregates. To investigate this further, we stably expressed mScarlet in WT, <italic>coHpo -/-</italic>, <italic>coWts</italic> -/-, and <italic>coYki -/-</italic> cells and then used optical sectioning to examine aggregate inner structure. This analysis revealed that cells within <italic>coHpo -/-</italic> or <italic>coWts -/-</italic> aggregates appeared more tightly packed than WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). To quantify this effect, we measured the number of cells per unit area in optical sections of aggregates. Whereas the number of cells per unit area in <italic>coYki -/-</italic> aggregates was not significantly different from WT, the number of cells per area in <italic>coHpo -/-</italic> and <italic>coWts -/-</italic> was significantly increased relative to WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). These results indicate that loss of the Hippo pathway kinases increases cell packing within <italic>Capsaspora</italic> aggregates.</p>
<p>Given that <italic>coHpo</italic> and <italic>coWts</italic> regulate a contractile behavior in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> cells, a plausible explanation for the increased cell packing within <italic>coHpo -/-</italic> and <italic>coWts -/-</italic> aggregates is that an increase in intercellular contractile interactions pulls cells closer and therefore leads to increased cell density in mutant aggregates. To test whether actomyosin-mediated contractile forces affect cell packing within aggregates, we treated WT and <italic>coHpo -/-</italic> aggregates with the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin or the actin-depolymerizing drug latrunculin B (LatB). For both WT and <italic>coHpo-/-</italic> aggregates, treatment with either blebbistatin or LatB decreased cell density within aggregates, as reflected by a reduction in the number of cells per unit area (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-D</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the Hippo pathway kinases regulate the density of cell packing in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> aggregates via actomyosin-mediated contractility .</p>

<p><italic>coYki</italic> affects both the cytoskeletal dynamics of <italic>Capsaspora</italic> cells and the shape of multicellular aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Phillips et al., 2022</xref>). Given these previous results and the fact that Yorkie/YAP/TAZ is inhibited by the Hippo pathway kinases in other organisms, it is plausible that the phenotypes observed in the <italic>coHpo</italic> and <italic>coWts</italic> mutants are mediated by <italic>coYki.</italic> Since techniques are currently unavailable to create double mutants in <italic>Capsaspora</italic>, we could not test this possibility through classic genetic epistasis. As an alternative approach, we asked whether ectopic activation of <italic>coYki</italic> can phenocopy the loss of <italic>coHpo</italic> or <italic>coWts</italic>, by transgenically expressing a coYki mutant in which the four predicted Wts/LATS phosphorylation sites are mutated to non-phosphorylatable Alanine (coYki 4SA). coYki 4SA shows increased nuclear localization compared to the wild-type coYki protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Phillips et al., 2022</xref>), and thus is predicted to be hyperactive. As observed in <italic>coHpo</italic> and <italic>coWts</italic> mutants, stable transgenic expression of coYki 4SA resulted in increased cell packing of <italic>Capsaspora</italic> aggregates (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> A and B), as well as an elongated cell morphology in adherent cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> C and D). These results suggest that the phenotypes observed in <italic>coHpo</italic> and <italic>coWts</italic> mutants are due to coYki activation resulting from a loss of upstream kinase signaling.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The evolutionary process by which the signaling pathways that regulate animal development came to function in these roles remains unclear. Apart from shedding light on the origin of animals, knowledge about this process could provide a deeper understanding of these signaling pathways, which play key roles in human health and disease. Although we cannot study the ancestral unicellular organisms that gave rise to animals, studying modern close unicellular relatives of animals can guide our understanding of what these organisms may have been like, and how conserved signaling pathways may have functioned in these unicellular ancestors. Our previous characterization of the Yorkie/YAP/TAZ ortholog coYki in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> showed that coYki affects actin dynamics and the shape of multicellular aggregates in this close unicellular relative of animals. However, we saw no effect on proliferation in the coYki mutant, suggesting that regulation of proliferation by Yorkie/YAP/TAZ may have evolved later in the lineage leading to animals. In this report, we build on our previous study by assessing the function of the upstream kinases coHpo and coWts in <italic>Capsaspora</italic>. We find that the mechanism of Yorkie/YAP/TAZ regulation (specifically, cytoplasmic sequestration by upstream kinase activity) is conserved in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> and animals, indicating an ancient origin of this signaling machinery. These findings support and extend our previous study uncovering a role for Hippo signaling in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics but not cell proliferation. Together, our studies suggest that the ancestral function of the Hippo pathway was cytoskeletal regulation, and that subsequently the pathway was co-opted to regulate cell proliferation and tissue size in animals.</p>
<p>In this report, we describe a contractile cell behavior observed in <italic>coHpo</italic> and <italic>coWts</italic> mutants. In this process, the cell transitions from a round morphology to an elongated spindle shape. The cell will remain in the spindle shape for approximately 20 seconds and then contract towards one pole. We interpret this as a process in which cells extend and then adhere to the substrate at the two ends of the spindle, contractile forces within the cell increase, and adhesion at one of the poles is subsequently lost, leading to contraction towards the other pole. Visualization of actin in live cells is consistent with this model: we observed actin-rich foci at the adhesive sites at the poles of spindle-shaped cells, and an actin filament connecting these foci, which may serve as a tension-generating structure. The cytoskeletal structures that we observe resemble adhesive/contractile structures in mammalian cells such as podosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Linder et al., 2023</xref>), focal adhesions (Fierro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Morales et al., 2022</xref>), and stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Tojkander et al., 2012</xref>). As <italic>Capsaspora</italic> encodes orthologs of some proteins known to label these structures, future colocalization experiments may reveal the degree of conservation between such subcellular structures in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> and animals.</p>
<p>The function of these contractile cells is presently unclear. While we observed the contractile behavior on glass surface, which is likely non-physiological, we speculate that such contraction exerted on a pliable surface may remodel a cell’s extracellular environment to provide certain fitness benefits. Intriguingly, the elongated, spindle morphology was reported to be common (nearly 50 percent of cells) after isolation of <italic>Capsaspora</italic> cells from the <italic>B. glabrata</italic> snail host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Stibbs et al., 1979</xref>), suggesting that environmental factors from the snail host may affect this elongated morphology and potentially Hippo pathway signaling. We further speculate that increased contractility within multicellular aggregates may serve to pull the neighboring cells closer to each other, which may contribute to the increased packing in the of <italic>coHpo</italic> or <italic>coWts</italic> mutant aggregates.</p>
<p>We show that the elongated cell morphology visible in <italic>coHpo</italic> and <italic>coWts</italic> mutants becomes more common after treatment with blebbistatin, indicating a role for myosin II in the contraction of this elongated cell state. One interpretation of the increase in elongated cells in the <italic>coHpo</italic> and <italic>coWts</italic> mutants, therefore, is that myosin activity is reduced. However, we also see that blebbistatin treatment reduces the packing of cells within multicellular groups, whereas loss of <italic>coHpo</italic> or <italic>coWts</italic> causes an increase in cell packing. Thus the specific role of myosin activity in the phenotypes observed in Hippo pathway mutants in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> remains unclear. One possibility is that the initial process of cell elongation is unrelated to myosin, and it is this process that is enhanced in <italic>coHpo</italic> and <italic>coWts</italic> mutants. Although techniques to visualize and quantify myosin activity in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> have not been developed, future work in this regard could elucidate the relationship between myosin activity and Hippo signaling in <italic>Capsaspora</italic>.</p>
<p>Previous work has examined the structure of <italic>Capsaspora</italic> aggregates by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Sebe-Pedros et al., 2013</xref>). In this report we have furthered our understanding of aggregate structure by providing evidence that a) cells within aggregates appear to contact their neighbors largely by interactions between microvilli; and b) Hippo pathway activity affects the packing of cells within these aggregates. In animals, the predominant form of multicellular structure is epithelia, in which cells with apical-basal polarity form lateral contacts at adherens junctions, septate junctions, tight junctions, and desmosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abedin and King, 2010</xref>). However, microvilli/filopodial adhesion plays important roles in dorsal closure in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Jacinto et al., 2000</xref>), early embryo compaction in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fierro-Gonzalez et al., 2013</xref>), and other developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brunet and Booth, 2023</xref>). Further, inter-microvillar contacts are the apparent means of adherence in the choanoflagellate <italic>C. flexa,</italic> another close unicellular relative of animals, that can exist in a sheet-like morphology with a remarkable actomyosin-dependent inverting activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brunet et al., 2019</xref>). Thus microvilli-mediated adhesion may be an ancient and conserved means of multicellularity that preceded the formation of epithelia.</p>
<p>In cultured mammalian cells, Hippo signaling regulates contact inhibition, a phenomenon in which proliferation is arrested upon cell confluency to achieve a proper cell density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aragona et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, while Hippo signaling does not regulate cell proliferation in <italic>Capsaspora</italic>, loss of Hippo pathway kinases or increase in coYki activity increases the density of cell packing within <italic>Capsaspora</italic> aggregates. Thus, despite the distinct routes of achieving proper cell density (cell proliferation vs. cell aggregation), the Hippo pathway appears to restrict cell density in both animals and <italic>Capsaspora</italic>. We speculate that the Hippo pathway may represent an ancient mechanism of cell density control preceding the emergence of animal multicellularity. Significantly, this model suggests that the signals that regulate the Hippo pathway in animals and <italic>Capsaspora</italic> may be conserved, and therefore studying <italic>Capsaspora</italic> could provide important insights into the regulation of this biomedically significant pathway.</p>

<p>For a list of plasmids and oligonucleotides generated for this study, see Key Resources Table. For a list of synthesized DNA sequences used in this study, see Supplemental Data S1. For transgenic expression of <italic>Capsaspora</italic> genes, we synthesized genes coding for the appropriate <italic>Capsaspora</italic> protein but with synonymous codon changes throughout the DNA sequence. This was done to reduce DNA sequence homology in order to prevent homologous recombination of the transgene with the endogenous <italic>Capsaspora</italic> alleles during plasmid integration into the genome, as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Phillips et al., 2022</xref>). To construct a plasmid for transgenic expression of coHpo in <italic>Capsaspora</italic> cells (pJP122), we synthesized a transgene encoding the coHpo protein (sJP201). There are three predicted isoforms of the coHpo sequence, but only one of these encodes the SARAH domain, which is important for Hippo kinase activity in Hippo pathway signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Scheel and Hofmann, 2003</xref>). We therefore used the isoform sequence encoding the SARAH domain to design our transgene. The coHpo transgene was cloned into a KpnI and AflII digest of pJP103 (Addgene #176481) using Gibson assembly, generating a vector encoding the coHpo transgene and hygromycin B resistance. Similarly, a coWts transgene was synthesized (sJP202) and cloned into a KpnI and AflII digest of pJP103 by Gibson assembly, generating a vector encoding a coWts transgene and hygromycin B resistance (pJP125.)</p>
<p>To generate a plasmid to stably express N-myristoylation motif (NMM)-Venus (pJP145), a marker of the plasma membrane and microvilli in <italic>Capsaspora</italic>, we first constructed a vector expressing both Venus and hygromycin B resistance (pJP115) by PCR-amplifying the Venus gene from pJP114 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Phillips et al., 2022</xref>) and cloning it by Gibson assembly into a KpnI and AflII digest of pJP103 (Addgene #176481), which contains a hygromycin B resistance cassette. We then synthesized the NMM motif (sJP203) following the sequence from the pONSY-coNMM:mCherry vector (Addgene #111878, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Parra-Acero et al., 2018</xref>)) and cloned this DNA fragment into a KpnI digest of pJP115 using Gibson assembly.</p>

<p>To measure the aspect ratio of cells, the ImageJ freehand selection tool was used to manually trace the border of imaged cells, and the Measure function was used to calculate the cellular aspect ratio. To quantify cell packing within aggregates expressing mScarlet, a z-stack of optical sections was obtained by confocal microscopy. To measure cells within the aggregate as opposed to cells at the edge of the aggregate, an optical section 14 microns deep into the aggregate was used for measurement. A 40 micron<sup>2</sup> square was drawn in the center of the optical section of the aggregate and the number of cells in the square was counted.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This Research Advance is an extension of this group's prior paper published in 2022 on the conserved roles of the Hippo pathway effector Yorkie in C. owczarzaki (PMID: 35659869). This species is an amoeba that holds an important phylogenetic position as a close relative of multicellular animals. The prior study used genome editing to delete the C. owczarzaki Yki (termed coYki) and found that Yki is not required for proliferation but instead regulates cell contractility and cell aggregation. In the current study, the authors wanted to address whether Hippo pathway kinases - coHippo (coHpo) and coWarts (coWts) - regulate coYki and whether they are dispensable for proliferation but instead regulate cell contractility and cell aggregation. They used genome editing to delete coHpo and coWts singly in C. owczarzaki. Both mutant strains had increased nuclear location of transfected coYki (tagged with Scarlet), suggesting that Hippo kinase pathway regulation of Yki is conserved in this organism. Neither kinase is required for proliferation. Either kinase mutant strain had a significantly increased percentage of cells that were elongated, which was relatively rare in a control population. The incident of elongation could be enhanced in both kinase-mutant and in control cells when myosin inhibitors were added to the media. coHpo and coWts-mutant aggregates were more tightly packed than control cell aggregates, which they hypothesize is due to the increased contractility seen in kinase-mutant cells. They could reduce the density of packing in kinase-mutant aggregates when they treated the cells with myosin or F-actin inhibitors. To test whether the effects observed in kinase-mutant strains were due to increased Yki activation, they generated a coYki with four S to A substitutions (termed coYki4SA), which should produce a dominant-active Yki impervious to phosphorylation and hence inactivation by Hippo kinases. Control C. owczarzaki cells transfected with coYki4SA had increased cell density in aggregates and elongation in adherent cells. These results support their conclusions that coHpo and coWts regulate cell contractility and cell packing through coYki.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The major strengths of the paper include high quality data, robust analyses of the data, and a well-written manuscript. The combination of genome editing in C. owczarzaki, transfection of C. owczarzaki, and time-lapse movies of adherent cells generally support the conclusions (1) that control of cell density is an ancient function of the Hippo pathway; (2) that Hippo pathway control of cytoskeletal properties and contractile behavior underlie its regulation of cell density, and (3) that Hippo kinase control of Yki localization is likely an ancient function of the pathway.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are only minor weaknesses. (1) Fig. 3C needs the &quot;still&quot; for the movie of control C. owczarzaki (in Movie S1). (2) The elongated cell shape is seen infrequently in control cells, and I wonder whether these events are transient inactivation of coHpo or coWts in these cells. Perhaps the authors could comment on this in the discussion. (3) Does C. owczarzaki normally aggregate or this is a lab-specific phenotype? For example, the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum forms aggregates during its life cycle. Could some additional information about C. owczarzaki be added to the introduction?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The study builds on the work of the Pan group and others which has described the existence of core Hippo pathway proteins in Capsaspora and, more recently, described a role for a Yorkie/YAP homologue in regulation of cell shape and actin, as opposed to proliferation. For this recent study, they developed genetic techniques to mutate genes in Capsaspora, and this technology has been leveraged again in this study. Using loss of genetic approaches, the authors find that loss of either of the two major kinases in the Hippo pathway core kinase cassette (Warts and Hippo) impact Capsaspora morphology and the actin cytoskeleton. This is phenocopied by overexpression of Capsaspora Yorkie/YAP. In addition, Capsaspora Yorkie/YAP accumulates in the nucleus of organisms lacking Warts or Hippo, as it does in metazoans. While these experiments are not overly surprising, they still provide important verification that core Hippo signaling events are conserved in Capsaspora.</p>
<p>Subsequently, they show that Capsaspora lacking Warts or Hippo do not overproliferate, which contrasts with many studies in animals, particularly in epithelial tissues where loss of Warts or Hippo often causes overproliferation. Rather, the authors show that Capsaspora Warts and Hippo regulate cell morphology and actomyosin-dependent contractile behaviour. They speculate from these findings that Hippo signalling could regulate the density of Capsaspora when they grow in aggregates and draw parallels to the known role of the Hippo pathway in contact inhibition of mammalian cells grown in culture.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Together with their 2022 paper, this study paints an emerging picture that the ancestral function of the Hippo pathway is to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, not proliferation, which is a significant finding. This also suggests that the ability to control proliferation was something that the Hippo pathway was re-purposed to do at some stage during the evolution of metazoans. These findings are important for the Hippo field, and our understanding of cellular signalling and evolution more broadly.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Further biochemical and genetic experiments would allow the authors to more convincingly prove that core features of Hippo signalling are conserved in Capsaspora - e.g., that Capsaspora Hippo/MST activates Warts/LATS by phosphorylation and Warts/LATS represses Yorkie/YAP by phosphorylation hey serine residues. Additional genetic studies would also allow one to determine whether Capsaspora Yki/YAP controls actomyosin contractility by transcription (with the Scalloped/TEAD homologue) and/or by non-transcriptional mechanisms, as have been reported for Yki in Drosophila. Higher resolution imaging approaches such as electron microscopy would likely give further mechanistic insights into how Hpo, Wts and Yki modulate actomyosin contractility in Capsaspora.</p>

<p>The authors present in this study the characterization of two mutant lines of the filasterean Capsaspora owczarzaki, a unicellular holozoan with a key phylogenetic position to understand multicellular development in animals. The present study is built on a previous work from the same research group, on the mutant of the orthologue of the Yorki gene in C. owczarzaki. By knocking out the two upstream kinases of the same pathway, coHpo-/- and coWts-/-, in single cell and aggregates of C. owkzarzaki, they now have mutated the entire pathway and in different cellular contexts.</p>
<p>The authors obtain results in the same direction as the previous work, demonstrating that the Hippo pathway of the unicellular holozoan C. owczarzaki, is not involved in the control of cell proliferation but is related with cytoskeletal dynamics through the actin-myosin mechanism.</p>
<p>The work carried out in this study is technically precise at all levels, molecular, cellular and microscopy. The reviewer here acknowledges how difficult is to work and develop tools and mutant lines in a non-model organism and therefore congratulates the authors in their efforts. The authors have done excellent work in this sense and all data presented seems to be solid.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some of the observations, in my opinion, should be further investigated before taking the conclusion that the Hippo pathway controls cell density and a contractile behavior in the C. owczarzaki. On the hand the authors claim as main conclusions what they have partially already claimed in the previous work (Phillips et al. eLife 2022;0:e77598).</p>
