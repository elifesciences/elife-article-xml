<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Membrane potential plays a crucial role in various cellular functions. However, existing techniques for measuring membrane potential are often invasive or have limited recording depth. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers noninvasive imaging with desirable spatial resolution over large areas. This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing MRI to detect membrane potential changes by measuring magnetic resonance parameters while manipulating membrane potential in cultured cells and <italic>in vivo</italic> rat models. Our findings reveal that depolarization (or hyperpolarization) of the membrane potential increases (or decreases) the <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> relaxation time, while the ratio of bound to free water proton shows the opposite trend. These findings also suggest a pioneering approach to noninvasively detect changes in membrane potential using MRI.</p></abstract>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Membrane potential is a fundamental property of all living cells, influencing crucial cell functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> such as neuronal and myocyte excitability, volume control, cell proliferation, and secretion. In the fields of neuroscience, membrane potential is of significant importance, as neural activities arise from the dynamic propagation of this electric potential. From a clinical perspective, deviations from normal membrane potential levels contribute to various diseases, including seizures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, arrhythmia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, and hypoglycemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Given its scientific and clinical importance, effective methods to detect changes in membrane potential have long been sought.</p>
<p>The intracellular recording technique using sharp glass electrodes is a commonly used method to detect changes in membrane potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. It provides real-time absolute recordings of membrane potential. Optical imaging is another major approach to detect changes in membrane potential. Voltage-sensitive dyes enable voltage imaging at the cellular level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Fluorescent calcium indicators detect calcium transients associated with neuronal activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Label-free optical imaging techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> utilize various contrast mechanisms such as cell membrane deformation, which are directly coupled with changes in membrane potential. Despite their efficacy, these methods have limitations when applied to intact biological systems due to their invasive nature, requiring procedures such as craniotomy.</p>
<p>As noninvasive techniques for directly or indirectly detecting brain activation <italic>in vivo</italic>, several imaging modalities have been developed, including electroencephalography (EEG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, magnetoencephalography (MEG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. EEG and MEG detect electric potentials on the scalp and extracranial magnetic fields, respectively, which are directly induced by neuronal activity in the brain. Although these techniques are noninvasive and provide excellent temporal resolution of milliseconds or less, they are constrained by shallow imaging depth and spatial localization challenges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In contrast, MRI enables noninvasive imaging with good spatial resolution of millimeters over a large brain volume, making it an appropriate tool for <italic>in vivo</italic> functional brain imaging. To date, the mainstream of functional MRI (fMRI) utilizes hemodynamic responses driven by brain activation, such as the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, while the BOLD contrast mechanism reflects dynamic changes in neuronal activity through neurovascular coupling, it provides inherently indirect and relatively slow, hemodynamic-responsive information of brain function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. On the other hand, many studies have attempted to explore the possibility of using MRI to directly detect neuronal activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. These studies utilized neuronal current-dependent signal phase shifts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and magnitude decay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, the Lorentz effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, high temporal resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, ghost artifacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, or cell swelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, while concerns about sensitivity exist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the possibility of using MRI to detect changes in membrane potential. We explored the dependence of <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> relaxation time and magnetization transfer (MT) on membrane potential changes, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo. In vitro</italic> experiments utilized two homogeneous and electrically non-active cells, i.e., neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) and leukemia (Jurkat) cell lines, providing a controlled environment free from hemodynamic effects. This aided in accurately evaluating changes in MR parameters with membrane potential. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments, conducted on a rat model with a craniotomy-exposed cortex, aimed to reproduce the <italic>in vitro</italic> findings.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> changes in MR parameters induced by membrane potential</title>
<p>A non-excitable neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, was selected to investigate the relationship between MR parameters and membrane potential. After culturing SH-SY5Y cells, they were suspended in extracellular media with various potassium ion concentrations ([K<sup>+</sup>]). As the control condition, [K<sup>+</sup>] = 4.2 mM was selected. For depolarization conditions, [K<sup>+</sup>] = 20, 40, and 80 mM were used. For hyperpolarization conditions, [K<sup>+</sup>] = 0.2 and 1 mM were used. The suspended cells were concentrated with centrifugation in an acrylic container and scanned in a 9.4 T preclinical MRI system to measure <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> and MT parameters such as pool size ratio (PSR) and magnetization transfer rate (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>mf</italic></sub>) under each condition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The PSR value represents the ratio of hydrogen protons in macromolecules and free water, and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>mf</italic></sub> represents the magnetization transfer rate of hydrogen protons from macromolecules to free water. In addition, the membrane potential of SH-SY5Y cells in each condition was separately measured via patch clamp recording.</p>

<p>Subsequent post-hoc analyses compared each experimental condition to the control using Dunnettâs test to account for multiple comparisons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). During depolarization induced by the highest [K<sup>+</sup>] (80 mM, Î<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = 30.0 mV), changes in MR parameters were observed as a 20.0% increase in <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> (Î<italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> = 10.1 ms, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and a 12.9% decrease in PSR (ÎPSR = â0.00476, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Conversely, during hyperpolarization induced by the lowest [K<sup>+</sup>] (0.2 mM, Î<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> = â5.33 mV), <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> decreased by 4.40% (Î<italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> = â2.21 ms, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and PSR increased by 6.28% (ÎPSR = 0.00231, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005). However, changes in <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>mf</italic></sub> were not significant across all conditions (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). These findings from <italic>in vitro</italic> SH-SY5Y cell experiments suggest that MR parameters, such as <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> and PSR, exhibit sufficient sensitivity to detect alterations in membrane potential, both depolarization and hyperpolarization.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Using a K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker</title>
<p>In this experiment, we investigated whether depolarization induced by altering potassium permeability with barium ions (Ba<sup>2+</sup>) would affect MR parameters similarly to depolarization induced by varying [K<sup>+</sup>], thereby further validating our findings. For this purpose, we administered barium ions (Ba<sup>2+</sup>) at a concentration of 10 mM to induce depolarization. Ba<sup>2+</sup> was chosen because it inhibits several types of two-pore-domain potassium channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, which predominantly regulate the resting membrane potential. Previous studies have confirmed that Ba<sup>2+</sup> depolarizes the membrane potential in SH-SY5Y and Jurkat cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The Ba<sup>2+</sup>-induced depolarization condition was compared with K<sup>+</sup>-induced depolarization and hyperpolarization conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). To compare the effects of [Ba<sup>2+</sup>] and [K<sup>+</sup>] on MR parameters, a linear mixed-effect model was utilized. This model included MR parameters as dependent variables, Î<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and its interaction with a group variable (indicating whether Î<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> was induced by [Ba<sup>2+</sup>] or [K<sup>+</sup>]) as fixed effects, and cell batch as a random effect. This analysis revealed no significant interactions for all MR parameters assessed (<italic>p</italic> = 0.182 for <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.788 for PSR, and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0890 for <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>mf</italic></sub>). These findings suggest that changes in <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> and PSR by membrane potential do not depend on the specific method of altering the membrane potential, whether by varying [K<sup>+</sup>] or applying [Ba<sup>2+</sup>]. This implies that if the changes in MR parameters observed with varying [K<sup>+</sup>] were not primarily due to membrane potential but were due to other K<sup>+</sup>-related factors, then experiments using [Ba<sup>2+</sup>] would not result in similar changes.</p>

<title>Using another cell type</title>
<p>To investigate whether changes in MR parameters in response to membrane potential differ across cell types, we assessed another cell line, Jurkat, under the same experimental conditions applied to SH-SY5Y cells. These conditions included a control condition at [K<sup>+</sup>] = 4.2 mM; hyperpolarization conditions at [K<sup>+</sup>] = 0.2 and 1 mM; depolarization conditions at [K<sup>+</sup>] = 20, 40, and 80 mM; and a Ba<sup>2+</sup>-induced depolarization condition at 10 mM.</p>
<p>Each experimental condition was compared to the control using Dunnettâs test to account for multiple comparisons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). As observed with SH-SY5Y cells, Jurkat cells showed significant positive changes in <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> and negative changes in PSR during depolarization. For example, at [K<sup>+</sup>] = 80 mM, <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> increased by 16.9% (Î<italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> = 9.26 ms, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), PSR decreased by 21.9% (ÎPSR = â0.00347, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). In contrast, during hyperpolarization at the lowest [K<sup>+</sup>] = 0.2 mM, <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> decreased by 18.1% (Î<italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> = â9.93 ms, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), whereas PSR increased by 17.6% (ÎPSR = 0.00280, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The depolarization induced by [Ba<sup>2+</sup>] = 10 mM resulted in a similar pattern, with <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> increasing by 11.5% (Î<italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> = 6.3 ms, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005), although the decrease in PSR was not significant (ÎPSR = â0.00212, <italic>p</italic> = 0.211). Changes in <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>mf</italic></sub> remained non-significant across all conditions (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). In summary, these findings indicate that the detectability of membrane potential changes by MR parameters like <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> and PSR does not appear specific to cell type, although the magnitude of these changes varies between different cell types.</p>

<p>The dependence of <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> values on membrane potential, observed in the aforementioned SH-SY5Y and Jurkat cell studies, was further explored in an <italic>in vivo</italic> rat model to validate these findings under physiological conditions. As depicted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, a craniotomy was performed to expose a 3-mm-diameter region of the rat cerebral cortex, followed by perfusion with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) to modulate the membrane potential. Hemodynamic responses were pharmacologically suppressed. MRI scans were performed using a 7 T preclinical MRI system to measure <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> in the exposed cortical area. A total of seven rats were used in the experiment that involved modulation of [K<sup>+</sup>]. The experimental protocol included sequential application of four conditions, each lasting 12 minutes: a baseline condition at [K<sup>+</sup>] = 3 mM, a depolarization condition at [K<sup>+</sup>] = 40 mM, further depolarization at [K<sup>+</sup>] = 80 mM, followed by a recovery condition using baseline aCSF. The recovery condition was applied to two of the seven rats. To distinguish the effect of aCSF perfusion on <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> from the effect of changes in membrane potential, a control experiment was also conducted using only baseline aCSF for the entire duration (48 minutes) with another group of five rats.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that MR parameters, specifically <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> relaxation time and pool size ratio (PSR), can detect changes in membrane potential. To the authorsâ knowledge, this is the first report that changes in membrane potential can be detected through MRI, which has the advantage of noninvasively acquiring signals over a large area with good spatial resolution. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with cultured cells were designed to exclude physiological factors such as hemodynamic responses and respiration. We observed that depolarization increases <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> and decreases PSR, while hyperpolarization has the opposite effect. <italic>In vivo</italic>, we pharmacologically suppressed hemodynamic responses to minimize their impact on <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> measurements. The trend of <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> dependence on membrane potential <italic>in vivo</italic> was consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> findings. However, the magnitude of <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> changes in rat cortex was approximately one-ninth of that observed in SH-SY5Y cells <italic>in vitro</italic> at [K<sup>+</sup>] = 80 mM.</p>
<p>Several factors may contribute to discrepancies between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> results. For instance, the actual extracellular [K<sup>+</sup>] experienced by cells in the rat cortex may be lower than that of the perfused aCSF due to diffusion-limiting barriers such as the leptomeninges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, even after the removal of the dura mater. Additionally, removal of excessive K<sup>+</sup> by clearing mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> may further reduce the [K<sup>+</sup>] experienced by the cells. Partial volume effects and cell type differences may also contribute to the discrepancy.</p>
<p>From a biophysical perspective, changes in <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> and PSR due to changes in membrane potential may be attributed to changes in cell volume, hydration water, and bulk water. These factors have also been suggested as potential mechanisms underlying diffusion fMRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Here, hydration water is known to have a significantly shorter <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> than bulk water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, and depolarization or hyperpolarization is known to be accompanied by cell swelling or shrinking, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. To be more specific, according to the definition of PSR as the ratio of bound to free water protons, the observed decrease in PSR upon depolarization indicates that the amount of bulk water with much longer <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> becomes relatively greater in the voxel than hydration water with much shorter <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>, which can lead to an overall increase in <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>. It could be hypothesized that <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> would behave similarly to <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> under membrane potential changes. For reference, we also conducted <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> measurements (Supplementary Fig. S2â4), demonstrating that <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> trends in a manner similar to <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> in response to membrane potential changes, while it is 3.5 times less sensitive than <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Several challenges and considerations were addressed in this study. First, maintaining the desired environment (37Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) for <italic>in vitro</italic> cells during MRI scans is challenging. In addition, intracellular accumulation of Ba<sup>2+</sup> in the Ba<sup>2+</sup>-induced depolarization experiment may affect cellular integrity. In this study, high cell viability (&gt; 97.6%) was confirmed using cell viability assays under experimental conditions (Supplementary Fig. S5). Second, differences in <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> value among the extracellular media may bias <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> measurements due to the partial volume effect. However, in this study, the differences in <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> among the extracellular media were found to be negligible compared to the observed <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> changes (Supplementary Fig. S6). Third, while our findings show that changes in membrane potential can affect MR parameters, it is important to note that these changes do not measure the membrane potential itself. Fourth, other factors such as pH, energy depletion, or extracellular osmolarity may affect MR parameters by altering cell volume. To minimize the effects of these other contributors, we matched osmolarity across all conditions, provided sufficient glucose to prevent energy depletion, and regulated pH levels by buffering with HEPES. Additionally, to mitigate possible changes in intra/extracellular volume fraction changes caused by cell movements, potentially due to agitation, we centrifuged the cells and imaged the bottom portion of the cell pellet, where cell movement was restricted due to close packing. Finally, our experimental paradigm was based on clamping the membrane potential at a specific level, thus measuring changes in <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> and PSR during static depolarization or hyperpolarization rather than dynamic changes such as those seen during action potentials. Future research could explore temporally varying membrane potential to evaluate the dynamic correlation between membrane potential and MR parameters with high temporal resolution MRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In summary, our study demonstrates that MR parameters such as <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> relaxation time can reflect changes in membrane potential both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. This finding proposes a pioneering approach for noninvasively detecting changes in membrane potential using MRI.</p>

<p>Two human cell lines were utilized for the experiments: SH-SY5Y, an immortalized neuroblastoma line, and Jurkat, a leukemia cell line. Both cell lines were sourced from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were maintained at a constant temperature of 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

This baseline medium was considered a control condition for various extracellular media used to adjust membrane potential. Two extracellular media with low K<sup>+</sup> concentrations (KCl = 0.2 and 1 mM) were prepared to hyperpolarize the membrane potential. Three extracellular media with high K<sup>+</sup> concentrations (KCl = 20, 40, and 80 mM) were prepared to depolarize the membrane potential. A Ba<sup>2+</sup> medium containing 10 mM BaCl<sub>2</sub> was also prepared to depolarize the membrane potential in a different way, i.e., as a K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker.

<p><italic>In vitro</italic> MRI experiments were performed on a 9.4 T MRI system (BioSpec 94/30 USR, Bruker BioSpin) at room temperature. A volume coil with an inner diameter of 86 mm was utilized for both radiofrequency (RF) pulse transmission and signal reception. Within the acrylic container, two wells on the same column (matrix = 2 Ã 7) contained identical cell pellets with the same extracellular media.

The MRI pulse sequence employed for mapping the <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> value was a single-echo spin-echo (SESE) sequence with 50 variable echo times (TE) spaced between 9.5 and 290.5 ms on a logarithmic scale. For mapping the MT parameters, an inversion recovery multi-echo spin-echo (IR-MESE) sequence was used.

The skin and periosteum over the skull were removed using a scalpel and surgical scissors. A 3.0-mm-diameter burr hole was opened using a dental drill with its center at the coordinates of 2.5 mm anterior and 2.0 mm lateral to the lambda. Then, a cylindrical chamber was implanted upon the burr hole with cyanoacrylate glue and dental composite resin.

The pH of the pipette solution was adjusted to 7.4 using KOH. Calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) were not included in the pipette solution to minimize Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent currents. The resistance of the electrode was 3â5 MÎ© with the internal solution filled.

<p>The authors show MRI relaxation time changes that are claimed to originate from cell membrane potential changes. This would be very <bold>important</bold> if true because it may provide a mechanism whereby membrane potential changes could be inferred noninvasively. However, the membrane potential manipulations applied here will induce cell swelling, and cell swelling has been previously shown to affect relaxation time. Therefore, the claim that the relaxation time changes observed in this manuscript are due to cell membrane potential changes is <bold>inadequately</bold> supported.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper examines changes in relaxation time (T1 and T2) and magnetization transfer parameters that occur in a model system and in vivo when cells or tissue are depolarized using an equimolar extracellular solution with different concentrations of the depolarizing ion K+. The motivation is to explain T2 changes that have previously been observed by the authors in an in vivo model with neural stimulation (DIANA) and to try provide a mechanism to explain those changes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors argue that the use of various concentrations of KCL in the extracellular fluid depolarize or hyperpolarize the cell pellets used and that this change in membrane potential is the driving force for the T2 (and T1-supplementary material) changes observed. In particular, they report an increase in T2 with increasing KCL concentration in the extracellular fluid (ECF) of pellets of SH-SY5Y cells. To offset the increasing osmolarity of the ECF due to the increase in KCL, the NaCL molarity of the ECF is proportionally reduced. The authors measure the intracellular voltage using patch clamp recordings, which is a gold standard. With 80 mM of KCL in the ECF, a change in T2 of the cell pellets of ~10 ms is observed with the intracellular potential recorded as about -6 mv. A very large T1 increase of ~90 ms is reported under the same conditions. The PSR (ratio of hydrogen protons on macromolecules to free water) decreases by about 10% at this 80 mM KCL concentration. Similar results are seen in a Jurkat cell line and similar, but far smaller changes are observed in vivo, for a variety of reasons discussed. As a final control, T1 and T2 values are measured in the various equimolar KCL solutions. As expected, no significant changes in T1 and T2 of the ECF were observed for these concentrations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the concepts presented are interesting, and the actual experimental methods seem to be nicely executed, the conclusions are not supported by the data for a number of reasons. This is not to say that the data isn't consistent with the conclusions, but there are other controls not included that would be necessary to draw the conclusion that it is membrane potential that is driving these T1 and T2 changes. Unfortunately for these authors, similar experiments conducted in 2008 (Stroman et al. Magn. Reson. in Med. 59:700-706) found similar results (increased T2 with KCL) but with a different mechanism, that they provide definite proof for. This study was not referenced in the current work.</p>
<p>It is well established that cells swell/shrink upon depolarization/hyperpolarization. Cell swelling is accompanied by increased light transmittance in vivo, and this should be true in the pellet system as well. In a beautiful series of experiments, Stroman et al. (2008) showed in perfused brain slices that the cells swell upon equimolar KCL depolarization and the light transmittance increases. The time course of these changes is quite slow, of the order of many minutes, both for the T2-weighted MRI signal and for the light transmittance. Stroman et al. also show that hypoosmotic changes produce the exact same timecourse as the KCL depolarization changes (and vice versa for the hyperosmotic changes - which cause cell shrinkage). Their conclusion, therefore, was that cell swelling (not membrane potential) was the cause of the T2-weighted changes observed, and that these were relatively slow (on the scale of many minutes).</p>
<p>What are the implications for the current study? Well, for one, the authors cannot exclude cell swelling as the mechanism for T2 changes, as they have not measured that. It is however well established that cell swelling occurs during depolarization, so this is not in question. Water in the pelletized cells is in slow/intermediate exchange with the ECF, and the solutions for the two compartment relaxation model for this are well established (see Menon and Allen, Magn. Reson. in Med. 20:214-227 (1991). The T2 relaxation times should be multiexponential (see point (3) further below). The current work cannot exclude cell swelling as the mechanism for T2 changes (it is mentioned in the paper, but not dealt with). Water entering cells dilutes the protein structures, changes rotational correlation times of the proteins in the cell and is known to increase T2. The PSR confirms that this is indeed happening, so the data in this work is completely consistent with the Stroman work and completely consistent with cell swelling associated with depolarization. The authors should have performed light scattering studies to demonstrate the presence or absence of cell swelling. Measuring intracellular potential is not enough to clarify the mechanism.</p>
<p>So why does it matter whether the mechanism is cell swelling or membrane potential? The reason is response time. Cell swelling due to depolarization is a slow process, slower than hemodynamic responses that characterize BOLD. In fact, cell swelling under normal homeostatic conditions in vivo is virtually non-existent. Only sustained depolarization events typically associated with non-naturalistic stimuli or brain dysfunction produce cell swelling. Membrane potential changes associated with neural activity, on the other hand, are very fast. In this manuscript, the authors have convincingly shown a signal change that is virtually the same as what was seen in the Stroman publication, but they have not shown that there is a response that can be detected with anything approaching the timescale of an action potential. So one cannot definitely say that the changes observed are due to membrane potential. One can only say they are consistent with cell swelling, regardless of what causes the cell swelling.</p>
<p>For this mechanism to be relevant to explaining DIANA, one needs to show that the cell swelling changes occur within a millisecond, which has never been reported. If one knows the populations of ECF and pellet, the T2s of the ECF and pellet and the volume change of the cells in the pellet, one can model any expected T2 changes due to neuronal activity. I think one would find that these are minuscule within the context of an action potential, or even bulk action potential.</p>
<p>There are a few smaller issues that should be addressed.</p>
<p>
(1) Why were complicated imaging sequences used to measure T1 and T2? On a Bruker system it should be possible to do very simple acquisitions with hard pulses (which will not need dictionaries and such to get quantitative numbers). Of course, this can only be done sample by sample and would take longer, but it avoids a lot of complication to correct the RF pulses used for imaging, which leads me to the 2nd point.</p>
<p>
(2) Figure S1 (H) is unlike any exponential T2 decay I have seen in almost 40 years of making T2 measurements. The strange plateau at the beginning and the bump around TE = 25 ms are odd. These could just be noise, but the fitted curve exactly reproduces these features. A monoexponential T2 decay cannot, by definition, produce a fit shaped like this.</p>
<p>
(3) As noted earlier, layered samples produce biexponential T2 decays and monoexponential T1 decays. I don't quite see how this was accounted for in the fitting of the data from the pellet preparations. I realize that these are spatially resolved measurements, but the imaging slice shown seems to be at the boundary of the pellet and the extracellular media and there definitely should be a biexponential water proton decay curve. Only 5 echo times were used, so this is part of the problem, but it does mean that the T2 reported is a population fraction weighted average of the T2 in the two compartments.</p>
<p>
(4) Delta T1 and T2 values are presented for the pellets in wells, but no absolute values are presented for either the pellets or the KCL solutions that I could find.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Min et al. attempt to demonstrate that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect changes in neuronal membrane potentials. They approach this goal by studying how MRI contrast and cellular potentials together respond to treatment of cultured cells with ionic solutions. The authors specifically study two MRI-based measurements: (A) the transverse (T2) relaxation rate, which reflects microscopic magnetic fields caused by solutes and biological structures; and (B) the fraction or &quot;pool size ratio&quot; (PSR) of water molecules estimated to be bound to macromolecules, using an MRI technique called magnetization transfer (MT) imaging. They see that depolarizing K+ and Ba2+ concentrations lead to T2 increases and PSR decreases that vary approximately linearly with voltage in a neuroblastoma cell line and that change similarly in a second cell type. They also show that depolarizing potassium concentrations evoke reversible T2 increases in rat brains and that these changes are reversed when potassium is renormalized. Min et al. argue that this implies that membrane potential changes cause the MRI effects, providing a potential basis for detecting cellular voltages by noninvasive imaging. If this were true, it would help validate a recent paper published by some of the authors (Toi et al., Science 378:160-8, 2022), in which they claimed to be able to detect millisecond-scale neuronal responses by MRI.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The discovery of a mechanism for relating cellular membrane potential to MRI contrast could yield an important means for studying functions of the nervous system. Achieving this has been a longstanding goal in the MRI community, but previous strategies have proven too weak or insufficiently reproducible for neuroscientific or clinical applications. The current paper suggests remarkably that one of the simplest and most widely used MRI contrast mechanisms-T2 weighted imaging-may indicate membrane potentials if measured in the absence of the hemodynamic signals that most functional MRI (fMRI) experiments rely on. The authors make their case using a diverse set of quantitative tests that include controls for ion and cell type-specificity of their in vitro results and reversibility of MRI changes observed in vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness of the paper is that it uses correlational data to conclude that there is a causational relationship between membrane potential and MRI contrast. Alternative explanations that could explain the authors' findings are not adequately considered. Most notably, depolarizing ionic solutions can also induce changes in cellular volume and tissue structure that in turn alter MRI contrast properties similarly to the results shown here. For example, a study by Stroman et al. (Magn Reson Med 59:700-6, 2008) reported reversible potassium-dependent T2 increases in neural tissue that correlate closely with light scattering-based indications of cell swelling. Phi Van et al. (Sci Adv 10:eadl2034, 2024) showed that potassium addition to one of the cell lines used here likewise leads to cell size increases and T2 increases. Such effects could in principle account for Min et al.'s results, and indeed it is difficult to see how they would not contribute, but they occur on a time scale far too slow to yield useful indications of membrane potential. The authors' observation that PSR correlates negatively with T2 in their experiments is also consistent with this explanation, given the inverse relationship usually observed (and mechanistically expected) between these two parameters. If the authors could show a tight correspondence between millisecond-scale membrane potential changes and MRI contrast, their argument for a causal connection or a useful correlational relationship between membrane potential and image contrast would be much stronger. As it is, however, the article does not succeed in demonstrating that membrane potential changes can be detected by MRI.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs comments. We agree that changes in cell volume due to depolarization and hyperpolarization significantly contribute to the observed changes in T2, PSR, and T1, especially in pelletized cells. For this reason, we already noted in the Discussion section of the original manuscript that cell volume changes influence the observed MR parameter changes, though this study did not present the magnitude of the cell volume changes. In this regard, we thank the reviewer for introducing the work by Stroman et al. (Magn Reson Med 59:700-706, 2008). When discussing the contribution of the cell volume changes to the observed MR parameter changes, we will additionally discuss the work of Stroman et al. in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>In addition, we acknowledge that the title and main conclusion of the original manuscript may be misleading, as we did not separately consider the effect of cell volume changes on MR parameters. To more accurately reflect the scope and results of this study and to consider the reviewer 2âs suggestion, we will adjust the title to âResponses to membrane potential-modulating ionic solutions measured by magnetic resonance imaging of cultured cells and in vivo rat cortexâ and will also revise the relevant phrases in the main text.</p>
<p>Finally, when [K+]-induced membrane potential changes are involved, there seems to be factors other than cell volume changes also appear to influence T2 changes. Our ongoing study shows that there are differences in T2 changes (for the same volume changes) between two different situations: pure osmotic volume changes vs. [K+]-induced volume changes (e.g., hypoosmotic vs. depolarization). Furthermore, this study suggests that mechanisms such as changes in free (primarily intracellular) and bound water within a voxel play an important role in generating this T2 difference. Our group is preparing a manuscript for this follow-up study and will report on it shortly.</p>

<p>In the context of cell swelling occurring at rapid response times, if we define cell swelling simply as an âincrease in cell volume,â there are several studies reporting transient structural (or volumetric) changes (e.g., ~nm diameter change over ~ms duration) in neuron cells during action potential propagation (Akkin et al., Biophys J 93:1347-1353, 2007; Kim et al., Biophys J 92:3122-3129, 2007; Lee et al., IEEE Trans Biomed Eng 58:3000-3003, 2011; Wnek et al., J Polym Sci Part B: Polym Phys 54:7-14, 2015; Yang et al., ACS Nano 12:4186-4193, 2018). These studies show a good correlation between membrane potential changes and cell volume changes (even if very small) at the cellular level within milliseconds.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the Response 1 above, this study does not address rapid dynamic membrane potential changes on the millisecond scale, which we explicitly discussed as one of the limitations in the Discussion section of the original manuscript. For this reason, we do not claim in this study that we provide the reader with definitive answers about the mechanisms involved in DIANA. Rather, as a first step toward addressing the mechanism of DIANA, this study confirms that there is a good correlation between changes in membrane potential and measurable MR parameters (e.g., T2 and PSR) when using ionic solutions that modulate membrane potential. Identifying T2 changes that occur during millisecond-scale membrane potential changes due to rapid neural activation will be further addressed in future studies.</p>

<p>There are a few smaller issues that should be addressed.</p>
<p>(1) Why were complicated imaging sequences used to measure T1 and T2? On a Bruker system it should be possible to do very simple acquisitions with hard pulses (which will not need dictionaries and such to get quantitative numbers). Of course, this can only be done sample by sample and would take longer, but it avoids a lot of complication to correct the RF pulses used for imaging, which leads me to the 2nd point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion regarding imaging sequences. We would like to clarify that dictionaries were used for fitting in vivo T2 decay data, not in vitro data. Sample-by-sample nonlocalized acquisition with hard pulses may be applicable for in vitro measurements. However, for in vivo measurements, a slice-selective multi-echo spin-echo sequence was necessary to acquire T2 maps within a reasonable scan time. Our choice of imaging sequence was guided by the need to spatially resolve MR signals from specific regions of interests while balancing scan time constraints.</p>

<p>(2) Figure S1 (H) is unlike any exponential T2 decay I have seen in almost 40 years of making T2 measurements. The strange plateau at the beginning and the bump around TE = 25 ms are odd. These could just be noise, but the fitted curve exactly reproduces these features. A monoexponential T2 decay cannot, by definition, produce a fit shaped like this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The T2 decay curves in Figure S1(H) indeed display features that deviate from a simple monoexponential decay. In our in vivo experiments, we used a multi-echo spin-echo sequence with slice-selective excitation and refocusing pulses. In such sequences, the echo train is influenced by stimulated echoes and imperfect slice profiles. This phenomenon is inherent to the pulse sequence rather than being artifacts or fitting errors (Hennig, Concepts Magn Reson 3:125-143, 1991; Lebel and Wilman, Magn Reson Med 64:1005-1014, 2010; McPhee and Wilman, Magn Reson Med 77:2057-2065, 2017). Therefore, we fitted the T2 decay curve using the technique developed by McPhee and Wilman (2017).</p>

<p>(3) As noted earlier, layered samples produce biexponential T2 decays and monoexponential T1 decays. I don't quite see how this was accounted for in the fitting of the data from the pellet preparations. I realize that these are spatially resolved measurements, but the imaging slice shown seems to be at the boundary of the pellet and the extracellular media and there definitely should be a biexponential water proton decay curve. Only 5 echo times were used, so this is part of the problem, but it does mean that the T2 reported is a population fraction weighted average of the T2 in the two compartments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the reviewerâs concern regarding potential biexponential decay due to the presence of different compartments. In our experiments, we carefully positioned the imaging slice sufficiently remote from the pellet-media interface. This approach ensures that the signal predominantly arises from the cells (and interstitial fluid), excluding the influence of extracellular media above the cell pellet. We will clearly describe the imaging slice in the revised manuscript. As mentioned in our Methods section, for in vitro experiments, we repeated a single-echo spin-echo sequence with 50 difference echo times. While Figure 1C illustrates data from five echo times for visual clarity, the full dataset with all 50 echo times was used for fitting. We will clarify this point in the revised manuscript to avoid any misunderstanding.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Min et al. attempt to demonstrate that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect changes in neuronal membrane potentials. They approach this goal by studying how MRI contrast and cellular potentials together respond to treatment of cultured cells with ionic solutions. The authors specifically study two MRI-based measurements: (A) the transverse (T2) relaxation rate, which reflects microscopic magnetic fields caused by solutes and biological structures; and (B) the fraction or &quot;pool size ratio&quot; (PSR) of water molecules estimated to be bound to macromolecules, using an MRI technique called magnetization transfer (MT) imaging. They see that depolarizing K+ and Ba2+ concentrations lead to T2 increases and PSR decreases that vary approximately linearly with voltage in a neuroblastoma cell line and that change similarly in a second cell type. They also show that depolarizing potassium concentrations evoke reversible T2 increases in rat brains and that these changes are reversed when potassium is renormalized. Min et al. argue that this implies that membrane potential changes cause the MRI effects, providing a potential basis for detecting cellular voltages by noninvasive imaging. If this were true, it would help validate a recent paper published by some of the authors (Toi et al., Science 378:160-8, 2022), in which they claimed to be able to detect millisecond-scale neuronal responses by MRI.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The discovery of a mechanism for relating cellular membrane potential to MRI contrast could yield an important means for studying functions of the nervous system. Achieving this has been a longstanding goal in the MRI community, but previous strategies have proven too weak or insufficiently reproducible for neuroscientific or clinical applications. The current paper suggests remarkably that one of the simplest and most widely used MRI contrast mechanisms-T2 weighted imaging-may indicate membrane potentials if measured in the absence of the hemodynamic signals that most functional MRI (fMRI) experiments rely on. The authors make their case using a diverse set of quantitative tests that include controls for ion and cell type-specificity of their in vitro results and reversibility of MRI changes observed in vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness of the paper is that it uses correlational data to conclude that there is a causational relationship between membrane potential and MRI contrast. Alternative explanations that could explain the authors' findings are not adequately considered. Most notably, depolarizing ionic solutions can also induce changes in cellular volume and tissue structure that in turn alter MRI contrast properties similarly to the results shown here. For example, a study by Stroman et al. (Magn Reson Med 59:700-6, 2008) reported reversible potassium-dependent T2 increases in neural tissue that correlate closely with light scattering-based indications of cell swelling. Phi Van et al. (Sci Adv 10:eadl2034, 2024) showed that potassium addition to one of the cell lines used here likewise leads to cell size increases and T2 increases. Such effects could in principle account for Min et al.'s results, and indeed it is difficult to see how they would not contribute, but they occur on a time scale far too slow to yield useful indications of membrane potential. The authors' observation that PSR correlates negatively with T2 in their experiments is also consistent with this explanation, given the inverse relationship usually observed (and mechanistically expected) between these two parameters. If the authors could show a tight correspondence between millisecond-scale membrane potential changes and MRI contrast, their argument for a causal connection or a useful correlational relationship between membrane potential and image contrast would be much stronger. As it is, however, the article does not succeed in demonstrating that membrane potential changes can be detected by MRI.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs comments. We agree that changes in cell volume due to depolarization and hyperpolarization significantly contribute to the observed MR parameter changes. For this reason, we have already noted in the Discussion section of the original manuscript that cell volume changes influence the observed MR parameter changes. In this regard, we thank the reviewer for introducing the work by Stroman et al. (Magn Reson Med 59:700-706, 2008) and Phi Van et al. (Sci Adv 10:eadl2034, 2024). When discussing the contribution of the cell volume changes to the observed MR parameter changes, we will additionally discuss both work of Stroman et al. and Phi Van et al. in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>In addition, this study does not address rapid dynamic membrane potential changes on the millisecond scale, which we explicitly discussed as one of the limitations of this study in the Discussion section of the original manuscript. For this reason, we do not claim in this study that we provide the reader with definitive answers about the mechanisms involved in DIANA. Rather, as a first step toward addressing the mechanism of DIANA, this study confirms that there is a good correlation between changes in membrane potential and measurable MR parameters (although on a slow time scale) when using ionic solutions that modulate membrane potential. Identifying T2 changes that occur during millisecond-scale membrane potential changes due to rapid neural activation will be further addressed in future studies.</p>
<p>Together, we acknowledge that the title and main conclusion of the original manuscript may be misleading. To more accurately reflect the scope and results of this study and to consider the reviewerâs suggestion, we will adjust the title to âResponses to membrane potential-modulating ionic solutions measured by magnetic resonance imaging of cultured cells and in vivo rat cortexâ and will also revise the relevant phrases in the main text.</p>
