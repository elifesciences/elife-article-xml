<title>Abstract</title><p>Mutations in the X-linked <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> gene cause cognitive deficits in humans, with a subset of patients suffering from epilepsy. X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) is often ascribed to neuronal deficits, but here we report that expression of human and mouse ZDHHC9 orthologs is far higher in myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) than in other CNS cell types. <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> codes for a protein acyltransferase (PAT), and we found that ZDHHC9 is the most highly expressed PAT in OLs. Wild type ZDHHC9 localizes to Golgi outposts in OL processes, but other PATs and XLID mutant forms of ZDHHC9 are restricted to OL cell bodies. Using genetic tools for OL progenitor fate tracing and sparse cell labeling, we show that mice lacking <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> have grossly normal OL development but display extensive morphological and structural myelin abnormalities. Consistent with the hypothesis that these deficits are OL-autonomous, they are broadly phenocopied by acute <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> knockdown in cultured conditions. Finally, we found that ZDHHC9 palmitoylates Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) in heterologous cells, and that palmitoylation of MBP is impaired in the <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> knockout brain. Our findings provide critical insights into the mechanisms of <italic>ZDHHC9</italic>-associated XLID and shed new light on the palmitoylation-dependent control of myelination.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mutations in the <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> gene cause X-linked Intellectual Disability (XLID)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). XLID-associated <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> mutations include nonsense mutations and missense mutations affecting key amino acids, as well as splice site mutations, insertions, and deletions that result in frameshifts. Importantly, all these genetic changes are predicted to be loss-of-function. These findings suggest that ZDHHC9 is essential for higher brain function.</p>
<p>Given that many XLID genes are neuronally enriched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), an <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis is that ZDHHC9 acts in neurons. However, patients with <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> mutations have grossly normal gray matter (GM) but reduced brain white matter (WM) volume, especially in the corpus callosum (CC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> mutations are also linked to cerebral palsy, a condition in which intellectually disability is often associated with WM impairment (WMI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). These findings raise the possibility that ZDHHC9 may be crucial for normal WM development and/or proper function of oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin-forming CNS glia abundant in WM. Notably, <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> knockout (KO) mice exhibit WM volume reductions and seizure-like activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), as well as behavioral phenotypes seen in other mouse models of ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Thus, <italic>Zdhhc</italic>9 KO mice have the potential to serve as an excellent model for human ZDHHC9 mutations. However, their phenotype is yet to be fully characterized.</p>
<p><italic>ZDHHC9</italic> codes for a protein acyltransferase (PAT), an enzyme that catalyzes the modification of protein cysteine residues with palmitate and related fatty acids. This process, termed palmitoylation (also known as <italic>S-</italic>palmitoylation or <italic>S</italic>-acylation), plays a critical role in targeting proteins to specific subcellular membrane locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Nearly 30 years ago, it was reported that major myelin proteins in the nervous system, including Proteolipid protein (PLP), Myelin basic protein (MBP), Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), are palmitoylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). However, at that time, methods were lacking to define roles of palmitoylation of these proteins in myelin formation and function. Later proteomic studies revealed many other palmitoylated myelin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), and an isolated study suggested that palmitoylation targets myelin proteins to the plasma membrane of cultured OLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Despite these findings, little is known regarding how myelin protein palmitoylation is regulated and the functional importance of this process for higher brain function.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that ZDHHC9-dependent palmitoylation plays a critical role in proper myelination and WM formation. Consistent with this notion, we report that ZDHHC9 is the most highly expressed PAT in mouse and human OLs. Moreover, ZDHHC9 localizes to puncta in OL processes that are likely Golgi outposts, whereas other PATs tested and <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> XLID mutant forms are restricted to OL cell bodies. These findings may explain why <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> loss of function cannot be compensated by other PATs. In mice lacking <italic>Zdhhc9</italic>, we did not detect changes in OL lineage cell generation or total MBP expression levels, but we found that at the micro-scale <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO OLs are dysmorphic and myelin ultrastructure is highly abnormal, with both hypo- and hypermyelination of axons in WM tracts. We show that with the help of Golga7, a ZDHHC9 partner protein that also localizes to Golgi outposts, ZDHHC9 robustly palmitoylates the major myelin protein MBP, and that MBP palmitoylation is impaired in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO brain. Palmitoyl- and total levels of another myelin protein, Myelin-associated Glycoprotein (MAG) are also affected by <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO, suggestive of a broader deficit in myelin protein regulation and organization in these mice. Together, our findings provide new insights into mechanisms of <italic>ZDHHC9</italic>-associated XLID and the palmitoylation-dependent control of myelination, a process first reported decades ago, but about which almost nothing is known.</p>

<title>Cell-Specific Transcriptomics Reveals That ZDHHC9 and Its Partner Protein GOLGA7 Are Enriched in Oligodendrocytes in the Mouse and Human Brain</title>
<p>To assess <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> expression in OLs, we performed FACS using cerebral cortex (CTX) of P30 <italic>Mobp-EGFP</italic> BAC transgenic (Tg) mice, which express EGFP only in mature OLs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>)). We isolated RNA from the EGFP<sup>+</sup> OLs and performed OL-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Total RNA was also extracted from the cortices of the same mice without OL sorting and used for a separate bulk RNA-Seq. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that genes previously known to be highly expressed in myelinating OLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) were highly enriched in our OL-specific RNA preparations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). In contrast, expression levels of genes specific to other neural cell types and endothelial cells were very low, confirming that our transcriptomic dataset is highly OL-specific (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We then extracted fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) values for all ZDHHC family PATs from our OL-specific RNA-Seq dataset. We found that <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> is the most highly expressed PAT in OLs (FPKM ∼ 180), with mRNAs for <italic>Zdhhc14</italic>, <italic>Zdhhc17</italic>, and <italic>Zdhhc20</italic> present at lower but detectable levels (FPKM 30 ∼ 70) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>). The remaining PATs were expressed at far lower levels (FPKM &lt;10). These results suggest that ZDHHC9 is the predominant PAT in myelinating OLs.</p>
<p>ZDHHC9 activity requires a conserved partner, Golgi Complex Protein-16 (gene name <italic>Golga7</italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). We found that <italic>Golga7</italic> was also abundantly expressed in OLs, at far higher levels than other Golga family members, including <italic>Golga7’</italic>s closest paralog, <italic>Golga7b</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). FPKM values for <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> and <italic>Golga7</italic> were far lower in total RNA preps obtained from whole cortices without specific cell type isolation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, left Heatmap), suggesting that high <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> and <italic>Golga7</italic> expression is an OL-specific feature, rather than a general characteristic of CNS cells. Consistent with this notion, examination of another CNS cell type-specific RNA-Seq dataset, obtained with sorted cells from P17 brain cortices via immunopanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), confirmed high and specific expression of <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> and <italic>Golga7</italic> in myelin-forming OLs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, right Heatmap). Moreover, examination of a human RNA-Seq study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) revealed that, like mouse CNS, both <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> and <italic>GOLGA7</italic> are enriched in human OLs, compared to any other PATs or other GOLGA family members, respectively. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). Together, these findings raise the possibility that ZDHHC9, in concert with GOLGA7, plays an important role in OLs.</p>

<title>Wild type ZDHHC9 and GOLGA7 Localize to Oligodendrocyte Processes <italic>In Vitro,</italic> Unlike Other PATs or ZDHHC9 Mutants</title>
<p>As a first step toward understanding ZDHHC9 function in OLs, we sought to define the subcellular localization of transfected HA-tagged ZDHHC9 (HA-ZDHHC9) in cultured OLs. We also compared the subcellular localization of HA-ZDHHC9 with that of HA-tagged forms of ZDHHC3, ZDHHC7 and ZDHHC17, three other ZDHHC-PATs that are implicated in nervous system regulation and which are expressed in OLs <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>)).</p>
<p>After three days of culture in differentiation medium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), cultured OLs were extensively ramified and showed strong MBP immunofluorescence (‘OL3D’; Fig S1A). We transfected these cultured OLs and fixed them 9h later to minimize the likelihood of ZDHHC-PAT expression itself altering OL morphology and affecting HA-PAT subcellular localization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Under these conditions, HA-ZDHHC3, HA-ZDHHC7, and HA-ZDHHC17 were only detected in OL cell bodies, consistent with their restriction to the somatic Golgi in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B, D</xref>). In contrast, HA-ZDHHC9 was detected both in OL cell bodies and in discrete puncta in OL processes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, D</xref>). Within OL cell bodies, ZDHHC9 partially colocalized with the Golgi marker GM130 (Fig. S1A, B). Consistent with this Golgi localization, ZDHHC9 also colocalized in part with additional Golgi markers (TGN38, Giantin; Fig S1C, D). However, these markers were not detected in OL processes and therefore did not colocalize with ZDHHC9 in this latter location (Fig. S1A-D).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="558291v2_fig2.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>We also compared the subcellular distribution of wild type ZDHHC9 (ZDHHC9WT) with that of XLID-associated ZDHHC9 mutants (R96W; R148W; P150S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). In contrast to HA-ZDHHC9WT, these XLID-associated HA-ZDHHC9 mutants did not localize to OL processes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>). These results raise the possibility that dysregulated subcellular localization of ZDHHC9, rather than, or in addition to, reduced catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) is a causative factor in <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> loss of function mutations in XLID.</p>
<p>We also sought to define the localization in OLs of Golga7, which directly binds and enhances function of ZDHHC9 in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Consistent with this role, myc-tagged Golga7 (myc-Golga7) colocalized extensively with HA-ZDHHC9 in both OL cell bodies and in discrete puncta in OL processes (Fig. S2A). We then sought to further define the identity of these discrete ZDHHC9/Golga7-positive puncta. In neurons, specialized Golgi outposts and Golgi satellites can function as acentrosomal microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Interestingly, Golgi outposts were also recently reported to be present in OLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), and a subset of OL Golgi outposts can be marked by the proteins TPPP and Mannosidase II (ManII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Consistent with their assignation as Golgi outposts, ZDHHC9-positive puncta in OL processes colocalized with GFP-tagged ManII (ManII-GFP) and, to a lesser extent, with Flag-tagged TPPP (TPPP-Flag) (Fig. S2B, C).</p>
<p>The OL processes in this culture condition correspond to large lipid-rich membranous sheets that form spiral membrane expansion on axons <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). ZDHHC9’s localization to Golgi outposts/satellites in processes of cultured OLs suggest its potential role in myelin formation (myelination) and/or maintenance. Moreover, this function of ZDHHC9 might not be shared with other PATs tested and may be impaired in XLID-associated mutant forms of ZDHHC9.</p>

<title>No detectable changes in Oligodendrocyte Development or Gross Myelination in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO Mice</title>
<p>To address whether <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> regulates OL development and myelination <italic>in vivo</italic>, we examined the brains of <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice. Histological observations of brain sections from 6-week-old male mice revealed no apparent difference in MBP-labeled OL processes between WT control and <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). OL numbers in CTX and the corpus callosum (CC), assessed using OL markers aspartoacylase (ASPA) or Quaking 7 (recognized by antibody CC1), also did not detect any significant difference between the two groups (Fig. S3A-C). To quantify OLs more precisely, we crossed <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO with <italic>Mobp-EGFP</italic> mice and counted EGFP-labeled OLs. Again, we did not detect significant differences in EGFP<sup>+</sup> OL density between the two genotypes in three examined CNS regions (CTX, CC, and spinal cord), at two different ages (P28, P56; (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, C</xref>)). We also detected no difference in the density of NG2<sup>+</sup> OL progenitor cells (OPCs) between WT and <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D, E</xref>).</p>

<p>We next asked whether <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss affects the rate of oligodendrogenesis (maturation of OPCs to OLs). To address this question, we crossed <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice with <italic>Pdgfra-CreER; R26-EGFP</italic> (RCE) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) and analyzed the fates of genetically labeled OPCs. Control (<italic>Pdgfra-CreER; RCE</italic>) and KO (<italic>Pdgfra-CreER; RCE</italic>; <italic>Zdhhc9</italic><sup>y/-</sup> <sup>or</sup> <sup>-/-</sup>) mice received tamoxifen injections at P21 and were sampled 3 weeks later (P21+21) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This allowed us to label PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> OPCs with EGFP at P21 and track their differentiation. Newly differentiated EGFP<sup>+</sup> OLs from the previously labeled EGFP-labeled OPCs were analyzed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2, G</xref>). However, we did not detect differences in the number of newly formed EGFP-labeled ASPA<sup>+</sup> OLs and % of EGFP<sup>+</sup> OLs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H, I</xref>) and the ratio of OLs to OPCs among EGFP-labeled cells (data not shown) between the two groups. These results suggest that <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO does not alter oligodendrogenesis in either the young or mature CNS, at least using the markers and methodologies that we employed.</p>

<title><italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO Impairs Microstructure of Oligodendrocyte Processes</title>
<p>Although we did not detect differences in overall oligodendrogenesis or myelin production, we reasoned that loss of <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> might still affect the targeting of specific myelin proteins to the membrane, resulting in irregular formation of processes in OLs or abnormalities in myelin. To address this possibility, we used a sparse genetic OL labeling method, crossing <italic>Mobp-iCreER</italic>; <italic>mT/mG</italic> mice to <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice. By P56, a small degree of tamoxifen-independent (leaky) Cre activity leads to spontaneous expression of membrane-anchored EGFP (mEGFP) in a subset (∼5%) of cortical OLs in these mice. The sparsely EGFP-labeled brain sections were then imaged with confocal microscopy to detect mEGFP signal in CTX and to subsequently trace OL processes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The morphology of individual OLs was then reconstructed as a 3D skeleton (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Sholl analysis of these reconstructions revealed that the overall OL process complexity was slightly increased in <italic>Zdhhc9 KO</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). More surprisingly, the primary and secondary branch process were longer in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO than control mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>We also analyzed the processes of individual OLs in raw images from these sections. In control mice, the EGFP-labeled processes originating from one OL soma were of similar thickness, with a uniformly smooth structure. However, the thickness of mEGFP<sup>+</sup> processes in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice was far more heterogenous, with several spheroid-like swellings (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). The abnormal thickness of EGFP<sup>+</sup> OL processes may reflect dysregulated axon recognition by OLs. Notably, the abnormal spheroid-like swellings on OL processes were distinguished from OL somas as they lack signal for DAPI or Olig2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, Fig. S4). Careful tracing of EGFP<sup>+</sup> OL processes connected to DAPI<sup>+</sup> cell body and quantification of spheroid-like swellings devoid of DAPI signal (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, C-2) revealed significant structural abnormalities in OL processes in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D, E</xref>). These results indicate that, in contrast to its lack of effect at the gross level, <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss greatly alters the structure of individual OL processes at the microscopic level, presumably due to abnormal OL membrane expansion.</p>

<title>Impaired Myelination in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO Mice</title>
<p>The non-uniformity of <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO OL processes suggests that <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss may disrupt the typical bias of myelination based on axon caliber and/or the spreading of the OL membrane along the axon. To address this issue, we examined the extent and pattern of axonal myelination using electron microscopy (EM) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). In electron micrographs from P56 CC, the number of axons did not differ between WT and <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A, B</xref>). However, while most axons were evenly myelinated in WT mice, myelin patterns of axons in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice were highly abnormal; with many large axons unmyelinated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A, C</xref>) and a subset of small diameter axons (&lt; 0.5 μm) appearing to be hypermyelinated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A, D</xref>). Consistent with the latter finding, <italic>g</italic>-ratios of these small diameter axons were smaller in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E, F</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we inquired whether the dysmyelination observed in young adult (P56) <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice resulted from impaired initial myelination or from impaired myelin maintenance or active demyelination. At P30, a time at which myelination is actively ongoing, EM images showed a broadly similar extent of myelination across all axons in WT mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G, H</xref>). However, in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice, both hypo- and hypermyelination of axons was already noticeable at this developmental stage (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>), which was evident from an increased interquartile range of <italic>g</italic>-ratios (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H, I</xref>). These findings suggest that <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss results in dysmyelination and, thus, that ZDHHC9 is required for proper initial myelination of individual axons.</p>

<title>Evidence supporting a cell-autonomous role of ZDHHC9 in Oligodendrocyte Maturation</title>
<p><italic>Zdhhc9</italic> is constitutively deleted in the KO mice, so OL morphological abnormalities and myelination deficits seen in this line might be caused by loss of action of ZDHHC9 in other cell types.

<p>We asked whether this failure to express and distribute MBP is due to impaired commitment to the OL lineage in culture. However, <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> knockdown OLs still expressed 2’,3’-Cyclic nucleotide 3’-phosphodiesterase (CNP), an early myelin-specific protein of developing Ols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>) (Fig. S5).

However, consistent with the reduced and restricted MBP expression, <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> knockdown OLs were also morphologically immature (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>) with a reduced degree of branching confirmed by Sholl analysis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>).

<title>A ZDHHC9-Golga7 PAT Complex Directly Palmitoylates MBP</title>
<p>Finally, we sought to identify potential ZDHHC9 substrates in OLs. Myelination of CNS axons by OLs requires the targeting of myelin proteins, including MBP, PLP, MOG and MAG, to the myelin membrane. These myelin proteins are all palmitoylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), but the PAT(s) that controls myelin protein palmitoylation was not previously identified. We thus used a non-radioactive palmitoylation assay, acyl biotin exchange (ABE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), to determine whether ZDHHC9 can directly palmitoylate MBP in co-transfected HEK293T cells. Palmitoylation of 21.5 kDa MBP (one of two MBP isoforms that contains a cysteine residue and is thus capable of undergoing palmitoylation) was very low when transfected alone. MBP palmitoylation remained very low when either HA-ZDHHC9 or myc-Golga7 were co-transfected in isolation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A, B</xref>). However, MBP palmitoylation was greatly increased by co-transfection of HA-ZDHHC9 and myc-Golga7 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A, B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Finally, we asked if ZDHHC9 likely palmitoylates MBP <italic>in vivo</italic>. We used ABE to purify palmitoyl-proteins from forebrain WM tissue (CC and striatum) of WT and <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mouse brains. Consistent with <italic>in vivo</italic> immunostaining results (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO did not affect total MBP levels measured by western blotting (all isoforms assessed together; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C, D</xref>). Two MBP bands were detected in ABE (palmitoyl) fractions, which based on their molecular weights, likely represent the 17.0 and 21.5 kDa isoforms of MBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Like 21.5 kDa MBP, the 17.0 kDa form of MBP contains a cysteine residue and may be subject to palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Importantly, palmitoylation, but not total expression, of both the 17 kDa and 21.5 kDa MBP isoforms was significantly reduced in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C, D</xref>). Total and palmitoyl-levels of MAG were also significantly reduced in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice, although the palmitoyl:total ratio of MAG was not. In the same samples, neither palmitoyl-, total, nor palmitoyl:total levels of Cadm4 were affected in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice. This latter finding is consistent with a report ascribing Cadm4 palmitoylation to a different PAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Together, these results suggest that ZDHHC9 directly palmitoylates MBP with the support of Golga7 and that <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss impairs MBP palmitoylation. In addition, <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss impacts other myelin protein levels and/or regulation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Genetic factors are central to intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>), as exemplified by the increasing number of known XLID-associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). However, knowledge of the cellular/molecular processes controlled by XLID-associated gene products is often limited. The cognitive deficits and epilepsy that are hallmarks of <italic>ZDHHC9-</italic>associated XLID are often ascribed to malformations of neocortical gray matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). Indeed, ZDHHC9 is expressed in a subset of forebrain neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>), and ‘<italic>Zdhhc9</italic> knockdown’ primary hippocampal neurons display impaired dendritic branching and an altered ratio of excitatory-to-inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). However, there is an increasing appreciation that ID can also result from impaired WM formation and/or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>). Consistent with this notion, both ZDHHC9 and its partner protein Golga7 are far more highly expressed in OLs than in other CNS cell types, in both mice and humans (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E, F</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>)). In support of a key role for ZDHHC9 in normal WM formation and function, we found that <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO does not affect axon number in the CC, but greatly impacts microscale OL morphology and myelin ultrastructure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> - <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). We recognize that using conventional <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice, in which <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> is globally deleted, cannot directly address whether impaired myelination in these mice is due to a cell-autonomous role for ZDHHC9 in OLs, a role for ZDHHC9 in neurons, or a combination of these factors. However, the impaired OL morphology and maturation seen in culture conditions after acute <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) supports the first of these possibilities. While a conditional KO mouse could more directly help test the OL-autonomous role of ZDHHC9 in vivo, in this study we focused on conventional KO mice to more accurately mirror the situation in human patients with <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> loss or mutation.</p>
<p>It is perhaps surprising that, despite the clear changes in OL morphogenesis, we did not detect changes in overall numbers of OPCs or OLs in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that such changes could be revealed by different methods. In addition, different OL subtypes express different subsets of other marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>) and it remains possible that <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss preferentially directs OL maturation towards or away from one or more of these subtypes. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that assessment of other brain regions might also reveal differences in OPC and/or OL numbers in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice. Lastly, we also note that acute <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss in cultured OLs causes more striking phenotypes than seen with KO mice <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, it is not uncommon for acute knockdown to cause more dramatic effects than germline KO, possibly due to longer-term compensatory mechanisms <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>). Together, though, our findings suggest that OL and WM abnormalities could significantly contribute to <italic>ZDHHC9</italic>-associated XLID.</p>
<p>Based on behavioral milestones, patients with <italic>ZDHHC9</italic>-associated XLID have been diagnosed as young as two years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), suggesting that ZDHHC9 is important for higher brain function during early development. Consistent with this notion, we observed dysmyelination (both hyper and hypomyelination) in P30 mice, approximately equivalent to a 3-year-old human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). These findings suggest that the myelin abnormalities observed in adult <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) are due to impaired myelination, rather than impaired myelin maintenance, and further support the use of <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice as a model for human <italic>ZDHHC9</italic>-associated XLID.</p>
<p><italic>Zdhhc9</italic> is also expressed at higher levels than other PATs in OLs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C, E, F</xref>), potentially explaining much of the impact of <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss in these cells. However, it is also intriguing that ZDHHC9 localization in OLs differs markedly from that of other PATs examined (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Moreover, ZDHHC9 and Golga7 colocalize as discrete puncta in cultured OL processes, and our immunostaining results with subcellular organelle markers suggest that these puncta represent Golgi outposts or satellites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, Fig. S2)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Of the PATs we tested, none were targeted to these locations, providing a possible additional, and non-mutually exclusive, reason why <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss cannot be readily compensated for in OLs.</p>
<p>Golgi outposts have long been known in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>), and we previously reported that ZDHHC9 localizes to such structures in primary hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Golgi outposts were also recently described in OLs, where their function remains to be fully determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Thus, the role(s) of ZDHHC9 at this subcellular organelle in OLs is challenging to infer. Nonetheless, we speculate that ZDHHC9 could be involved in either or both of the best-described roles of Golgi outposts, protein glycosylation and microtubule nucleation, for the following reasons. First, ZDHHC9-positive Golgi outposts in OL processes are also positive for the enzyme Mannosidase II, suggesting they represent sites at which protein glycosylation is regulated (Fig. S2B). In addition, although ZDHHC9 colocalization with TPPP, a protein implicated in microtubule nucleation, is less apparent (Fig. S2C), knockout/knockdown of either ZDHHC9 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) or TPPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>) affects branching and complexity of OL processes, a process that involves microtubule nucleation. However, more investigation is needed to determine the functions of Golgi outposts in OLs, in order to define the associated contribution of ZDHHC9.</p>
<p>Another intriguing question is whether and how the loss of ZDHHC9 action at Golgi outposts might contribute to the myelination deficits we observed in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Our sparse genetic labeling studies revealed that <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO OL processes are distended, with numerous spheroid-like swellings (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). It appears very possible that the hypo- and hypermyelination of <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO axons seen in single-plane EM cross-sections (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) represents this same distension phenotype, observed using a different method. Although beyond our current technical abilities, we speculate that EM-based reconstruction in 3 dimensions would reveal regions of both hypo- and hypermyelination of individual callosal axons in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice.</p>
<p>How, though, might <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss cause dysmyelination? Several myelin proteins are palmitoylated, and we found that a ZDHHC9/Golga7 complex palmitoylates the major myelin protein MBP and that MBP palmitoylation is reduced in forebrain WM of <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Given that palmitoylation can sort proteins to the myelin membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), the simplest explanation might be that impaired palmitoylation of MBP, and potentially other myelin proteins, in the absence of ZDHHC9 affects myelin structure per se. We also observed slight but significant reductions in palmitoyl- and total levels of MAG in the absence of ZDHHC9 (Fig S6A, B), which may also contribute to impaired myelination. In contrast, ZDHHC9 loss did not alter palmitoyl- or total levels of Cadm4, a myelin protein whose palmitoylation is ascribed to the Golgi-localized PAT ZDHHC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>)(Fig S6C, D). These latter finding suggests that, although ZDHHC9 loss may affect additional myelin proteins, gross, widespread dysregulation of myelin protein levels and/or palmitoylation in the absence of ZDHHC9 is unlikely. An important additional factor to consider, however, is that ZDHHC9 substrates also include other proteins that act at Golgi outposts to direct myelin proteins to the correct region of the myelin membrane and/or to ensure uniform distribution of myelin proteins within that membrane. A comparison of WT and <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO palmitoyl-proteomes could help determine which of these possibilities (which are not mutually exclusive) best accounts for impaired myelination in the absence of ZDHHC9.</p>
<p>In summary, we reveal an unexpectedly non-heterogeneous expression of <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> in both mice and humans, with biased expression in mature OLs. Moreover, within OLs, WT ZDHHC9 localizes uniquely compared to other PATs examined, and to XLID-associated forms of ZDHHC9. Although we did not detect changes in overall OL numbers or gross myelin staining, we found that <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss greatly impairs OL morphology and myelination at the microscale. These findings provide new insights into mechanisms of <italic>ZDHHC9</italic>-associated XLID and into other conditions marked by WMI.</p>

All RNA samples were subjected to Quality Control with Bioanalyzer (Agilent), and the RNA samples whose RIN was higher than 8 were used for subsequent applications. Ten ng of total RNA was used in the Ovation RNA-Seq System v2 (NuGEN) to prepare cDNA library. Following manufacturer’s instructions, total RNA and primer were incubated at 65 °C for 5 min, followed by first-strand cDNA synthesis (4 °C for 1 min, 25 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 10 min, 70 °C for 15 min, and then cooling to 4 °C) and second strand cDNA synthesis (4 °C for 1 min, 25 °C for 10 min, 50 °C for 30 min, 80 °C for 20 min and then cooling to 4 °C). RNAClean XP bead purification was performed. Single Primer Isothermal Amplification (SPIA) was used to amplify cDNAs. QIAquick cleanups (Qiagen) were eluted in 30 µl low EDTA TE buffer and quantified via Nanodrop 1000. 100 ng amplified SPIA cDNA was sonicated using a Covaris E210 (50 µl, duty cycle 10%, intensity 5, 200 burst/sec, 45 sec) to shear samples to 350bp. The libraries were prepared using the TruSeq DNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were purified using sample purification beads. End repair reaction (at 30 °C for 30 min) was followed by bead purification and size selection for 350bp insert. dA-tailing (37 °C for 30 min, 70 °C for 5 min, 4 °C for 5 min) and adapter ligation with barcoded adapters were performed (30 °C for 10 min), followed by bead purification and PCR amplification (95 °C for 3 min; 8 cycles of 98 °C for 20 sec, 60 °C for 15 sec and 72 °C for 30 sec; 72 °C for 5 min).

<p>Primary mixed glial cultures were prepared from P1 rat pups, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>). Briefly, cortices were isolated and digested with papain and DNase I, followed by mechanical dissociation. Cells were resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% (w/v) penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were plated in T75 flasks coated with poly-D-lysine and medium was replaced every other day. Under these conditions, a mixed population of glial cells survives and proliferates, but neuronal cells do not survive. After 7∼10 days, these mixed glial cultures were shaken overnight (14∼16 hours). Detached cells were added to uncoated petri dishes, to which microglia preferentially adhere but OPCs do not. The OPC-enriched supernatant was then plated on poly-D-lysine coated coverslips. OPCs were maintained in defined OPC media containing PDGF (10 ng/ml) and bFGF (5 ng/ml). The following day, fresh OPC medium was added, and the medium was refreshed every other day. To induce OPC differentiation, OPC medium was replaced by defined OL medium containing triiodothyronine (T3, 30 ng/ml and T4, 40 ng/ml), CNTF (10 ng/ml) and NT3 (1 ng/ml).</p>

<p>To quantify distribution of HA-tagged PATs in OL processes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), confocal images of HA (PAT) and GFP (cell fill) signal were thresholded. The same threshold values for each channel were used across all images. Using the Sync Windows tool in ImageJ/Fiji, the cell body area was traced in the GFP channel image and deleted from both images. Both images were then inverted and the ADD function was used to generate an image of the HA+/GFP+ signal. Using the Analyze particles tool (with settings 0-infinity pixels sq and 0.00-1.00 circularity), the combined area occupied by the HA+/GFP+ puncta was calculated and normalized to the total extra-somatic GFP+ area from the GFP+ image of the same cell.</p>

<p>In this work Jeong and colleagues focus on exploring the role of the acyltransferase ZDHHC9 in myelinating OLs in particular in the palmitoylation of several myelin proteins. After confirming the specific enrichment of the Zdhhc9 transcript in mouse and human OLs, the authors examine the subcellular localization of the protein in vitro and observed that in comparison with other isoforms, ZDHHC9 localizes at OLs cell bodies and at discrete puncta in the processes. These observations (Figures 1 and 2) led the authors to hypothesize that ZDHHC9 plays an important role in myelination. No gross changes were detected in OL development in Zdhhc9 KO mice and analyses from P28 Zdhhc9 KO mice crossed with Mobp-EGFP reporter mice did not show changes in EGFP+ OL differentiation (Figure 3). However, and given the observed subcellular localization of ZDHHC9 in OL processes (Figure 2) and the observation that the percentage of unmyelinated axons is increased in Zdhhc9 KO (Figure 6), early time points to examine the differentiated pools of OLs and their capacity to extend processes/contact axons need to be considered.</p>
<p>Maturation of OL in Zdhhc9 KO was examined by crossing Zdhhc9 KO with Pdgfra-CreER; R26- EGFP and following the newly EGFP-labelled OPCs following tamoxifen administration. No changes in the numbers of EGFP+ OL were detected. The authors concluded that the loss of ZDHHC9 does not alter oligodendrogenesis in either the young or mature CNS. The authors observed defects in Zdhhc9 KO OL protrusions that they attributed to abnormal OL membrane expansion (Fig 4 and 5). Can they show evidence for this?</p>
<p>The authors report that Zdhhc9 KO primary and secondary branches in OL were longer, some contained spheroid-like swellings and the OL protrusion complexity was higher. However, these data is partially contradictory to what they show in OL differentiation experiments in vitro (Fig 7). There is also no evidence for increased membrane expansion in Zdhhc9 knockdown myelin forming cells in culture. How to reconcile this?</p>

<p>This study provides an in-depth exploration of the impact of X-linked ZDHHC9 gene mutations on cognitive deficits and epilepsy, with a particular focus on the expression and function of ZDHHC9 in myelin-forming oligodendrocytes (OLs). These findings offer crucial insights into understanding ZDHHC9-related X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and shed light on the regulatory mechanisms of palmitoylation in myelination. The experimental design and analysis of results are convincing, providing a valuable reference for further research in this field. However, upon careful review, I believe the article still needs further improvement and supplementation in the following aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the subcellular localization experiment of ZDHHC9 mutants in OL, it is currently limited to in vitro cultured OL, lacking validation in vivo OL or myelin sheath. Additionally, it is necessary to investigate whether the abnormal subcellular localization of ZDHHC9 mutants affects their enzyme activity and palmitoylation modification of substrate proteins.</p>
<p>(2) The experimental period (P21+21 days) using genetic labeling to track the development of myelinating cells may not be long enough. It is recommended to extend the observation time and analyze at more time points to more comprehensively reflect the impact of Zdhhc9 KO.</p>
<p>(3) The author speculates that Zdhhc9 may regulate myelination by affecting the membrane localization of specific myelin proteins, but lacks direct experimental evidence to support this. It is suggested to detect the expression and distribution of relevant proteins in the myelin of Zdhhc9 KO mice.</p>
<p>(4) Although the article mentions the association of Zdhhc9 with intellectual disabilities, it does not involve behavioral analysis of Zdhhc9 KO mice. It is recommended to supplement some behavioral experimental data to support the important role of Zdhhc9 in maintaining normal cognitive function, enhancing the clinical relevance of the article.</p>
<p>(5) For the abnormal myelination observed in Zdhhc9 KO mice, including unmyelinated large-diameter axons and excessively myelinated small-diameter axons, the article lacks in-depth research and explanation on the exact mechanism and mode of action of ZDHHC9 in regulating myelination.</p>
<p>(6) The function of ZDHHC9 in OL may be related to the Golgi apparatus, but its exact role in these structures is still unclear. It is suggested to discuss in more detail the role of ZDHHC9 in the Golgi apparatus in the discussion section.</p>
<p>(7) More experimental support and in-depth research are needed on the detailed mechanism of how ZDHHC9 and Golga7 cooperatively regulate MBP palmitoylation, and how this decrease in palmitoylation level leads to myelination defects.</p>
<p>In summary, it is recommended that the authors address the above issues through additional experiments and improved discussions to further strengthen the credibility and clinical relevance of the article.</p>
