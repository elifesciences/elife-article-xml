<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Amyloid β (Aβ) forms aggregates in the Alzheimer’s disease brain and is well known for its pathological roles. Recent studies show that it also regulates neuronal physiology in the healthy brain. Whether Aβ also regulates glial physiology in the normal brain, however, has remained unclear. In this article, we describe the discovery of a novel signaling pathway activated by the monomeric form of Aβ that plays essential roles in the regulation of microglial activity and the assembly of neocortex during development. We find that activation of this pathway depends on the function of amyloid precursor (APP) and heterotrimeric G proteins in microglia and inhibits microglial immune activation at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Genetic disruption of this pathway during neocortical development results in microglial dysregulation and excessive matrix proteinase activation, leading to basement membrane degradation, neuronal ectopia, and laminar disruption. These results uncover a previously unknown function of Aβ as a negative regulator of brain microglia and substantially elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation. Considering the prominence of Aβ and neuroinflammation in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease, they also highlight a potentially overlooked role of Aβ monomer depletion in the development of the disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aβ, a core component of amyloid plaques in the Alzheimer’s disease brain, is well known to form oligomers under disease conditions. Studies have shown that the oligomers formed by Aβ are highly toxic, with wide-ranging effects including inhibition of neurotransmitter release, depletion of synaptic vesicle pools, disruption of postsynaptic organization and function, and impairment of multiple forms of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gulisano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lauren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lazarevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Parodi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Puzzo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Shankar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Walsh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Zott et al., 2019</xref>). These effects likely significantly underpin the pathogenic role of Aβ in Alzheimer’s disease and contribute to neuron loss and cognitive decline in patients. Besides its pathological roles, recent studies show that Aβ is also produced in the healthy brain by neurons in a neural activity-dependent manner and regulates the normal physiology of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cirrito et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fogel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Galanis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Garcia-Osta and Alberini, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gulisano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gulisano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Morley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Palmeri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Puzzo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). For example, consistent with studies showing that Aβ monomers and low molecular weight oligomers positively regulate synaptic function and plasticity, administration of these molecules in vivo has been found to improve learning and memory in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fogel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Garcia-Osta and Alberini, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gulisano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gulisano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Morley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Palmeri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Puzzo et al., 2008</xref>). Recent studies have further shown that Aβ monomers directly promote synapse formation and function and homeostatic plasticity, processes crucial to normal cognitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Galanis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kamenetz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Together, these findings have provided crucial insights into the physiological roles that Aβ plays in regulating normal neuronal function in the brain. However, it remains unclear if Aβ also regulates the physiology of glia, nonneuronal cells that also play important roles in normal brain function.</p>
<p>Microglia and astrocytes, two of the major glial cell types in the brain, are known to play critical roles in the normal development, function, and plasticity of the brain circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barres, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Schafer and Stevens, 2015</xref>). They coordinately regulate, among others, the spatiotemporally specific expression of immune cytokines in the brain that regulate numerous processes in brain circuit development, function, and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Zipp et al., 2023</xref>). For example, in the thalamus, a key relay station in the visual pathway, populations of astrocytes have been found to activate the expression of interleukin-33 in a neural activity-dependent manner, induce activity-dependent elimination of supernumerary synapses, and promote the maturation of the visual circuitry in early postnatal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Vainchtein et al., 2018</xref>). In the adult hippocampus, in contrast, astrocytes have been found to activate the expression of interleukin-33 under neuronal activity blockade and induce homeostatic synaptic plasticity that maintains circuit activity balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). In the striatum and the neocortex, not only have astrocytes but also have microglia been observed to activate the expression of TNFα upon changes in neural circuit activity and induce homeostatic synaptic plasticity that dampens circuit perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Heir et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lewitus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006</xref>). In the clinic, the induction of microglial release of cytokines such as TNFα also underpins the application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, a noninvasive brain stimulation technique frequently used to induce cortical plasticity and treat pharmaco-resistant depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Eichler et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, glial activation and brain cytokine elevation are key pathologic factors in disease development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Colonna and Butovsky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Patani et al., 2023</xref>). Elevated TNFα expression by microglia also underlies interneuron deficits and autism-like phenotype linked to maternal immune activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, the precise regulation of glial cytokine expression in the brain plays a key role in the normal development and function of the brain and its dysregulation is linked to common neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. However, how glial cytokine expression is mechanistically regulated by cell-cell communication in the brain have remained largely unknown.</p>
<p>In this article, we report the discovery of a novel microglial signaling pathway activated by Aβ, the neuron-produced peptide at the center of Alzheimer’s disease, that plays a crucial role in precisely regulating the levels of microglial cytokine expression and activity and ensuring the proper assembly of neuronal laminae during cerebral cortex development. We first came across this pathway in our study of the function of <italic>ric8</italic>a, a gene encoding a molecular chaperone for heterotrimeric G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gabay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Tall et al., 2003</xref>). We found that deletion of <italic>ric8a</italic> during cortical development resulted in cortical basement membrane degradation, neuronal ectopia, and laminar disruption. However, unlike in classic models of cobblestone lissencephaly, these phenotypes resulted not from <italic>ric8a</italic> deficiency in brain neural cell types, but from deficiency in microglia. The phenotypes also resemble those in mutants of amyloid precursor protein (APP) family and pathway genes. Indeed, we found that <italic>app</italic> deficiency in microglia also underpins ectopia formation in <italic>app</italic> family gene mutants. Furthermore, we found that APP and Ric8a form a functional pathway in microglia that is specifically activated by the monomeric form of Aβ and this pathway normally inhibits the transcriptional and post-transcriptional expression of immune cytokines by microglia.</p>

<title>Cortical ectopia in <italic>ric8a-emx1-cre</italic> mutants results from non-neural deficiency</title>
<p>To study of the function of <italic>ric8a</italic> in neocortical development, we deleted a conditional <italic>ric8a</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ma et al., 2017</xref>) using <italic>emx1-cre,</italic> a <italic>cre</italic> line designed to target dorsal forebrain neural progenitors in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gorski et al., 2002</xref>). We found it result in ectopia formation exclusively in the lateral cortex of the perinatal mutant brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-d</xref>). Birth-dating showed that the ectopia consisted of both early and late-born neurons (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 1</xref>). Consistent with this observation, neurons in the ectopia also stained positive for both Ctip2 and Cux1, genes specific to lower and upper-layer neurons, respectively. Interestingly, in cortical areas without ectopia, radial migration of early- and late-born neurons appeared largely normal as shown by birth-dating as well as Cux1 and Ctip2 staining (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>). This suggests that cell-autonomous defects in neurons are unlikely the cause of the ectopia. At E16.5, clear breaches in the pial basement membrane of the developing cortex were already apparent (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 3</xref>). However, unlike classic models of cobblestone lissencephaly, where radial glial fibers typically retract, radial glial fibers in <italic>ric8a</italic> mutants instead extended beyond the breaches. This argues against radial glial cell adhesion defects since they would be predicted to retract. Furthermore, in areas without ectopia, we also observed normal localization of Cajal-Retzius cells, expression of Reelin, and splitting of the preplate, arguing against primary defects in Cajal-Retzius cells. In cobblestone lissencephaly, studies show that ectopia result from primary defects in radial glial maintenance of the pial basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beggs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Graus-Porta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Moore et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Satz et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>ric8a</italic> mutants, we observed large numbers of basement membrane breaches at E14.5, almost all associated with ectopia (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 4</xref>). In contrast, at E13.5, although we also observed significant numbers of breaches, none was associated with ectopia. This indicates that basement membrane breaches similarly precede ectopia in <italic>ric8a</italic> mutants. However, at E12.5, despite a complete lack of basement membrane breaches, we observed increased numbers of laminin-positive debris across the lateral cortex, both beneath basement membrane segments with intact laminin staining and beneath segments with disrupted laminin staining, the latter presumably sites of future breach (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 5</xref>). As a major basement membrane component, the increased amounts of laminin debris suggest increased degradative activity within the developing cortex. Thus, these results indicate that excessive basement membrane degradation, but not defective maintenance, is likely a primary cause of cortical ectopia in <italic>ric8a</italic> mutants.</p>

<p>To determine the cell type(s) genetically responsible for cortical basement membrane degradation and ectopia in <italic>ric8a</italic> mutants, we employed a panel of <italic>cre</italic> lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e-h’</xref>). To target Cajal-Retzius cells, we employed <italic>wnt3a-cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Yoshida et al., 2006</xref>) but found <italic>ric8a</italic> deletion using <italic>wnt3a-cre</italic> did not result in ectopia. To target postmitotic excitatory and inhibitory neurons, we employed <italic>nex-cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Goebbels et al., 2006</xref>) and <italic>dlx5/6-cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Stenman et al., 2003</xref>) respectively but similarly found neither result in ectopia. These results point to <italic>ric8a</italic> requirement in cell types other than post-mitotic neurons. To test the involvement of neural progenitors, we employed <italic>nestin-cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Graus-Porta et al., 2001</xref>). Previous studies show that deletion of <italic>β1 integrin</italic> and related genes by <italic>emx1-cre</italic> and <italic>nestin-cre</italic> results in similar ectopia phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Belvindrah et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Graus-Porta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Huang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Niewmierzycka et al., 2005</xref>). To our surprise, deletion of <italic>ric8a</italic> by <italic>nestin-cre</italic> did not result in ectopia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ma et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g-g’</xref>). Since <italic>nestin-cre</italic>-mediated deletion in neural progenitors is inherited by post-mitotic neurons and astrocytes, this indicates that the combined deletion of <italic>ric8a</italic> from all these cell types does not lead to ectopia. The onset of <italic>nestin-cre</italic> expression is, however, developmentally slightly later than that of <italic>emx1-cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gorski et al., 2002</xref>). To assess the potential contribution of this temporal difference, we employed <italic>foxg1-cre</italic>, a <italic>cre</italic> line expressed in forebrain neural progenitors starting from E10.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hebert and McConnell, 2000</xref>). We found that <italic>ric8a</italic> deletion using <italic>foxg1-cre</italic> still failed to produce ectopia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h-h’</xref>). Thus, these results strongly argue against the interpretation that <italic>ric8a</italic> deficiency in neural cell lineages is responsible for basement membrane degradation and ectopia in <italic>ric8a</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>During embryogenesis, the neural tube undergoes epithelial-mesenchymal transition giving rise to neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Leathers and Rogers, 2022</xref>). This process involves region-specific basement membrane breakdown that resembles the <italic>ric8a</italic> mutant phenotype. To determine if ectopic epithelial-mesenchymal transition plays a role, we examined potential changes in neuro-epithelial cell fates in the mutant cortex. We found that cortical neural progenitors expressed Pax6, Nestin, and Vimentin normally (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 6</xref>). Cell proliferation in the ventricular zone was also normal. Furthermore, although <italic>ric8a</italic> regulates asymmetric cell division in invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Afshar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Couwenbergs et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">David et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hampoelz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), we observed no significant defects in mitotic spindle orientation at the ventricular surface. Additionally, no ectopic expression of neural crest markers or Wnt pathway activation was observed (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 7</xref>). Altogether, these results further indicate that non-neural-cell deficiency is responsible for ectopia formation in <italic>ric8a</italic> mutants.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Microglial <italic>ric8a</italic> deficiency is responsible for ectopia formation</title>
<p>To assess the role of non-neural cell types, we turned our attention to microglia since RNA-seq studies show that brain microglia express <italic>emx1</italic> at a significant level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). To determine if <italic>emx1-cre</italic> is expressed and active in microglia, we isolated microglia from <italic>ric8a-emx1-cre</italic> mutants. We found that <italic>emx1-cre</italic> mediated <italic>ric8a</italic> deletion indeed resulted in altered cytokine expression in microglia (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 8</xref>). This indicate that <italic>emx1-cre</italic> is expressed and active in microglia and deletes <italic>ric8a</italic>. To determine the specific significance of <italic>ric8a</italic> deletion from microglia alone, we next employed a microglia-specific <italic>cx3cr1-cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Yona et al., 2013</xref>). Like <italic>emx1-cre</italic> mutants, <italic>ric8a-cx3cr1-cre</italic> mutant microglia also showed elevated cytokine secretion and transcription in comparison to control microglia upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-b</xref>). Similar results were also obtained with stimulation by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), an intracellular immune activator. Thus, these results indicate that <italic>ric8a</italic> deficiency in microglia results in broad increases in microglial sensitivity to immune stimulation.</p>

<p>To determine if microglial <italic>ric8a</italic> deficiency alone is sufficient to cause cortical ectopia in vivo, we examined <italic>ric8a-cx3cr1-cre</italic> mutants but found that it did not affect either basement membrane integrity or cortical layering (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). We reasoned that this may be related to the fact that <italic>ric8a</italic> mutant microglia only show heightened activity upon stimulation but not under basal unstimulated conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-b</xref>) but elevated microglial activity may be needed for basement membrane degradation and ectopia formation. To test this possibility, we employed in utero LPS administration to activate microglia during cortical development. We found that over 50% of <italic>ric8a-cx3cr1-cre</italic> mutant neonates showed ectopia when administered LPS at E11.5-12.5 (10 of 19 mutant neonates examined) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). In contrast, no cortical ectopia were observed in any of the 32 littermate controls that were similarly administered LPS. This indicates that only the combination of microglial <italic>ric8a</italic> deficiency and immune activation leads to ectopia formation. In <italic>emx1-cre</italic> mutants, ectopia develop without LPS administration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We suspect that this may be due to concurrent <italic>ric8a</italic> deficiency in neural cell types, which may result in deficits that mimic immune stimulation. To test this, we next additionally deleted <italic>ric8a</italic> from neural cells in the <italic>ric8a</italic>-<italic>cx3cr1-cre</italic> microglial mutant background by introducing <italic>nestin-cre</italic>. We have shown that <italic>ric8a</italic> deletion by <italic>nestin-cre</italic> alone does not result in ectopia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g-g’</xref>). However, we found that, like deletion by <italic>emx1-cre</italic>, <italic>ric8a</italic> deletion by the dual <italic>cre</italic> combination of <italic>cx3cr1-cre</italic> and <italic>nestin-cre</italic> also resulted in ectopia in all double <italic>cre</italic> mutants (6 of 6 examined) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Thus, these results indicate that elevated immune activation of <italic>ric8a</italic> deficient microglia during cortical development is responsible for ectopia formation.</p>

<title>Microglial <italic>app</italic> deficiency also results in ectopia formation</title>
<p>The exclusive localization of ectopia to the lateral cortex in <italic>ric8a</italic> mutants is reminiscent of the phenotypes observed in APP family and pathway mutants including <italic>app/aplp1/2</italic> triple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Herms et al., 2004</xref>) and <italic>apbb1/2</italic> double knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Guenette et al., 2006</xref>). Independent studies also point to a role of non-neural cells in ectopia formation in these mutants. For example, unlike the triple knockout, specific <italic>app</italic> knockdown in cortical neurons during development results in under- but not over-migration of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Young-Pearse et al., 2007</xref>). To test the role of microglia in ecotopia formation in APP pathway mutants, we first analyzed <italic>app</italic> mutant microglia. To this end, we employed <italic>cx3cr1-cre</italic> to delete a conditional allele of <italic>app</italic> from microglia and found that microglia cultured from <italic>app</italic>-<italic>cx3cr1-cre</italic> mutants showed reduced TNFα and IL-6 secretion as well as muted IL-6 transcription upon stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 9</xref>). This indicates that <italic>app</italic> plays a previously unrecognized, cell-autonomous role in microglia in regulating microglial activity. Microglia exhibit attenuated immune response following chronic stimulation, especially when carrying strong loss-of-function mutations in anti-inflammatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chamberlain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Sayed et al., 2018</xref>). We suspect that the attenuated response by <italic>app</italic> mutant microglia may result from similar effects following in vitro culture. To test effects of <italic>app</italic> mutation under conditions that more closely resemble in vivo conditions, we next isolated fresh, unelicited peritoneal macrophages and acutely analyzed their response to immune stimulation. We found that <italic>app</italic> mutant macrophages showed significantly elevated secretion of all cytokines tested (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). At the transcriptional level, mRNA induction was also increased for all cytokines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Thus, like that of <italic>ric8a</italic>, the normal function of <italic>app</italic> also appears to be to suppress the inflammatory activation of microglia.</p>

<p>To determine if microglial <italic>app</italic> deficiency is also responsible for ectopia formation in <italic>app</italic> triple knockout mutants, we next asked if activating microglia in microglia-specific <italic>app</italic> mutants similarly results in pial ectopia during cortical development. To this end, we administered LPS in utero at E11.5-12.5 to <italic>app-cx3cr1-cre</italic> mutant animals as we did to <italic>ric8a-cx3cr1-cre</italic> mutants above. We found that, while none of the 81 littermate controls administered LPS showed ectopia, a significant number of mutant neonates showed ectopia (6 of 31 neonates examined, ∼19%) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Thus, <italic>app</italic> deficient microglia, when activated, also results in cortical ectopia during development. The reduced severity of the ectopia observed, as compared to that in <italic>ric8a/cx3cr1-cre</italic> mutants, likely in part results from the reduced LPS dosage (by ∼3 folds) we had to use in these animas due to the enhanced immune sensitivity of their strain genetic background. Other <italic>app</italic> gene family members are also expressed in microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) and may in addition compensate for the loss of APP. Thus, these results indicate that <italic>app</italic> normally plays a cell-autonomous role in microglia that negatively regulate microglial activation and its loss of function underlies ectopia formation. The similarities between <italic>app</italic> and <italic>ric8a</italic> mutant phenotypes suggest that they form a previously unknown anti-inflammatory pathway in microglia.</p>

<title>Monomeric Aβ suppresses microglial inflammatory activation via APP and Ric8a</title>
<p>The possibility that <italic>app</italic> and <italic>ric8a</italic> may form a novel anti-inflammatory pathway in microglia raises questions on the identity of the ligands for the pathway. Several molecules have been reported to bind to APP and/or activate APP-dependent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fogel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Milosch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Rice et al., 2012</xref>), among which Aβ is note-worthy for its nanomolar direct binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fogel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Shaked et al., 2006</xref>). Aβ oligomers and fibrils have been shown by numerous studies to be pro-inflammatory, while non-fibrillar Aβ lack such activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Halle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Huang, 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Lorton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Muehlhauser et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Tan et al., 1999</xref>). In contrast, when employed under conditions that favor the monomer conformation, Aβ inhibits T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Grant et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that, unlike Aβ oligomers, Aβ monomers may be anti-inflammatory. To test this possibility, we dissolved Aβ40 peptides in DMSO, which has been shown to preserve the monomeric conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">LeVine, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Stine et al., 2011</xref>). We found that Aβ monomers as prepared potently suppressed the secretion of large numbers of cytokines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 10</xref>) and showed similar effects on microglia no matter if they were activated by LPS or poly I:C (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). We also found that the Aβ monomers similarly strongly inhibited the induction of cytokines at the transcriptional level (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 10</xref>). In addition, we observed these effects with Aβ40 peptides from different commercial sources. Thus, these results indicate that monomeric Aβ possesses a previously unreported anti-inflammatory activity against microglia that strongly inhibits microglial inflammatory activation.</p>

<p>To determine whether monomeric Aβ signals through APP, we employed <italic>app-cx3cr1-cre</italic> mutant microglia. We found that, unlike that of control microglia, Aβ monomers failed to suppress the secretion of all tested cytokines by <italic>app</italic> mutant microglia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>, <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 10</xref>). Interestingly, this blockade appeared to be specific to <italic>app</italic> since Aβ monomers still significantly suppressed cytokine secretion by <italic>aplp2</italic> mutant microglia. At the transcriptional level, Aβ monomers also failed to suppress cytokine induction in <italic>app</italic> mutant microglia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 10</xref>). Together, these results indicate that APP is functionally required in microglia for Aβ monomer inhibition of cytokine expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Cultured microglia from <italic>app-cx3cr1-</italic>cre mutants showed attenuated immune activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). To assess whether this may affect the efficacy of Aβ monomer inhibition, we next tested the response of fresh, unelicited macrophages. We found that, like that of control microglia, cytokine secretion by control macrophages was also strongly suppressed by Aβ monomers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>, <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 10</xref>). However, even though <italic>app</italic> mutant macrophages showed elevated response to immune stimulation in comparison to control macrophages, they still failed to respond to Aβ monomers and displayed levels of cytokine secretion that were indistinguishable from those of DMSO-treated cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>, <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 10</xref>). Thus, these results further indicate that APP function is required in microglia for mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of Aβ monomers.</p>
<p>The similarity of <italic>ric8a</italic> ectopia to <italic>app</italic> ectopia phenotype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) also suggests that Ric8a functions in the same pathway as APP in mediating Aβ monomer anti-inflammatory signaling in microglia. This is consistent with previous studies showing that heterotrimeric G proteins are coupled to APP and mediate APP intracellular signaling in vitro and vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fogel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Milosch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Nishimoto et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Ramaker et al., 2013</xref>) and that Ric8a is a molecular chaperone essential for the post-translational stability of heterotrimeric G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gabay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Tall et al., 2003</xref>). To directly test if Ric8a is part of this pathway, we next employed <italic>ric8a-cx3cr1-cre</italic> mutant microglia. We found that, indeed, like that of <italic>app</italic> mutant microglia, Aβ monomers also failed to suppress the secretion of TNFα and IL-6 by <italic>ric8a</italic> mutant microglia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). This indicates that heterotrimeric G proteins function is likely required in the same pathway of APP in microglia for the suppression of TNFα and IL-6 secretion. However, unlike APP, we found that Ric8a appears to be dispensable for Aβ monomer regulation of other cytokines. For example, unlike that of TNFα and IL-6, Aβ monomers still suppressed IL-1β secretion by <italic>ric8a</italic> mutant microglia (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 10</xref>). It also appears to be dispensable for the regulation of cytokine transcription since Aβ monomers similarly suppressed IL-6 transcriptional induction in both control and <italic>ric8a</italic> mutant microglia. These results suggest that heterotrimeric G proteins function may only mediate some of the anti-inflammatory signaling of monomeric Aβ. Thus, APP and Ric8a-regulated heterotrimeric G proteins form part of a novel anti-inflammatory pathway activated by monomeric Aβ in microglia.</p>

<title>Elevated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) cause basement membrane degradation</title>
<p>We have shown that heightened microglial activation due to mutation in the Aβ monomer-activated APP/Ric8a pathway results in basement membrane degradation and ectopia during cortical development. To further test this interpretation, we sought to test the prediction that inhibition of microglial activation in these mutants suppressed the formation ectopia. To this end, we employed dorsomorphin and S3I-201, inhibitors targeting Akt, Stat3, and other mediators in pro-inflammatory signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Qin et al., 2012</xref>).

<p>Under neuroinflammatory conditions, brain cytokines frequently induce MMPs, which lead to breakdown of the extracellular matrix and contribute to disease pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Pagenstecher et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Wang et al., 2000</xref>). Since <italic>ric8a</italic> mutant microglia are hyperactive in inflammatory cytokine production, we wonder if induction of MMPs may underlie the laminin degradation and cortical basement membrane break observed in <italic>ric8a</italic> mutants. To test this, we examined the activities of MMP2 and MMP9 in the developing cortex using gelatin gel zymography. We found that the activity of MMP9 in the mutant cortex was significantly increased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i</xref>, <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 12</xref>). In contrast, that activity of MMP2 remained unaffected.

To test if the increased MMP activity is responsible for the ectopia observed, we next employed BB94, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of MMPs. We found that BB94 administration significantly suppress both the number and the size of the ectopia in <italic>ric8a</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5j-m</xref>). To narrow down the identity of MMPs responsible, we further employed an inhibitor specific for MMP9 and 13 and found that it similarly suppressed both the number and the size of the ectopia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5l-m</xref>). Furthermore, consistent with its near complete suppression of cortical ectopia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a-f</xref>), we found that the co-administration of dorsomorphin and S3I-201 also reduced MMP9 activity in the mutant cortex to the control level (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig. 12</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The spatiotemporal expression of immune cytokines by glial cells in the brain plays critical roles in the normal development, function, and plasticity of the brain circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barres, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Schafer and Stevens, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Zipp et al., 2023</xref>). In this article, we have identified a novel microglial anti-inflammatory pathway activated by monomeric Aβ that inhibits microglial cytokine expression and plays essential roles in the normal development of the cerebral cortex. We have found that this pathway is mediated by APP and heterotrimeric G proteins in microglia and its activation leads to the inhibition of microglial cytokine induction at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). We further show that a key function of this pathway is to suppress the activity of MMP9 during corticogenesis and disruption of this regulation results in cortical basement membrane degradation and neuronal ectopia development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Furthermore, we find that this pathway is activated specifically by the monomeric form of Aβ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), identifying, for the first time, an isoform specific activity of Aβ against microglia. These results provide novel insights into the neuron-glia communication mechanisms that coordinate the regulation of immune cytokines, key regulators of Hebbian and non-Hebbian synaptic plasticity, by glial cells in the brain. The discovery of the novel activity of monomeric Aβ as a negative microglial regulator may also facilitate the further elucidation of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Microglial activity regulation during cortical development</title>
<p>Among the glial cell populations in the brain, astrocytes and oligodendrocyte are both born within the nervous system at the end of cortical neurogenesis. As such, they play limited roles in the early steps of cortical development. In contrast, microglia are not only of a distinct non-neural lineage that originates from outside the nervous system but also begin to populate the brain at the onset of corticogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ginhoux et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hattori et al., 2023</xref>). As such, they play unique roles throughout cortical development. Indeed, microglial activity has been found to regulate the size of the cortical neural precursor pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cunningham et al., 2013</xref>). Microglia-secreted cytokines have also been found to promote both neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Shigemoto-Mogami et al., 2014</xref>). As such, the precise regulation of microglial activity is critical to the normal development of the neocortex from an early stage. In this study, we have shown that immune over-activation of microglia due to disruption of a monomeric Aβ-activated pathway results in excessive cortical matrix proteinase activation, leading basement membrane degradation and neuronal ectopia. Previous studies have shown that reductions in the expression of microglial immune and chemotaxis genes instead lead to the failure of microglia to populate the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Iyer et al., 2022</xref>). These results together thus highlight the importance of precisely regulating the level of microglial activity during brain development. The dramatic destructive effects of microglial hyperactivity we have observed during corticogenesis also foreshadow the critical roles it plays in brain dysfunction and disease at later stages of life.</p>
<p>In this study, we have also shown that the anti-inflammatory regulation of microglia in corticogenesis depends on a pathway composed of APP and Ric8a-regulated heterotrimeric G proteins. This has revealed new insight into the intercellular signaling mechanisms regulating microglial activity in the brain. Heterotrimeric G proteins are well-known mediators of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. In this study, we have found that they also function in the same pathway as APP. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to report an in vivo anti-inflammatory function of this pathway in microglia and has significantly advanced knowledge in microglial biology. This is also consistent with previous studies showing that heterotrimeric G proteins interact with the APP cytoplasmic domain and mediate APP signaling from invertebrates to mammals in several other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fogel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Milosch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Nishimoto et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Ramaker et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we have in addition shown that this pathway is specifically activated by the monomeric form of Aβ, a peptide produced by neurons in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cirrito et al., 2005</xref>), providing further insight into the biological function of this pathway. In the early cortex, neurogenesis is just beginning, and most neurons born are in an immature state. It is unclear if this pathway is activated by Aβ at this stage. However, studies have shown that other APP ligands such as pancortin, a member of the olfactomedin family proteins known to inhibit innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), are expressed in the cortex at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Rice et al., 2012</xref>). It will be interesting to determine if these innate immune regulators play a role in regulating this pathway.</p>

<title>Neuronal activity, glial cytokine expression, and brain circuit plasticity</title>
<p>Activity-dependent competitive and homeostatic plasticity is a foundational rule that regulates the development, maturation, and function of neural circuits across brain regions. Studies have shown that glial cells, through regulating the spatiotemporal expression of immune cytokines, play a pivotal role in this process. In the developing thalamus, by activating interleukin-33 expression in an activity-dependent manner, astrocytes have been found to promote the segregation of eye-specific axonal projection and the maturation of the visual circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">He et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Vainchtein et al., 2018</xref>). In the visual cortex, astrocytic expression of TNFα similarly mediates activity-dependent homeostatic upscaling of cortical synapses following peripheral monocular deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barnes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Heir et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kaneko et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we have shown that Aβ monomers inhibit expression of cytokines by brain microglia via a novel APP/heterotrimeric G protein-mediated pathway. Aβ is primarily produced by neurons in the brain in a neural activity-dependent manner and form oligomers when large quantities are produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cirrito et al., 2005</xref>). Aβ oligomers, in contrary to monomers, are proinflammatory and increase glial cytokine expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Halle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Huang, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Lorton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Muehlhauser et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Tan et al., 1999</xref>). These findings thus suggest that different levels of neural circuit activity in the brain may differentially regulate glial cytokine expression through inducing different levels of Aβ. High levels of neural activity may lead to high levels of Aβ and the formation of Aβ oligomers that activate glial cytokine production, while low levels of neural activity may produce low levels of Aβ, maintain Aβ as monomers, and inhibit glial cytokine production. Thus, Aβ in the brain may not only be a reporter of the levels of neural circuit activity but may also serve as an agent that directly mediate activity level-dependent plasticity. Following sensory deprivation, for example, Aβ levels may be lowered due to loss of sensory stimulation. This may lead to the relief of monomeric Aβ inhibition of cytokines such as TNFα and as a result trigger homeostatic upscaling of cortical synapses in the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barnes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Heir et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kaneko et al., 2008</xref>). In contrary, when neural activity levels are high, large quantities of Aβ may be produced, leading to formation of Aβ oligomers that may in turn induce expression of cytokines such as IL-33 that promote synaptic pruning. A large body of evidence strongly indicates that Aβ and related pathways indeed mediate homeostatic and competitive plasticity in the visual and other systems of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Galanis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Huang, 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kamenetz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Our discovery of the Aβ monomer-activated pathway has therefore provided novel insights into a universal mechanism that senses neural circuit activity pattern and translates it into homeostatic and competitive synaptic changes in the brain, a mechanism with fundamental roles in cognitive function.</p>
<p>In this study, we have also found that the matrix proteinase MMP9 is a key downstream effector of microglial activity in the developing cortex. We find that microglial hyperactivity results in increased levels of MMP9, leading to cortical basement membrane degradation and neuronal ectopia and inhibiting MMP9 directly or indirectly suppresses the phenotype. This suggests that the regulation of MMP9 may be a key mechanism by which glial cells regulate brain development and plasticity. Indeed, independent studies have shown that, in the visual cortex, MMP9 is also a pivotal mediator of TNFα-dependent homeostatic upscaling of central synapses following monocular deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akol et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kaneko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kelly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Spolidoro et al., 2012</xref>). In the Xenopus tectum, MMP9 has similarly been found to be induced by neural activity and promote visual activity-induced dendritic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gore et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, in both wildtype and amblyopic animals, light reintroduction after dark exposure has been found to reactivate plasticity in the adult visual cortex via MMP9, uncovering a potential treatment for common visual conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Murase et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Murase et al., 2019</xref>). These results therefore highlight a conserved glia/cytokine/MMP9-mediated mechanism that regulates brain development and plasticity from embryogenesis to adulthood. In ocular dominance plasticity, MMP9 is activated at perisynaptic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Murase et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Murase et al., 2019</xref>). MMP9 mRNA translation has been also observed in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dziembowska et al., 2012</xref>). In the <italic>ric8a</italic> mutant cortex, we find that MMP9 activity is increased. Further studies are required to determine the cellular sources of MMP9 and how its activity is regulated.</p>

<title>Aβ monomer anti-inflammatory activity and Alzheimer’s disease</title>
<p>Aβ is well known as a component of the amyloid plaques in the Alzheimer’s disease brain. It is a unique amphipathic peptide that can, dependent on concentration and other conditions, remain as monomers or form oligomers. Studies on Aβ have historically focused on the neurotoxic effects of Aβ oligomers and their proinflammatory effects on glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gulisano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Halle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Huang, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lauren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lazarevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Lorton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Muehlhauser et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Parodi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Puzzo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Shankar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Tan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Walsh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Zott et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we have found that, in contrary to Aβ oligomers, Aβ monomers instead possess a previously unknown anti-inflammatory activity that acts through a unique microglial pathway. We have further found that genetic disruption of this pathway in corticogenesis results microglial hyperactivity, leading to neuronal ectopia and large disruption of cortical structural organization. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to uncover this overlooked anti-inflammatory activity of Aβ monomers. It is in alignment with recent studies showing that Aβ monomers are also directly protective to neurons and positively regulate synapse development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Galanis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Giuffrida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Plant et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Ramsden et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Assuming a set amount of Aβ peptides, the formation of Aβ oligomers and aggregates in the brain would, by chemical law, be predicted to result in the depletion of Aβ monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dear et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Michaels et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, in the Alzheimer’s disease brain, besides the obvious formation of Aβ aggregates, there may also be a less visible depletion of Aβ monomers taking place at the same time, which may, like Aβ oligomers, also contribute to the development of neuroinflammation and neuronal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Huang, 2023</xref>). In support of this interpretation, high soluble brain Aβ42, which likely also means high levels of Aβ monomers in the brain, have been found in clinical studies to preserve cognition in patients of both familial and sporadic Alzheimer’s disease, in spite of increasing amyloidosis detected in their brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Espay et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Sturchio et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Sturchio et al., 2021</xref>). In our study, we have also found that the effects of microglial disinhibition are mediated by MMP9. Importantly, in neurodegenerative diseases, MMP9 has been similarly found to be a key determinant regulatings the selective degeneration of neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kaplan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Tran et al., 2019</xref>). MMP9 levels are also upregulated in the plasma in both mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bruno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Lorenzl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Tsiknia et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, in several motor neuron disease models, reducing MMP9 has been found to protect neurons and delay the loss of motor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kaplan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Spiller et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, our study has not only uncovered a potentially overlooked role of Aβ monomer depletion in the development of Alzheimer’s disease but also identified downstream effectors. Elucidating the roles these factors play may reveal new insight into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors want to elucidate which are the mechanisms that regulate the immune response in physiological conditions in cortical development. To achieve this goal, authors used a wide range of mutant mice to analyse the consequences of immune activation in the formation of cortical ectopia in mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrated that Abeta monomers are anti-inflammatory and inhibit microglial activation. This is a novel result that demonstrates the physiological role of APP in cortical development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>-On the other hand, cortical ectopia has been already described in mouse models in which the amyloid signalling has been disrupted (Herms et al., 2004; Guenette et al., 2006), making the current study less novel.</p>
<p>One of the molecules analysed is Ric8a, a GTPase activator involved in neuronal development. Authors used the conditional mutant mice Emx1-Ric8a to delete Ric8a from early progenitors and glutamatergic neurons in the pallium. Emx1-Ric8a mutant mice present cortical ectopias and authors attributed this malformation to the increase in inflammatory response due to Ric8a deletion in microglia. Several discordances do not fit this interpretation:</p>
<p>-The role of Ric8a in cortical development and function has been already described in several papers, but none of them has been cited in the current manuscript (Kask et al., 2015, 2018; Ruisu et al., 2013; Tonissoo et al., 2006).</p>
<p>-Ectopia formation in the cortex has been already described in Nestin-Ric8a cKO mice (Kask et al., 2015). In the current manuscript, authors analyzed the same mutant mice (Nestin-Ric8a), but they did not detect any ectopia. Authors should discuss this discordance.</p>
<p>-Authors claim that microglia express Emx1, and therefore, Ric8a is deleted in microglia cells. However, the arguments for this assumption are very weak and the evidence suggests that this is not the case. This is an important point considering that authors want to emphasise the role of Ric8a in microglia activation, and therefore, additional experiments should demonstrate that Ric8a is deleted in microglia in Emx1-Ric8a mutant mice.</p>

<p>Kwon et al. used several conditional KO mice for the deletion of ric8a or app in different cell types. Some of them exhibited pial basement membrane breaches leading to neuronal ectopia in the neocortex.</p>
<p>They first investigated ric8a, a Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor for Heterotrimeric G Proteins. They observed the above-mentioned phenotype when ric8a is deleted from microglia and neural cells (ric8a-emx1-cre or dual deletion with cre combination cx3cr1 (in microglia) and nestin (in neural cells)) but not in microglia alone or neural cells alone (whether it is in CR cells (ric8a-Wnt3a-cre), post-mitotic neurons (nex-cre or dlx5/6-cre), or in progenitors and their progeny (nestin-cre or foxg1-cre). They also show that ric8a KO mutant microglia cells stimulated in vitro by LPS exhibit an increased TNFa, IL6 and IL1b secretion compared to controls (Fig 2). They therefore injected LPS in vivo and observed the neuronal ectopia phenotype in the ric8a-cx3cr1-cre (microglial deletion) cortices at P0 (Fig 2). They suggest that ric8a KO in neuronal cells mimics immune stimulation (but we have no clue how ric8a KO in neural cells would induce immune stimulation).</p>
<p>The authors then turned their attention on APP. They observed neuronal ectopia into the marginal zone when APP is deleted in microglia (app-cxcr3-cre) + intraperitoneal LPS injection (they did not show it, but we have to assume there would not be a phenotype without the injection of LPS) (Fig 3). (The phenotype is similar but not identical to ric8a-cx3cr1-cre + LPS. They suggest that the reason is because they had to inject 3 times less LPS due to enhanced immune sensitivity in this genetic background but it is only a hypothesis). After in vitro stimulation by LPS, app mutant microglia show a reduced secretion of TNFa and IL6 but not IL1b (this is the opposite to ric8a-cx3cr1-cre microglia cells) while peritoneal macrophages in culture show increased secretion of TNFa, IL1, IL6 and IL23 (fig 3 and Suppl. Fig 9).</p>
<p>Amyloid beta (Ab) being one of the molecules binding to APP, the authors showed that Ab40 monomers (they did not test Ab40 oligomers) partially inhibit cytokines (TNFa, IL6, IL1b, MCP-1, IL23a, IL10) secretion in vitro by microglia stimulated by LPS but does not affect secretion by microglia from app-cx3cr1-cre (tested for TNFa, IL6, IL1b, IL23a, IL10) (Fig 4, Suppl fig 10) (but still does it in aplp2-cx3cr1-cre) and does not affect secretion by ric8a-cx3cr1-cre microglia (tested for TNFa and IL6 but still suppress IL1b) (Therefore here is another difference between app and ric8a KO microglia).</p>
<p>The authors injected inhibitors of Akt or Stat3 in the ric8a-emx1-cre cortex and found it suppressed neuronal ectopia (Fig 5, Suppl fig 11). It is not clear whether it suppresses immune stimulation from neuronal cells or immune reaction from microglia cells.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors examined the activities of MMP2 and MMP9 in the developing cortex using gelatin gel zymography. The activity and protein levels of MMP9 but not MMP2 in the ric8a-emx1-cre cortex were claimed significantly increased (Fig 5, Suppl fig 12). Unfortunately, they did not show it in the app-cx3cr1-cre +LPS mouse. They make a connection between ric8a deletion and MMP9 but unfortunately do not make the connection between app deletion and MMP9, which is at the center of the pathway claimed to be important here). Then they injected BB94, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of MMPs or an inhibitor specific for MMP9 and 13. They both significantly suppress the number and the size of the ectopia in ric8a mutants (Fig5).</p>
<p>After reading the manuscript, I still do not know how ric8a in neural cells is involved in the immune inhibition. Is it through the control of Ab monomers? In addition, the authors did not show in vivo data supporting that Ab monomers are the key players here. As the authors said, this is not the only APP interactor. Finally, I still do not know how ric8a is linked to APP in microglia in the model.</p>
<p>While several of the findings presented in this manuscript are of potential interest, there are a number of shortcomings. Here are some suggestions that could improve the manuscript and help substantiate the conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) As the title suggests it, the focus is on Ab and APP functions in microglia. However, the analysis is more focused on ric8a. The connection between ric8a and APP in this study is not investigated, besides the fact that their deletion induces somewhat similar but not identical phenotypes. Showing a similar phenotype is not enough to conclude that they are working on the same pathway. The authors should find a way to make that connection between ric8a and app in the cells investigated here.</p>
<p>(2) This would help to show the appearance of breaches in the pial basement membrane leading to neuronal ectopia; to investigate laminin debris, cell identity, Wnt pathway for app-cxcr3-cre + LPS injection as you did for ric8a-emx1-cre.</p>
<p>(3) As a control, this would help to show that app-cxcr3-cre without the LPS injection does not display the phenotype.</p>
<p>(4) This would help to show the activity and protein levels of MMP9 and MMP2 and perform the rescue experiments with the inhibitors in the app-cx3cr1-cre cortex +LPS.</p>
<p>(5) Is MMP9 secreted by microglia cells or neural cells?</p>
<p>(6) The in vitro evidence indicates that one of the multiple APP interactors, ie Ab40 monomers, is less effective in suppressing the expression of some cytokines by microglia cells mutants for ric8a (TNFa and IL6 but still suppress IL1b) or APP (TNFa, IL6, IL1b, IL23a, IL10) when compared to WT. But there are other interactors for APP. In order to support the claim, it seems crucial to have in vivo data to show that Ab40 monomers are the molecules involved in preventing the breach in the pial basement membrane.</p>
<p>(7) In order to claim that this is specific to Ab40 monomers and not oligomers, it is necessary to show that the Ab40 oligomers do not have the same effect in vitro and in vivo. Also, an assay should be done to show that your Ab preparations are pure monomers or oligomers.</p>
<p>(8) Most of the cytokine secretion assays used microglia cells in culture. Two results draw my attention. Ric8a deletion increases TNFa and IL6 secretion after LPS stimulation in vitro on microglia cells while app deletion decreases their secretion. Then later, papers show that the decrease in IL1b induced by Ab on microglia cells is prevented by APP deletion but not ric8a deletion. Those two pieces of data suggest that ric8a and APP might not be in the same pathway. In addition, the phenotype from app-cxcr3-cre + LPS injection and ric8a-cxcr3-cre + LPS injection are not exactly the same. It could be due to the level of LPS as the author suggests or it might not be. More experiments are needed to prove they are in the same pathway.</p>
<p>(9) How do the authors reconcile the reduced TNFa and IL6 secretion upon stimulation of app mutant microglia with the model where app is attenuating immune response in vivo? Line 213 says that microglia exhibit attenuated immune response following chronic stimulation but I don't know if 3 hours of LPS in vitro is a chronic stimulation.</p>
<p>(10) Line 119: In their model, the authors suggest that there is a breach in pial basement membrane but that the phenotype is different from the retraction of the radial fibers due to reduced adhesion. So, could the author discuss to what substrate the radial fibers are attached to, in their model where the pial surface is destroyed?</p>
<p>(11) The authors should show that the increased cytokine secretion observed in vitro is also happening in vivo in ric8a-emx1-cre compared to WT mice and compared to ric8a-nestin-cre mice. Or when app is deleted in microglia (app-cxcr3-cre) + LPS injection compared to WT mice +LPS.</p>
<p>(12) The authors injected inhibitors of Akt or Stat3 in the ric8a-emx1-cre cortex and found that it suppressed neuronal ectopia (Fig 5, Suppl fig 11). Does it suppress immune stimulation from neuronal cells or immune reaction from microglia cells?</p>
<p>(13) Fig 5 and Supplementary fig 12: Please show a tubulin loading control in Fig 5i as you did in suppl fig 12 d (gel zymography). Please provide a gel zymography showing side by side Control, mutant and mutant +DM/S3I treatment. The same request for the MMP9 staining. Please provide statistics for control vs mutant for suppl fig 12c and d.</p>
<p>(14) Please provide the name and the source of the MMP9/13 inhibitor used in this study.</p>
<p>(15) The results show that deletion of ric8a in microglia and neural cells induced pia membrane breaches but no phenotype is apparent in ric8a deletion in microglia or neural cells alone. Then, the results showed that intraperitoneal injection of LPS induced the phenotype in ric8a-cxcr3-cre mutants. It would be beneficial as a control supporting the model to show that the insult induced by LPS injection does not induce the phenotype in the ric8a-foxg1-cre mice.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors want to elucidate which are the mechanisms that regulate the immune response in physiological conditions in cortical development. To achieve this goal, authors used a wide range of mutant mice to analyse the consequences of immune activation in the formation of cortical ectopia in mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors demonstrated that Abeta monomers are anti-inflammatory and inhibit microglial activation. This is a novel result that demonstrates the physiological role of APP in cortical development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>-On the other hand, cortical ectopia has been already described in mouse models in which the amyloid signalling has been disrupted (Herms et al., 2004; Guenette et al., 2006), making the current study less novel.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree these previous studies have implicated amyloid precursor protein in cortical ectopia. However, since these studies use whole-body knockouts, they have not implicated the functional roles of specific cell types.  Nor have they identified the specific mechanisms underlying the formation of this unique class of cortical ectopia. In contrast, our studies show that the disruption of a novel Abeta-regulated signaling pathway in microglia is the primary cause of ectopia formation in this class of ectopia mutants. This is the first time that microglia have been specifically implicated in the development of cortical ectopia. We further show that elevated MMP activity and resulting cortical basement membrane degradation is the underlying mechanism leading to ectopia formation.  This is also the first time that MMP activity and basement membrane degradation (instead of maintenance) have been implicated in cortical ectopia development. As such, our results have provided novel insights into the diverse mechanisms underlying cortical ectopia formation in developmental brain disorders.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>One of the molecules analysed is Ric8a, a GTPase activator involved in neuronal development. Authors used the conditional mutant mice Emx1-Ric8a to delete Ric8a from early progenitors and glutamatergic neurons in the pallium. Emx1-Ric8a mutant mice present cortical ectopias and authors attributed this malformation to the increase in inflammatory response due to Ric8a deletion in microglia. Several discordances do not fit this interpretation:</p>
<p>-The role of Ric8a in cortical development and function has been already described in several papers, but none of them has been cited in the current manuscript (Kask et al., 2015, 2018; Ruisu et al., 2013; Tonissoo et al., 2006).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will include reference to these publications in revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-Ectopia formation in the cortex has been already described in Nestin-Ric8a cKO mice (Kask et al., 2015). In the current manuscript, authors analyzed the same mutant mice (Nestin-Ric8a), but they did not detect any ectopia. Authors should discuss this discordance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The expression pattern of nestin-cre is known to vary dependent on factors including transgene insertion site, genetic background, and sex. Early studies show, for example, that the nestin gene promoter drives cre expression in many non-neural tissues in another transgenic line in the FVB/N genetic background (Dubois et al Genesis. 2006 Aug;44(8):355-60. doi: 10.1002/dvg.20226).  The specific nestin-cre line used in Kask et al 2015 has also been shown to be active in brain microglia and lead to increased microglia pro-inflammatory activity upon breeding to a conditional allele of a cholesterol transporter gene (Karasinska et al., Neurobiol Dis. 2013 Jun:54:445-55; Karasinska et al.,  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678874/">J Neurosci.</ext-link> 2009 Mar 18; 29(11): 3579–3589). The ectopia reported in Kask et al 2015 are also significantly more subtle than what we have observed and apparently not observed in all mutant animals (we observe severe ectopia in every single emx1-cre mutant).  We presume the ectopia reported in Kask et al 2015 may result from a combined deletion of ric8a gene from microglia and neural cells due to unique combinations of factors affecting nestin-cre expression in a subset of mutants.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-Authors claim that microglia express Emx1, and therefore, Ric8a is deleted in microglia cells. However, the arguments for this assumption are very weak and the evidence suggests that this is not the case. This is an important point considering that authors want to emphasise the role of Ric8a in microglia activation, and therefore, additional experiments should demonstrate that Ric8a is deleted in microglia in Emx1-Ric8a mutant mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have observed altered mRNA expression of several genes in purified microglia cultured from the emx1-cre mutants (Supplemental Fig. 8), which indicates that ric8a is deleted from microglia and suggests a role of microglial ric8a deficiency in ectopia formation.  This interpretation is further strengthened by the observation that deletion of ric8a from microglia using a microglia-specific cx3cr1-cre results in similar ectopia (Fig. 2). We also have other data supporting this interpretation, including data showing induction of the expression of a cre reporter in brain microglia by emx1-cre and loss of ric8a gene expression in microglia cells isolated from emx1-cre mutants. We will include these data in revision.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree we do not currently know the precise mechanisms by which mutant microglia are activated in the mutant brain.  However, this does not affect the conclusion that deficiency in the Abeta monomer-regulated APP/Ric8a pathway in microglia is the primary cause of cortical ectopia in these mutants, since we have shown that genetic disruption of this pathway in microglia alone by different means targeting different pathway components, using cell type specific cre, all results in similar cortical ectopia phenotypes.  Regarding the source of the immunogens, there are several possibilities which we plan to investigate in future studies. For example, the clearance of apoptotic cells and associated cellular debris is an important physiological process and deficits in this process have been linked to inflammatory diseases throughout life (Doran et al., Nat Rev Immunol. 2020 Apr;20(4):254-267; Boada-Romero et al., Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 2020 Jul;21(7):398-414.).  In the embryonic cortex, studies have shown that large numbers of cell death take place starting as early as E12 (Blaschke et al., Development. 1996 Apr;122(4):1165-74; Blaschke et al., J Comp Neurol. 1998 Jun 22;396(1):39-50).  Studies have also shown that radial glia and neuronal progenitors play critical roles in the clearance of apoptotic cells and associated cellular debris in the brain (Lu et al., Nat Cell Biol. 2011 Jul 31;13(9):1076-83; Ginisty et al., Stem Cells. 2015 Feb;33(2):515-25; Amaya et al., J Comp Neurol. 2015 Feb 1;523(2):183-96). Moreover, Ric8a-dependent heterotrimeric G proteins have been found to specifically promote the phagocytic activity of both professional and non-professional phagocytic cells (Billings et al., Sci Signal. 2016 Feb 2;9(413):ra14; Preissler et al., Glia. 2015 Feb;63(2):206-15; Pan et al. Dev Cell. 2016 Feb 22;36(4):428-39; Flak et al. J Clin Invest. 2020 Jan 2;130(1):359-373; Zhang et al., Nat Commun. 2023 Sep 14;14(1):5706).  Thus, it is likely that the failure to promptly clear up apoptotic cells and debris by radial glia may play a role in the triggering of microglial activation in ric8a mutants. We have not included discussion of these possibilities since the precise mechanisms remain to be determined.  Moreover, they also do not impact the conclusion of the current study.</p>

<p>The authors then turned their attention on APP. They observed neuronal ectopia into the marginal zone when APP is deleted in microglia (app-cxcr3-cre) + intraperitoneal LPS injection (they did not show it, but we have to assume there would not be a phenotype without the injection of LPS) (Fig 3). (The phenotype is similar but not identical to ric8a-cx3cr1-cre + LPS. They suggest that the reason is because they had to inject 3 times less LPS due to enhanced immune sensitivity in this genetic background but it is only a hypothesis). After in vitro stimulation by LPS, app mutant microglia show a reduced secretion of TNFa and IL6 but not IL1b (this is the opposite to ric8a-cx3cr1-cre microglia cells) while peritoneal macrophages in culture show increased secretion of TNFa, IL1, IL6 and IL23 (fig 3 and Suppl. Fig 9).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have data showing that that app-cxcr3-cre mutants without LPS injection do not show ectopia and will include them in revision.  The reason we employ LPS injection is, in the first place, we do not see a phenotype without the injection. We agree, and have also stated in the text, that the phenotype of the app mutants is not as severe as that of the ric8a mutant.  Besides the low LPS dosage used, we also suggest that other app family members may compensate since the ectopia in the app family gene mutants reported previously were only observed in app/aplp1/2 triple knockouts, not even in any of the double knockouts (Herms et al., 2004). These potential causes are also not mutually exclusive. Nonetheless, the microglia specific app mutants clearly show ectopia upon immune stimulation, implicating a role of microglial APP in cortical ectopia formation.</p>
<p>The distinct response of ric8a and app microglia to LPS results from in vitro culturing of microglia. Indeed, we have shown that, when acutely isolated macrophages are used, these mutants show changes in the same direction (both increased cytokine secretion).  The microglia used for analysis in this study have all been cultured in vitro for two weeks before assay. They have thus been under chronic stimulation exposing to dead cells and debris in the culture dish through this period.  Dependent on the degree of perturbation to inflammation-regulating pathways, such exposures are known to significantly change microglial cytokine expression, sometimes in an opposite direction from expected.  For example, under chronic immune stimulation, while the trem2+/- microglia, which are heterozygous mutant for the anti-inflammatory Trem2, show elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression as expected, trem2-/- (null) microglia under the same conditions instead not only do not show increases but for some pro-inflammatory cytokines, actually show decreases in expression (Sayed et al.,, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 Oct 2;115(40):10172-10177).  In several systems, Ric8a-dependent heterotrimeric G proteins have been shown to act downstream of APP and mediate one of the branches of the signaling activated by APP (Milosch et al., Cell Death Dis. 2014 Aug 28;5(8):e1391; Fogel et al,, Cell Rep. 2014 Jun 12;7(5):1560-1576; Ramaker et al., J Neurosci. 2013 Jun 12;33(24):10165-81; Nishimoto et al., Nature. 1993 Mar 4;362(6415):75-9).  It is likely that in microglia Ric8a-dependent heterotrimeric G proteins may also mediate only a subset of the signaling downstream of APP.  As such, app knockout in microglia may have more severe effects than ric8a knockout on microglial immune activation and lead to changes in the opposite direction compared to ric8a knockout, as has been observed for trem2 null mutation vs heterozygosity discussed above. This may explain the subdued TNF and IL6 secretion by cultured app mutant microglia.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Amyloid beta (Ab) being one of the molecules binding to APP, the authors showed that Ab40 monomers (they did not test Ab40 oligomers) partially inhibit cytokines (TNFa, IL6, IL1b, MCP-1, IL23a, IL10) secretion in vitro by microglia stimulated by LPS but does not affect secretion by microglia from app-cx3cr1-cre (tested for TNFa, IL6, IL1b, IL23a, IL10) (Fig 4, Suppl fig 10) (but still does it in aplp2-cx3cr1-cre) and does not affect secretion by ric8a-cx3cr1-cre microglia (tested for TNFa and IL6 but still suppress IL1b) (Therefore here is another difference between app and ric8a KO microglia).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have tested the effects of Abeta40 oligomers, which induce instead of suppressing microglial cytokine secretion, and will include the data in revision.  As mentioned above, in several systems, Ric8a-dependent heterotrimeric G proteins have been shown to act downstream of APP and mediate one of the branches of the signaling activated by APP (Milosch et al., Cell Death Dis. 2014 Aug 28;5(8):e1391; Fogel et al,, Cell Rep. 2014 Jun 12;7(5):1560-1576; Ramaker et al., J Neurosci. 2013 Jun 12;33(24):10165-81; Nishimoto et al., Nature. 1993 Mar 4;362(6415):75-9).  We assume that this is likely also true in microglia and that Ric8a-dependent heterotrimeric G proteins may mediate only a subset of the signaling downstream of APP.  This may explain the difference in the effects of APP and ric8a knockout mutation in abolishing the anti-inflammatory effects of Abeta monomers on IL-1b vs TNF/IL-6.  It also suggests that TNF/IL-6 and IL-1b secretion must be regulated by different mechanisms. Indeed, it is well established in immunology that the secretion of IL1b, but not of TNF or IL6, is regulated by inflammasome-dependent mechanisms (see, for example, Proz &amp; Dixit. Nat Rev Immunol. 2016 Jul;16(7):407-20. doi: 10.1038/nri.2016.58).</p>

<p>The authors injected inhibitors of Akt or Stat3 in the ric8a-emx1-cre cortex and found it suppressed neuronal ectopia (Fig 5, Suppl fig 11). It is not clear whether it suppresses immune stimulation from neuronal cells or immune reaction from microglia cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree at present the pharmacological approaches we have taken are not able to distinguish these possibilities.  However, whichever of these possibilities turns out to be the case would still implicate a role of excessive microglial activation in the formation of cortical ectopia and support the conclusion of the study.  Thus, while potentially worthwhile of further investigation, this question does not impact the conclusion of this study. Furthermore, as mentioned, we plan to determine the mechanisms of how ric8a mutation in neural cells induces immune activation in future studies. These results will likely enable us to adopt more specific approaches to address this question.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, the authors examined the activities of MMP2 and MMP9 in the developing cortex using gelatin gel zymography. The activity and protein levels of MMP9 but not MMP2 in the ric8a-emx1-cre cortex were claimed significantly increased (Fig 5, Suppl fig 12). Unfortunately, they did not show it in the app-cx3cr1-cre +LPS mouse. They make a connection between ric8a deletion and MMP9 but unfortunately do not make the connection between app deletion and MMP9, which is at the center of the pathway claimed to be important here). Then they injected BB94, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of MMPs or an inhibitor specific for MMP9 and 13. They both significantly suppress the number and the size of the ectopia in ric8a mutants (Fig5).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For all the gelatin gel zymography analysis, we quantify protein concentrations in the cortical lysates using the Bio-Rad Bradford assay kit and load the same amounts of proteins per lane. The results across lanes are thus directly comparable. From the quantification, our results clearly show that MMP9, but not MMP2, levels are increased in the mutants (supplemental Figure 12).  The data on MMP2 also provide an internal control further supporting the observation of a specific change in MMP9.  For this analysis, we focus on the ric8a-emx1-cre mutants since the app-cx3cr1-cre +LPS animals show less severe, more localized ectopia and in most cases only in one of the hemispheres.  Any changes in MMP9 are therefore likely to be masked and the experiments unlikely to yield meaningful results.  On the other hand, we have clearly shown that the administration of different classes of MMP inhibitors significantly eliminate ectopia in ric8a-emx1-cre mutants. This has strongly implicated a functional contribution of MMPs.</p>

<p>After reading the manuscript, I still do not know how ric8a in neural cells is involved in the immune inhibition. Is it through the control of Ab monomers? In addition, the authors did not show in vivo data supporting that Ab monomers are the key players here. As the authors said, this is not the only APP interactor. Finally, I still do not know how ric8a is linked to APP in microglia in the model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As detailed above, there are several possibilities including potential deficits in the clearance of apoptotic cells and associated debris that may trigger microglial activation in ri8ca-emx1-cre mutants. We will investigate these possibilities in future studies.  We have not included discussion since their roles remain to be determined.  As for the role of Abeta monomers, we have indicated that we currently do not have evidence that in the developing cortex Abeta monomers play a role in inhibiting microglia.  We have also indicated in the manuscript that our conclusion is that an Abeta monomer-activated microglial pathway regulates normal brain development, not that Abeta monomers themselves regulate brain development.  Regarding the link between Ric8a and APP, the reviewer has missed several major lines of supporting evidence. For example, we have shown that Abeta monomers activates a pathway in microglia that inhibits the secretion of several proinflammatory cytokines including TNF, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-23 (Figure 4 and Supplemental Figures 8-10).  This inhibition is abolished when either app or ric8a gene is deleted from microglia.  This indicates that app and ric8a act in the same pathway activated by Abeta monomers in microglia. We also show that this Abeta monomer-activated pathway also inhibits the transcription of several cytokines in microglia.  This inhibition is also abolished when either app or ric8a gene is deleted from microglia.  This reinforces the conclusion that app and ric8a act in the same pathway in microglia.  Furthermore, cell type specific deletion of app or ric8a from microglia in vivo also results in similar phenotypes of cortical ectopia. Together, these results thus strongly support the conclusion that app and ric8a act in the same pathway activated by Abeta monomers in microglia. This conclusion is also consistent with published findings that Ric8a dependent heterotrimeric G proteins bind to APP and mediate subsets of APP signaling across different different species (Milosch et al., Cell Death Dis. 2014 Aug 28;5(8):e1391; Fogel et al,, Cell Rep. 2014 Jun 12;7(5):1560-1576; Ramaker et al., J Neurosci. 2013 Jun 12;33(24):10165-81; Nishimoto et al., Nature. 1993 Mar 4;362(6415):75-9).</p>

<p>While several of the findings presented in this manuscript are of potential interest, there are a number of shortcomings. Here are some suggestions that could improve the manuscript and help substantiate the conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) As the title suggests it, the focus is on Ab and APP functions in microglia. However, the analysis is more focused on ric8a. The connection between ric8a and APP in this study is not investigated, besides the fact that their deletion induces somewhat similar but not identical phenotypes. Showing a similar phenotype is not enough to conclude that they are working on the same pathway. The authors should find a way to make that connection between ric8a and app in the cells investigated here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As discussed above, the reviewer misses several major lines of evidence showing that APP and Ric8a acts in the same pathway in microglia.  For example, besides the similarity of the ectopia phenotypes, we have shown that Abeta monomers activates a pathway in microglia that inhibits the secretion of several proinflammatory cytokines including TNF, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-23 (Figure 4 and Supplemental Figures 8-10).  These inhibitory effects are completely abolished when either app or ric8a gene is deleted from microglia.  This indicates that app and ric8a act in the same pathway activated by Abeta monomers in microglia. We also show that this Abeta monomer-activated pathway inhibits the transcription of several cytokine genes in microglia.  These effects are again completely abolished when either app or ric8a gene is deleted from microglia.  This further reinforces the conclusion that app and ric8a act in the same pathway in microglia.  Not only so we also show that the same results are true in macrophages.  Together, these results therefore strongly support the conclusion that app and ric8a act in the same pathway in microglia. This conclusion is also consistent with published findings that Ric8a dependent heterotrimeric G proteins bind to APP and mediate APP signaling across different species (Milosch et al., Cell Death Dis. 2014 Aug 28;5(8):e1391; Fogel et al,, Cell Rep. 2014 Jun 12;7(5):1560-1576; Ramaker et al., J Neurosci. 2013 Jun 12;33(24):10165-81; Nishimoto et al., Nature. 1993 Mar 4;362(6415):75-9).</p>

<p>(2) This would help to show the appearance of breaches in the pial basement membrane leading to neuronal ectopia; to investigate laminin debris, cell identity, Wnt pathway for app-cxcr3-cre + LPS injection as you did for ric8a-emx1-cre.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will provide further data on the breaches in the pial basement membrane.  We have not observed any changes in cell identity or Wnt pathway activity in ric8a-emx1-cre mutants. The ectopia phenotype in the app-cxcr3-cre + LPS animals is also less severe.  It is therefore likely of limited value to examine potential changes in these areas.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) As a control, this would help to show that app-cxcr3-cre without the LPS injection does not display the phenotype.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have the data on app-cx3cr1-cre mutants without LPS injection, which show no ectopia, and will include the data in revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) This would help to show the activity and protein levels of MMP9 and MMP2 and perform the rescue experiments with the inhibitors in the app-cx3cr1-cre cortex +LPS.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As discussed above, we focus analysis on the ric8a-emx1-cre mutants since app-cx3cr1-cre +LPS animals show less severe, more localized ectopia and in most cases only in one of the hemispheres.  Determining potential changes in MMP9 levels and effects of MMP inhibitors are therefore not likely to yield useful data.  On the other hand, we have shown that MMP9 levels are increased and administration of different classes of MMP inhibitors eliminate cortical ectopia in ric8a-emx1-cre mutants.  This has strongly implicated a functional contribution of MMPs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Is MMP9 secreted by microglia cells or neural cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our in situ hybridization data show MMP9 is most highly expressed in macrophage-like cells in the embryonic cortex, suggesting that microglia may be a major source of MMP9. We will incorporate these data in revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The in vitro evidence indicates that one of the multiple APP interactors, ie Ab40 monomers, is less effective in suppressing the expression of some cytokines by microglia cells mutants for ric8a (TNFa and IL6 but still suppress IL1b) or APP (TNFa, IL6, IL1b, IL23a, IL10) when compared to WT. But there are other interactors for APP. In order to support the claim, it seems crucial to have in vivo data to show that Ab40 monomers are the molecules involved in preventing the breach in the pial basement membrane.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As addressed in detail above, we have indicated that our conclusion is that an Abeta monomer-activated microglial pathway regulates normal brain development, not that Abeta monomers themselves regulate brain development.  We currently do not have evidence that the Abeta monomers play a role in inhibiting microglia in the developing cortex.  There are candidate ligands for the pathway in the developing cortex, the functional study of which, however, is a major undertaking and beyond the scope of the current study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In order to claim that this is specific to Ab40 monomers and not oligomers, it is necessary to show that the Ab40 oligomers do not have the same effect in vitro and in vivo. Also, an assay should be done to show that your Ab preparations are pure monomers or oligomers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have tested the effects of Abeta40 oligomers, which induce instead of suppressing microglial cytokine secretion, and will include the data in revision. The protocols we use in preparing the monomers and oligomers are standard protocols employed in the field of Alzheimer’s disease research and have been optimized and validated repeatedly over the past several decades.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Most of the cytokine secretion assays used microglia cells in culture. Two results draw my attention. Ric8a deletion increases TNFa and IL6 secretion after LPS stimulation in vitro on microglia cells while app deletion decreases their secretion. Then later, papers show that the decrease in IL1b induced by Ab on microglia cells is prevented by APP deletion but not ric8a deletion. Those two pieces of data suggest that ric8a and APP might not be in the same pathway. In addition, the phenotype from app-cxcr3-cre + LPS injection and ric8a-cxcr3-cre + LPS injection are not exactly the same. It could be due to the level of LPS as the author suggests or it might not be. More experiments are needed to prove they are in the same pathway.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As discussed above, the reviewer misses several major lines of evidence, which strongly support the conclusion that APP and Ric8a act in the same pathway activated by Abeta monomers in microglia (see detailed discussion in point 1).  The differential response of app and ric8a mutant microglia likely results from chronic immune stimulation during in vitro culturing, which is known to alter microglia cytokine expression (see detailed discussion in point 9 below on how chronic immune stimulation changes microglial cytokine expression). We have demonstrated this by showing that, without culturing, acutely isolated app and ric8a mutant macrophages both display elevated cytokine secretion (Figure 4).  Regarding the distinct regulation of TNF/IL-6 and IL-1b by APP and Ric8a, as discussed above, in several systems, Ric8a-dependent heterotrimeric G proteins have been shown to act downstream of APP and mediate one of the branches of the signaling activated by APP (Milosch et al., Cell Death Dis. 2014 Aug 28;5(8):e1391; Fogel et al,, Cell Rep. 2014 Jun 12;7(5):1560-1576; Ramaker et al., J Neurosci. 2013 Jun 12;33(24):10165-81; Nishimoto et al., Nature. 1993 Mar 4;362(6415):75-9).  It is likely this is also the case in microglia and Ric8a-dependent heterotrimeric G proteins may mediate only a subset of the anti-inflammatory signaling activated by APP.  As such, this may explain why app, but ric8a, mutation abolishes the inhibitory effects of Abeta monomers on IL-1b.  This also suggests that the secretion of TNF/IL-6 and IL-1b must be regulated by different mechanisms. Indeed, it is well established in immunology that the secretion of IL1b, but not that of TNF or IL6, is regulated by inflammasome-dependent mechanisms (see, for example, Proz &amp; Dixit. Nat Rev Immunol. 2016 Jul;16(7):407-20. doi: 10.1038/nri.2016.58).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) How do the authors reconcile the reduced TNFa and IL6 secretion upon stimulation of app mutant microglia with the model where app is attenuating immune response in vivo? Line 213 says that microglia exhibit attenuated immune response following chronic stimulation but I don't know if 3 hours of LPS in vitro is a chronic stimulation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer has misunderstood.  The microglia used in this study have all been cultured in vitro for approximately two weeks before assay. They have thus been under chronic stimulation exposing to dead cells and debris in the culture dish throughout this period.  Dependent on the degree of perturbation to inflammation-regulating pathways, such exposures are known to significantly change microglial cytokine expression, sometimes in an opposite direction than expected.  For example, under chronic immune stimulation, while the trem2+/- microglia, which are heterozygous mutant for the anti-inflammatory Trem2, show elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression as expected, trem2-/- (null) microglia under the same conditions instead not only do not show increases but for some pro-inflammatory cytokines, actually show decreases in expression (Sayed et al.,, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 Oct 2;115(40):10172-10177).  As mentioned, in several systems, Ric8a-dependent heterotrimeric G proteins have also been shown to bind to APP and mediate one of the branches of the signaling activated by APP (Milosch et al., Cell Death Dis. 2014 Aug 28;5(8):e1391; Fogel et al,, Cell Rep. 2014 Jun 12;7(5):1560-1576; Ramaker et al., J Neurosci. 2013 Jun 12;33(24):10165-81; Nishimoto et al., Nature. 1993 Mar 4;362(6415):75-9).  It is likely that Ric8a-dependent heterotrimeric G proteins also mediate only a subset of the anti-inflammatory signaling activated by APP in microglia.  As such, app knockout in microglia may have more severe effects than ric8a knockout on microglial immune activation, similar to the relationship between trem2 null mutation vs heterozygosity discussed above. This likely explains why TNF and IL6 secretion by cultured app mutant microglia is subdued.  In contrast, we find that acutely isolated app mutant macrophages show increased cytokine secretion. This is likely more representative of the response of app mutant microglia in the absence of chronic stimulation.</p>

<p>(10) Line 119: In their model, the authors suggest that there is a breach in pial basement membrane but that the phenotype is different from the retraction of the radial fibers due to reduced adhesion. So, could the author discuss to what substrate the radial fibers are attached to, in their model where the pial surface is destroyed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Radial glial endfeet normally bind to the basement membrane via cell surface receptors including the integrin and the dystroglycan protein complexes. We observe free radial glial endfeet at the breach sites, apparently without attachment to any basement membrane.  However, we cannot exclude the possibility that there may be residual basement components not detected by the methodology employed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) The authors should show that the increased cytokine secretion observed in vitro is also happening in vivo in ric8a-emx1-cre compared to WT mice and compared to ric8a-nestin-cre mice. Or when app is deleted in microglia (app-cxcr3-cre) + LPS injection compared to WT mice +LPS.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not technically feasible since it is impossible to extract the extracellular (secreted) fractions of cytokines from an embryonic brain without causing cell lysis and the release of the intracellular pool.  This, however, does not affect our conclusion that the Abeta monomer-regulated microglia pathway plays a key role in regulates normal brain development since its genetic disruption, by different approaches, clearly results in brain malformation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) The authors injected inhibitors of Akt or Stat3 in the ric8a-emx1-cre cortex and found that it suppressed neuronal ectopia (Fig 5, Suppl fig 11). Does it suppress immune stimulation from neuronal cells or immune reaction from microglia cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As discussed above, we agree at present the pharmacological approaches we have taken are not able to distinguish these two possibilities.  However, no matter which possibility is true, it does not affect our conclusion.  Furthermore, we also plan to determine the mechanisms of how ric8a mutation in neural cells induce immune activation in future studies. These results will likely enable us to adopt specific approaches to address this question.</p>

<p>For all experiments of the gelatin gel zymography analysis, we quantify protein concentrations in the cortical lysates using the Bio-Rad Bradford assay kit and load the same amounts of proteins per lane.

<p>(15) The results show that deletion of ric8a in microglia and neural cells induced pia membrane breaches but no phenotype is apparent in ric8a deletion in microglia or neural cells alone. Then, the results showed that intraperitoneal injection of LPS induced the phenotype in ric8a-cxcr3-cre mutants. It would be beneficial as a control supporting the model to show that the insult induced by LPS injection does not induce the phenotype in the ric8a-foxg1-cre mice.</p>

<p>We agree it may potentially be useful to show that LPS injection does not induce ectopia in ric8a-foxg1-cre mice.  Unfortunately, since the ric8a-foxg1-cre mutation shows no phenotype, we are no longer in possession of this line.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>-The information in the abstract and the introduction is only related to app. So, it is very abrupt how authors start the manuscript studying the role of Ric8a, with no information at all about this protein and why the authors want to investigate this role in microglial activation. Later in the manuscript, the authors tried to link Ric8a with app to study the role of app in the inflammatory response and ectopia formation. This link is quite weak as well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the last paragraph of the Introduction, we explain the use of the ric8a mutant and how it leads to discovery of the Abeta monomer-regulated pathway. We will improve the writing in revision to make these points clearer.  We will also improve the writing of the potential link of Ric8a to APP by highlighting, especially, the fact that ric8a and app pathway mutants are among a unique group of only three mouse mutants (ric8a, app/aplp1/2, and apbb1/2) that show cortical ectopia exclusively in the lateral cortex, while all other cortical ectopia mutants show the most severe ectopia are at the midline.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-In order to validate the mouse model, double immunofluorescence or immunofluorescence+in situ hybridization should be performed to show that microglia express ric8a and that is eliminated in the Emx1-Ric8a mutant mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above, we have additional lines of evidence showing that ric8a is deleted from microglia in emx1-cre mutants. This includes data showing induction of the expression of a cre reporter in brain microglia by emx1-cre and loss of ric8a gene expression in microglia cells isolated from emx1-cre mutants.  We will include these data in revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-In Supplemental Fig. 6, the authors claimed that cell proliferation is normal in Ric8a mutant mice without doing any quantification. They also quantified the angle of mitotic division of progenitors in the ventricular zone, but there are no images for the spindle orientation quantification, and no description of how they did it. In addition, this data is contrary to what has already been published in conditional Ric8a mutant mice (Kask et al., 2015). The Vimentin staining should be improved.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will provide quantification of cell proliferation in revision. We will also provide details on the quantification on mitotic spindle orientation.  We are not sure why the results are different from the other study. We were indeed anticipating deficits in mitotic spindle orientation and spent major efforts in the analysis.  However, based on the data, we could not draw the conclusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-Analysis of the MMP9 expression should be done by western blot and not by immunofluorescence. In fact, the MMP9 expression shown in Figure 5g,h, does not correspond with RNA expression shown in gene expression atlas like genepaint or the allen atlas, doubting the specificity of the antibody. The expression of Mmp9 is quite low or absent in the cortex at E13.5-E14.5, making this protein very unlikely to be responsible for laminin degradation during development.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We perform gelatin gel zymography on MMP2/9, which shows increased MMP9 activity levels in the mutant cortex. This is similar to Western blot analysis (all lanes are loaded with the same amounts of cortical lysates).  The immunofluorescence staining, a different type, of analysis, was designed as a complementary approach.  Regarding RNA expression, please also note that MMP9 is a secreted protein and the protein expression pattern is expected to be different from that of RNA. We also have in situ data showing that, while MMP9 mRNA is indeed low, it is strongly expressed in macrophage-like cells most prominently in cortical blood vessels at E12-E13 (we will include these data in revision).  We suspect that these cells are microglial lineage cells populating the embryonic cortex at this stage (see, for example, Squarzoni et al., Cell Rep. 2014 Sep 11;8(5):1271-9. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2014.07.042.) and may be a major source of cortical MMP9.  As for functional contributions, we agree that we cannot rule roles played by other MMPs.  However, based on the ectopia suppression data, our results clearly indicate a key functional contribution by MMP9/13.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For MMP9 activity, authors should show the whole membrane with a minimum of three control and three mutant individual samples and with the quantification.</p>
