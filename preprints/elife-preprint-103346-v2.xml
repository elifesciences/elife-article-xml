<title>Abstract</title><p>The transcription factor (TF) regulatory network in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is complex and involves multiple regulators that respond to various environmental signals and physiological cues by regulating gene expression. However, the biological functions of at least half of its 373 putative TFs remain uncharacterised. Herein, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) was used to investigate the binding sites of 172 TFs in the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 strain. The results revealed 81,009 significant binding peaks in the genome, more than half of which were located in the promoter regions. To further decode the diverse regulatory relationships among TFs, a hierarchical network was assembled into three levels: top, middle, and bottom. Thirteen ternary regulatory motifs revealed flexible relationships among TFs in small hubs, and a comprehensive co-association atlas was established, showing the enrichment of seven core associated clusters. Twenty-four TFs were identified as the master regulators of virulence-related pathways. The pan-genome analysis revealed the conservation and evolution of TFs in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> complex and other species. A Web-based database combining existing and new data from ChIP-seq and the high- throughput systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment was established for searching TF-binding sites. This study provides important insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and related bacteria and is expected to contribute to the development of effective therapies for infectious diseases caused by this pathogen.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transcription factors (TFs) are key regulators of transcription and thus play crucial roles in mediating multiple biological pathways and events in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Based on their DNA-binding domains (DBDs), TFs can be classified into different families, such as the LysR, AraC, and LuxR families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. TFs can activate and repress the expression of a set of genes in response to various environmental and/or specific signal triggers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Several approaches can be used to study TFs, including chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> and ChIP-exo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> in <italic>in vivo</italic> research and DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and high-throughput systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (HT-SELEX)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> in <italic>in vitro</italic> research. ChIP-seq is a powerful <italic>in vivo</italic> technique that enables more accurate genome-wide mapping of TFâDNA interactions than <italic>in vitro</italic> methods because TFs may interact with other co-regulators in an environment-specific pattern, thereby altering binding preferences <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>These sequencing approaches have been used to illustrate the biological functions of TFs in several bacterial species, including <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and <italic>Clostridium thermocellum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, several databases and models have been constructed based on experimental validation or machine learning for studying TFs in bacteria, such as CollecTF, PredicTF, PRODORIC, DBTBS, and RegulomePA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, the functions and spatiotemporal interactions of most bacterial TFs remain to be clarified.</p>
<p>The gram-negative bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is a major human opportunistic pathogen that grows ubiquitously. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> tends to cause infection in burn victims, patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and individuals hospitalised for long periods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. It utilises versatile pathways to exert its virulence, such as biofilm formation, quorum sensing (QS), type III and type VI secretion systems (T3SS and T6SS, respectively), motility, siderophore production, oxidative stress resistance, and antibiotic resistance, all of which are under the control of a complicated TF regulatory network (TRN). The metabolic changes regulated by the TRN enhance the pathogenâs adaptability under different infection and survival conditions.</p>
<p><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> employs diverse virulence pathways to establish successful infection, with QS being one of the major mechanisms involving the expression of many virulence genes. Its regulation occurs hierarchically, comprising the interconnected <italic>las</italic>, <italic>rhl</italic>, and <italic>pqs</italic> systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Through its transcriptional regulator, LasR, and in collaboration with its corresponding autoinducer, 3-oxo-C<sub>12</sub>-HSL (encoded by <italic>lasI</italic>), the <italic>las</italic> system triggers the activation of the <italic>rhl</italic> and <italic>pqs</italic> systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Additionally, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> utilizes motility systems for surface attachment and colonization, including: (i) swarming and swimming powered by flagella, which are multicellular and individual cell movements, respectively, and (ii) twitching powered by type 4 pili (T4P)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, wherein T4P promote surface attachment by twitching to pull the cell closer to the attachment sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The motility of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is thus the initial step in its pathogenic process and is associated with the upregulation of virulence and the induction of host defence. Both QS and motility pathways are precisely controlled by the sophisticated TRN in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Understanding how these virulence pathways are integrated and regulated is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections.</p>
<p>Despite the TRN being essential for understanding how bacterial genes are regulated synergistically, only a limited number of binding targets of TFs have been identified in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> over the past decades. For example, ChIP-seq and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) co-analysis has been used to map a <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> genomic regulatory network (PAGnet) of 20 key virulence-related TFs, while HT-SELEX has been used to characterise the DNA-binding specificities of 182 TFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. DAP-seq has been used to reveal a regulatory network of 55 response regulators (RRs) of two-component systems in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 51 of which are from the PAO1 strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. However, almost half of the TFs remain to be annotated with biological functions, and their downstream targets and upstream regulators remain unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we performed ChIP-seq of 172 TFs, which are the most rest of the TFs after HT- SELEX screening (Table S1) from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which revealed a hierarchical and co-association regulatory network among TFs and newly identified virulence-related regulators. We also established a Web-based database to store and search TF-binding patterns together with ChIP-seq and HT-SELEX data, which is available to the public. Our findings and tools will significantly contribute to future mechanistic studies on and a comprehensive understanding of the TRN in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and other bacterial species.</p>

<title>ChIP-seq of 172 uncharacterised TFs reveals a global transcriptional atlas of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic></title>
<p>In this study, 373 proteins in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> were annotated as TFs with DNA-binding activity based on the existing annotations in the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> Genome Database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To profile the whole TFâDNA binding landscape and construct a comprehensive regulatory network of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, ChIP-seq experiments were performed on 172 TFs to determine the TF-binding sites (TFBSs) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Libraries were constructed using vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein tagging, and raw sequence reads were mapped to the PAO1 genome using bowtie2 (Version 2.3.4.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Using MACS2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, 81,009 significant binding peaks with a cut-off p-value of 0.001 were identified. Subsequently, the R package ChIPpeakAnno<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> was used to define the peak locations and find the nearest genes. The peak location can be divided into six features: upstream, overlapStart, inside, overlapEnd, downstream, and includeFeature. The percentages of binding peak locations for each TF indicated that more than half of the TFs preferentially bind to the upstream (upstream intergenic regions) and overlapStart (overlapped with the transcription start sites [TSSs] of genes) regions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Apart from these regions, some TFs bind to the inside regions (coding regions of genes). Few TFs were found to preferentially bind to the rest of the peak location features.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="618254v2_fig1.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>To further provide insights into the functional roles of different TFs in gene regulation, we analysed the peak distance to the TSS, which revealed several patterns (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). First, most of the TFs exhibited peak distributions that were concentrated in the proximal region around the TSS. Some TFs, such as Cor_CI, showed a broader distribution of peak distance, indicating that these TFs might also be active at positions farther from the TSS. Furthermore, certain TFs, including RpiR and DeoR, displayed distinct bimodal or multimodal distributions, while other TFs, such as LysR and AraC, showed smoother and more narrowly focused distributions, suggesting their different binding preferences. The number of peaks of each TF and its DBD types are summarised in a treemap in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>. TFs in the LysR and AraC families accounted for almost half of all of the peaks. PA2718, classified in the MerR family, yielded the highest number (2,480) of binding peaks, followed by the TF PA0756 (2,080 binding peaks) from the OmpR family. Furthermore, eight TFs showed no more than 10 peaks, and the TFs PA4074 and PA4806 had only two peaks each. To preliminarily identify the different regulatory functions of TFs via their different binding preferences, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis for each TF and presented the top 10 GO terms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). The significantly enriched GO terms (BH-adjusted <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) for all of the 172 TFs analysed by ChIP- seq are listed in Table S2, and these terms suggest divergent functions of the TFs. Of these functional categories, most were related to metabolism, such as transcription, translation, ribosome structure, and GTPase activity, while some of the functional categories were associated with virulence, including T4P, O antigen biosynthesis, and biofilm formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Hierarchical networks of TFs based on pairwise interactions</title>
<p>TF-coding genes can also serve as targets for other TFs, leading to interactions between the DNA-binding profiles of TFs. To clarify these relationships, lists of binding targets of the TFs obtained using ChIP-seq and HT-SELEX were used to assemble a system-level hierarchical regulatory network. After filtering by TFs that bind to promoter regions, 947 unique pairwise patterns between TFs were identified from a total of 13,375 promoter interactions.</p>
<p>We next defined a statistic index, h, based on the out-degree (<italic>O</italic>) and in-degree (<italic>I</italic>) of interactions to measure the direction and hierarchical level of TFs [<italic>h =</italic> (<italic>O-I</italic>)/(<italic>O+I</italic>)] in our established hierarchical regulatory network and thus identify hubs and information-flow bottlenecks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The h value of each TF can reflect the direction and extent of information flow. A positive h indicates that the TF acts âupstreamâ, whereas a negative value suggests that it acts âdownstreamâ. The higher the absolute h value, the stronger the implication of the direction. A density plot of all of the TFs with their h values revealed that they can be approximately divided into three groups: top (h [0.75, 1]), middle (h [-0.75, 0.75]), and bottom (h [-1, 0.75]) levels (Fig. S2A). The top-level TFs are those that tend to control many other TFs, while the bottom- level TFs are those that are more regulated by other TFs than acting as regulators themselves. The middle-level TFs are those that connect the top- and bottom-level TFs. Of the 231 TFs in this hierarchy, 100, 46, and 85 TFs were defined as top-, middle-, and bottom-level TFs, respectively. The complete hierarchical information of all of the TFs is provided in Table S3. To avoid extreme cases and aid visualisation, we summarised the hierarchical regulatory network by removing TFs for which (<italic>O+I</italic>) was more than 10 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and Fig. S2B). The network was visualised using Cytoscape software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Additionally, we investigated the factors influencing the hierarchical level of TFs, such as DBD types (e.g., DBD families containing more TFs). TFs from the AraC, GntR, and TetR families tended to cluster at the top level. TFs from the MarR family and two-DBD-type TFs (i.e., TFs with two DBDs) were mostly found in the bottom level. Additionally, among the characterised TFs, 58% were clustered at the bottom level, probably because these TFs directly regulated the downstream genes involved in important phenotypes, such as AlgR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, AmrZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, MvfR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, FleQ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, and VqsM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Overall, the organised hierarchical regulatory network profiling at the three levels showed complex pairwise interactions among TFs in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p>

<title>Ternary regulatory motifs show flexible relationships among TFs in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic></title>
<p>Apart from their global hierarchical regulatory structure, we investigated the constituent regulatory network motifs of TFs, which revealed small connectivity patterns associated with canonical functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Positive and negative feedback loops are prevalent in bacterial regulatory networks, which generally involve combinations of several genes to appropriately respond to stimuli. One of the regulatory patterns was a single auto-regulator that can self-regulate its expression or activity. Through analysis, nine auto-regulator TFs were identified (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Compared with non-auto- regulators, auto-regulators usually tend to be repressors, which play important roles in maintaining a steady state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. For example, the key T3SS activators PsrA and HrpL can repress their own expression in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P. savastanoi</italic>, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In addition, the most fundamental regulatory pattern was the ternary TF motif. We computed all possible motifs, which are listed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and Table S4. The basic triangular motifs were monodirectional regulatory structures with five different motifs. The most frequently observed motif (6,535 occurrences) was motif_2, wherein two different TFs co-regulate another TF. The remaining eight types of motifs, which contained toggle switches, occurred much less frequently than the basic motifs. The more complex the relationships among TFs, the lesser their occurrence. In particular, motif_10, motif_12, and motif_13, characterised by two or three mutually regulating TFs, were not found even once (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The high occurrence of different TFs in diverse motifs revealed a complex and flexible regulatory network in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Next, we constructed a basic motif_3 regulatory network based on potential TFâTF interactions to detect the regulatory preferences based on DBD types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Basic motif_3 was a typical hierarchical regulatory network in which TF1 regulates TF2, which in turn regulates TF3. We found that the AraC, Fis, and GntR families tended to harbour top-level TFs rather than middle- and bottom-level TFs, while the OmpR family tended to harbour TFs from middle- and bottom-levels more than those from the top level. Furthermore, the LysR and LuxR families revealed non-significant differences among these three TF levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Taken together, our integrated hierarchical regulatory profiling revealed a multifaceted TFâTF connection, reflecting the regulatory preferences of TFs and DBD types in <italic>P. aeruginos</italic>a.</p>

<title>Clustering of 103 TF-binding motifs</title>
<p>According to their binding sites, a total of 103 binding motifs were determined. The TFs were clustered based on the positional weight matrix similarity of their motifs. A circular phylogenetic tree was constructed using hierarchical clustering of the pairwise similarity matrix (Fig. S3 and Table S5). Each node in the tree represents a TF, colour-highlighted according to its DBD family classification. The clustering analysis revealed four distinct clusters of TFs, one each coloured light green (Cluster 1), light blue (Cluster 2), purple (Cluster 3), and pink (Cluster 4). These clustersindicate groups of TFs with similar binding properties or regulatory functions.</p>
<p>Within each identified cluster, TFs tend to share conserved motif patterns, indicating potential functional relationships. For instance, it was found that the TFs in cluster 1 were enriched in adenine (A) and thymine (T) bases. Further, cluster 4 was more likely to have an inverted repeat (IR) sequence, such as PA0367 and PA1015. This conservation suggests that TFs within the same cluster co-regulate similar sets of genes. Additionally, the clustering uncovered novel associations between TFs from different DBD families, indicating potential new regulatory interactions or evolutionary links that warrant further investigation.</p>

<p>Next, we summarised the potential functional crosstalk among the middle-scale co- associated five TFs (PA2417, PA2718, PA0756, PmiR, and AgtR) in cluster 3. Among a total of 1,241 target genes, 372 were co-bound by at least three TFs, and 35 were co- bound by all five TFs, indicating that these TFs have a high level of collaboration in regulatory patterns (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). There were smaller intersections among different combinations of TFs, highlighting potential co-regulation or shared binding sites. Binding targets co-bound by more than four TFs are summarised in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>. The dense network and connectivity indicate a complex regulatory landscape, where these TFs may orchestrate a coordinated regulation of gene expression. For example, peak visualization of PA2504 revealed distinct binding patterns of these five TFs compared with the control group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).

<title>Twenty-four master regulators are associated with virulence</title>
<p>After elucidating the binding targets of 172 TFs, we investigated their potential functions in the virulence-related pathways and pathogenesis of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. For this purpose, we performed an enrichment analysis using a hypergeometric test to define the master regulators (BH-adjusted <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) that might play important roles in regulating specific pathways. We primarily focused on TF-binding profiles involving the promoter regions of genes involved in nine pathways, namely QS, motility, biofilm production, antibiotic resistance, T6SS, T3SS, reactive oxygen species (ROS) resistance, pyocyanin production, and siderophore production. Accordingly, 134 of the 172 TFs were found to bind to at least one target gene associated with the abovementioned virulent pathways, and 24 were identified as master regulators of genes involved in six pathways, namely siderophore production, biofilm production, pyocyanin production, QS, motility, and ROS resistance pathways (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and Table S7).</p>

<p>The intersection of master regulators across these virulent pathways revealed that six TFs (PA0167, PyrR, PA0707, PA0877, PA1504, and PA1484) only played an important role in regulating the motility pathway, and four TFs (PA1380, PA0815, PA5428, and PA3973) jointly regulated the motility and other pathways, including biofilm production, pyocyanin production, and QS pathways (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Specifically, PA0815 co-regulated motility, biofilm production, and QS pathways. PA1380 jointly regulated motility and pyocyanin production pathways.

<p>To define the core TFs that regulate metabolism, we performed master regulator analysis in metabolic pathways (<italic>p.adjust</italic> &lt; 0.05) based on the TFBSs located in the promoter regions revealed by ChIP-seq for all TFs. We identified 14 TFs potentially involved in two pathways, namely the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and ribosome function pathways (Fig. S6A-B). The radial plot highlights the master regulators within the TCA cycle and ribosome function pathways, and their joint regulation with their targets is presented in the regulatory network below. PA2957 and PA5438 were found to play putative roles in the TCA cycle by potentially binding to the promoter of certain genes, including <italic>icd</italic>, <italic>sucA</italic>, and <italic>sdhC</italic>, indicating that they coordinate the expression of genes crucial for central metabolism and energy production (Fig. S6B).

<title>Conservation and evolution of TFs in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic></title>
<p>Differences between species are mainly due to differences in genes, whereas essential genes are usually well conserved, especially in subspecies. To investigate the conservation of TFs in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, we performed a pan-genome analysis of 100 strains containing model strains and clinical strains using the Roary software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. A total of 21,432 genes were identified across the 100 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains, of which only 4,544 genes were classified as core genes (existing in more than 99% of strains), revealing that most of the genes were cloud genes (existing in less than 15% of strains) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). However, when focusing on the TFs among these 100 strains, almost 89% of TFs (331 of 373) were found to be well-conserved (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>), which implied that these recognised TFs from PAO1 play essential roles in biological activities in all of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> subspecies.</p>

<p>The bar plot provides detailed information on the rest of the non-core TFs in PAO1, in addition to several important TFs, such as LasR and ExsA, that are lacking in some strains (Fig. 7C). As is known, the <italic>lasR</italic> mutant of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is associated with CF lung disease progression and is considered a marker of an early CF-adaptive phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. ExsA is considered an important activator of the T3SS pathway in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which is characterised by an acute infection phenotype. Additionally, VqsM might have a relatively special function in PAO1 among <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> subspecies in addition to playing an important role in the QS and antibiotic resistance pathways. Taken together, the core- and non-core TFs were both vital and worth studying for understanding the metabolism and virulence-related regulatory mechanisms in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p>
<p>To further investigate the conservation of TFs in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, we re-analysed the ChIP-seq data of PhoB and RpoN in the PA14 strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> and compared them with those in the PAO1 strain. Fig. S7A shows genome-wide binding peaks of PhoB and RpoN throughout the genomes of PAO1 and PA14. We found that in PA14 and PAO1, PhoB had 725 and 63 peaks, while RpoN yielded 363 and 1,238 peaks, respectively. Next, we used MEME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> to compare the motifs of PhoB and RpoN in PAO1 and PA14 based on their binding sequences from ChIP-seq (Fig. S7B). PhoB and RpoN shared a well-conserved motif in the two strains even though they showed different peak distributions in the genomes. They had different numbers of peaks, and of the 690 and 345 respective annotation targets of PhoB and RpoN in PA14, 114 and 66 targets, respectively, were unique to PA14. The rest of the targets were homologous between PAO1 and PA14. We next performed target annotation and observed that the genes regulated by these two TFs were significantly (Fisherâs test) overrepresented in the two tested strains (Fig. S7C). For example, RpoN has been found to play an important role in regulating T6SS in both PAO1 and PA14<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Overall, the conservation of the representative TFs PhoB and RpoN in PAO1 and PA14 indicates that conserved TFs may share similar functions in different species. This knowledge is expected to guide drug development for different infectious strains.</p>
<p>TFs play a pivotal role in regulating gene expression, and studying their conservation and evolution could provide insights into how gene expression patterns are conserved or modified across different species and help to predict gene regulatory networks in different species. For example, the conservation of a TF across multiple species suggests that its targets and regulatory interactions are likely to be conserved as well. Therefore, to study the conservation and evolution of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> TFs across other species, we conducted phylogenetic analyses of the 373 TFs of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> across other bacteria, fungi, archaea, plants, and animals. We found that three <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> species showed the most conserved TFs, followed by <italic>P. savastanoi</italic>, a phytopathogen (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Compared with bacteria, the conservation values of the TFs were lower in fungi, archaea, plants, and animals. However, several orthologues of TFs were still noted among these organisms. For instance, PA2032 had more than 25% and approximately 30% identity with aminoadipate aminotransferase in humans and mice, respectively. The phylogenetic tree of PA2032 across bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, and animals, with PAO1 as the root revealed that the bacterial TFs (purple) indicates a high degree of conservation within prokaryotes, suggesting a fundamental role in core regulatory processes (Fig. S7D). In contrast, eukaryotic TFs (fungi, plants, and animals) form distinct clades with longer branch lengths, indicating significant divergence and specialization during eukaryotic evolution. These findings suggest that while TF is conserved across domains of life, its functional roles and regulatory mechanisms have undergone substantial diversification in eukaryotes. Altogether, the high-level evolutionary conservation of TFs in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strongly suggests that the regulatory mechanisms are common to a wide range of bacteria.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Bacterial pathogens use many mechanisms to establish infection and cause diseases in human hosts, making them a major public health concern worldwide. These bacteria can secrete a wide range of molecular particles that recognise and bind to host cell targets, thus damaging or preventing host responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Pathogenic bacteria use strategies to adapt to environmental stressors such as nutrient limitation or antibiotic treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. The underlying mechanism of these strategies involves sensing external signals and then responding to different environmental conditions. TFs are key molecules involved in responding to host or environmental signals by precisely modulating transcription levels; hence, their pivotal roles in infection conditions cannot be overstated. Nevertheless, our comprehension of bacterial TFs remains considerably limited, even in extensively examined model organisms such as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. To address this knowledge gap and shed more light on TFs in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, we conducted ChIP-seq experiments aimed at elucidating the TFBSs for 172 TFs with relatively unexplored biological functions.</p>
<p>The basic function of TFs is to recognise specific DNA sequences (i.e., motifs) at the promoter region and then upregulate or downregulate the transcription of the target gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Apart from promoter regions, TFs have also been identified to directly regulate the transcription of coding regions in bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. ChIP-seq is a valuable technique to obtain high-resolution DNAâprotein interaction mapping on a genome- wide scale to study the potential binding targets of TFs. The technique is highly sensitive and can detect low-abundance DNA-binding events, allowing the detection of weak TFâDNA interactions. <italic>In vitro</italic> assays, such as DAP-seq or HT-SELEX, offer superior scalability to ChIP-seq but present their own challenges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. It is difficult to investigate the crosstalk and interactions between TFs by studying proteins individually. Thus, we devised a strategy involving TF-overexpressing plasmids. This strategy can enhance the visualisation of more subtle binding peaks, particularly when investigating co-associations and TFs lacking well-defined signals. Notably, the literature underscores the collaborative nature of TFs, which often exhibit interactions with other auxiliary proteins at multiple promoter sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and S3, we present a TF-binding motifs clustering tree and a TF co-association regulatory network based on ChIP-seq data and core clusters of TFs with high co-association scores. Overall, our above-described analysis has illustrated a regulatory atlas to study the biological functions of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> TFs in specific contexts.</p>
<p>=<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> uses TFs to control biological functions, including metabolism and virulence. Given the public health burden of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection, many studies have investigated the roles of TFs in this pathogen. These studies have characterised the regulatory mechanisms of individual TFs, such as FleQ, AlgR, LasR, VqsM, and PvrA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Additionally, a TRN comprising 690 genes and 1,020 regulatory interactions with six biological modules and main motifs was established in 2011 using published data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we developed a PAGnet containing 20 key virulence-associated TFs based on ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. A previous study used machine learning to identify modules of a group of genes related to known TFs from published data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Another study used DAP-seq to determine a regulatory network of 55 RRs in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. To further identify and characterise unknown TFs, we used HT-SELEX to describe the binding specificities of 182 TFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Compared with the abovementioned studies, the present work profiled a comprehensive regulatory network of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, combining existing and new data with experimental verification.</p>
<p>We confirmed the functions and provided potential molecular mechanisms of a number of previously identified TFs to explain their phenotypes. PA0797 is known to regulate the <italic>pqs</italic> system and pyocyanin production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. In the present study, it was also found to bind to the <italic>pqsH</italic> promoter region and its motif was visualised. PA5428 was found to bind to the promoter regions of <italic>aceA</italic> and <italic>glcB</italic> genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>, which was also demonstrated in our ChIP-seq results. PA4381 (CloR) was found to be associated with polymyxin resistance in a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> and to be possibly related to ROS resistance in the present study. Furthermore, PA5032 plays a putative role in biofilm regulation and also forms an operon with PA5033, an HP associated with biofilm formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our study is the first to illustrate the hierarchical regulatory network and ternary motifs of and genome-wide co-association relationships among TFs in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, contributing to a better understanding of the fundamental traits of pathogenicity of this species. Traditional bacterial eradication strategies involving antibiotics often focus on pathogen extermination, yet this approach can inadvertently foster selective growth advantages and precipitate the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Therefore, prioritising TF-targeted drugs could potentially alleviate selective growth pressure and enhance future preventative measures against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection. The extensive datasets generated in this study offer valuable insights into understanding and targeting <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> pathogenicity. The genome-wide binding profiles can be systematically analyzed through our hierarchical regulatory network framework to decode complex virulence mechanisms. The virulence-related master regulators and core regulatory clusters identified in this study highlighted key nodes of transcriptional control. Understanding these regulatory relationships is particularly valuable for identifying targets whose modulation would significantly impact virulence while accounting for potential compensatory mechanisms. This knowledge base thus provides a foundation for developing targeted approaches to combat <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections, moving beyond traditional antibiotic strategies toward more sophisticated interventions based on regulatory network manipulation.</p>

<p>The bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used in the present study are listed in Table S8. The <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 strain, and its derivatives were grown at 37 Â°C in LB (Luria-Bertani) broth with shaking at 220 rpm or on LB agar plates. Antibiotics were used for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> at the following concentrations: kanamycin at 50 Î¼g/ ml and carbenicillin at 60 Î¼g/ml.</p>

<title>ChIP-seq and analysis</title>
<p>The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) procedures were modified from a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. Briefly, for the VSVG-tagged, the ORF was amplified by PCR from the PAO1 genome and cloned into pAK1900 plasmid by HindIII/BamHI for the overexpressed TFs through HindIII site by using ClonEx- press MultiS One Step Cloning Kit (Vazyme, China). Wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> containing empty pAK1900 or pAK1900-TF-VSV-G was cultured in LB medium supplemented at 37Â°C with shaking until mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.6), then we cross-linked the samples with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. Subsequently, cross-linking was stopped by the addition of 125 mM glycine. Samples were centrifuged and washed thrice with a Tris buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl). The resulting pellets were resuspended in 500 Î¼l IP buffer (50 mM HEPESâKOH [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 % Triton X- 100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and mini-protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and then the DNA was broken into pieces (100 to 300 bp) with an ultrasonic processor. Insoluble cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 Â°C, and the supernatant was used as the input sample in IP experiments. We next added 25 Î¼l agarose-conjugated anti-VSV antibodies (Sigma) in the IP buffer. Washing, reverse cross-linked, and purification of the ChIP DNA were conducted. We used the NEXTflex ChIP-Seq kit (Bio Scientific) to construct the DNA fragment library, and agarose gel was used to cut DNA fragments between 150 and 250 bp. After sequencing, the raw reads were trimmed by Trim Galore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> with default parameters. Then, the filtered reads were aligned to the PAO1 genome (NC_002516) using bowtie2. Only the unique reads after alignment will be used to perform peakcalling with MACS2 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). MEME-ChIP was used to identify consensus motifs with all peaks. TF target genes were then annotated by the R package ChIPpeakAnno.</p>

<title>Identification of virulence-related master regulators</title>
<p>We first generated gene lists associated with nine pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>: QS, motility, biofilm production, antibiotic resistance, T6SS, T3SS, ROS resistance, pyocyanin, and siderophores. Then, we calculated the number of overlap genes between target genes of TF and genes involved in the above eight pathways. The statistical significance of the master regulator was identified using the Hypergeometric test (BH-adjusted <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). R package ggplot2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> was used to visualize the result.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, Huang et al. revealed the complex regulatory functions and transcription network of 172 unknown transcriptional factors (TFs) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. They have built a global TF-DNA binding landscape and elucidated binding preferences and functional roles of these TFs. More specifically, the authors established a hierarchical regulatory network and identified ternary regulatory motifs, and co-association modules. Since P. aeruginosa is a well known pathogen, the authors thus identified key TFs associated with virulence pathways (e.g., quorum sensing [QS], motility, biofilm formation), which could be potential drug targets for future development. The authors also explored the TF conservation and functional evolution through pan-genome and phylogenetic analyses. For the easy searching by other researchers, the authors developed a publicly accessible database (PATF_Net) integrating ChIP-seq and HT-SELEX data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors performed ChIP-seq analysis of 172 TFs (nearly half of the 373 predicted TFs in P. aeruginosa) and identified 81,009 significant binding peaks, representing one of the largest TF-DNA interaction studies in the field. Also, The integration of HT-SELEX, pan-genome, and phylogenetic analyses provided multi-dimensional insights into TF conservation and function.</p>
<p>(2) The authors provided informative analytical Framework for presenting the TFs, where a hierarchical network model based on the &quot;hierarchy index (h)&quot; classified TFs into top, middle, and bottom levels. They identified 13 ternary regulatory motifs and co-association clusters, which deepened our understanding of complex regulatory interactions.</p>
<p>(3) The PATF_Net database provides TF-target network visualization and data-sharing capabilities, offering practical utility for researchers especially for the P. aeruginosa field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) There is very limited experimental validation for this study. Although 24 virulence-related master regulators (e.g., PA0815 regulating motility, biofilm, and QS) were identified, functional validation (e.g., gene knockout or phenotypic assays) is lacking, leaving some conclusions reliant on bioinformatic predictions. Another approach for validation is checking the mutations of these TFs from clinical strains of P. aeruginosa, where chronically adapted isolates often gain mutations in virulence regulators.</p>
<p>(2) ChIP-seq in bacteria may suffer from low-abundance TF signals and off-target effects. The functional implications of non-promoter binding peaks (e.g., coding regions) were not discussed.</p>
<p>(3) PATF_Net currently supports basic queries but lacks advanced tools (e.g., dynamic network modeling or cross-species comparisons). User experience and accessibility remain underevaluated. But this could be improved in the future.</p>
<p>Achievement of Aims and Support for Conclusions</p>
<p>(1) The authors successfully mapped global P. aeruginosa TF binding sites, constructed hierarchical networks and co-association modules, and identified virulence-related TFs, fulfilling the primary objectives. The database and pan-genome analysis provide foundational resources for future studies.</p>
<p>(2) The hierarchical model aligns with known virulence mechanisms (e.g., LasR and ExsA at the bottom level directly regulating virulence genes). Co-association findings (e.g., PA2417 and PA2718 co-regulating pqsH) resonate with prior studies, though experimental confirmation of synergy is needed.</p>
<p>Impact on the Field and Utility of Data/Methods</p>
<p>(1) This study fills critical gaps in TF functional annotation in P. aeruginosa, offering new insights into pathogenicity mechanisms (e.g., antibiotic resistance, host adaptation). The hierarchical and co-association frameworks are transferable to other pathogens, advancing comparative studies of bacterial regulatory networks.</p>
<p>(2) PATF_Net enables rapid exploration of TF-target interactions, accelerating candidate regulator discovery.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors utilized ChIP-seq on strains containing tagged transcription factor (TF)-overexpression plasmids to identify binding sites for 172 transcription factors in P. aeruginosa. High-quality binding site data provides a rich resource for understanding regulation in this critical pathogen. These TFs were selected to fill gaps in prior studies measuring TF binding sites in P. aeruginosa. The authors further perform a structured analysis of the resulting transcriptional regulatory network, focusing on regulators of virulence and metabolism, in addition to performing a pangenomic analysis of the TFs. The resulting dataset has been made available through an online database. While the implemented approach to determining functional TF binding sites has limitations, the resulting dataset still has substantial value to P. aeruginosa research.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The generated TF binding site database fills an important gap in regulatory data in the key pathogen P. aeruginosa. Key analyses of this dataset presented include an analysis of TF interactions and regulators of virulence and metabolism, which should provide important context for future studies into these processes. The online database containing this data is well organized and easy to access. As a data resource, this work should be of significant value to the infectious disease community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Drawbacks of the study include 1) challenges interpreting binding site data obtained from TF overexpression due to unknown activity state of the TFs on the measured conditions, 2) limited practical value of the presented TRN topological analysis, and 3) lack of independent experimental validation of the proposed master regulators of virulence and metabolism.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review)</bold>:</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work done by Huang et.al. revealed the complex regulatory functions and transcription network of 172 unknown transcription factors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The authors utilized ChIP-seq to profile TFs binding site information across the genome, demonstrating diverse regulatory relationships among them via hierarchical networks with three levels. They further constructed thirteen ternary regulatory motifs in small subs and co-association atlas with 7 core associated clusters. The study also uncovered 24 virulence-related master regulators. The pan-genome analysis uncovered both the conservation and evolution of TFs with P. aeruginosa complex and related species. Furthermore, they established a web-based database combining both existing and novel data from HT-SELEX and ChIP-seq to provide TF binding site information. This study offered valuable insights into studying transcription regulatory networks in P. aeruginosa and other microbes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The results are presented with clarity, supported by well-organized figures and tables that not only illustrate the study's findings but also enhance the understanding of complex data patterns.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback on our paper exploring the transcription regulatory networks in P. aeruginosa.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The results of this manuscript are mainly presented in systematic figures and tables. Some of the results need to be discussed as an illustration how readers can utilize these datasets.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the valuable suggestion about enhancing the practical aspects of our manuscript. We have expanded the discussion section to include more detailed explanations of how these datasets can be utilized in practical applications.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>In this work, the authors comprehensively describe the transcriptional regulatory network of Pseudomonas aeruginosa through the analysis of transcription factor binding characteristics. They reveal the hierarchical structure of the network through ChIP-seq, categorizing transcription factors into top-, middle-, and bottom-level, and reveal a diverse set of relationships among the transcription factors. Additionally, the authors conduct a pangenome analysis across the Pseudomonas aeruginosa species complex as well as other species to study the evolution of transcription factors. Moreover, the authors present a database with new and existing data to enable the storage and search of transcription factor binding sites. The findings of this study broaden our knowledge on the transcriptome of P. aeruginosa. This study sheds light on the complex interconnections between various cellular functions that contribute to the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa, along with the associated regulatory mechanisms. Certain findings, such as the regulatory tendencies of DNA-binding domain-types, provides valuable insights on the possible functions of uncharacterized transcription factors and new functions of those that have already been characterized. The techniques used hold great potential for discovery of transcription factor functions in understudied organisms as well.</p>
<p>The study would benefit from a more clear discussion on the implications of various findings, such as binding preferences, regulatory preferences, and the link between regulatory crosstalk and virulence. Additionally, the pangenome analysis would be furthered through a discussion of the divergence of the transcription factors of P. aeruginosa PAO1 across species in relation to the findings on the hierarchical structure of the transcriptional regulatory network.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>(1) It appears that many TFs are conserved among bacteria, archaebacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. Does this mean these TFs in bacterial could be the ancestors of TFs in fungi, plants, and animals? If we fetch these TFs out and build an evolutionary tree, can we visual the three kingdoms as well?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. While many TFs are conserved across bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, and animals, this conservation does not necessarily imply a direct ancestral relationship. Instead, it may reflect the fundamental importance of certain domains and regulatory mechanisms, which could have arisen from a common ancestral system or through convergent evolution. If we fetch TF PA2032 out to build an evolutionary tree by setting PAO1 as the root, we can visualize these kingdoms in a tree. We added this content in the revised manuscript. Please see Figure S7D and Lines 404-411.</p>
<p>âThe phylogenetic tree of PA2032 across bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, and animals, with PAO1 as the root revealed that the bacterial TFs (purple) indicates a high degree of conservation within prokaryotes, suggesting a fundamental role in core regulatory processes. In contrast, eukaryotic TFs (fungi, plants, and animals) form distinct clades with longer branch lengths, indicating significant divergence and specialization during eukaryotic evolution. These findings suggest that while TF is conserved across domains of life, its functional roles and regulatory mechanisms have undergone substantial diversification in eukaryotes.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Can the authors give an indication how could we employ the findings of this study in designing next generation of antimicrobial agents?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this important suggestion. We have provided this content in the discussion part. Please see Lines 481-492.</p>
<p>âThe extensive datasets generated in this study offer valuable insights into understanding and targeting P. aeruginosa pathogenicity. The genome-wide binding profiles can be systematically analyzed through our hierarchical regulatory network framework to decode complex virulence mechanisms. The virulence-related master regulators and core regulatory clusters identified in this study highlighted key nodes of transcriptional control. Understanding these regulatory relationships is particularly valuable for identifying targets whose modulation would significantly impact virulence while accounting for potential compensatory mechanisms. This knowledge base thus provides a foundation for developing targeted approaches to combat P. aeruginosa infections, moving beyond traditional antibiotic strategies toward more sophisticated interventions based on regulatory network manipulation.â</p>

<p>(1) Lines 178-180: It would strengthen the discussion to include a few additional references that support the claims made in this section, providing a more comprehensive context for the readers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes. We have added more citations(1-5) (No. 1-5 in the references at the end of the rebuttal) to support the claims. Please see Line 182.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Line 198: You mention 'seven' motifs containing toggle switches, but Fig.3 actually displays eight motifs. Please revise this discrepancy to ensure consistency between the text and the figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes. We have revised the wording to âeightâ. Please see Line 200.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 3A: Consider adding a diagram or legend that represents the colors associated with each DNA-binding domain (DBD) family.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. The colors of DBD were aligned with the legend in Figure S3. We have added it in Figure 3A.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Line 21: The use of the abbreviation 'TF' should be done at the first instance of 'transcription factor'.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes. We have revised it. Please see Line 21.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 74: The purpose of this paragraph is slightly unclear. It is recommended that appropriate modifications are made.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for the confusion. The purpose of this paragraph was to introduce the major virulence pathways in P. aeruginosa and mention the important role of TRN in these pathways. We have modified it to make it clearer. Please see Lines 74-75.</p>
<p>âP. aeruginosa employs diverse virulence pathways to establish successful infection, with QS being one of the major mechanisms involving the expression of many virulence genes.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 113: How were these 172 TFs selected?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for indicating this question. In a previous study, we performed HT-SELEX to characterize the DNA-binding motifs of all TFs in P. aeruginosa PAO1, successfully identifying binding sequences for 182 TFs. To further elucidate the binding landscapes of the rest, we performed ChIP-seq on the remaining TFs (172 TFs in total with high-quality ChIP-seq libraries). Please see Lines 100-101 in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 119: Defining other features, namely downstream and include Feature, would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have added the definition for all peak annotation in the legend. Please see Lines 569-574.</p>
<p>âAnnotation heatmap of all peak distribution with 6 locations: Upstream, where the peak is located entirely upstream of the gene; Downstream, where the peak is positioned completely downstream of the gene; Inside, where the peak is entirely contained within the gene body; OverlapStart, where the peak overlaps with the 5' end of the gene; OverlapEnd, where the peak overlaps with the 3' end of the gene; and IncludeFeature, where the peak completely encompasses the gene.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 129: The distribution type of AraC-type TFs is unclear - it is mentioned that AraC has a 'broad distribution', but it is later stated that it has a 'narrow distribution'.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are sorry for this mistake, and we have revised the example for âbroad distributionâ, which is Cor_CI instead of AraC. Please see Lines 132-135.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 161: 'h value' here may need to be modified to 'absolute h value'.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes. We have revised it. Please see Line 164.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 502: &quot;s The DNA&quot; needs to be corrected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes. We have revised it. Please see Line 514.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 515: It would be helpful to readers if the reference used for these pathways was cited.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes. We have added the review reference (Shao et al, 2023) related to these pathways(6) (the 6th reference at the end of the rebuttal). Please see Line 527.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 558: &quot;Translation start site&quot; needs to be corrected to &quot;Transcription start site&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The âTSSâ here exactly indicated âTranslation start siteâ.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 593. &quot;Virulent&quot; pathways needs to be corrected to &quot;virulence&quot; pathways.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes. We have revised it. Please see Line 609.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 604: The type of categorization based on which the proportion of genes is displayed needs to be mentioned.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we agree. We have added the type of categorization in the legend. Please see Lines 621-627.</p>
<p>âFigure 6. Conservation and variability of TFs in PAO1. (A). The pie chart shows the proportions of genes categorized by their presence across P. aeruginosa strains for all genes. (B). The pie chart shows the distribution of TFs identified from PAO1 across different conservation categories. (C). The bar plot of the proportion for non-core TFs. Genes are categorized based on their presence frequency across P. aeruginosa strains: Core genes (present in 99% ~ 100% strains), Soft core genes (present in 95% ~ 99% strains), Shell genes (present in 15% ~ 95% strains), and Cloud genes (present in 0% ~ 15% strains).â</p>
