<title>Abstract</title><p>The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system orchestrates 24-hour rhythms in physiology and behavior by regulating rhythmic transcription in cells. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells, play crucial roles in central nervous system (CNS) functions, but the impact of the circadian clock on astrocyte functions remains largely unexplored. In this study, we identified 412 circadian rhythmic transcripts in cultured mouse cortical astrocytes through RNA sequencing. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that genes involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis are under circadian control. Notably, <italic>Herpud1</italic> (<italic>Herp</italic>) exhibited robust circadian rhythmicity at both mRNA and protein levels, a rhythm disrupted in astrocytes lacking the circadian transcription factor, BMAL1. HERP regulated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by modulating the degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (ITPRs). ATP-stimulated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release varied with the circadian phase, being more pronounced at subjective night phase, likely due to the rhythmic expression of ITPR2. Correspondingly, ATP-stimulated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases were heightened at the subjective night phase. This rhythmic ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response led to circadian phase-dependent variations in the phosphorylation of Connexin 43 (Ser368) and gap junctional communication. Given the role of gap junction channel (GJC) in propagating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, we suggest that this circadian regulation of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses could affect astrocytic modulation of synaptic activity according to the time of day. Overall, our study enhances the understanding of how the circadian clock influences astrocyte function in the CNS, shedding light on their potential role in daily variations of brain activity and health.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The circadian clock orchestrates a range of behaviors, physiological processes, and cellular and biochemical activities in organisms with approximately 24-hour rhythms, facilitating adaptation to environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bell-Pedersen et al., 2005</xref>). In mammals, the master clock localized in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus synchronizes peripheral tissue clocks throughout the body to the light/dark cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mohawk et al., 2012</xref>). The circadian clock’s molecular mechanism is driven by a transcriptional translational feedback loop (TTFL). CLOCK and BMAL1 form a heterodimer that triggers expression of the repressor genes, <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per</italic>) and <italic>Cryptochrome</italic> (<italic>Cry)</italic>, along with other clock-controlled output genes. PER and CRY proteins then translocate to the nucleus, where they interact with CLOCK/BMAL1, halting further transcriptional activation. A secondary feedback loop involving the interplay between transcriptional activation by ROR and repression by REV-ERB finely regulates the rhythmic transcription of <italic>Bmal1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Takahashi, 2017</xref>). Recent studies have revealed that the circadian clock controls the rhythmic transcription of numerous genes, displaying notable tissue specificity. This characteristic underscores the time-of-day-specific functional specialization of diverse tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mure et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, circadian clock-controlled genes significantly influence various physiological processes including development, metabolism, aging, and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lananna &amp; Musiek, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Reinke &amp; Asher, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schultz &amp; Kay, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the CNS, play vital roles in maintaining homeostasis of extracellular fluids, ions, and neurotransmitters; proving energy substrates to neurons; regulating local blood flow; modulating neuronal activity through gliotransmission; and assisting in interstitial fluid drainage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sofroniew &amp; Vinters, 2010</xref>). Though not electrically excitable, astrocytes exhibit complex intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, both spatially and temporally, within individual astrocytes and across astrocytic networks. Astrocytes express various types of Gq-coupled receptors activated by neurotransmitters such as ATP, epinephrine, glutamate, and dopamine <italic>etc</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Verkhratsky &amp; Nedergaard, 2018</xref>). Activation of these Gq-coupled receptors initiates the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R) signaling cascade, causing a release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER that substantially increases intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Guerra-Gomes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Verkhratsky &amp; Nedergaard, 2018</xref>). Increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in astrocytes are involved in regulating numerous afore-mentioned processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Giaume et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Verkhratsky &amp; Nedergaard, 2018</xref>). Recent studies have shown that astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling can regulate circadian rhythms and sleep patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bojarskaite et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brancaccio et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence underscores the importance of the circadian clock in astrocytes function. Cultured murine cortical astrocytes expressing a PER-luciferase reporter (PER::LUC) exhibit circadian oscillations and can be entrained by temperature cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Prolo et al., 2005</xref>) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), which synchronizes SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Marpegan et al., 2009</xref>). These findings provide strong evidence that a molecular clock operates in astrocytes. In addition, disruption of clock genes specific to astrocytes has been linked to a range of deleterious effects, including excessive astrocyte activation, disruptions in daily activity patterns, impaired learning, metabolic imbalances, and a shortened lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barca-Mayo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barca-Mayo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Griffin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lananna et al., 2018</xref>). Remarkably, these phenotypic changes closely resemble those observed in astrocytes during the progression of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Brandebura et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Phatnani &amp; Maniatis, 2015</xref>). Moreover, the rhythmic metabolic activity of astrocytes, including intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations and neurotransmitter release, is critical for circadian timing in the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brancaccio et al., 2017</xref>). Despite the emerging significance of circadian rhythms in astrocyte function in health and disease, our understanding of the link between the circadian clock and specific astrocytic functions is still limited.</p>
<p>In this study, we conducted a transcriptome analysis to investigate how the circadian clock regulates astrocyte function. Our research uncovered that <italic>Herp (</italic>homocysteine-inducible ER protein with ubiquitin like domain 1; <italic>Herp</italic>) exhibited a BMAL1-dependent rhythmic expression, peaking at subjective midday phase and reaching its nadir at subjective midnight phase. HERP was crucial for ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation by modulating the degradation of ITPRs. Importantly, the ATP-stimulated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response varied according to time post synchronization, a dependence that was absent in cultured astrocytes from <italic>Bmal1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice. Furthermore, the pronounced release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> during the subjective night phase led to robust phosphorylation of the Ser368 residue of CX43, diminishing cell-to-cell communication between astrocytes. Overall, our study demonstrates that the circadian clock orchestrates a variety of astrocytic processes including Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis by controlling the rhythmic transcription of genes, highlighting its pivotal role in CNS function.</p>

<title>Defining circadian rhythmic transcripts in cultured mouse cortical astrocytes</title>
<p>To understand how the circadian clock regulates astrocyte physiology, we conducted a circadian transcriptome analysis of cultured mouse cortical astrocytes. Cultured astrocytes were synchronized using serum shock (SS) and harvested every 4hrs for 2 days starting at 12hrs post-SS. The time series astrocyte transcriptome was determined by RNA-seq (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Using a Gaussian mixture model, we defined expressed transcripts, choosing 0.577 transcripts per million (TPM) as the cut-off, corresponding to the 1% threshold in the distribution curve of highly expressed genes (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>). A total of 17,671 transcripts with the highest TPM values of the 12 time points exceeding 0.577, were considered expressed. To validate astrocyte enrichment, we compared the expression of marker genes for nervous cells. Our transcriptome data were replete with astrocyte markers but lacked markers for microglia, oligodendrocytes, neurons, and endothelial cells (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Various methods have been used to identify periodicity in time-series data, such as Lomb-Scargle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Glynn et al., 2006</xref>), JTK_CYCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hughes et al., 2010</xref>) and ARSER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yang &amp; Su, 2010</xref>), each with distinct advantages and limitations. MetaCycle, integrates these three methods, facilitating the evaluation of periodicity in time-series data without requiring the selection of an optimal algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, BioCycle has been developed using a deep neural network trained with extensive synthetic and biological time series datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agostinelli et al., 2016</xref>). Because MetaCycle and Biocycle identify periodic signal based on different algorithms, we applied both packages to identify periodicity in our time-series transcriptome data. BioCycle and MetaCycle analyses detected 321 and 311 periodic transcripts, respectively (FDR corrected, q-value &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Among these, 220 (53.4%) were detected by both methods, but many transcripts did not overlap. MetaCycle is known for its inability to detect asymmetric waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mei et al., 2020</xref>). In our analysis, genes with increasing waveforms like <italic>Adora1</italic> and <italic>Mybph</italic> were identified as rhythmic only by BioCycle, while <italic>Plat</italic> and <italic>Il34</italic> were identified as rhythmic only by MetaCycle (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1C</xref>). Despite these discrepancies, the clear circadian rhythmic expression profiles of these genes led us to conclude that using the union of the two lists compensates for the limitations of each algorithm. Consequently, we identified a total of 412 circadian rhythmic transcripts (2.3% of all transcripts) (Supplementary file 1). The circadian oscillations of these transcripts are illustrated in the heatmap in <xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1D</xref>.</p>
<p>Next, we compared rhythmic transcripts of astrocytes with those of 12 mouse tissues from CircaDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), a database of circadian rhythmic genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). A majority of the rhythmic transcripts in astrocytes (265 of 412, 65.3%) were not rhythmic or were rhythmic in one tissue. 14 transcripts were rhythmic in more than 10 tissues; most of these were core clock genes except <italic>Tspan4</italic>, <italic>Tsc22d3</italic>, and <italic>Wee1</italic>. This result is consistent with previous reports of tissue-specific circadian rhythmic expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mure et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Panda et al., 2002</xref>). A phase comparison of these 14 common oscillating transcripts between CircaDB and our analysis showed a consistent time difference, with 8hrs after SS corresponding to ZT0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). An additional phase comparison of 82 transcripts that overlapped in only one tissue indicated a very robust phase correlation between astrocytes and the corresponding tissue (<italic>r</italic> = 0.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Collectively, our analysis indicates that the identified oscillating transcripts were not false positive but were clearly associated with the circadian clock. Hierarchical clustering analysis of oscillating transcripts revealed two clusters: cluster 1 with 185 transcripts and cluster 2 with 227 transcripts (<xref rid="fig1S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2</xref>). A circular map of peak phases across all rhythmic genes revealed two major peaks, one in the early night (ZT12 to ZT16) and one in the late night or dawn (ZT21 to ZT1) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Here for more intuitive interpretation, we set 8hrs post synchronization (sync) to ZT0 based on a previous phase comparison. Circadian transcriptome studies conducted in multiple animal tissues have indicated that the phases of each tissue are not randomly distributed but are predominantly clustered in one or two narrow temporal windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Panda et al., 2002</xref>). Consistent with these previous reports, mouse cultured astrocytes exhibited a high degree of temporal organization. Intriguingly, there was a relatively quiescent zone during subjective daytime, a finding different from that observed for diurnal animals, which showed a quiescent zone during subjective nighttime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mure et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>To understand the biological processes and pathways controlled by the circadian clock, we performed a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis on each cluster using Metascape (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://metascape.org">https://metascape.org</ext-link>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Given that the goal of our research was to investigate processes specifically controlled by the circadian clock, we excluded 17 core clock transcripts (<italic>Arntl, Clock, Nfil3, Npas2, Bhlhe40, Bhlhe41, Cry1, Cry2, Dbp, Elf, Nr1d1, Nr1d2, Per1, Per2, Per3, Rorc,</italic> and <italic>Tef</italic>) from our GO enrichment analysis. Among the rhythmic processes, we focused on “calcium ion homeostasis (GO:0055074)” due to the importance of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in numerous astrocyte functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agulhon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bojarskaite et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brancaccio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Giaume et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Guerra-Gomes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Verkhratsky &amp; Nedergaard, 2018</xref>). In this category, Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis-related genes included <italic>Herp</italic>, <italic>Slc4a11</italic>, <italic>Sord</italic> and <italic>Kcnh1 etc</italic>. with <italic>Herp</italic> showing the most robust oscillation with large amplitude (<xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Circadian rhythmic expression of <italic>Herp</italic> in cultured mouse cortical astrocytes</title>
<p>We first assessed the expression patterns of core clock genes and <italic>Herp</italic> in our cultured astrocytes. <italic>Bmal1</italic>, was rhythmically expressed with a peak at 30hr post sync while <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Rev-Erbα</italic> showed rhythmic expression with peaks at 20hr and 16hr, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>Herp</italic> displayed a robust rhythmic expression pattern, peaking at 20hr, similar to <italic>Per2</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). To verify the circadian expression of <italic>Herp</italic>, we performed quantitative real-time RT-PCR, which confirmed that <italic>Bmal1</italic>, <italic>Rev-Erbα</italic> and <italic>Herp</italic> exhibited circadian rhythms consistent with the RNAseq results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we examined whether HERP protein levels also showed rhythmic changes, as many genes exhibit rhythmic transcription without corresponding protein level changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Reddy et al., 2006</xref>). We validated the specificity of HERP antiserum using Western blot analysis of astrocytes treated with <italic>Herp</italic> siRNA (<italic>Herp</italic>-KD), which significantly reduced <italic>Herp</italic> mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) and the intensities of specific bands in Western blots (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). SS-synchronized cultured astrocytes were sampled every 6hrs for 2 days and processed for Western blot analysis of BMAL1 and HERP. BMAL1 phosphorylation showed circadian variation, with hyper-phosphorylation peaking at midday and hypo-phosphorylation peaking early in the day or late at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Yoshitane et al., 2009</xref>). In our SS-synchronized cultured astrocytes, BMAL1 was hyperphosphorylated at 18hr, 24hr, 42hr, and 48hr (corresponding to midday) and hypo-phosphorylated at 12hr, 36hr (corresponding to early in the day), and 30hr, 54hr (corresponding to late at night) throughout two daily cycles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>) indicating strong circadian rhythms in cultured astrocytes. Importantly, HERP protein levels oscillated peaking at 18hr and 42hr and reaching a minimum at 12hr, 30hr, and 54hr, mirroring its mRNA pattern (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Herp</italic> also exhibited rhythmic expression in astrocyte cultures synchronized by either dexamethasone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Balsalobre et al., 2000</xref>) or forskolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yagita &amp; Okamura, 2000</xref>) treatments which are other commonly used for circadian clock resetting (<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, to investigate whether the rhythmic expression of <italic>Herp</italic> is regulated by a circadian clock, we examined <italic>Herp</italic> mRNA and protein expression patterns in primary astrocyte cultured from <italic>Bmal1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. The rhythmic expression patterns of <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Rev- Erbα</italic>, and <italic>Herp</italic> were abolished in <italic>Bmal1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> astrocyte cultures with their expression maintained at trough levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). HERP protein levels remained constant throughout the daily cycles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>). Collectively, these observations indicate that the expression of <italic>Herp</italic> exhibits a robust circadian rhythm that is controlled by BMAL1 in cultured mouse astrocytes. These results suggest that HERP-regulated cellular processes vary in a time-of-day specific manner.</p>

<title><italic>Herp</italic> knockdown alters ATP-induced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release</title>
<p><italic>Herp</italic> was first identified as a gene with altered expression in response to homocysteine treatment in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kokame et al., 1996</xref>). It is strongly induced not only by homocysteine but also by ER stress-causing agents such as tunicamycin or thapsigargin. HERP, characterized by an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain and present in the ER membrane facing cytoplasmic side, is involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kokame et al., 2000</xref>) and is part of the ER- associated degradation (ERAD) complex, participating in the ubiquitination and relocation of ERAD substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Leitman et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, HERP modulates the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response through IP<sub>3</sub>R degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Paredes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Torrealba et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, we sought to investigate whether HERP-controlled processes are subject to circadian regulation by examining the HERP-regulated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in the astrocytes. We employed the organelle-specific fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators: G-CEPIA1er for the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>), R-GECO1 for the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wu et al., 2013</xref>), and mito-R-GECO1 for mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). We first confirmed that these Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators colocalized with organelle-specific markers (<xref rid="fig3S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>). ATP serves not only as a fundamental energy source but also as an active intercellular messenger. In astrocytes, ATP application induces an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Neary et al., 1988</xref>) by binding to the G<sub>q</sub>/G<sub>11</sub> coupled P2Y receptor, activating PLC-β and inducing the hydrolysis of PIP<sub>2</sub> to diacylglycerol (DAG) and IP<sub>3</sub>, which mobilizes Ca<sup>2+</sup> through IP<sub>3</sub>Rs on the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Baryshnikov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">James &amp; Butt, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>We treated control and <italic>Herp</italic>-KD astrocytes with 100μM ATP and monitored subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes. ATP treatment rapidly decreased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> in control astrocytes and this response was more pronounced in <italic>Herp</italic>-KD astrocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). As the main Ca<sup>2+</sup> store in the cell, ER releases Ca<sup>2+</sup> which is then rapidly transmitted to other organelles such as mitochondria and cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Carreras-Sureda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Giorgi et al., 2018</xref>). Although ATP treatment did not significantly alter cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in control astrocytes, it greatly increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in <italic>Herp</italic>-KD astrocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). Consistently, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> significantly increased in <italic>Herp</italic>-KD astrocytes compared with control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we examined the mechanism by which HERP controls ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>.There are three subtypes of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs encoded by the genes <italic>Itpr1</italic>, <italic>Itpr2</italic>, and <italic>Itpr3</italic>. Transcriptome analysis of our cultured astrocytes indicated <italic>Itpr1</italic> as the most prevalent, followed by <italic>Itpr2</italic>, while <italic>Itpr3</italic> expression was minimal (<xref rid="fig3S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, expression of these <italic>Itpr</italic> subtypes was not rhythmic. We then assessed the ITPR1 and ITPR2 protein levels in control and <italic>Herp</italic>-KD astrocytes and found that the levels of both ITPR1 and ITPR2 were slightly but statistically significantly increased in <italic>Herp</italic>-KD astrocytes compared to controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3M</xref>). These results, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Paredes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Torrealba et al., 2017</xref>) indicated that HERP negatively regulates ITPRs in astrocyte.</p>
<p>To confirm that the HERP-ITPR axis underlies ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response, we analyzed the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response following treatment with Xestospongin C (XesC), an IP3R inhibitor. XesC treatment reduced the ATP- induced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and abolished the enhanced effect observed in <italic>Herp</italic>-KD compared to control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3N</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3P</xref>).

<title>ATP-induced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release varies according to time post synchronization</title>
<p>Given that HERP levels exhibited circadian variation and HERP regulated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, we investigated whether ATP-induced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses differ depending on circadian phase. After SS, we measured ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> following ATP treatment at peak (42hr post sync) and trough (30hr post sync) phases of HERP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). With lower HERP levels potentially resulting in higher IP<sub>3</sub>R levels at 30hr, we anticipated greater ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release at 30hr than at 42hr. Consistent with this, ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> decreased more at 30hr than at 42hr upon ATP treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). Also, in keeping with previous result (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>), cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increased more at 30hr than at 42hr following ATP treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>).

<p>To confirm that HERP underlies this circadian phase-dependent ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, we compared ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in control and <italic>Herp</italic>-KD astrocytes at 30hr and 42hr post sync. Control astrocytes exhibited time-dependent variation in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, which was abolished in <italic>Herp</italic>-KD astrocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4L</xref>), indicating the involvement of HERP in this regulation.</p>
<p>We then assessed whether ITPR1 and ITPR2 levels varied with time. BMAL1 phosphorylation served as a proxy for circadian phase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4N</xref>). ITPR2 levels showed time-dependent changes opposite to those of HERP, whereas ITPR1 levels remained constant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4N</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4O</xref>). Since <italic>Itpr2</italic> mRNA levels did not exhibit a rhythmic pattern (<xref rid="fig3S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>), the circadian phase-dependent differences in ITPR2 levels are likely driven by HERP-mediated ITPR2 degradation. Consequently, circadian rhythmic ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is primarily driven by oscillations in ITPR2.</p>
<p>To verify if ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is regulated by the circadian clock, we analyzed the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in <italic>Bmal1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mouse astrocyte cultures. In WT astrocyte cultures, there was a clear circadian phase-dependent difference in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. However, this difference was abolished in <italic>Bmal1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> astrocyte cultures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>). The absence of rhythmic ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in <italic>Bmal1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> astrocytes correlated with constant levels of HERP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-E</xref>). Additionally, ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release was significantly faster in <italic>Bmal1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> astrocytes compared to WT astrocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>) attributed to lower levels of HERP in <italic>Bmal1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> astrocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-E</xref>).

<title>ATP-induced S368-phosphorylation of CX43 and gap junctional communication shows circadian variation</title>
<p>Syncytial coupling through gap junctions is a prominent feature of astrocytes, critical for their homeostatic functions, including the diffusion and equilibration of ions, metabolites, and signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Langer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Verkhratsky &amp; Nedergaard, 2018</xref>). This coupling allows the astrocytic syncytium to propagate Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves, affecting nearby and remote cells through release of “gliotransmitters” and modulating synaptic functions in a far-reaching network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pacholko et al., 2020</xref>). Connexin (Cx) family proteins constitute gap junction channels (GJCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Giaume et al., 2021</xref>), with Cx43 (also known as Gja1) and Cx30 (also known as Gjb6) being the main connexins in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kunzelmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nagy et al., 1999</xref>). In our cultured astrocytes, Cx43 was the most abundantly expressed connexin (<xref rid="fig6S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>). Phosphorylation of CX43 at Ser368 by protein kinase C (PKC), activated in response to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, is known to decrease gap junction conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Enkvist &amp; McCarthy, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nimlamool et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Solan &amp; Lampe, 2014</xref>). Accordingly, we hypothesized that the circadian variations in ATP-driven ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses might differentially impact CX43 phosphorylation according to times of day.</p>
<p>First, we confirmed that ATP treatment induces rapid phosphorylation of CX43 at Ser368 (pCX43 (S368)) in cultured astrocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>).

<p>We also examined circadian variations of pCX43 (S368) <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mice were entrained to a 12:12 hour light/dark (LD) cycle for two weeks and then kept in constant darkness (DD). This ensured that variations in CX43 phosphorylation were due to the internal circadian clock and not external light stimuli. Prefrontal cortex tissues were dissected at circadian time (CT) 58 and CT70 on the third day of DD. pCX43 (S368) levels were higher at CT70 (subjective night) than at CT58 (subjective day), consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> results (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm that HERP underlies the rhythmic phosphorylation of CX43 at Ser368, we compared pCX43 (S368) in control and <italic>Herp</italic>-KD astrocytes at 30hr and 42hr post sync. In control astrocytes pCX43 (S368) was higher at 30hr compared to 42hr, consistent with previous results. However, in <italic>Herp</italic>-KD astrocytes, the circadian phase-dependent differences in pCX43 (S368) were abolished despite the normal circadian rhythm indicated by BMAL1 phosphorylation, (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6H</xref>). This suggests that rhythms of HERP levels are required for the rhythmic phosphorylation of CX43 (S368).</p>
<p>Finally, we assessed if rhythmic phosphorylation of CX43 contributes to circadian phase-dependent variation in gap junctional communication in cultured astrocytes by using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) method. The absence of FRAP signal in carbenoxolone (CBX)-treated astrocytes confirmed the involvement of gap junctions in intercellular communication of cultured astrocytes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>).

<p>In summary, we propose a model illustrating how the circadian clock influences astrocyte function through the regulation of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. Based on phase comparisons of clock genes between our data and CircaDB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), we defined subjective day and night, with 8hr post sync corresponding to the beginning of the day. In astrocytes, BMAL1/CLOCK-controlled oscillation of HERP regulates day and night variations in ITPR2 levels. These oscillations contribute to changes in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses, which in turn result in the distinct day and night differences in pCx43 (S368) and the gap junction conductance (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is widely acknowledged that the circadian clock orchestrates cellular functions in a highly cell type-specific manner by governing transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mure et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Although the importance of the circadian clock in astrocytes has been well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barca-Mayo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barca-Mayo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Griffin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lananna et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Prolo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tso et al., 2017</xref>), studies specifically exploring astrocyte-specific circadian transcriptomes have been limited. Our study conducted such an analysis on primary cultured cortical astrocytes, discovering that rhythmic expression of <italic>Herp</italic> underlies day/night variation in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response by regulating IP<sub>3</sub>R levels. We also found that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated CX43 phosphorylation varied according to the daily rhythmic ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. Given that astrocytes function in a network in which Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagates through GJCs, we propose that the time-dependent control of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses could influence the role of astrocytes in modulating synaptic activity throughout the day (see below).</p>
<p>Circadian oscillations of <italic>Herp</italic> expression have been previously documented in various mouse tissues including the lung, heart, liver, kidney, aorta, skeletal muscle, adrenal gland, pancreatic islet and SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Panda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Rakshit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we identified that <italic>Herp</italic> is also rhythmically expressed in cultured astrocytes. <italic>Herp</italic> exhibited rhythmic expression in phase with <italic>Per2</italic> and showed flattened expression at its nadir level in <italic>Bmal1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> astrocyte cultures, suggesting direct regulation CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). ChIP-Atlas analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chip-atlas.org">https://chip-atlas.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Oki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zou et al., 2022</xref>) has shown CLOCK binding to the genomic region of <italic>Herp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Annayev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hong et al., 2018</xref>). Although no canonical E-Box is present in the upstream 6kb region of the <italic>Herp</italic> gene, several non-canonical E-Boxes, important for circadian expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yoo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>), were identified (<xref rid="tblS2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). Among these, the non-canonical E-Box sequence “CACGTT,” located near transcription start site (chr8:94386194-94386543), is highly conserved across diverse mammalian species. Therefore, we propose that these non-canonical E boxes might drive the CLOCK/BMAL1 dependent expression of <italic>Herp</italic>. A recent study employing a circadian single-cell RNA seq analysis of SCN reported that <italic>Herp</italic> displays a circadian rhythm exclusively in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wen et al., 2020</xref>). Given that astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the SCN show a circadian rhythm, peaking during the subjective night and are crucial for circadian timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brancaccio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Patton et al., 2022</xref>), HERP’s circadian rhythmic expression in SCN astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wen et al., 2020</xref>) may be integral to the mechanisms of circadian timing.</p>
<p>We demonstrated that HERP regulated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses by degrading IP<sub>3</sub>Rs in astrocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3M</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Paredes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Torrealba et al., 2017</xref>). When <italic>Herp</italic> was downregulated, both ITPR1 and ITPR2 levels increased, suggesting HERP’s role in degrading both ITPR1 and ITPR2. However, only the levels of ITPR2 exhibited circadian phase-dependent variation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3M</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4L</xref>). The min/max ratio of HERP expression throughout the day was 0.38 under normal conditions but 0.072 in <italic>Herp</italic>-KD conditions. Based on this, we reasoned that the amplitude of HERP oscillations impacted the levels of ITPR2 under normal circumstances, while having a much lesser effect on the levels of ITPR1. Thus, the circadian control of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in response to stimulation in cultured astrocytes is primarily attributable to ITPR2.</p>
<p>ER and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses following ATP treatment exhibited distinct circadian variation, but mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses did not show significant variations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). We think of several possibilities to account for the absence of significant circadian variations in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> relative to cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> change. Upon ATP stimulation, direct Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer occurs through IP<sub>3</sub>R in the cytosol. For mitochondrial uptake, Ca<sup>2+</sup> first transits to the intermembrane space via IP<sub>3</sub>Rs and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) complex before entering the matrix through mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Giorgi et al., 2018</xref>). The Mito-R-GECO1 reporter is confined within the mitochondrial matrix and thus limiting assessment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Substantial changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels might occur in the intermembrane space, but the influx into the matrix via MCUs could remain constant across different time, resulting in apparent lack of significant change. Secondly, the amount of VDAC or the VDAC:IP<sub>3</sub>R complex on the mitochondrial membrane might vary inversely with HERP levels, potentially maintaining a consistent flow of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the mitochondria irrespective of the time. Additionally, the presence of several Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion mechanisms in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Giorgi et al., 2018</xref>) points to a more complex regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> compared with that in the cytosol. Although the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated, our data indicate that the circadian variation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER, particularly in response to stimuli, predominantly impacts cytoplasmic signaling rather than mitochondrial signaling.</p>
<p>During the subjective night phase (active period for mice), ATP- stimulated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release was pronounced than during the subjective day phase (rest period for mice) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). This finding aligns with studies showing heightened stimulus-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in astrocytes during wakefulness, which diminishes during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bojarskaite et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ingiosi et al., 2020</xref>). In flies, Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in astrocytes is correlated with the duration of wakefulness, suggesting that astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a key factor in the homeostatic regulation of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Blum et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for differential Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels observed between wake and sleep states, with circadian regulation of ITPR2 by HERP being a key factor in this process.</p>
<p>ATP-stimulated Cx43 (S368) phosphorylation is higher at 30hr (subjective night phase) than at 42hr post sync (subjective day phase) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>.), a finding further supported by in <italic>vivo</italic> experiments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). What are the implications of this day/night variation in CX43 (S368) phosphorylation? We reasoned that the circadian variation in CX43 phosphorylation could significantly impact astrocyte functionality within the syncytium. Indeed, our cultured astrocytes exhibited circadian phase-dependent variation in gap junctional communication (Figure7D-7F). Astrocytes influence synaptic activity through the release of gliotransmitters such as glutamate, GABA, D-serine, and ATP, triggered by increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to the activity of adjacent neurons and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Verkhratsky &amp; Nedergaard, 2018</xref>). Importantly, this increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> spreads to adjacent astrocytes through GJCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fujii et al., 2017</xref>), influencing a large area of the neuronal network. Considering that Cx43 Ser368 phosphorylation occurs to uncouple specific pathways in the astrocytic syncytium to focus local responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Enkvist &amp; McCarthy, 1992</xref>), our findings suggest that astrocytes better equipped for localized responses when presented with a stimulus during the active phase in mice. Conversely, during the rest period, characterized by more synchronous neuronal activity across broad brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Vyazovskiy et al., 2009</xref>) higher GJC conductance might allow astrocytes to exert control over a larger area. In support of this idea, recent study showed that synchronized astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity advances the slow wave activity (SWA) of the brain, a key feature of non-REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Szabó et al., 2017</xref>). Blocking GJC was found to reduce SWA, further supporting this interpretation. However, conflicting findings have also been reported. For instance, Ingiosi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ingiosi et al., 2020</xref>) found that astrocytic synchrony was higher during wakefulness than sleep in the mouse frontal cortex. Whether these differing results in astrocyte synchrony during resting and active periods are attributable to differences in experimental context (e.g., brain regions, sleep-inducing condition) remains unclear. Indeed, astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics during wakefulness/sleep vary according to brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tsunematsu et al., 2021</xref>). While the extent of astrocyte synchrony might differ depending on brain region and/or stimulus, our results suggest that the baseline state of astrocyte synchrony, which is affected by GJC conductance, varies with the day/night cycle.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings enhance the understanding of the circadian regulation of astrocytic functions, particularly through the rhythmic expression of HERP and its impact on ER Ca²⁺ signaling and CX43 phosphorylation. This study underscores the intricate interplay between the circadian clock and astrocyte physiology, highlighting the pivotal role of HERP in modulating key astrocytic processes such as sleep, gap junction communication and synaptic modulation. The day/night variations in ER Ca²⁺ response and CX43 phosphorylation, and their implications for astrocytic network dynamics and neuronal interactions, open new avenues for exploring the broader implications of astrocytic circadian rhythms in brain function and health.</p>

Live imaging was performed using a Nikon A1R Confocal Microscope with a 488 nm argon laser and a x60 1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat objective. Photobleaching was performed on a region of interest (ROI) cell, and fluorescence was measured at 37°C and 5% CO2. Fluorescence intensity was recorded pre-bleach (5 images), during a 15-second laser pulse (100% power, 5.3 lines/sec), and post-bleach (every 3 seconds for 3 minutes). Images were analyzed using NIS Elements C software. Fluorescence intensity at each time point (F<sub>t</sub>) was normalized to the pre-bleach intensity (F<sub>0</sub>), calculated as the average of 5 pre-bleach frames. The percentage of fluorescence recovery was calculated using: (F<sub>FR</sub>-F<sub>A</sub>)/(F<sub>0</sub>-F<sub>A</sub>)x100, where F<sub>FR</sub> is the full recovery fluorescence intensity and F<sub>A</sub> is the intensity immediately after photobleaching.</p>

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>To conduct the statistical analyses, all samples were first tested for normality. For cases where normality testing was not possible, such as with the Area Under/Above Curve, <italic>t</italic>-tests were used for comparing two groups, and one-way ANOVA was used for comparing three or more groups, considering the sufficient sample size. When comparing two groups, a <italic>t</italic>-test was performed if the data followed a normal distribution; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used. For comparisons among three or more groups, one-way ANOVA was used if the data were normally distributed, and the Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA tests were used if they were not. When comparing three or more groups across multiple time points, a two-way ANOVA was performed. A <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In Ryu et al., the authors use a cortical mouse astrocyte culture system to address the functional contribution of astrocytes to circadian rhythms in the brain. The authors' starting point is transcriptional output from serum-shocked culture, comparative informatics with existing tools and existing datasets. After fairly routine pathway analyses, they focus on the calcium homeostasis machinery and one gene, Herp, in particular. They argue that Herp is rhythmic at both mRNA and protein levels in astrocytes. They then use a calcium reporter targeted to the ER, mitochondria, or cytosol and show that Herp modulates calcium signaling as a function of circadian time. They argue that this occurs through the regulation of inositol receptors. They claim that the signaling pathway is clock-controlled by a limited examination of Bmal1 knockout astrocytes. Finally, they switch to calcium-mediated phosphorylation of the gap junction protein Connexin 43 but do not directly connect HERP-mediated circadian signaling to these observations. While these experiments address very important questions related to the critical role of astrocytes in regulating circadian signaling, the mechanistic arguments for HERP function, its role in circadian signaling through inositol receptors, the connection to gap junctions, and ultimately, the functional relevance of these findings is only partially substantiated by experimental evidence.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The paper provides useful datasets of astrocyte gene expression in circadian time.</p>
<p>- Identifies HERP as a rhythmic output of the circadian clock.</p>
<p>- Demonstrates the circadian-specific sensitivity of ATP -&gt; calcium signaling.</p>
<p>- Identifies possible rhythms in both Connexin 43 phosphorylation and rhythmic movement of calcium between cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- It is not immediately clear why the authors chose to focus on Ca2+ homeostasis or Herp from their initial screens as neither were the &quot;most rhythmic&quot; pathways in their primary analyses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We chose to focus on Ca2+ homeostasis processes because intracellular Ca2+ signaling plays crucial role in numerous astrocyte functions and is notably associated with sleep/wake status of animals, which is our primary interest (Bojarskaite et al., 2020; Ingiosi et al., 2020; Blum et al., 2021; Szabó et al., 2017). Among the genes involved in calcium ion homeostasis, Herp exhibited the most robust rhythmicity (supplementary table 1). The rationale for our focus on Ca2+ homeostasis and Herp is explained in the results section (line 143-150). We hope this provides a clear justification for our focus.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- It would have been interesting (and potentially important) to know whether various methods of cellular synchronization would also render HERP rhythmic (e.g., temperature, forskolin, etc). If Herp is indeed relatively astrocyte-specific and rhythmic, it should be easy to assess its rhythmicity in vivo.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s insightful comment. In response, we examined HERP expression in cultured astrocytes synchronized using either Dexamethasone or Forskolin treatment. We found that Herp exhibited rhythmic expression at both the the mRNA and protein levels under these conditions. These results have been added to Figure S3 and are explained in the manuscript (lines 173-175).</p>
<p>Additionally, we measured HERP levels in the prefrontal cortex of mice at CT58 and CT70 and found no rhythmicity, as shown in Author response image 1. Given that Herp is expressed in various brain cell types, including microglia, endothelial cells, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and the astrocytes- with the highest expression in microglia(Cahoy et al., 2008), we reason that the potential rhythmic expression of HERP in astrocytes might be masked by its continuous expression in other cell types. Nonetheless, to assess HERP rhythmicity specifically in astrocytes in vivo, we attempted immunostaining using several anti-HERP antibodies, but none were successful. Consequently, we were unable to determine whether HERP exhibits rhythmic expression in astrocytes in vivo.</p>

<p>- The authors show that Herp suppression reduces ATP-mediated suppression of calcium whereas it initially increases Ca2+ in the cytosol and mitochondria and then suppresses it. The dynamics of the mitochondrial and cytosolic responses are not discussed in any detail and it is unclear what their direct relationship is to Herp-mediated ER signaling. What is the explanation for Herp (which is thought to be ER-specific) to calcium signaling in other organelles?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our examination of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ responses was aimed at corroborating HERP’s effect on ER Ca2+ response. Upon ATP stimulation, Ca2+ is released from the ER via IP3R receptors (IP3Rs) and subsequently transmitted to other organelles including mitochondria (Carreras-Sureda et al., 2018; Giorgi et al., 2018). Ca2+ is directly transferred to the cytosol by IP3Rs located on the ER membrane, and to the mitochondria through a complex formed by IP3R and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) on the mitochondria (Giorgi et al., 2018).  Consistent with previous reports, we observed an increase of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ levels accompanied by decrease in ER Ca2+ levels following ATP treatment (See Fig. 3B, E, H, control siRNA). The ATP-stimulated ER Ca2+ release was enhanced by Herp knockdown. We reasoned that if Ca2+ release was enhanced, then cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptakes would also be enhanced. The results were consistent with our hypothesis (See Fig. 3B, E, H, Herp siRNA). These observations are described in the Results section (lines 202-208) and in the Discussion (lines 333-348). We hope this explanation clarifies the relationship between Herp-mediated ER Ca2+ response and Ca2+ response in other organelles. Thank you for your consideration.</p>

<p>- What is the functional significance of promoting ATP-mediated suppression of calcium in ER?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In astrocytes, intracellular Ca2+ plays crucial role in regulating several processes. In this study, among various downstream effects of intracellular Ca2+, we examined the gap junction channel (GJC) conductance, which affects astrocytic communication. As discussed in the manuscript (lines 357-381), circadian variation in HERP results in rhythmic Cx43 (S368) phosphorylation linked with GJC conductance. We propose that during the subjective night phase, heightened ATP induced ER Ca2+ release reduces GJC conductance, uncoupling astrocytes from the syncytium, making them better equipped for localized response. On the other hand, during the subjective day phase, increased GJC conductance may allow astrocytes to control a larger area for synchronous neuronal activity which is a key feature of sleep.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The authors then nicely show that the effect of ATP is dependent on intrinsic circadian timing but do not explain why these effects are antiphase in cytosol or mitochondria.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Moreover, the ∆F/F for calcium in mitochondria and cytosol both rise, cross the abscissa, and then diminish - strongly suggesting a biphasic signaling event. Therefore, one wonders whether measuring the area under the curve is the most functionally relevant measurement of the change.</p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comments. As explained in our previous response, Ca2+ released from the ER is transferred to the cytosol and mitochondria. This transfer explains why the fluorescent intensities of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ indicators show anti-phasic responses to those of the ER.</p>
<p>We agree that cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ responses may be biphasic. The decrease below the abscissa in mitochondria and cytosol likely reflects Ca2+ extrusion from these organelles. However, our primary focus was on the initial uptake of Ca2+ following ER Ca2+ release. Thus, when calculating the area under the curve (AUC), we measured the area between the ∆F/F graph and the y=0 (X-axis) for both mitochondria and cytosol. We reason that the measuring the area under the curve (above the abscissa) fits with our objective.</p>
<p>While addressing your concerns, we noticed errors in the Y-axis labels of Fig. 3C, 4D, and 5C. For the ER Ca2+ dynamics, we measured the area above curve. These mistakes have now been corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Why are mitochondrial and cytosolic calcium not also demonstrated for Bmal1 KO astrocytes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In two sets of experiments (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4), we demonstrated that the increase in cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ aligns with ER Ca2+ release. Since there were no circadian time differences in ER Ca2+ release in the Bmal1 KO cultures, we concluded that it was unnecessary to measure Ca2+ levels in the mitochondria and cytosol. Additionally, our primary focus is on the ER Ca2+ response rather than the Ca2+ dynamics in subcellular organelles. We hope this clarifies our rationale and maintains the focus of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The authors claim that Herp acts by regulating the degradation of ITPRs but this hypothesis - rather central to the mechanisms proposed in this study - is not experimentally substantiated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comments regarding the role of HERP in the degradation of IP3Rs. In the original manuscript, we demonstrated that treating cells with Herp siRNA leads to an increase in the levels of ITPR1 and ITPR2, suggesting that HERP might be involved in the regulation of IP3Rs stability. This observation is consistent with previous studies, which showed that Herp siRNA treatment increases ITPR levels in HeLa and cardiac cells (Paredes et al., 2016; Torrealba et al., 2017). Torrealba et al. also showed that HERP regulates the polyubiquitination of IP3Rs. Based on our results and previous reports, we hypothesized that HERP similarly regulates ITPR degradation in cultured astrocytes.</p>
<p>However, as the reviewer rightly pointed out, further evidence is needed to confirm that HERP specifically regulates ITPR degradation. To address this, we conducted new experiments examining the effect of XesC, an inhibitor of IP3Rs, on ER Ca2+ release. The treatment of XesC reduced the ER Ca2+ release and abolished the enhancement of ER Ca2+ release by Herp KD. These results demonstrated that HERP influences ER Ca2+ response through IP3Rs. These new findings have been added to Fig. 3N – 3P and explained in the Results section (lines 217-221).</p>
<p>We believe these additional experiments and clarifications strengthen our hypothesis that HERP regulates IP3R degradation, thereby modulating ER Ca2+ responses.</p>

<p>- There is no clear demonstration of the functional relevance of the circadian rhythms of ATP-mediated calcium signaling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned in the previous response, we examined Cx43 phosphorylation linked with GJC conductance in the context of ATP-mediated Ca2+ signaling. Our results demonstrated circadian variations in Cx43 Ser368 phosphorylation leading to variations of gap junction channel (GJC) conductance (Fig. 6C – F and Fig. 7D - I). We have discussed the significance of this circadian rhythm in ATP driven ER Ca2+ signaling concerning astrocytic function during sleep/wake states in the manuscript (lines 357 – 382) as follows.</p>
<p>“ATP-stimulated Cx43 (S368) phosphorylation is higher at 30hr (subjective night phase) than at 42hr (subjective day phase) (Fig. 6C and 6D.), a finding further supported by in vivo experiments showing higher pCx43(S368) levels in the prefrontal cortex during the subjective night than during the day (Fig. 6E and 6F). What are the implications of this day/night variation in Cx43 (S368) phosphorylation? We reasoned that the circadian variation in Cx43 phosphorylation could significantly impact astrocyte functionality within the syncytium. Indeed, our cultured astrocytes exhibited circadian phase-dependent variation in gap junctional communication (Fig.7D – 7F). Astrocytes influence synaptic activity through the release of gliotransmitters such as glutamate, GABA, D-serine, and ATP, triggered by increases in intracellular Ca2+ in response to the activity of adjacent neurons and astrocytes (Verkhratsky &amp; Nedergaard, 2018). Importantly, this increase in Ca2+ spreads to adjacent astrocytes through GJCs (Fujii et al., 2017), influencing a large area of the neuronal network. Considering that Cx43 Ser368 phosphorylation occurs to uncouple specific pathways in the astrocytic syncytium to focus local responses (Enkvist &amp; McCarthy, 1992), our findings suggest that astrocytes better equipped for localized responses when presented with a stimulus during the active phase in mice. Conversely, during the rest period, characterized by more synchronous neuronal activity across broad brain areas (Vyazovskiy et al., 2009) higher GJC conductance might allow astrocytes to exert control over a larger area. In support of this idea, recent study showed that synchronized astrocytic Ca2+ activity advances the slow wave activity (SWA) of the brain, a key feature of non-REM sleep (Szabó et al., 2017). Blocking GJC was found to reduce SWA, further supporting this interpretation. However, conflicting findings have also been reported. For instance, Ingiosi et al. (Ingiosi et al., 2020) found that astrocytic synchrony was higher during wakefulness than sleep in the mouse frontal cortex. Whether these differing results in astrocyte synchrony during resting and active periods are attributable to differences in experimental context (e.g., brain regions, sleep-inducing condition) remains unclear. Indeed, astrocyte Ca2+ dynamics during wakefulness/sleep vary according to brain regions (Tsunematsu et al., 2021). While the extent of astrocyte synchrony might differ depending on brain region and/or stimulus, on our results suggest that the baseline state of astrocyte synchrony, which is affected by GJC conductance, varies with the day/night cycle.”</p>

<p>Astrocyte biology is an active area of research and this study is timely and adds to a growing body of literature in the field. The RNA-seq, Herp expression, and Ca2+ release data across wild-type, Bmal1 knockout, and Herp knockdown cellular models are robust and lend considerable support to the study's conclusions, highlighting their importance. Despite these strengths, the manuscript presents a gap in elucidating the dynamics of HERP and the involvement of ITPR1/2 in modulating Ca2+ release patterns and their circadian variations, which remains insufficiently supported and characterized. While the Connexin data underscore the importance of rhythmic Ca2+ release triggered by ATP, the relationship here appears correlational and the role of HERP and ITPR in Cx function remains to be characterized. Moreover, enhancing the manuscript's clarity and readability could significantly benefit the presentation and comprehension of the findings.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>- While HERP appears to be a clock-controlled gene and its protein levels appear to demonstrate rhythmicity as well, the data quality of the western blotting in Bmal1 knockout raises some concern about the accuracy of HERP protein quantification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the reviewer’s concern regarding the proximity of the HERP band to a nonspecific band in the Western blotting for the Bmal1 knockout. However, we took great care to ensure the accuracy of our HERP band quantification. We meticulously selected only the specific HERP band, excluding nonspecific band. Therefore, we are confident in the accuracy of our HERP protein measurements.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- If HERP is rhythmic and ITPRs are not, if their model is correct, might we expect HERP suppression to result in 'unmasking' an ITPR rhythm?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our model suggests that both HERP and ITPRs are rhythmic, with HERP regulating the degradation of ITPR proteins and driving their rhythms. Consistent with this, we observed that day/night variations in ITPR2 levels (Fig. 4N and 4O). Therefore, we concluded that circadian variations in HERP are sufficient to drive ITPR2 rhythms. We have explained this in detail in the Result section (lines 236-241) and the Discussion section (lines 324-332).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The authors make a rather abrupt switch to examining gap junctions and connexin 43 phosphorylation. While the data demonstrating that the phosphorylation of S368 may indeed be rhythmic - the authors do not connect these data to the rest of the manuscript by showing a connection to HERP-mediated calcium signaling, limiting the coherence of the narrative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s insightful comments. To address the reviewer's concern regarding the connection between Herp and the phosphorylation of CX43 at S368, we have conducted new experiments to test whether KD of Herp abolishes the rhythms of Cx43 phosphorylation at S368. We found that the phosphorylation of Cx43 at S368 is significantly enhanced at 30hrs post sync compared with 42hrs post sync in control siRNA-treated astrocytes consistent with our previous results (Fig. 6C &amp; 6D). On the other hand, this circadian phase dependent difference in phosphorylation was abolished in Herp siRNA treated astrocytes. These results clearly indicate that circadian variations in Cx43 phosphorylation are driven by the HERP. These new results are now included in Fig. 6G and 6H and explained in the Results section (lines 276-281).</p>

<p>Most of the suggestions of this reviewer are related to the conceptual interpretation and presentation of the data and to the statistical analysis</p>
<p>In Figure 1 the authors analyzed the rhythmic transcriptome of cortical astrocytes synchronized with a serum shock in two different ways. The authors need to discuss what is the difference between the two methods used to detect rhythmic transcripts and make sense of them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have provided a more detailed explanation about MetaCycle and BioCycle, as well as the rationale for using both packages in our analysis as follows: “Various methods have been used to identify periodicity in time-series data, such as Lomb-Scargle (Glynn et al., 2006), JTK_CYCLE (Hughes et al., 2010) and ARSER (Yang &amp; Su, 2010), each with distinct advantages and limitations. MetaCycle, integrates these three methods, facilitating the evaluation of periodicity in time-series data without requiring the selection of an optimal algorithm (Wu et al., 2016). Additionally, BioCycle has been developed using a deep neural network trained with extensive synthetic and biological time series datasets (Agostinelli et al., 2016). Because MetaCycle and Biocycle identify periodic signal based on different algorithms, we applied both packages to identify periodicity in our time-series transcriptome data. BioCycle and MetaCycle analyses detected 321 and 311 periodic transcripts, respectively (FDR corrected, q-value &lt; 0.05) (Fig. 1B). Among these, 220 (53.4%) were detected by both methods, but many transcripts did not overlap. MetaCycle is known for its inability to detect asymmetric waveforms (Mei et al., 2020). In our analysis, genes with increasing waveforms like Adora1 and Mybph were identified as rhythmic only by BioCycle, while Plat and Il34 were identified as rhythmic only by MetaCycle (Fig. S1C). Despite these discrepancies, the clear circadian rhythmic expression profiles of these genes led us to conclude that using the union of the two lists compensates for the limitations of each algorithm.”</p>

<p>The reasoning for comparing CT0 with the phase of the clock 8 hs after SS needs to be explained. Circadian time (CT) conceptually refers to the clock phase in the absence of entrainment cues in vivo, the direct transformation of &quot;time after synchronization&quot; in vitro to CT is misleading.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s insightful comments. Initially, we believed that transforming TASS to CT, despite being in vitro data, might provide a more intuitive and physiologically relevant interpretation of our results. However, we agree that this approach might be misleading. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have revised our terminology by changing “CT” to “Time post sync (hr)”. Nonetheless, in Fig. 1F for circular peak phase map, we set 8hrs post sync to ZT0 based on a phase comparison result in Fig. 1D for physiologically relevant interpretation.

<p>We understand the reviewer’s concern that a cell culture system is not equivalent to light/dark entrainment condition. However, we apply time-synchronizing stimuli to recapitulate in vivo entrainment. In addition, by comparing our data with CircaDB, we defined 8hrs post sync as corresponding to ZT0, thus aligning it with the beginning of the day. We have retained the shading to facilitate easier interpretation of our data in relation to in vivo situations. However, in response to the reviewer’s concern, we have revised the shading from white/grey to light grey/dark grey. We hope this adjustment addresses the reviewer’s concern, but if the reviewer still believes it is inappropriate, please let us know, we will gladly update it.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s insightful comment. In the original version of our manuscript's Discussion section, we mentioned the absence of a canonical E-Box in the upstream of Herp gene. However, following the reviewer’s suggestion and considering the potential role of non-canonical E-Boxes, we conducted an additional analysis. This analysis identified several non-canonical E-Boxes within the 6 kb upstream region of the Herp gene (Table S2). Notably, we found one non-canonical E-Box, “CACGTT,” known to regulate circadian expression (Yoo et al., 2005) is close to the transcription start site (chr8:94386194-94386543). Moreover, this element is evolutionarily conserved across various mammals, including humans, rats, mice, dogs, and opossums (See Author response image 2). Therefore, we reasoned that these non-canonical E boxes might drive the CLOCK/BMAL1 dependent expression of Herp. We have updated the Discussion to reflect these findings in lines 315-319.</p>

<p>(1) Figure 3. Clarify the physiological importance of 100 µM ATP. Would the Herp rhythm warrant Ca2+ release rhythms under basal conditions? In 3J-K, the relatively weak effect of Herp knockdown on ITPR1/2 levels, albeit statistically significant, may not be physiologically significant. This calls into question the claimed Herp-ITPR axis that underlies the Ca2+ release phenotype. Further, the correlation certainly exists but further characterization of Herp KD cells would be required to address the mechanism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As previously reported, a broad range of ATP concentrations can induce Ca2+ activity in the astrocytes (Neary et al., 1988). Originally, we conducted an ATP dose-response analysis to observe ER Ca2+ release in our primary astrocyte culture. Our results show that ER Ca2+ release begins at 50 µM ATP and plateaus at 500 µM. Please refer to Author response image 3. We selected 100µM ATP for our experiments because it induces a medium level of ER Ca2+ response. Importantly, although measuring ATP concentrations at the synapse in vivo is challenging(Tan et al., 2017), estimates suggest synaptic ATP concentrations range from 5-500 µM (Pankratov et al., 2006). Thus, 100µM ATP is a physiologically relevant concentration that can affect nearby cells, including astrocytes, in the nervous system.</p>

<p>Regarding the comment on Ca2+ release rhythms under basal conditions, we interpret this as referring Ca2+ release in the absence of a stimulus. We typically observe Ca2+ release only upon stimulation, such as ATP treatment. However, we acknowledge that the modest effects of HERP knockdown on ITPR1/2 levels could question the HERP-ITPR axis’s role in ER Ca2+ release.</p>
<p>To address this, we analyzed whether Herp KD induced increases in ER Ca2+ release were mediated through ITPRs by treating cells with Xestospongin C (XesC), an IP3R inhibitor. XesC treatment reduced ATP-induced ER Ca2+ release and eliminated the differences in ER Ca2+ release between control and Herp KD astrocytes (Fig. 3N – 3P). These results clearly indicate that HERP-ITPR axis plays critical role in controlling ER Ca2+ release. These new experiments have been included in Fig. 3 and explained in the result section (lines 217-221).</p>
<p>Furthermore, following the reviewer’s suggestion, we examined whether HERP rhythms underlie the rhythms of ER Ca2+ response by analyzing ER Ca2+ response in Herp KD astrocyte in two different times following synchronization. In control astrocytes, ATP-induced ER Ca2+ responses vary depending on time, whereas these time-dependent variations were abolished in Herp KD astrocytes. These new experiments have been included in Fig. 4K – 4M and explained in the Results section (lines 232-235).</p>
<p>Collectively, these results indicate that HERP rhythms lead to time-dependent differences in ER Ca2+ response through ITPRs.</p>

<p>(2) Figure 4K-L. As data suggested the involvement of ITPR1 and ITPR2 (circadian effect), a reasonable next step is to determine their involvement, but the study did not pursue the hypothesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comment. Our results indeed suggest that rhythms in ITPR2 levels may drive the time-dependent variations in ATP-induced ER Ca2+ release following synchronization. The newly conducted experiments demonstrated that treatment with the ITPR inhibitor XesC suppressed ATP-induced ER Ca2+ release at both control and Herp siRNA treatment conditions (Fig. 3). Based on these findings, we now further confirm that rhythms of ITPR levels, specifically ITPR2 underlie the circadian variations in ER Ca2+ release. While examining the effect of ITPR2 siRNA would directly prove the involvement of ITPR2, we have decided to pursue this experiment in the future studies.</p>

<p>(3) Figure 5A-C. Data from WT cells should be included side by side with Bmal1-/- cells for comparison which is expected to be consistent with the HERP levels as in 5D-E. Again, the role of ITPR2 is suggested but not demonstrated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the reviewer's suggestion, we conducted additional experiments including both WT and Bmal1-/- cultured astrocytes side-by-side. The results were consistent with our previous findings: WT astrocytes showed rhythms of ER Ca2+ release while Bmal1-/- astrocytes did not. We have updated the Figure 5A to 5C and the corresponding Results section in lines 242-245 accordingly.</p>
<p>
Regarding second comment, as mentioned in our previous response, we plan to examine the role of ITPR2 in further studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 6. The Connexin data seems an addon and is correlative with the Ca2+ release. The role of Herp and Itpr in Connexin function is not addressed. Figure 6E-F was not called out in the results section. Suggest providing additional data to support the role of the HERP-ITPR axis in regulating Ca2+ release and Connexin activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that additional data are needed to support the role of HERP in regulating CX43 phosphorylation. Therefore, we have conducted further experiments to determine whether rhythms of Cx43 phosphorylation are regulated by HERP. In the control astrocytes, ATP treatment induced time-dependent variations in Cx43 phosphorylation. However, these rhythms were abolished in Herp KD astrocytes. These results indicate that rhythms in HERP levels contribute to the time-dependent variations in Cx43 phosphorylation. These new experiments have included in Fig. 6G and 6H and explained in the results section (lines 276-281).</p>
<p>Regarding second comment, we have corrected our oversight by properly referencing figures 6E-F in the results section. Please refer to lines 357-359 for clarification.</p>

<p>(5) Discussion. This section should focus on noteworthy points to discuss, not repeating the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based on the reviewer's valuable suggestions, we have revised the Discussion section to minimize repetition of the results. Thank you for your guidance.</p>

<p>(6) The manuscript exhibits numerous grammatical and textual inaccuracies that necessitate careful revision by the authors. My observations here are confined to the title and the abstract alone. I recommend altering the title from &quot;mouse cultured astrocytes&quot; to &quot;cultured mouse astrocytes&quot; for clarity and grammatical correctness. The abstract, meanwhile, needs enhancements both in terms of its content and language. It should incorporate the results of the partitioning among the ER, cytoplasm, and mitochondria, and provide clear definitions for some of the critical terms used. It's worth noting that the abstract's second sentence contains a grammatical error.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s valuable feedback. We have carefully revised the title, abstract, and main text to address the grammatical and textual issues. The title has been changed to “cultured mouse astrocytes”. Additionally, the abstract now includes results related to cytoplasmic Ca2+ dynamics and has been revised in several places. We appreciate your insights and have worked to enhance the content and language accordingly.</p>
