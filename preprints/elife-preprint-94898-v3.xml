<title>Abstract</title><p>The incessant arms race between viruses and hosts has led to numerous evolutionary innovations that shape life’s evolution. During this process, the interactions between viral receptors and viruses have garnered significant interest since viral receptors are cell surface proteins exploited by viruses to initiate infection. Our study sheds light on the arms race between the MDA5 receptor and 5’ppp-RNA virus in a lower vertebrate fish, <italic>M. miiuy</italic>. Firstly, the frequent and independent loss events of RIG-I in vertebrates prompted us to search for alternative immune substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation response (HDGCR) being the main pathway. Our further analysis suggested that MDA5 of <italic>M. miiuy and G. gallus</italic>, the homolog of RIG-I, can replace RIG-I in recognizing 5’ppp-RNA virus, which may lead to redundancy of RIG-I and loss from the species genome during evolution. Secondly, as an adversarial strategy, 5’ppp-RNA SCRV can utilize the m<sup>6</sup>A methylation mechanism to degrade MDA5 and weaken its antiviral immune ability, thus promoting its own replication and immune evasion. In summary, our study provides a snapshot into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, offering valuable perspectives on the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system.</p>

<p>The Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) motifs, including proteins, lipids and nucleotides, resulting in activation of innate immune responses of host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Retinoic acid-induced RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) are a specific group of PRRs belonging to the family of DExD/H-box RNA helicases, and they play a crucial role in the innate antiviral response. There are three members in the RLR family: retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2). RIG-I and MDA5 exhibit similar signaling characteristics and structural homology, including two N-terminal caspase-recruitment domains (CARDs), a DExD/H box RNA helicase domain, and a C-terminal repressor domain (RD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. However, LGP2 lacks CARD domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The specific roles of RIG-I and MDA5 in response to virus stimulation are not redundant: RIG-I detects short blunt-end RNA with a 5’-triphosphate motif (5’ppp-RNA), while MDA5 specifically recognizes long forms of viral dsRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In contrast, the involvement of LGP2 in cytosolic RNA sensing remains a topic of debate. Some studies have proposed that LGP2 is crucial for the production of type Ⅰ interferon (IFN-Ⅰ) in response to several RIG-I– and MDA5-dependent viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, whereas others have described LGP2 as a negative regulator of RIG-I signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. However, surprisingly, despite the important immune functions of RLR members, they have been lost from the genome in many species including mammals, birds, and fish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>5’ppp-RNA is present in a wide variety of RNA viruses, including Flaviviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. These viruses widely infect all kinds of life and cause various harmfulness and serious diseases, and the infected hosts range from the highest vertebrates to the lowest vertebrate, teleost fish <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. 5’ppp-RNA viruses are expected to be recognized and trigger an antiviral immune response by RIG-I. However, RIG-I is lacking in many vertebrates, so who then recognizes 5’ppp-RNA in these species? When a gene is functionally inactive or lost, other genes or pathways may undergo homology-dependent genetic compensation response (HDGCR) to maintain organismal balance. The pressure from viral infections has led to the evolution of the immune system, and the loss of RIG-I may be accompanied by functional substitution by homologous genes in order to compensate for the loss of RIG-I function. <italic>Tupaia belangeri</italic>, a mammal lacking RIG-I, has been reported to possess the MDA5 protein, which has undergone positive selection and exhibits the ability to sense Sendai virus (an RNA virus posed as a RIG-I agonist) for inducing type I IFN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. This study provides insights into the compensatory mechanism of RIG-I deficiency in vertebrates, however, considering the dynamic nature of host-virus dynamics, further research is urgently needed to validate and expand these insights.</p>
<p>For millions of years, viruses have coevolved with their hosts, leading to the development of various mechanisms for immune evasion in response to the mutual evolutionary pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Recently, it is reported that N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification plays a crucial role in enabling viruses to evade the interferon (IFN) response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. m<sup>6</sup>A methylation is an important epigenetic modification that involves the dynamic and reversible process of RNA methylation, regulated by methylase (writer), demethylase (eraser), and reader proteins that recognize m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. N6-methylation deposition on mRNA primarily relies on the enzymatic “writing” complex within the cell, with a key composition featuring methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) and METTL14. Conversely, N6-demethylation is chiefly modulated by “eraser” proteins, with fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) and AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) being the identified enzymes for this role <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The functional impact of N6-methylation on RNA characteristics typically remains latent until recognition by “reader” proteins, such as members of the YTHDF protein family, encompassing YTH domain family 1 (YTHDF1), YTHDF2, and YTHDF3. In mammals, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 are recognized for their involvement in the degradation of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNA targets, as well as their association with mRNA localization and phase separation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. By utilizing these m<sup>6</sup>A-related enzymes in the host, viruses can not only use m<sup>6</sup>A modification to hide themselves and avoid recognition by host receptors but also manipulate host gene expression to enable immune evasion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Fish and birds are commonly observed to exhibit “RIG-I deficiency” phenomena, and they are also the most abundant groups of aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates respectively, giving them certain evolutionary advantages. As a result, the research of the immune evolution of them helps us to understand the immune evolution of the entire vertebrates. Meanwhile, fish and birds are major source of high-quality protein for human consumption, viral diseases in aquaculture and livestock industry pose serious obstacles to the industry’s healthy development. Among them, the 5’ppp-RNA virus, as mentioned earlier, is a highly pathogenic group. Within this group, <italic>siniperca cheats</italic> rhabdovirus (SCRV) is an important pathogen that can cause huge economic losses and serious threats to aquaculture in freshwater and marine fish <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. In addition, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is also a highly infectious and widely prevalent 5’ppp-RNA virus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Therefore, in this study, we selected teleost fish miiuy croaker (<italic>Miichthys miiuy</italic>) and bird chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>), two vertebrates lacking RIG-I, as well as two 5’ppp-RNA viruses (SCRV and VSV), to investigate the evolutionary strategies and interactions between 5’ppp-RNA virus and host. The final results demonstrated that the MDA5 of <italic>M. miiuy</italic> and <italic>G. gallus</italic> lacking RIG-I both evolved the ability to recognize 5’ppp-RNA. In addition, SCRV virus can in turn utilize the m<sup>6</sup>A strategy to degrade MDA5 of <italic>M. miiuy</italic> for immune evasion. In summary, these findings shed light on the functional diversity of innate antiviral activity and unveil a complex arms race between virus replication and the innate immunity of its reservoir hosts in vertebrates. In addition, since the loss of RIG-I in vertebrates is a widespread event, our research also provides a new perspective for vertebrate groups that have lost RIG-I.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>A genetic compensation response model for RIG loss</title>
<p>In previous studies, it has been reported that a few vertebrates lost the RIG-I gene during evolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. To investigate this further, we analyzed the genomes of various species, and determined the presence and absence of the RIG-I gene. As depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, the absence of the RIG-I gene does not appear to be uncommon in vertebrates, with at least three independent loss events observed in mammals, birds and fish, respectively. These gene-loss events occurred over a long evolutionary timescale. Based on the minimum age of the common ancestor of RIG-I-missing species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.timetree.org/">http://www.timetree.org/</ext-link>), the oldest recorded losses occurring in species like <italic>Erpetoichthys calabaricus</italic>, can be traced back to approximately 330 million years ago (MYA). Conversely, the detected loss in <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> took place less than 42 MYA. To gain a deeper understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of vertebrate RIG-I, we explored the conservation of the genes surrounding RIG-I. We analyzed the genome sequences of <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Callorhinchus milii</italic>, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, <italic>Tupaia belangeri</italic>, <italic>Gallus gallus</italic>, and <italic>M. miiuy</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Similar to the slow-evolving <italic>Callorhinchus milii</italic>, humans possess RIG-I with TOPORS and ACO1 as its upstream and downstream genes, respectively. As previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. <italic>Tupaia belangeri</italic>, <italic>Gallus gallus</italic>, and <italic>M. miiuy</italic> do not have RIG-I. Interestingly, zebrafish has a RIG-I with its upstream gene being TOPORSb, seemingly a result of chromosome fragment duplication. However, one RIG-I gene was lost in the downstream region of TOPORSa, indicating that one of the RIG-I copies has been lost in zebrafish, similar to <italic>M. miiuy</italic>.</p>

<p>Given the important role of RIG-I in recognizing 5’ppp RNA, we selected two different models for experiments to detect the presence of other potential receptors for immune compensation in RIG-I deficient species. Specifically, we extracted virus RNA from SCRV and VSV viruses and obtained their dephosphorylated RNA derivatives (SCRV-RNA-CIAP and VSV-RNA-CIAP) through Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (CIAP) treatment. Next, these RNAs were transfected into MKC cells of <italic>M. miiuy</italic> and DF-1 cells of <italic>G. gallus</italic> respectively to detect the dimerization form of IRF3. Results showed that virus RNA are more potent than dephosphorylated virus RNA in activating IRF3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). And further qPCR experiments showed that the induction ability of IFN-1 by SCRV-RNA is significantly higher than that of SCRV-RNA-CIAP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). These results indicate the presence of viral receptors in <italic>M. miiuy</italic> and <italic>G. gallus</italic> that can recognize 5’ppp-RNA. Next, we compared the structural domains of human RIG-I and <italic>M. miiuy</italic> MDA5 (mmiMDA5) and LGP2 (mmiLGP2) proteins, and observed that mmiLGP2 lacks the CARD domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). We next co-transfected mmiLGP2 plasmids or si-mmiLGP2 with MDA5 plasmids into MKC cells. The results showed that mmiLGP2 can actively regulate mmiMDA5’s immune response to the SCRV virus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1I</xref>), which further indicates that it participates in antiviral immunity as an intermediate regulatory factor of MDA5 rather than a downstream signal transmitter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Therefore, these results prompted us to investigate whether MDA5, a structurally similar homolog to RIG-I, can substitute for RIG-I in recognizing 5’ppp-RNA in vertebrates without RIG-I (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<label>2.2</label><title>MDA5 promotes host antiviral innate immunity</title>
<p>To further investigate the alternative immune function of MDA5, we first investigated the <italic>M. miiuy</italic> MDA5-mediated signaling pathway in response to SCRV virus and double-stranded mimetic poly(I:C)-HMW infection. Two siRNA molecules (si-MDA5-1 and si-MDA5-2) were designed to assess the function of MDA5. si-MDA5-1 demonstrated higher inhibitory efficiency compared to si-MDA5-2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, si-MDA5-1 (referred to as si-MDA5) was selected for subsequent experiments. Subsequently, we constructed the MDA5 expression plasmid and confirmed its protein overexpression efficiency and cytoplasmic localization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Considering that mammalian MDA5 activates NF-κB and IRF3/IRF7 to induce IFNs, we investigated whether <italic>M. miiuy</italic> MDA5 could impact these pathways. Dual-luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that knockdown of MDA5 significantly inhibits NF-κB, IRF3, IRF7, and IFN-1 reporter genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, we investigated the role of MDA5 in regulating the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are crucial effectors. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-2G</xref>, we observed that knockdown or overexpression of MDA5 can significantly inhibit or promote the expression levels of IFN-1, Mx1, ISG15, and Viperin upon SCRV infection or poly(I:C)-HMW stimulation. To visually represent the biological significance of MDA5 in SCRV-induced host cells, we utilized the virus plaque and qPCR methods to examine whether it could influence viral replication. As demonstrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2K</xref>, knockdown of MDA5 led to a significant increase in viral plaque formation and promoted SCRV replication in SCRV-infected cells, while overexpression had the opposite effect. Next, we explored that how MDA5 conducts signal transduction, and results showed that MDA5 is capable of binding not only to MAVS but also to STING (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2M</xref>). In our previous laboratory investigations, we have substantiated the induction effect of STING on IFN under SCRV infection or poly(I:C) stimulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Under the infection of SCRV virus, co-transfection of STING plasmids or si-STING with MDA5 plasmids can significantly increase or decrease the induction of IFN-1, indicating the important role of STING in MDA5-mediated immune transmission in response to RNA virus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2N</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2O</xref>). Finally, through the determination of IRF3 dimer and IFN induction, our results showed that the induction of antiviral innate immunity by SCRV-RNA depends on MDA5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2P</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2Q</xref>).

<label>2.3</label><title>RD domain is required for MDA5 to recognize SCRV RNA</title>
<p>We investigated whether <italic>M. miiuy</italic> MDA5, in the absence of RIG-I, can directly bind to the RNA of SCRV. To address this question, we precipitated the MDA5 protein from SCRV-infected MKC cells that were transfected with MDA5-Flag and pcDNA3.1-Flag. The bound RNA was then amplified using SCRV-specific primers or β-actin primers as a control. Our results showed that MDA5 interacted with SCRV RNA, while β-actin mRNA did not associate with MDA5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The C-terminal regulatory domain (RD) of human RIG-I binds to viral RNA in a triphosphate-dependent manner, to determine if the RD domain of <italic>M. miiuy</italic> MDA5 has similar functions, we generated truncated mutations called MDA5-ΔRD and Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of MDA5 and MDA5-ΔRD plasmids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We subsequently noted that MDA5-ΔRD exhibited an inability to interact with SCRV RNA, which was supported by the loss of its immunological capability in inhibiting SCRV viral replication (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). We also examined the effects of MDA5 and MDA5-ΔRD on antiviral factors in both uninfected, SCRV-infected, and poly(I:C)-HMW-stimulated MKC cells. In the absence of infection, overexpression of both MDA5 and MDA5-ΔRD stimulated the expression of antiviral genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>). However, when cells were infected or stimulated with SCRV or poly(I:C)-HMW, only the overexpression of MDA5, not MDA5-ΔRD, significantly increased the expression of antiviral genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>). In summary, these findings provided evidence that MDA5 may recognize SCRV RNA through its RD domain.</p>

<label>2.4</label><title>MDA5 recognizes 5’ppp-RNA in M. miiuy and G. gallus</title>
<p>To provide specific evidence of MDA5 recognition of 5’ppp-RNA in <italic>M. miiuy</italic>, we synthesized 67 nt 5’ppp-SCRV from the SCRV virus and through in vitro transcription using T7 polymerase. As a positive control capable of binding to the mmiMDA5 receptor, 112 bp dsRNA from the MDA5 gene sequence was also generated. Gel analysis and nuclease sensitivity confirmed the generation of RNA products of the expected size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The RNA pull-down experiment showed that 5’ppp-SCRV can be recognized by mmiMDA5, similar to 112 bp blunt end dsRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Next, we transfected wild-type 5’ppp-SCRV and dephosphorylated mutant SCRV RNAs (5’-OH-SCRV and 5’pppGG-SCRV) into MKC cells to detect the dimer of IRF3, and found that the activation ability of 5’ppp-RNA on IRF3 depends on its triphosphate structure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). in addition, knockdown of mmiMDA5 blocked the induction of IRF3 by 5’ppp-SCRV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, biotin-labeled 5’ppp-RNA captured mmiMDA5, while the biotin-labeled mutant types (5’-OH-SCRV and 5’pppGG-SCRV) did not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Additionally, we purified recombinant MDA5 and MDA5-ΔRD of <italic>M. miiuy</italic> to conduct electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). When recombinant mmiMDA5 was subjected to EMSA using a biotin-labeled 5’ppp-SCRV probe, a clear complex was detected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). This complex formation was inhibited by adding an excess of cold 5’ppp-SCRV but not 5’-OH-SCRV and 5’pppGG-SCRV, demonstrating the direct interaction between mmiMDA5 and 5’ppp-SCRV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). However, 5’ppp-SCRV cannot bind to the MDA5-ΔRD (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). Next, we investigated whether <italic>G. gallus</italic> MDA5 (ggaMDA5) shares the ability to recognize 5’ppp-RNA seen in fish. We synthesized 67 nt 5’ppp-VSV from the VSV virus and found that it is similar to 5’ppp-SCRV, binding to ggaMDA5 and activating IRF3 in a triphosphate-dependent manner (4I-4M). Overall, our findings demonstrated that MDA5 detection of RNA in two RIG-I deficient vertebrates (<italic>M. miiuy and G. gallus</italic>) is guided by the RNA 5’-triphosphate end and is disrupted when RNA is capped at the 5’-triphosphate end or dephosphorylated.</p>

<label>2.5</label><title>Altered m<sup>6</sup>A modification and expression of MDA5 upon SCRV infection</title>
<p>As stated in the previous results, MDA5 has evolved to possess immune recognition abilities that take over the role of RIG-I, significantly enhancing the host’s ability to resist viral infections. However, evolution is a continuous battle between hosts and viruses, viruses often evolve complex escape mechanisms to evade immune surveillance and destruction, in which the m<sup>6</sup>A modification mechanism is an important way. To investigate the impact of SCRV infection on the overall methylation dynamics of fish hosts, we utilized methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq, GenBank accession number: PRJNA819945) to measure changes in m<sup>6</sup>A modification of host transcripts during SCRV infection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). From the results shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, we identified 3060 differentially m<sup>6</sup>A methylated peaks (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) and 2082 differentially expressed genes (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) between the non-infected and SCRV-infected group, indicating that infection significantly alters the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of specific host transcripts. It is worth noting that hyper-methylated m<sup>6</sup>A peaks were also observed in the MDA5 mRNA transcripts during SCRV infection (fold change &gt;1.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and the expression level of MDA5 was higher in the infection group compared to the control group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Further analysis of the m<sup>6</sup>A-seq data showed that MDA5 contained m<sup>6</sup>A sites in the exon1 region which were markedly higher in the infection group than that in the control group (Untreated VS SCRV: <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Next, we tested the concrete m<sup>6</sup>A modification sites of MDA5 mRNA. We used the SRAMP database to predict potential m<sup>6</sup>A sites in MDA5-exon1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Four potential sites were predicted and two specific primers were designed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), then m<sup>6</sup>A quantitative real-time PCR and semiquantitative PCR were performed. In line with the m<sup>6</sup>A-seq data, the results further confirmed that m<sup>6</sup>A sites exactly exist in MDA5 exon1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). After being infected with SCRV or poly(I:C)-HMW, the methylation level of MDA5 increased in MKC cells, further confirming the sequencing data (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). We further inserted the MDA5-exon1 into pmirGLO, and results showed that the infection of SCRV can reduce the luciferase activity of pmirGLO-MDA5-exon1, and the use of cycloleucine (CL, an amino acid analogue that can inhibit m<sup>6</sup>A modification) hindered the degradation of MDA5-exon1 by SCRV, indicating that SCRV can regulate MDA5 expression through a methylation mechanism (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). MDA5 is classified as an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG). Consistently, in spleen and kidney tissues infected with SCRV, the expression level of MDA5 demonstrates fluctuation. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). We further explored the mRNA and protein levels of MDA5 in MKC cells infected with SCRV and poly(I:C)-HMW and found that their expression all first significantly increased and then returned to the normal level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5J</xref>). Overall, our results suggested that the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of MDA5 is increased, and the expression level of MDA5 shows fluctuating changes upon SCRV infection.</p>

<label>2.6</label><title>m<sup>6</sup>A-modification weakens MDA5 mRNA stability and antiviral ability</title>
<p>SCRV infection can increase the methylation level of MDA5, and this mechanism is expected to have a regulatory effect on MDA5. To investigate this, the regulatory effects of METTL3 and METTL14, the main components of the methyltransferase complex, on MDA5 were explored. Three siRNAs targeting METTL3 and METTL14 were designed, and si-METTL3-2 and si-METTL14-3 showed higher knockdown efficiency (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). METTL3 and METTL14-overexpressing plasmids were also constructed, and the interaction between them confirmed their cooperative role in m<sup>6</sup>A modification (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Subsequently, the global m<sup>6</sup>A levels were measured in cells after knockdown or overexpression of METTL3 and METTL14. Consistent with expectations, the knockdown of METTL3 and METTL14 significantly decreased the global m<sup>6</sup>A level, while their overexpression significantly increased the overall methylation level (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). To investigate their role in the process of virus infection, we used the virus plaque and qPCR methods to explore whether it could affect SCRV replication. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>, overexpression of METTL3 or METTL14 significantly enhances viral plaque formation and promotes SCRV replication in SCRV-infected cells. And as m<sup>6</sup>A writers, METTL3 and METTL14 can directly regulate the methylation level of MDA5 and induce MDA5 degradation by reducing its mRNA stability (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6I</xref>). We further inserted the MDA5-exon1 into pmirGLO and mVenus-C1 vector, and results showed that si-METTL3&amp;14 can reduce the luciferase activity of pmirGLO-MDA5-exon1, and METTL3&amp;14 could suppress the levels of GFP, further indicating the presence of methylation sites in MDA5-exon1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-figure supplement 1A and 1D). To investigate the potential m<sup>6</sup>A sites on MDA5-exon1, we constructed mutant MDA5-exon1 reporter plasmids (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-figure supplement 1B). As expected, our results showed that the luciferase activity of wild-type pmirGLO-MDA5-exon1 reporter, but not of mutant pmirGLO-MDA5-exon1 reporter, was markedly increased upon METTL3&amp;14 knockdown (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>-figure supplement 1C). Furthermore, we found that the use of cycloleucine hindered the degradation of MDA5 by METTL3 and METTL14, indicating that these proteins regulate MDA5 expression through a methylation mechanism (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6K</xref>). Additionally, MDA5 expression was degraded by METTL3&amp;14 in both SCRV-infected and uninfected groups (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6L</xref>). To investigate the impact of this mechanism on viral infection, we co-transfected METTL3&amp;14 and MDA5 plasmids and found that METTL3&amp;14 partially suppressed the antiviral immune benefit of MDA5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6M</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6O</xref>). Taken together, our data demonstrate that METTL3&amp;14-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A methylation of MDA5 inhibits its mRNA stability and expression levels, thus suppressing the antiviral capabilities of MDA5.</p>

<label>2.7</label><title>Detailed m<sup>6</sup>A regulatory mechanism of MDA5</title>
<p>The m<sup>6</sup>A mechanism is jointly regulated by writers, erasers, and readers. The m<sup>6</sup>A modification of mRNA recruits m<sup>6</sup>A-binding proteins (readers) which have the function of recognizing m<sup>6</sup>A sites and accelerating mRNA decay. In this study, we hypothesized that YTHDF readers (YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDF3) may recognize m<sup>6</sup>A-modified MDA5 and destabilize it. We examined the binding ability of YTHDF proteins to MDA5 mRNA and found that YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 exhibited stronger binding compared to YTHDF1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>).

Results showed that the knockdown or overexpression of YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 led to the increase or decrease of the expression levels of MDA5, whereas YTHDF1 did not appear to influence MDA5 expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, 7D, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>-figure supplement 1A and 1C). In addition, overexpression of YTHDF2&amp;3 can increase the luciferase activity of wild-type pmirGLO-MDA5-exon1 reporter, but not of mutant pmirGLO-MDA5-exon1 reporter (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>-figure supplement 1B). We then found that si-METTL3&amp;14 can counteract the negative impact of YTHDF2&amp;3 on MDA5 mRNA, protein, and stability (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref>). Since the m<sup>6</sup>A mechanism is reversible, we then studied the regulation of MDA5 by two major erasers. Results showed that FTO, not ALKBH5, can upregulate MDA5 expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). Moreover, the overexpression of FTO can reverse the inhibitory effect of YTHDF2&amp;3 on MDA5 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7I</xref>). Taken together, these data suggested that through METTL3&amp;14-m<sup>6</sup>A-YTHDF2&amp;3 regulatory network, m<sup>6</sup>A can mediate the degradation of MDA5, and this process can be countered by FTO (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>).</p>

<label>3.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have identified multiple independent loss events of RIG-I throughout vertebrate evolution. Specifically, we have observed at least three independent loss events in mammals, birds, and fish, respectively. Regarding the loss of RIG-I in avian species, previous studies have provided more comprehensive and accurate information than ours, indicating that birds have experienced more than 16 instances of RIG-I loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. However, it should be noted that we have not found the loss of RIG-I in reptiles and amphibians (not displayed). But this does not imply that there has been no loss event among them, but rather, there is insufficient information regarding the genomes of reptiles and amphibians to draw the conclusions. As the abundance of genomic data continues to grow, there will be an increasing amount of evidence available to verify the presence or absence of RIG-I in these taxonomic groups. Additionally, the presence of RIG-I in current species does not guarantee that RIG-I loss has not occurred previously. For instance, our research has indicated that zebrafish may have experienced RIG-I loss. However, prior to the loss event, the zebrafish RIG-I has undergone repetitive events. These findings collectively highlight that the loss of RIG-I is not a random occurrence, but rather bears significant biological and evolutionary implications that deserve further investigation.</p>
<p>The evolutionary loss of RIG-I raises the question of a possible compensation of its function by other gene products. RIG-I deficiency instances in mammals were scarcer compared to those in fish and birds. Previous research has revealed that in <italic>T. belangeri</italic>, concurrent with the loss of RIG-I, both MDA5 and LGP2 have undergone notable positive selection, and MDA5 or MDA5/LGP2 could sense Sendai virus (an RNA virus posed as a RIG-I agonist) for inducing type I IFN. This proposed an immune substitution model for RIG-I deficiency in mammals, though direct evidence of MDA5/LGP2 binding to 5’ppp-RNA was lacking. In this study, we characterized the consequences resulting from the loss of RIG-I in the <italic>M. miiuy</italic> and <italic>G. gallus</italic> (two representative species of vertebrates lacking RIG-I) and provided direct functional evidence for the alternative immune recognition function of MDA5. SCRV and VSV belongs to the class of rhabdovirus, which is a negative-strand virus with a non-segmented genome and initiate both replication and transcription de novo leading to 5′-triphosphate RNA in the cytosol, was expected to trigger an IFN response without the need for replication and presumed dsRNA formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Then, we synthesized 5’ppp-RNA probes from the SCRV and VSV genome sequences and purified recombinant MDA5 of <italic>M. miiuy</italic> and <italic>G. gallus</italic>. Results demonstrated that MDA5 detect the 5’ppp-RNA in <italic>M. miiuy and G. gallus</italic> and is disrupted when RNA is capped at the 5’-triphosphate end or dephosphorylated. Furthermore, the recognition of RNA by MDA5 depends on its RD domain, which not only indicates that the RD domain of MDA5 has evolved functions similar to RD domain of RIG-I, but also excludes the possibility of MDA5 binding to 5’ppp-RNA through intermediate ligands. Furthermore, in vertebrates that possess RIG-I, STING exclusively binds to RIG-I rather than MDA5. However, similar to the interaction observed between MDA5 and STING in tree shrews and chickens that lacking RIG-I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, the MDA5 of <italic>M. miiuy</italic> can also interact with STING protein, indicating that in vertebrates lacking RIG-I, MDA5 may utilize STING to facilitate signal transduction in the antiviral response. Next, by linking the immune replacement ability evolved by MDA5 with the common RIG-I loss event in vertebrates, we propose a straightforward explanation for this evolutionary event: In the lengthy process of vertebrate evolution, MDA5 gradually acquired new functionalities to effectively detect viruses such as 5’ppp-RNAs, which were initially recognized by RIG-I. As a result, there was functional redundancy of RIG-I, which eventually led to its gradual disappearance from the vertebrate genome. This hypothesis is supported by two viewpoints: first, MDA5 and RIG-I can both recognize overlapping viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>; secondly, in fish without RIG-I deficiency, MDA5 has stronger antiviral ability compared to RIG-I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Finally, although MDA5 has a compensatory effect on RIG-I, the absence of RIG-I may still have a significant impact on the immune system of vertebrates. Ducks are often resistant to influenza viruses capable of killing chicken, and the loss of RIG-I in chickens provides a plausible explanation for their increased susceptibility to influenza viruses compared with ducks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Furthermore, SCRV virus, the virus model used in this study, mainly affects the <italic>Siniperca chuatsi</italic>, which is a fish species that also lacks RIG-I like <italic>M. miiuy</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Viruses are constantly co-evolving with hosts. Our available data suggested that the vertebrate has evolved MDA5 with alternative functions to recognize and resist 5’ppp-RNA virus in the absence of RIG-I. As a response, virus has also evolved to use the m<sup>6</sup>A mechanism to evade the host immune response. Previous study indicated that m<sup>6</sup>A modification plays a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis in the body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. During the infection process, the virus may disrupt the m<sup>6</sup>A level and disrupt the immune balance, thereby facilitating its own replication and invasion. Viruses may utilize the m<sup>6</sup>A mechanism in two ways to evade immunity. On the one hand, many studies suggested a role for m<sup>6</sup>A in shielding RNA species from detection by PRRs. There are numerous viruses recognized in RIG-I dependent manner, but m<sup>6</sup>A modification increases the possibility of immune evasion. For example, the loss of m<sup>6</sup>A site or removing m<sup>6</sup>A from human metapneumovirus may weaken its immune evasion ability, prevent it from evading detection by RIG-I, and result in higher levels of IFN release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Moreover, it has been reported that the RNA containing m<sup>6</sup>A modifications binds to RIG-I poorly, and it failed to trigger the RIG-I conformational changes associated with downstream immune signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. On the other hand, m<sup>6</sup>A-mediated viral strategies for inhibiting IFN induction pathways appear to exist. For instance, following infection by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the IFN-β transcript was modified by m<sup>6</sup>A, and this methylation decreased its half-life, suggesting that HCMV can exploit this control of IFN-β expression to facilitate its replication by increasing m<sup>6</sup>A modification of the IFN-β transcript and thus decreasing its production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. In another study, the m6A reader YTHDF3 could restrain the type I IFN response and ISG expression by involving enhancement of FOXO3 translation in a m6A-independent mechanism, which acts as a negative regulator of immunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Moreover, previous study reports that IFN-α and IFN-β mRNA encoding cytokines that promote IFN response are modified by m6A, and the loss of METTL3 and YTHDF2 could increase the IFN expression and ISG activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. In summary, viruses can utilize m<sup>6</sup>A to evade the immune response by shielding the recognition of RIG-I or reducing the host’s immune reaction, thus counteracting the host’s defense mechanisms. In our previous study, we discovered that SCRV infection can not only increase overall cellular methylation levels but also upregulate the expression of METTL3, thereby suggesting its potential to regulate host gene expression through the m<sup>6</sup>A mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. While changes in m<sup>6</sup>A modification and the expression of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified transcripts are biologically relevant, identifying bona fide m<sup>6</sup>A alterations during viral infection will allow us to understand how m<sup>6</sup>A modification of cellular mRNA is regulated. As our m<sup>6</sup>A change analysis pipeline controls for changes in gene expression, these data should represent true changes in m<sup>6</sup>A modification rather than changes in the expression of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified transcripts. In this study, we found that SCRV virus infection alters m<sup>6</sup>A modification of specific cellular transcripts, including MDA5. MDA5 plays a crucial role as a receptor in recognizing the SCRV virus and controlling IFN activation. The aberrant m<sup>6</sup>A levels of MDA5 subsequently affect the expression of antiviral genes, thereby compromising its ability to mount an effective antiviral immune response. It is plausible that SCRV also impacts the production of antiviral genes, such as IFN-1 or other cytokines, by manipulating m<sup>6</sup>A modification on the transcripts of cytokines or molecules involved in their production. This interesting aspect warrants further investigation in future research.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated a co-evolutionary arms race between 5’ppp-RNA virus and virus receptors. Specifically, we conducted an evolutionary analysis and provided functional evidence to confirm that MDA5 of <italic>M. miiuy</italic> and <italic>G. gallus</italic> has acquired an additional function of sensing 5’ppp-RNA, thus compensating for the loss of RIG-I. Additionally, we found that SCRV infection can regulate the m<sup>6</sup>A level of MDA5 in the <italic>M. miiuy</italic>, leading to its degradation and subsequently affecting the immune response for immune evasion. Fish and birds, as the most abundant aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates respectively, are also the two lineages with the most frequent occurrence of RIG-I deficiency, the investigation of host-pathogen interactions of them offers valuable insights into the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study shows that in teleost fish, the RIG-I-like protein MDA5 can compensate for the absence of RIG-I by detecting 5'-triphosphorylated RNA. A fish virus containing such RNA can nevertheless evade MDA5 detection through a mechanism involving m6A methylation-induced silencing. The conclusions, which are supported by <bold>solid</bold> data, advance our understanding of antiviral immunity and virus-host conflicts in vertebrates.</p>

<p>This study offers valuable insights into host-virus interactions, emphasizing the adaptability of the immune system.

<p>
However, caution is warranted in extrapolating these findings universally, given the dynamic nature of host-virus dynamics.

<p>Panel 2N and 2O should have been done with and without SCRV treatment, so that the reader can assess whether SCRV induces additional IFN activation (on top of MDA5 and STING autoactivation). I would recommend the authors include a sentence in the text to explain that ectopic expression of MDA5 or STING (i.e. overexpression from a plasmid) induces autoactivation of these proteins. Therefore, the IFN induction that is seen in panel 2N is likely due to MDA5/STING overexpression. SCRV treatment may further boost IFN induction, but this cannot be assessed without the 'mock' conditions. This information will help the readers to interpret Fig. 2N and 2O correctly.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold><italic>eLife assessment</italic></bold></p>
<p><italic>The authors present evidence suggesting that MDA5 can substitute as a sensor for triphosphate RNA in a species that naturally lacks RIG-I. The key findings are potentially important for our understanding of the evolution of innate immune responses. Compared to an earlier version of the paper, the strength of evidence has improved but it is still partially incomplete due to a few key missing experiments and controls.</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the editorial team for their positive comments and constructive suggestions on improving our manuscript. We have made further improvements based on the valuable suggestions of the reviewers, and we are pleased to send you the revised manuscript now. After revising the manuscript and further supplementing with experiments, we think that our existing data can support our claims.</p>

<p><italic>This study offers valuable insights into host-virus interactions, emphasizing the adaptability of the immune system. Readers should recognize the significance of MDA5 in potentially replacing RIG-I and the adversarial strategy employed by 5'ppp-RNA SCRV in degrading MDA5 mediated by m6A modification in different species, further indicating that m6A is a conservational process in the antiviral immune response.</italic></p>
<p><italic>However, caution is warranted in extrapolating these findings universally, given the dynamic nature of host-virus dynamics. The study provides a snapshot into the complexity of these interactions, but further research is needed to validate and extend these insights, considering potential variations across viral species and environmental contexts. Additionally, it is noted that the main claims put forth in the manuscript are only partially supported by the data presented.</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>After meticulous revisions of the manuscript, including adjustments to the title, abstract, results, and discussion, the main claim of our study now is the arm race between the MDA5 receptor and SCRV virus in a lower vertebrate fish, <italic>M. miiuy</italic>. This mainly includes two parts: Firstly, the MDA5 of <italic>M. miiuy</italic> can recognize virus invasion and initiate host immune response by recognizing the triphosphate structure of SCRV. Secondly, as an adversarial strategy, 5’ppp-RNA SCRV virus can utilize the m6A mechanism to degrade MDA5 in <italic>M. miiuy</italic>. Based on the reviewer's suggestions, we have further supplemented the critical experiments (Figure 3F-3G, Figure 4D, Figure 5G) and provided a more detailed and accurate explanation of the experimental conclusions, we believe that our existing manuscript can support our main claims. In addition, because virus-host coevolution complicates the derivation of universal conclusions, we will further expand our insights in future research.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold><italic>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</italic></bold></p>
<p><italic>This manuscript by Geng et al. aims to demonstrate that MDA5 compensates for the loss of RIG-I in certain species, such as teleost fish miiuy croaker. The authors use siniperca cheats rhabdovirus (SCRV) and poly(I:C) to demonstrate that these RNA ligands induce an IFN response in an MDA5-dependent manner in m.miiuy derived cells. Furthermore, they show that MDA5 requires its RD domain to directly bind to SCRV RNA and to induce an IFN response. They use in vitro synthesized RNA with a 5'triphosphate (or lacking a 5'triphosphate as a control) to demonstrate that MDA5 can directly bind to 5'-triphosphorylated RNA. The second part of the paper is devoted to m6A modification of MDA5 transcripts by SCRV as an immune evasion strategy. The authors demonstrate that the modification of MDA5 with m6A is increased upon infection and that this causes increased decay of MDA5 and consequently a decreased IFN response.</italic></p>
<p><italic>One critical caveat in this study is that it does not address whether ppp-SCRV RNA induces IRF3-dimerization and type I IFN induction in an MDA5 dependent manner. The data demonstrate that mmiMDA5 can bind to triphosphorylated RNA (Fig. 4D). In addition, triphosphorylated RNA can dimerize IRF3 (4C). However, a key experiment that ties these two observations together is missing.</italic></p>
<p><italic>Specifically, although Fig. 4C demonstrates that 5'ppp-SCRV RNA induces dimerization (unlike its dephosphorylated or capped derivatives), this does not proof that this happens in an MDA5-dependent manner. This experiment should have been done in WT and siMDA5 MKC cells side-by-side to demonstrate that the IRF3 dimerization that is observed here is mediated by MDA5 and not by another (unknown) protein. The same holds true for Fig. 4J.</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the referee's professional suggestions. In fact, we have transfected SCRV RNA into WT and si-MDA5 MKC cells, and subsequently assessed the dimerization of IRF3 and the IFN response (Figure 2P-2Q). The results indicated that knockdown of MDA5 prevents immune activation of SCRV RNA. However, considering the potential for SCRV RNA to activate immunity independent of the triphosphate structure, this experimental observation does not comprehensively establish the MDA5-dependent induction of IRF3 dimer by 5’ppp-RNA. Accordingly, in accordance with the referee's recommendation, we proceeded to investigate the inducible activity of 5'ppp-SCRV on IRF3 dimerization in WT and si-MDA5 MKC cells, revealing that 5'ppp-SCRV indeed elicits immunity in an MDA5-dependent manner (Figure 4D). Additionally, poly(I:C)-HMW, a known ligand for MDA5, demonstrated a residual, albeit attenuated, activation of IRF3 following MDA5 knockdown, potentially attributed to its capacity to stimulate immunity through alternative pathways such as TLR3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><italic>- Fig 1C-D: these experiments are not sufficiently convincing, i.e. the difference in IRF3 dimerization between VSV-RNA and VSV-RNA+CIAP transfection is minimal.</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have reconstituted the necessary materials and repeated the pertinent experiments depicted in Fig 1C-1D. The results demonstrate that SCRV-RNA+CIAP and VSV-RNA+CIAP exhibit a mitigating effect on the induction activity of SCRV-RNA and VSV-RNA on IRF3 dimerization, albeit without complete elimination (Figure 1C and 1D). These findings suggest the presence of receptors within <italic>M. miiuy</italic> and <italic>G. gallus</italic> capable of recognizing the viral triphosphate structure; however, it is worth noting that RNA derived from SCRV and VSV viruses does not exclusively depend on the triphosphate structure to activate the host's antiviral response.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><italic>Fig. 2N and 2O: why did the authors decide to use overexpression of MDA5 to assess the impact of STING on MDA5-mediated IFN induction? This should have been done in cells transfected with SCRV or polyIC (as in 2D-G) or in infected cells (as in 2H-K). In addition, it is a pity that the authors did not include an siMAVS condition alongside siSTING, to investigate the relative contribution of MAVS versus STING to the MDA5-mediated IFN response. Panel O suggests that the IFN response is completely dependent on STING, which is hard to envision.</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our previous laboratory investigations, we have substantiated the induction effect of STING on IFN under SCRV infection or poly(I:C) stimulation, as documented in the relevant literature (10.1007/s11427-020-1789-5), which we have referenced in our manuscript (lines 177-178). While we did assess the impact of STING on MDA5-mediated IFN induction in SCRV-infected cells, as indicated in the figure legends, we have revised Figure 2N-2O for improved clarity, and similarly, Figure 1H-1I has also been updated. Furthermore, considering that RNA virus infection can activate the cGAS/STING axis (10.3389/fcimb.2023.1172739) and the significant role of MAVS in sensing RNA virus invasion in the NLR pathway (10.1038/ni.1782), it is challenging to ascertain the respective contributions of STING and MAVS to the immune signaling cascade mediated by MDA5 during RNA virus infection. We intend to explore this aspect further in future research endeavors.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><italic>Fig. 3F and 3G: where are the mock-transfected/infected conditions? Given that ectopic expression of hMDA5 is known to cause autoactivation of the IFN pathway, the baseline ISG levels should be shown (ie. In absence of a stimulus or infection). Normalization of the data does not reveal whether this is the case and is therefore misleading.</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based on the reviewer's suggestions, we have rerun the experiment. We examined the effects of MDA5 and MDA5-ΔRD on antiviral factors in both uninfected, SCRV-infected, and poly(I:C)-HMW-stimulated MKC cells. Results showed that overexpression of both MDA5 and MDA5-ΔRD stimulated the expression of antiviral genes. However, when cells were infected or stimulated with SCRV or poly(I:C)-HMW, only the overexpression of MDA5, not MDA5-ΔRD, significantly increased the expression of antiviral genes (Figure 3F-3I).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><italic>Fig. 4F and 4G: can the authors please indicate in the figure which area of the gel is relevant here? The band that runs halfway the gel? If so, the effects described in the text are not supported by the data (i.e. the 5'OH-SCRV and 5'pppGG-SCRV appear to compete with Bio-5'ppp-SCRV as well as 5'ppp-SCRV).</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Apologies for any confusion. The relevant areas in the gel pertaining to the experimental findings were denoted with asterisks and elaborated upon in the figure legends (Figure 4G, 4H, and 4M). The findings indicated that 5'ppp-SCRV, in contrast to 5'OH-SCRV and 5'pppGG-SCRV, demonstrated the ability to compete with bio-5'ppp-SCRV.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><italic>My concerns about Fig. 5 remain unaltered. The fact that MDA5 is an ISG explains its increased expression and increased methylation pattern. The authors should at the very least mention in their text that MDA5 is an ISG and that their observations may be partially explained by this fact.</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>First, as our m6A change analysis pipeline controls for changes in gene expression, these data should represent true changes in m6A modification rather than changes in the expression of m6A-modified transcripts (10.1038/s41598-020-63355-3). Similar studies demonstrated that m6A modification in RIOK3 and CIRBP mRNAs are altered following <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> infection (10.1016/j.molcel.2019.11.007). The specific calculation method is as follows: relative m6A level for each transcript was calculated as the percent of input in each condition normalized to that of the respective positive control spike-in. Fold change of enrichment was calculated with mock samples normalized to 1. Therefore, changes in the expression level of MDA5 can partially explain the increase in m6A modification on all MDA5 mRNA in cells, but it cannot indicate changes in m6A modification on each mDA5 transcript. We have supplemented the calculation method process in the manuscript and cited relevant literature (Lines 606-608). In addition, we have elaborated on the fact that MDA5 is an ISG gene in the experimental results (lines 260-261), and emphasized its compatibility with enhanced m6A modification of MDA5 in the discussion section (lines 405-409).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold><italic>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</italic></bold></p>
<p><italic>In this manuscript, the authors explored the interaction between the pattern recognition receptor MDA5 and 5'ppp-RNA in the Miiuy croaker. They found that MDA5 can serve as a substitute for RIG-I in detecting 5'ppp-RNA of Siniperca cheilinus rhabdovirus (SCRV) when RIG-I is absent in Miiuy croaker. Furthermore, they observed MDA5's recognition of 5'ppp-RNA in chickens (Gallus gallus), a species lacking RIG-I. Additionally, the authors documented that MDA5's functionality can be compromised by m6A-mediated methylation and degradation of MDA5 mRNA, orchestrated by the METTL3/14-YTHDF2/3 regulatory network in Miiuy croaker during SCRV infection. This impairment compromises the innate antiviral immunity of fish, facilitating SCRV's immune evasion. These findings offer valuable insights into the adaptation and functional diversity of innate antiviral mechanisms in vertebrates.</italic></p>

<p>We extend our sincere appreciation for your professional comments and insightful suggestions on our manuscript, as they have significantly contributed to enhancing its quality.</p>

<p><bold><italic>Recommendations for the authors:</italic></bold></p>
<p><bold><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</italic></bold></p>
<p>(1) <italic>The interpretation of Figures 1H and I, along with the captions, seems unclear. Particularly, understanding the meaning of the X-axis in Figure I is challenging. Additionally, the designation of &quot;H2O = 1&quot; on the Y-axis in Figure 1E lacks clarity. It would be helpful if the author could revise and clarify these figures for better comprehension.</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your reminder and have corrected and clarified these figures and figure legends (lines 768-772). We have replaced the Y-axis of Figure 1I with &quot;Relative mRNA expression&quot; instead of &quot; Relative IFN-1 expression&quot; (Figure 1I). In addition, we have added an explanation of &quot;H2O=1&quot; in the legend of Figure 1E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) <italic>The interpretation of Figure 5 in section 2.5 seems incomplete. The author mentioned that both m6A levels and MDA5 expression levels are increased (lines 256-257), prompting questions about the relationship between m6A and MDA5 expression. If higher m6A levels typically lead to MDA5 mRNA instability and lower MDA5 expression, observing both increasing simultaneously appears contradictory. Considering the dynamic changes shown in Figure 5, it would be more appropriate to propose an alteration in both m6A levels and MDA5 expression levels. Given the fluctuating nature of these changes, definitively labeling them as solely &quot;increased&quot; is challenging. Therefore, offering a nuanced interpretation of the results and clarifying this aspect would bolster the study's conclusions.</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While changes in m6A modification and the expression of m6A-modified transcripts are biologically relevant, identifying bona fide m6A alterations during viral infection will allow us to understand how m6A modification of cellular mRNA is regulated. As our m6A change analysis pipeline controls for changes in gene expression, these data should represent true changes in m6A modification rather than changes in the expression of m6A-modified transcripts (10.1038/s41598-020-63355-3). Similar studies demonstrated that m6A modification in RIOK3 and CIRBP mRNAs are altered following Flaviviridae infection (10.1016/j.molcel.2019.11.007). The specific calculation method is as follows: relative m6A level for each transcript was calculated as the percent of input in each condition normalized to that of the respective positive control spike-in. Fold change of enrichment was calculated with mock samples normalized to 1. Therefore, the upregulation of MDA5 expression can partially explain the increase in m6A modification on all MDA5 mRNA in cells, but it cannot indicate changes in m6A modification on each mDA5 transcript. We have supplemented the calculation method process in the manuscript and cited relevant literature. I hope to receive your understanding.</p>
<p>In addition, although higher m6A levels often lead to unstable MDA5 mRNA and lower MDA5 expression, SCRV can affect MDA5 expression through multiple pathways. For example, since MDA5 is an interferon-stimulated gene, the infection of SCRV virus can cause strong expression of interferon and indirectly induce high-level expression of MDA5. Therefore, the expression of MDA5 is not contradictory to the simultaneous increase in MDA5 modification (24 h). In order to further enhance our experimental conclusions, we supplemented the dual fluorescence experiment. The results indicate that, the infection of SCRV can inhibit the fluorescence activity of MDA5-exon1 reporter plasmids containing m6A sites but not including the promoter sequence of the MDA5 gene, and this inhibitory effect can be counteracted by cycloleucine (CL, an amino acid analogue that can inhibit m6A modification) (Figure 5G). This further indicates that SCRV can reduce the expression of MDA5 through the m6A pathway.</p>
<p>Finally, in light of the fluctuations in MDA5 expression levels, we have changed the subheadings of Results 2.5 section and provided a more comprehensive and precise elucidation of the experimental outcomes. We are grateful for your valuable feedback.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) <italic>In the discussion section, it would indeed be advantageous for the author to explore the novelty of this work more comprehensively, moving beyond merely acknowledging the widespread loss of RIG-I and suggesting MDA5 as a compensatory mechanism. Considering the well-established roles of MDA5 and m6A in host-virus interactions, the findings of this study may seem familiar in light of previous research. To enhance the discussion, it would be valuable for the author to delve into the implications of this evolutionary model. For instance, does the compensation or loss of RIG-I impact a species' susceptibility to specific types of viruses? Exploring such questions would provide insight into the broader significance of this compensation model and its potential effects on host-virus interactions, thus adding depth to the study's contribution.</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the expert advice provided by the referee. In response, we have expanded our discussion in the relevant section, addressing the potential influence of RIG-I deficiency and MDA5 compensation on the antiviral immune system in vertebrates (lines 371-376). Furthermore, we underscore the significance of exploring the impact of SCRV infection on MDA5 m6A modification, considering its compatibility with MDA5 as an ISG gene, in elucidating the host response to viral infection (lines 405-409).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) <italic>To improve the manuscript, it would be beneficial if the editors could aid the author in refining the language. Many descriptions in the article are overly redundant, and there should be appropriate differentiation between experimental methods and results.</italic></p>
