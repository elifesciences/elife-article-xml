<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs harbor regulatory elements influencing translation efficiency. Although 3.7% of disease-relevant human mutations occur in UTRs, their exact role in pathogenesis remains unclear. Through metagene analysis, we mapped pathogenic UTR mutations to regions near coding sequences, with a focus on the upstream open reading frame (uORF) initiation site. Subsequently, we utilized massively parallel poly(ribo)some profiling to compare the ribosome associations of 6,555 pairs of wildtype and mutant UTR fragments. We identified 46 UTR variants that altered polysome profiles, with enrichment in pathogenic mutations. Both univariate analysis and the elastic model highlighted the significance of motifs of short repeated sequences, including SRSF2 binding sites, as mutation hotspots that lead to aberrant translation. Furthermore, these polysome-shifting mutations exhibited considerable impact on RNA secondary structures, particularly for upstream AUG-containing 5’ UTRs. Integrating these features, our model achieved high accuracy (AUROC &gt; 0.8) in predicting polysome-shifting mutations in the test dataset. Additionally, several lines of evidence indicate that changes in uORF usage underlie the translation deficiency arising from these mutations. Illustrating this, we demonstrate that a pathogenic mutation in the IRF6 5’ UTR suppresses translation of the primary open reading frame by creating a uORF. Remarkably, site-directed ADAR editing of the mutant mRNA rescued this translation deficiency. Overall, our study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of UTR mutations and their links to clinical impacts through translation defects.</p>

<title>Untranslated regions (UTRs) control translation efficiency</title>
<p>UTRs are crucial to gene expression regulation. Whilst mRNA coding regions determine protein sequence, the UTRs modulate protein abundance via, for instance, tuning stability and translation of mRNAs thereof. Many studies have shown that structural elements in 5’ UTRs are involved in translation regulation. An iron regulatory protein (IRP) that maintains iron homeostasis binds to an iron-responsive element (IRE) in the 5’ UTR of ferritin mRNAs, blocks recruitment of translation initiation factors, and elicits translation inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Klausner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Muckenthaler et al., 1998</xref>). Internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) are another <italic>cis</italic>-acting element of 5’ UTRs that control translation. IRESs in 5’ UTRs facilitate translation initiation by presenting ribosome-binding sites in a 5’ cap-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Komar &amp; Hatzoglou, 2005</xref>). On the contrary, guanine-quadruplex motifs, which can adopt a non-canonical secondary structure in the 5’ UTR, are known to repress translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kumari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Serikawa et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, although 3’ UTRs lie far from the translation initiation site, they can regulate translation efficiency by controlling polyadenylation and binding of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. For instance, the poly(A) tail of mRNA can loop with its 5’ end, facilitating translation and ribosome recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Choe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wells et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, proteins and miRNAs that are deposited on 3’ UTRs can regulate various phases of translation including initiation, elongation, and termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mazumder et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s1b">
<title>Massively parallel translation assays</title>
<p>To decode the regulatory potential of UTRs, we developed a massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), in which UTRs of fixed length adjoin the coding sequence of a reporter. Similar approaches have been adopted to reveal the sequence-specific regulation and modular functions of numerous processes, including transcription, RNA splicing, translation, RNA localization, RNA decay and protein degradation in various species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chiang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Griesemer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Litterman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mikl et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Niederer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Oikonomou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rabani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sample et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Savinov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Slutskin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). In some studies of RNA translation, reporter protein output, for example, intensity of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), has been used as a readout of regulatory activity. However, protein output essentially is the product of the interaction between RNA half-lives and its translatability. Therefore, for a more unequivocal study design, poly(ribo)some profiling has been used to estimate RNA translatability through evaluating their ribosome association status. MPRA based on polyribosome profiling technique has been applied to examine the translational efficiency of UTRs of interest. For instance, it has been shown previously that variations in 5’ UTRs have a greater impact on ribosome load than those in coding regions or 3’ UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Leppek et al., 2022</xref>). MPRAs on 5’ UTRs have demonstrated that an upstream start codon (uATG) or open reading frame (uORF) can suppress primary ORF translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sample et al., 2019</xref>). Structural hindrances, such as RNA G-quadruplexes (RG4) and stem-loops, also can suppress translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fay et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Leppek et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, at the sequence level, G-rich and C-rich elements are repressors of translation, whereas A-rich elements enhance translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Niederer et al., 2022</xref>). Most massively parallel polysome profiling studies exclusively examined 5’ UTRs, likely due to the general assumption that 5’ UTRs play the major role in ribosome recruitment. On the other hand, MPRAs assessing fluorescent protein expression showed that binding sites for miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), particularly AU-rich elements, played a critical role in regulating the protein output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Oikonomou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Stoecklin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wissink et al., 2016</xref>). Pumilio and AU-rich element-binding proteins, such as Tristetraprolin (TTP) and the embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV) family, have been shown to influence protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barreau et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mayya &amp; Duchaine, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Van Etten et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, whether these RBP or miRNA binding sites dampened protein level via impeding ribosome association was not corroborated by those MPRA studies.</p>

<title>Precision diagnosis of UTR mutations</title>
<p>The genetic variants in UTRs may affect mRNA stability, translation, and localization, which in turn impact the flow of gene expression and hence result in phenotypical change and even pathogenesis. Prior studies have evidenced that even single nucleotide changes in a UTR can affect mRNA translation and/or transcript half-life in disease contexts. For example, single nucleotide substitutions at the 36<sup>th</sup> position of the 5’ UTR or the 1723<sup>rd</sup> position and the 3’ UTR of transforming growth factor β3 (TGFβ3; MIM# 190230) are associated with typical arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beffagna et al., 2005</xref>). Another such example is a point mutation in the 3’ UTR of glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1), which results in congenital myasthenic syndrome. GFPT1 is a rate-limiting enzyme for hexosamine biosynthesis, and a mutation in its 3’ UTR has been known to cause 90% reduction in protein production, potentially due to gain of a miRNA binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dusl et al., 2015</xref>). All things considered, sequence integrity of UTRs has profound effects on gene regulation, given that variants in UTRs may induce various phenotypes and even lead to severe diseases.</p>
<p>To systematically evaluate the impact of disease-relevant UTR variants on translation, we employed massively parallel ribosome profiling on both 5’ and 3’ UTRs to examine the effects of mutations on ribosome association. Through this strategy, we identified 46 high-confidence variants that caused ribosome shifting, and, intriguingly, their functional consequences converged on changes of RNA secondary structure and RBD binding motifs. Moreover, we investigated the molecular mechanism of a severe 5’ UTR suppressive mutation and developed ADAR-based editing to rescue the expression defect.</p>

<title>Construction of a UTR library of DNA templates</title>
<p>A UTR library of DNA templates was assembled by overlapping extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Herculase II Fusion Enzyme (Agilent Technologies). Initially, the oligonucleotide library sequences (CustomArray Inc., USA) were double-strandized and amplified by PCR. After PCR clean-up (Qiagen), the UTR library amplicons were appended sequentially with EGFP CDS and CMV promoter sequences (derived from EGFP-N1 vector) by means of overlapping PCR. The assembled full-length DNA templates (CMVP-5’UTR-EGFP or CMVP-EGFP-3’UTR) were subjected to PCR clean-up for subsequent transfection. Primers are listed in Supplemental Table S1.</p>

<title>Polysome fractionation and preparation for next generation sequencing</title>
<p>Polysome fractionation was conducted in accordance with a protocol published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gandin et al., 2014</xref>) with slight modification. In brief, HEK293T cells cultured in 15-cm Petri dishes were grown to 60-70% confluency and then transfected with 4 µg of the UTR library of DNA templates (2 µg for each UTR library) using lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Invitrogen). Fourteen hours after transfection, the cells were incubated in culture medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) (Sigma) for 5 minutes. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with and then detached in ice-cold 1x PBS containing 100 μg/ml CHX, followed by centrifugation at 200 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 minutes at 4 °C. The entire procedure was conducted at a low temperature with the addition of 100 μg/ml CHX to preserve the polysome status. After discarding the supernatant, the cell pellet was re-suspended with 425 µl of hypotonic buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 mM KCl and 1x EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Next, 5 μl of 10 mg/ml CHX, 1 μl of 1 M DTT, and 100 units of RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen) were added into the cell suspension, followed by vortexing for 5 seconds. Then, 25 μl of 10% Triton X-100 and 25 μl of 10% Sodium Deoxycholate were added into the suspension. After lysing the cells on ice for 5 minutes, the lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 7 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and then layered onto a 5-50% sucrose gradient made of 5% and 50% sucrose solutions containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.1 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 µg/ml CHX, 0.1x EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, and 10 units/ml RNase inhibitor, before undergoing ultracentrifugation with a SW41 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 36,000 rpm and 4 °C for 2 hours. Afterwards, the gradient samples were fractionated by fixed volume (500 µl/fraction), and all of the fractions were collected and subjected to RNA extraction (Direct-zol™ RNA MiniPrep Plus, Zymo Research). In addition to the indication of polysome profile derived from UV absorbance, the identity of each fraction was further verified through examining the distribution of 18S and 28S rRNAs among fractions via RNA electrophoresis.</p>
<p>Next, fractions corresponding to ribosome peaks were further categorized into three groups: monosome (Mono), low-density polysome (Light, 2-5 ribosomes), and high-density polysome (Heavy, ≥ 6 ribosomes). Then, the RNAs extracted from the fractions corresponding to each group were pooled together in an equal-fraction manner and subjected to reverse transcription using SuperScript IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Thereafter, the UTR regions of mRNAs derived from our UTR library of DNA templates were amplified from the cDNA products using Phusion PCR Master Mix/GC Buffer (Thermo) and primers hosting Illumina sequencing adaptors and random tri-nucleotides for Illumina<sup>®</sup> NextSeq paired-end 150 sequencing.</p>

Initially, DNA oligos (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc.) of selected UTR candidate sequences were double-strandized and amplified by PCR. Afterwards, the purified UTR amplicons were appended with firefly luciferase CDS (derived from pGL3-Basic vector) and the CMV promoter sequence (derived from EGFP-N1 vector) sequentially via overlapping PCR.</p>

<title>Luciferase assay, RNA extraction, and RT-qPCR</title>
<p>Fourteen to fifteen hours after co-transfection with 500 ng of linear constructs (CMVP-5’UTR-FFLuc or CMVP-FFLuc-3’UTR) and 100 ng of pRL-TK vector, HEK293T cells cultured in a 12-well plate were harvested and processed according to the instruction of Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) with minor modification. In brief, after removing media and washing once with PBS, the transfected cells were detached and then lysed in 180 µl of Dual-Glo reagent, before being subjected to moderate shaking on an orbital shaker at room temperature for 10 minutes. The lysate was then transferred to a new tube and underwent low-speed centrifugation to remove the cell debris. Then, 50 µl of clear supernatant was transferred to 96-well black plates to measure firefly luminescence with EnSpire Multimode Plate Reader (PerkinElmer) or SpectraMax Paradigm reader (Molecular Devices) and the software SoftMax Pro. Subsequently, 50 µl of Dual-Glo Stop &amp; Glo Reagent was added into each well. After incubation at room temperature for 10 minutes, <italic>Renilla</italic> luminescence was measured as above.</p>
<p>Relative luminescence units (RLUs) were calculated by dividing the firefly luciferase readouts by those of the transfection control, i.e., <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase. To evaluate translation efficiency, the RLUs were normalized to the transcript level measured by real-time PCR. Apart from those specifically annotated herein, all data is shown as the fold-change of the mutant relative to wildtype.</p>
<p>To calibrate the luciferase assay results against cognate mRNA expression level, total RNAs were extracted from the cells subjected to identical transfection conditions with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted with Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kits (Zymo Research), before being subjected to reverse transcription. Then, cDNA was reverse-transcribed from 1 µg of RNA using 2.5 µM random hexamer with 1 µl (200U) SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Scientific). The reaction mixture was incubated at 24°C for 10 min to allow primer annealing, followed by incubation at 50°C for 10 min for reverse transcription. Subsequently, the reaction was terminated by incubating at 80°C for 10 min to inactivate the reverse transcriptase. Finally, the cDNA products were subjected to real-time PCR with Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (QuantStudio 12K Flex system, Applied Biosystems) to determine the expression level of firefly luciferase relative to that of <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase.</p>

<title>Elastic model of polysome-shifting UTR variants</title>
<p>To develop a prediction model for determining whether a genetic variant affects mRNA translation, we employed a logistic regression model with elastic net regularization for feature selection. The curated features included free energy, structure rate, GC content, k-mer, G-quadruplex (RG4), conservation level, miRNA binding motif, PUM motif, RBP motif, and ARE. Before feature selection, the features were narrowed down using multiple logistic regression models to regress the significance of variants (Yes/No) on each feature, with a <italic>p-value</italic> &lt; 0.01 serving as the criterion for identifying potential candidates. Subsequently, the dataset was divided into two groups, comprising training and testing sets in a 2:1 ratio, respectively. The model is represented as follows:

<title>Meta-analysis of disease-relevant UTR variants</title>
<p>It has been estimated that ∼3.7% of disease-relevant genetic variants arise in UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">MacArthur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Steri et al., 2018</xref>). To investigate if there is a positional effect of disease-relevant UTR variants, we compared the overall distribution of disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ClinVar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Landrum et al., 2016</xref>) to over a million human UTR SNPs in the dbSNP archive, which revealed enrichment for disease-relevant variants near mRNA coding regions in both 5’ and 3’ UTRs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), indicating that the near-coding region of UTRs is a critical regulatory region for gene expression. Although we did not detect enrichment for disease-relevant 5’ UTR variants near the transcription start site, they did exist at uORF start sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). This specific localization of disease-relevant UTR variants evidences a trend in the positioning of functional elements within UTRs.</p>

<title>Massively parallel poly(ribo)some assays on human disease-relevant UTR mutations</title>
<p>Although many disease-associated UTR variants are located in functional elements, their pathogenic mechanisms remain unknown. To examine if these variants directly affect protein output, we first sought to determine the impact of these variants on translation. To systematically examine the altered translation efficiency by UTR variants, we implemented massively parallel polysome assays to examine the effects of variants on polysome association (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). First, we extracted 6,555 disease-associated UTR variants, including SNPs and indels shorter than 15 nucleotides (nt), from the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) and ClinVar, followed by multiplex oligonucleotide synthesis for selected UTRs. We prioritized UTR variants designated as pathogenic or likely pathogenic in the database. Consequently, all annotated pathogenic and likely pathogenic UTR variants reported by the time of data collection were included in the library. Additionally, due to the constraint of synthesis length (∼150 nt), we synthesized the segment of selected UTRs (∼115 nt) in which variants were located at the center to maximize the possibility of including critical regulatory elements. Moreover, UTR fragments of both alternative and reference alleles were synthesized in parallel for case-control comparison. In cases where multiple alternative alleles existed at the same position, they were paired with the same reference allele to prevent duplication in the library. The entire library of UTR oligonucleotides (UTR library) was then cloned into CMV promoter-driven enhanced GFP (EGFP) vectors, which were then transfected and expressed in HEK293T cells. The cells were treated with cycloheximide 14 hours post transfection and then subjected to polysome fractionation (see Methods). By matching the UV absorbance profile of fractions to rRNA abundance revealed by gel electrophoresis of RNA samples (total RNA extracted from polysome fractions), we were able to estimate the number of bound ribosomes in the collected fractions. RNA samples from fractions containing 1 ribosome, 2 – 5 ribosomes, and 6 or more ribosomes were pooled, respectively, and are referred to hereafter as the Mono, Light and Heavy groups.</p>

</fig>
<p>UTR library constituents were then reverse-transcribed and PCR-amplified from the three groups of RNA samples, before undergoing next-generation sequencing. To evaluate the effects of disease-associated variants on the distribution of corresponding transcripts across the Mono, Light and Heavy groups, we fit a negative binomial generalized linear model to read count for each UTR pair (wildtype/WT and mutant/mut) in three fraction groups while accounting for batch effects of the three experimental replicates (see Methods). The model primarily focused on discerning the distribution pattern of reads in three polysome fractions between UTR pairs, without considering differences in the expression levels of the UTR species. As a result, the analysis was unaffected by any perturbation of UTR sequence at the transcriptional level and did not account for changes in stoichiometry between UTRs and regulatory factors due to variations in expression levels. Consequently, we identified 483 high-confidence UTR pairs, comprising 396 pairs that did not alter translation (172 and 224 for 5’ UTRs and 3’ UTRs, respectively; collectively denoted by high-confidence nonsignificant or ‘HC-nonsig’ UTR variants), and 19 5’ UTR and 27 3’ UTR variants that significantly affected polysome distribution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, Supplemental Figs. S1, S2 and Table S2; collectively denoted by high-confidence significant or ‘HC-sig’ UTR variants).</p>
<p>Although a very small proportion of UTR variants are categorized as pathogenic, we observed that HC-sig variants are enriched with known pathogenic variants relative to the HC-nonsig variants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), suggesting a contribution of translation-altering UTR variants to pathogenicity. Notably, we found that these translation-altering UTR variants are particularly prevalent in neurological and developmental disorders (Supplemental Table S3).</p>
<p>Even with the high confidence dataset, we did not intend to immediately translate the altered polysome profile into an increase or decrease in translation efficiency, as the direction of the shift was not readily evident. Additionally, sedimentation in the sucrose gradient may have been partially affected by heavy particles other than ribosomes. Subsequently, individual reporters were used to examine the variants’ effect on translation.</p>

<title>Validating the translation defects of mutant UTRs by luciferase reporter assay</title>
<p>The variants significantly altering the polysome profile were then individually validated by means of high-sensitivity luciferase reporter assays (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). To that end, we synthesized short-form UTRs of the target variants and their corresponding wildtype alleles anew, before ligating them to the 5’ or 3’ end of the firefly luciferase coding sequence accordingly. To compare translation activity between wildtype and mutant UTRs, two reporter constructs of the same pair were transfected into independent wells of HEK293T cells, whereby their bioluminescence intensity was determined separately. Notably, to calibrate transfection efficiency across wells, the UTR reporter constructs were co-transfected with <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase vector, and the firefly bioluminescence signal intensity was normalized to that of <italic>Renilla</italic>. Moreover, to control for potential variations in transcriptional activity, the relative firefly luminescence (mut/WT) of each UTR pair was further normalized to their cognate relative RNA level (mut/WT) (see Method). Our results indicate that 11 of the 12 selected HC-sig variants displayed prominent effects on translation activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Additionally, most of the tested UTR variants only altered translation efficiency but not RNA level, except for RFAXP:c.-101T&gt;G (Supplemental Fig. S3). Furthermore, we observed that 5’ UTR variants had a greater impact on translation activity relative to 3’ UTR variants.</p>

</fig>
<p>After validating individually the variants identified in our polysome profiling assay, we proceeded to investigate their effects on translation within an endogenous genomic context, targeting a total of eight variants (five in 5’ UTRs and three in 3’ UTRs). We derived the respective full-length UTR sequences from HEK293T cells and introduced the variants into cognate UTR amplicons via site-directed mutagenesis. Next, the UTR fragments were cloned into firefly luciferase reporter plasmids, which were then used for luciferase assay. 15 hours post transfection, the translation efficiency of the full-length UTR constructs was determined and normalized as described above. Despite being embedded in a longer genomic context, 7 of the 8 selected variants still significantly altered the translation activity of the full-length UTR constructs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Moreover, we observed only minor variation in the mRNA levels of the luciferase reporter across the full-length UTR constructs, indicating that the observed phenotypes could not be attributed to discrepancies in transcriptional activity or RNA stability (Supplemental Fig. S4). Furthermore, UTR variant-elicited regulation was highly consistent between full-length and short-form UTRs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), though the fold-change (mut/WT) in translation activity observed for full-length UTRs was much lower than for short-form UTRs, potentially due to the existence of additional regulatory elements in genomic milieus, which hindered or mitigated the impact of variants. Thus, our luciferase reporter assays verify the robustness of our massively parallel polysome assay results. The disparity between full-length and short-form UTRs also highlights the strength and weakness of our strategy.</p>

<title>Polysome-shifting UTR variants promote motif gain/loss</title>
<p>We hypothesized that polysome-shifting UTR variants may result in the removal or gain of functional motifs that recruit <italic>trans</italic> factors responsible for regulating translation. Accordingly, we postulated that polysome-shifting variants would display distinct sequence properties. Therefore, first we investigated the nucleotide composition of polysome-shifting variants. We found that variations in C nucleotides (including gain and loss) in 5’ UTRs were relatively inert in terms of translational alteration, whereas that was not the case for C in 3’ UTRs (Supplemental Fig. S5A and Table S4). Subsequently, we investigated the RBP-binding motifs of polysome-shifting UTR variants. Our results show that GAAGAA and T-rich motifs are enriched in HC-sig 5’ UTRs, whereas G-rich and YTTC motifs are enriched in HC-sig 3’ UTRs (Supplemental Fig. S5B and Table S4, Y represents T or C). Furthermore, recognizing the intricate relationships between binding motifs and their corresponding RBPs, we conducted an additional analysis focusing on the RBPs themselves. This analysis suggested that TRA2B and members of the HNRNP family can bind HC-sig UTRs to regulate their translation (Supplemental Fig. S5C). Extending this analysis, we calculated if changes in RBP-binding motifs are associated with changes in polysome profiles, which revealed that changes of SRSF1/2-, PABPN1-(AGAAG motifs) and CELF2-(T-rich motifs) binding sites in 5’ UTRs frequently caused polysome shifting, so did mutations of binding sites for KHSRP (AGGG motifs) in 3’ UTRs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To further validate the RBP-binding motifs identified by our enrichment analysis, we examined the effect of selected motifs on reporter expression by inserting them into a segment of the <italic>MUTYH</italic> 5’ UTR or <italic>MEFV</italic> 3’ UTR that contains suitable cloning sites (see Methods) and then perturbing its effect by mutating it so that it retained the same length but rendered it non-RBP-binding according to the ATtRACT RBP motif database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Giudice et al., 2016</xref>). For 5’ UTR, GTTTTG and GAAGAAG motifs were selected for the test. Both selected motifs significantly increased the translation efficiency of luciferase reporters without affecting RNA expression level (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). For 3’ UTR CTTTTC and AGGGGGA motifs were selected for the test, yet neither of them significantly altered reporter expression. However, mutation of the AGGGGGA motif into AGCTGTA significantly reduced translation efficiency, indicative of a context-dependent effect of RBP-binding motifs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Additionally, to assess the impact of RBPs on translation regulation through the short repeat sequence, we conducted a knockdown of SRSF2 using shRNA. This RBP was chosen due to its cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Thul et al., 2017</xref>) and abundant expression in HEK293T cells compared to other candidate RBPs. The results revealed that depleting SRSF2 eliminated the translation enhancement mediated by GAAGAAG, while having no effect on a non-SRSF2-binding motif (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). While SRSF2 has not been directly implicated in translation regulation, some members of the SRSF family have been reported to function as translation regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sliskovic et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, a mutation in the <italic>NUMA1</italic> 5’ UTR that disrupted SRSF9 binding was previously demonstrated to decrease translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lim et al., 2021</xref>), providing further support for the involvement of SRSF family proteins in translation regulation. Together, these results support the existence of mutational hotspots on short repeated sequences for polysome-shifting UTR variants and a collaborative regulatory effect of binding motifs.</p>

To do so, we compared the folding energy change for variants in the HC-sig and HC-nonsig groups, which revealed that the 5’ UTR HC-sig variants significantly weakened the folding structures and tended to prompt greater structural change than HC-nonsig variants, which was not the case for 3’ UTR variants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Furthermore, the HC-sig WT exhibited robust folding energy, potentially underlying their susceptibility of folding perturbations. In the same vein, RNA secondary structure predictions showed notable structural changes caused by 5’ UTR single-nucleotide variations. As an example of the latter, we present the case of a 5’ UTR single nucleotide variation in C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>. These results suggest that structural alterations of 5’ UTRs by sequence variation could be a potential causal factor of the translation defects.</p>

<p>Since it has been shown previously that the usage of an uATG is affected by the surrounding UTR structure and can regulate translation of primary ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Guenther et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Xiang et al., 2023</xref>), we examined if the significant structural change elicited by HC-sig variants could be associated with the presence of uATG. Indeed, by contrasting UTR variants that did not alter uATG counts, we found that uATG-hosting UTRs were strongly associated with structural changes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Therefore, while changes in uATG may not be common explanatory factors for polysome-shifting mutations, our results indicate that structure-modifying UTR variants may control primary ORF translation partly by interfering with translation initiation from a uORF.</p>

<title>Modeling the polysome-shifting UTR variants</title>
<p>Recognizing that polysome-shifting variants encompass diverse classes, such as those disrupting RBP binding or secondary structure, we employed statistical learning to discern the contributions of sequence and structural features to polysome shifting. Over 3,000 features, including evolutionary conservation, folding energy, secondary structures, RBP motifs, and k-mers, were collected. Features deemed insignificant or with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) smaller than 0.5 by univariate logistic regression were filtered out (Methods). The remaining features were further refined using elastic regression. Twelve features were selected to elucidate polysome-shifting variants in the 5’ UTR, while eighteen were chosen for the 3’ UTR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> and Supplemental Table S5). Notably, GAA-repeat motifs of SRSF family binding sites again emerged as the most influential sequence feature for the 5’ UTR. Additionally, changes in ‘CAT’ and ‘AA’ sequences, along with the folding energy of the 5’ UTR, proved most effective in inducing polysome shifting. In contrast, for the 3’ UTR, the structural contribution was less pronounced. Mutations altering GA- and T-rich sequences were identified as the strongest features promoting polysome shifting, consistent with prior analyses of RBP binding motifs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Model accuracy was validated against a test dataset not included in the training, with both the 5’ UTR and 3’ UTR models achieving an AUROC exceeding 0.8, underscoring the model’s robustness (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Overall, our model supports the hypothesis that GA- and T-rich short repeat motifs serve as mutation hotspots for polysome-shifting mutations, while secondary structure exerts a greater influence on 5’ UTR translation regulation compared to the 3’ UTR.</p>

<title>The translation defect of a uORF-creating variant can be rescued by RNA editing</title>
<p>While uATG in the 5’ UTR was not identified by the model as a widespread feature explaining polysome shifting, we hypothesize that it may still be a crucial factor. Its significance, however, might not have been universally captured across our library. Genome-wide analysis clearly indicated an enrichment of uORF disruption in the pathogenic UTR mutations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Therefore, we aimed to dissect the regulatory mechanisms of uORFs underlying the effects of polysome-shifting variants and develop rescue strategies against pathogenic uORF mutations.</p>
<p>First, we examined whether the presence of uATG in general leads to lower translation in reporter assays. We observed that the presence of uATG in 5’ UTRs of firefly luciferase was correlated with lower protein outputs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, Supplemental Table S6). Furthermore, two of the validated UTRs—Ferritin light chain (FTL) and Interferon Regulatory Factor 6 (IRF6)—demonstrated extreme translation perturbations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In a study by Luscieti et al., an FTL variant (c.-161C&gt;T) was characterized as preventing 5’ UTR stem-loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Luscieti et al., 2013</xref>). As a consequence, the recruitment of suppressive iron regulatory proteins mediated by the 5’ UTR stem-loop is disrupted, leading to an increase in translation activity. An IRF6 variant (c. −4609 G&gt;A) was found previously to be associated with the developmental disorder Van der Woude syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">de Lima et al., 2009</xref>). The G&gt;A variant was predicted to generate an out-of-frame uORF, but no experimental evidence has been provided yet. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, the corresponding full-length mutant UTR displayed a dramatic 9-fold reduction in translation efficiency, strongly indicating that presence of the uORF represses primary ORF translation. To verify the role of uATG, we performed western blotting to measure protein levels directly and determine protein size. To do so, we generated a third reporter construct that harbored the uORF in-frame to the coding region by deleting one nucleotide (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). When probed with a luciferase-targeting antibody, the signal intensity for the out-of-frame mutant after normalization to the wildtype was only 0.089 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). This suggests that only a minute fraction of ribosomes may reinitiate at the canonical site or undergo leaky scanning at the uATG. Notably, the in-frame mutant, which represents a combination of the extended and the original forms, displayed a 0.24-fold signal intensity, indicating that uATG, despite lower initiation efficiency, markedly suppresses initiation at the canonical site. Compared to wildtype, we determined 0.6-fold translation efficiency, as measured by luciferase reporter assays, upon overexpression of the in-frame mutant (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>) and no significant change in mRNA level was observed (Supplemental Fig. S4). The discrepancy between protein abundance and luciferase intensity indicates that the extended form of the luciferase reporter may contribute to higher luminescence intensity. The severe defect in translation efficiency elicited by the uORF in IRF6 was validated, but we could not detect the small peptide in the out-of-frame constructs (data not shown). It remains unclear if micropeptides, if translated, play any role in pathogenesis. However, patients who have gained a uORF in the IRF6 5’ UTR phenocopy Van der Woude patients hosting loss-of-function IRF6 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">de Lima et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Lastly, we aimed to develop rescue strategies that may be useful for future therapeutic purposes. We selected site-directed RNA editing using adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzyme for this purpose to avoid genome editing and potential off-target effects. Upon binding of an antisense RNA to a target transcript, the ADAR enzyme catalyzes adenosine-to-inosine editing. Inosine is subsequently interpreted as guanosine during translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Merkle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Qu et al., 2019</xref>). To achieve high editing efficiency, we overexpressed the antisense RNA coding construct and ADAR2 protein (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). The transcribed antisense RNA encompasses a T&gt;C mismatch that signals the complementary nucleotide for editing. First, we assessed editing efficiency by means of Sanger sequencing (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). Only co-expression of antisense RNA and ADAR2 resulted in detectable editing, with an efficiency of ∼21%. Luciferase signal intensities were also validated (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>). Consistently, expression of the antisense RNA alone had a very limited effect, but co-introduction of ADAR2 significantly increased the protein expression to ∼50% the level of wildtype. Our promising results advocate the potential of clinical use of guided ADAR-RNA editing to reverse uORF-mediated translation suppression and thus alleviate the impact of the disease.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we applied massively parallel polysome assays to examine the effect of mutations in 5’ and 3’ UTRs in terms of RNA translatability (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Our results show that the effect we observed in our high-throughput profiling is reliable, though it could be diluted somewhat in a more complex genomic context (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). We have shown that T- and GAA-repeat motifs are sensitive to translation-altering mutations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), underscoring the involvement of both <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences and <italic>trans</italic>-acting RBPs in regulating RNA translatability. Additionally, we identified the secondary structure of 5’ UTRs as a critical factor controlling RNA translatability (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). We observed that alterations in folding energy, especially in uORF-hosting 5’ UTRs, can have detrimental effects, suggesting structure-mediated uORF translation. These findings were summarized by elastic net regression models and robustly explained the polysome-shifting UTR variants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Additionally, the creation of uORFs in 5’ UTRs through mutation adversely impacts primary ORF expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B&amp;C</xref>), consistent with our finding of pathogenic mutant hotspot at uORF translation start sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We also reveal that ADAR-mediated editing can be deployed to rescue primary ORF translation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E-G</xref>). Our study emphasizes the significant role of precise UTR translation regulation in gene expression and offers a molecular explanation for the impact of UTR mutations on pathogenicity. Below, we discuss some of the strengths and limitations of our study.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Massively parallel evaluation of translation efficiency</title>
<p>Translation efficiency is a key post-transcriptional regulation to control gene output. Efforts have been made to assess translation efficiency systematically in terms of gene structures and sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Leppek et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Niederer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Oikonomou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sample et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Savinov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Slutskin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wissink et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). One way to measure translation efficiency is according to protein output. For instance, in MPRA where reporter sequences are fixed and fused with test sequences, the expression of the reporter fluorescent proteins is determined by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), with expression being normalized to the level of the other fluorescent reporter from the same construct to account for experimental bias. The tested sequences within each bin are then determined by sequencing. Mass spectrometry can be employed to determine quantitatively endogenous protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baek et al., 2008</xref>). Although this method is relatively quantitative, MPRA has the leverage over RNA stability, especially if the reporter is fused with various UTRs. Moreover, the results for endogenous proteins are influenced by protein turnover, which itself is a very important means of controlling gene expression. Thus, although protein output is a crucial readout of gene expression, this approach does not provide a direct measurement of translation efficiency.</p>
<p>The alternative method to measure translation is through polysome profiling. For endogenous genes, ribosome footprinting can be employed to quantify transcript fragments associated with ribosomes. For MPRA, in which the coding footprint is identical for the whole library, polysome profiling is used instead. Rather than sequencing and then counting transcript fragments attached to ribosomes, polysome profiling does not shear off the transcript, but only fractionates RNAs according to the number (size) of associated ribosomes through ultracentrifugation in a sucrose gradient, representing the most direct way to measure the efficiency of RNAs to recruit ribosomes. However, there are some limitations to this method. First, there is considerable variation in how polysome fractions are used. Some studies have used the average number of ribosomes on each reporter, with each fraction (including the ‘ribosome-free’ fraction) being considered and the average ribosome number being calculated according to the relative distribution of the transcript in polysomes. In contrast, others use only some of the fractions to infer translation efficiency. For example, percentage translated RNAs in polysomes can be used to infer ribosome loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Schuster et al., 2023</xref>), and the monosome to input ratio (recruitment score) can be calculated to infer ribosome recruitment efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Niederer et al., 2022</xref>). These alternative approaches to analyzing the data create perplexity to interpret polysome profiles. Another major limitation of polysome profiling is its dependency on promoters. It has been reported that whether polysome profiles reflect translation efficiency is contingent on the promoters driving gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kong et al., 2008</xref>). It remains unclear if the strong expression promoters (such as the CMV promoter) commonly used for MPRA are optimal for revealing differences in polysome profiles. Moreover, because not all ribosomes translate actively on transcripts, they can be slowed, stalled, or collided on a transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Meydan &amp; Guydosh, 2021</xref>). Although it has been proposed that the major bottleneck of the translation reaction is translation initiation, elongation also contributes to translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Riba et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, whether the number of ribosomes associated with a transcript truly reflects translation efficiency, especially for endogenous transcripts in diverse coding contexts, remains elusive.</p>

<title>Severe translation defects caused by 5’ UTR point mutations</title>
<p>The 5’ UTR serves as the major ribosome entry site for translation. In our data, we observed remarkable changes in translation efficiency elicited by 5’ UTR point mutations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), with IRF6:c.-4609G&gt;A and FTL:c.-161C&gt;T protein outputs being reduced 10-30-fold without affecting respective RNA levels (Supplemental Figs. S3, S4). The impacts of 3’ UTR mutations appear to be more additive and context-dependent, consistent with its nature of greater length variation. The most severe UTR mutation we identified in our MPRA dataset is IRF6:c.-4609G&gt;A, which has been observed in Van der Woude syndrome patients. This 5’ UTR mutation has been suggested to suppress IRF6 translation by generating a uORF. We have demonstrated herein that IRF6:c.-4609G&gt;A creates a strong upstream translation start codon, dramatically reducing protein output from the primary ORF (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B&amp;C</xref>). We reasoned that a G&gt;A mutation represented an optimal target for ADAR editing, allowing us to switch A back to I, which is read as G by the cellular machinery (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E-G</xref>). Another advantage of ADAR is that editing operates at the RNA level within the potential treatment window, thereby restoring desired protein function without causing any permanent alterations to the DNA.</p>
<p>Ferritin is composed of L (FTL) and H (FTH) subunits, and it is responsible for regulating the storage and intracellular distribution of iron. FTL:c.-161C, one of the UTR variants we observed as eliciting strongly perturbed translation, has been mapped as part of a noncanonical upstream start codon (CAG, TISdb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wan &amp; Qian, 2014</xref>). It is likely that the C&gt;T mutation disrupts uORF initiation, thereby releasing repression of the primary ORF, and promoting the ∼10-fold increase in translation. However, the 5’ UTR of FTL is also responsible for forming an IRE stem-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Klausner et al., 1993</xref>). The FTL:c.-161C&gt;T mutation likely disrupts this hexanucleotide loop structure, preventing it from interacting with the Iron Regulatory Proteins IRP1 and IRP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Luscieti et al., 2013</xref>). Since IRPs bind to IREs under iron-deficient conditions to suppress translation of both ferritin subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Muckenthaler et al., 1998</xref>), mutations that abolish IRP-IRE interactions elicit aberrant production of ferritins and are the major causative mutations of Hereditary Hyperferritinaemia Cataract Syndrome. Thus, our massively parallel polysome profiling has uncovered known and novel mutations that cause translation defects, serving as a genetic diagnostic tool for identifying crucial and clinically relevant regulatory mutations.</p>

<p>The authors describe a massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) screen focused on identifying polymorphisms in 5' and 3' UTRs that affect translation efficiency and thus might have a functional impact on cells. The topic is of timely interest, and indeed, several related efforts have recently been published and preprinted (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37516102/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37516102/</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10635273/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10635273/</ext-link>). This study has several major issues with the results and their presentation.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) The main issue is that it appears that the screen has largely failed, yet the reasons for that are unclear, which makes it difficult to interpret. The authors start with a library that includes approximately 6,000 variants, which makes it a medium-sized MPRA. But then, only 483 pairs of WT/mutated UTRs yield high-confidence information, which is already a small number for any downstream statistical analysis, particularly since most don't actually affect translation in the reporter screen setting (which is not unexpected). It is unclear why &gt;90% of the library did not give high-confidence information. The profiles presented as base-case examples in Figure 2B don't look very informative or convincing. All the subsequent analysis is done on a very small set of UTRs that have an effect, and it is unclear to this reviewer how these can yield statistically significant and/or biologically relevant associations.</p>
<p>(2) From the variants that had an effect, the authors go on to carry out some protein-level validations and see some changes, but it is not clear if those changes are in the same direction as observed in the screen.</p>
<p>(3) The authors follow up on specific motifs and specific RBPs predicted to bind them, but it is unclear how many of the hits in the screen actually have these motifs, or how significant motifs can arise from such a small sample size.</p>
<p>(4) It is particularly puzzling how the authors can build a machine learning predictor with &gt;3,000 features when the dataset they use for training the model has just a few dozens of translation-shifting variants.</p>
<p>(5) The lack of meaningful validation experiments altering the SNPs in the endogenous loci by genome editing limits the impact of the results.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their paper &quot;Massively Parallel Polyribosome Profiling Reveals Translation Defects of Human Disease‐Relevant UTR Mutations&quot; the authors use massively parallel polysome profiling to determine the effects of 5' and 3' UTR SNPs (from dbSNP/ClinVar) on translational output. They show that some UTR SNPs cause a change in the polysome profile with respect to the wild-type and that pathogenic SNPs are enriched in the polysome-shifting group. They validate that some changes in polysome profiles are predictive of differences in translational output using transiently expressed luciferase reporters. Additionally, they identify sequence motifs enriched in the polysome-shifting group. They show that 2 enriched 5' UTR motifs increase the translation of a luciferase reporter in a protein-dependent manner, highlighting the use of their method to identify translational control elements.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a useful method and approach, as UTR variants have been more difficult to study than coding variants. Additionally, their evidence that pathogenic mutations are more likely to cause changes in polysome association is well supported.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors acknowledge that they &quot;did not intend to immediately translate the altered polysome profile into an increase or decrease in translation efficiency, as the direction of the shift was not readily evident. Additionally, sedimentation in the sucrose gradient may have been partially affected by heavy particles other than ribosomes.&quot; However, shifted polysome distribution is used as a category for many downstream analyses. Without further clarity or subdivision, it is very difficult to interpret the results (for example in Figure 5A, is it surprising that the polysome shifting mutants decrease structure? Are the polysome &quot;shifts&quot; towards the untranslated or heavy fractions?)</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors describe a massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) screen focused on identifying polymorphisms in 5' and 3' UTRs that affect translation efficiency and thus might have a functional impact on cells. The topic is of timely interest, and indeed, several related efforts have recently been published and preprinted (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37516102/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37516102/</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10635273/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10635273/</ext-link>). This study has several major issues with the results and their presentation.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) The main issue is that it appears that the screen has largely failed, yet the reasons for that are unclear, which makes it difficult to interpret. The authors start with a library that includes approximately 6,000 variants, which makes it a medium-sized MPRA. But then, only 483 pairs of WT/mutated UTRs yield high-confidence information, which is already a small number for any downstream statistical analysis, particularly since most don't actually affect translation in the reporter screen setting (which is not unexpected). It is unclear why &gt;90% of the library did not give highconfidence information. The profiles presented as base-case examples in Figure 2B don't look very informative or convincing. All the subsequent analysis is done on a very small set of UTRs that have an effect, and it is unclear to this reviewer how these can yield statistically significant and/or biologically relevant associations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To make sure our final results are technically and statistically sound, we applied stringent selection criteria and cutoffs in our analytics workflow. First, from our RNA-seq dataset, we filtered the UTRs with at least 20 reads in a polysome profile across all three repeated experiments. Secondly, in the following main analysis using a negative binomial generalized linear model (GLM), we further excluded the UTRs that displayed batch effect, i.e. their batch-related main effect and interaction are significant. We believe our measure has safeguarded the filtered observations (UTRs) from the (potential) high variation of our massively parallel translation assays and thus gives high confidence to our results.</p>
<p>Regarding the interpretation of Figure 2B, since we aimed to identify the UTRs whose interaction term of genotype and fractions is significant in our generalized linear model, it is statistically conventional to double-check the interaction of the two variables using such a graph. For instance, in the top left panel of Figure 2B (5'UTR of ANK2:c.-39G&gt;T), we can see that read counts of WT samples congruously decreased from Mono to Light, whereas the read counts of mutant samples were roughly the same in the two fractions – the trend is different between WT and mutant. Ergo, the distinct distribution patterns of two genotypes across three fractions in Figure 2B offer the readers a convincing visual supplement to our statistics from GLM.</p>
<p>In contrast to Figure 2B, the graphs of nonsignificant UTRs (shown below) reveal that the trends between the two genotypes are similar across the 'Mono and Light' and 'Light and Heavy' polysome fractions. Importantly, our analysis remains unaffected by differential expression levels between WT and mutant, as it specifically distinguishes polysome profiles with different distributions. This consistent trend further supports the lack of interaction between genotype and polysome fractions for these UTRs.</p>

<p>(2) From the variants that had an effect, the authors go on to carry out some protein-level validations and see some changes, but it is not clear if those changes are in the same direction as observed in the screen.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To infer the directionality of translation efficiency from polysome profiles, a common approach involves pooling polysome fractions and comparing them with free or monosome fractions to identify 'translating' fractions. However, this method has two major potential pitfalls: (i) it sacrifices resolution and does not account for potential bias toward light or heavy polysomes, and (ii) it fails to account for discrepancies between polysome load and actual protein output (as discussed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114098">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114098</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-47424-w">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-47424-w</ext-link>). Therefore, our analysis focused on the changes within polysome profiles themselves. 'Significant' candidates were identified based on a significant interaction between genotype and polysome distribution using a negative binomial generalized linear model, without presupposing the direction of change on protein output.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors follow up on specific motifs and specific RBPs predicted to bind them, but it is unclear how many of the hits in the screen actually have these motifs, or how significant motifs can arise from such a small sample size.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We calculated the Δmotif enrichment in significant UTRs versus nonsignificant UTRs using Fisher’s exact test. For example, the enrichment of the Δ‘AGGG’ motif in 3’ UTRs is shown below:</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>This test yields a P-value of 0.004167 by Fisher’s exact test. The P-values and Odds ratios of Δmotifs in relation to polysome shifting are included in Supplementary Table S4, and we will update the detailed motif information in the revised Supplementary Table S4.</p>

<p>(4) It is particularly puzzling how the authors can build a machine learning predictor with &gt;3,000 features when the dataset they use for training the model has just a few dozens of translation-shifting variants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the concern regarding the relatively small number of translation-shifting variants compared to the large number of features. To address this, we employed LASSO regression, which, according to The Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman, is particularly suitable for datasets where the number of features 𝑝𝑝 is much larger than the number of samples 𝑁𝑁. LASSO effectively performs feature selection by shrinking less important coefficients to zero, allowing us to build a robust and generalizable model despite the limited number of variants.</p>

<p>(5) The lack of meaningful validation experiments altering the SNPs in the endogenous loci by genome editing limits the impact of the results.</p>

<p>We plan to assess the endogenous effect by generating CRISPR knock-in clones carrying the UTR variant.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their paper &quot;Massively Parallel Polyribosome Profiling Reveals Translation Defects of Human Disease‐Relevant UTR Mutations&quot; the authors use massively parallel polysome profiling to determine the effects of 5' and 3' UTR SNPs (from dbSNP/ClinVar) on translational output. They show that some UTR SNPs cause a change in the polysome profile with respect to the wild-type and that pathogenic SNPs are enriched in the polysome-shifting group. They validate that some changes in polysome profiles are predictive of differences in translational output using transiently expressed luciferase reporters. Additionally, they identify sequence motifs enriched in the polysome-shifting group. They show that 2 enriched 5' UTR motifs increase the translation of a luciferase reporter in a proteindependent manner, highlighting the use of their method to identify translational control elements.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a useful method and approach, as UTR variants have been more difficult to study than coding variants. Additionally, their evidence that pathogenic mutations are more likely to cause changes in polysome association is well supported.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors acknowledge that they &quot;did not intend to immediately translate the altered polysome profile into an increase or decrease in translation efficiency, as the direction of the shift was not readily evident. Additionally, sedimentation in the sucrose gradient may have been partially affected by heavy particles other than ribosomes.&quot; However, shifted polysome distribution is used as a category for many downstream analyses. Without further clarity or subdivision, it is very difficult to interpret the results (for example in Figure 5A, is it surprising that the polysome shifting mutants decrease structure? Are the polysome &quot;shifts&quot; towards the untranslated or heavy fractions?)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our approach, combining polysome fractionation of the UTR library with negative binomial generalized linear model (GLM) analysis of RNA-seq data, systematically identifies variants that affect translational efficiency. The GLM model is specifically designed to detect UTR pairs with significant interactions between genotype and polysome fractions, relying solely on changes in polysome profiles to identify variants that disrupt translation. Consequently, our analytical method does not determine the direction of translation alteration.</p>
<p>Following the massively parallel polysome profiling, we sought to understand how these polysomeshifting variants influence the translation process. To do this, we examined their effects on RNA characteristics related to translation, such as RBP binding and RNA structure. In Figure 5A, we observed a notable trend in significant hits within 5’ UTRs—they tend to increase ΔG (weaker folding energy) in response to changes in polysome profiles, regardless of whether protein production increases or decreases (Fig. 3).</p>
